Transcript:  It's time for MacBreak Weekly. Alex, Andy and Jason Snell are all here.  Lots to talk about. Yes, believe it or not.  The new versions of all the Apple operating systems are out now.  The final betas before the next releases.  There's also a big security update everybody should get.  A zero-click flaw in messages has been patched.  We'll talk about the rumors including a new iMac with a bigger than 30-inch display.  The Vision OS SDK is out. Some of the new features in the Vision Pro headset.  And Apple loses in the Supreme Court. It's all coming up next on MacBreak Weekly.  This is MacBreak Weekly, episode 876, recorded Tuesday, June 27, 2023.  Mediocre Tuesday.

Transcript:  It gave us a chance to get James Thompson on. It was great to have him on, catch up with him.  And talk about as a developer what he sees coming down the pipe with iOS 17 and Mac OS Sonoma.  Also with us, Mr. Andy Anacko, WG.  BH Boston. Hello, Andrew.  Hey there, Heather. Who there?  That's all we have to say.  No questions.  It's humid. It's a humid Tuesday here in New England.  I heard that it's pretty warm out there. Yes.

Transcript:  I was a little embarrassed last week. I was in Boston. We were doing a GBA in the studio.  I had a nice shirt on and a tie and a little thing thrown over that, but then it was hot.  So I took those off. Then I realized that I was wearing black sneakers, black pants, a black t-shirt.  I'm like, oh dear, Reverend Andy is enjoying the summer in Boston, isn't he?  On the radio. No one knows you're a priest. It's good.  I try not to let that happen.

Transcript:  Ninja. I would say ninja Andy instead.  And also with us, Alex Lindsay. We had a good dose of Alice on Sunday on Twitter.  If you haven't heard it, he was fantastic.  Great to have you back in your regular seat.  Yeah, it was a good show. Really enjoyed it.  It was also almost a record holder, three hours.  We had Jason Delrayon who wrote a book, really interesting book called Winter Sells All,  about Amazon versus Walmart.  A lot of really interesting stuff about Walmart, among other things.  Anyway, fun conversation. If you didn't get it here, tweet 933.  Tune in for more Alex. But Alex is here today to talk Apple, as we all are.  Just as we went to press.  I say that for you, Jason, since you're the old print guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's straight out of front page here.  Apple seeds, fourth beta of Mac OS Ventura 13.5, fourth betas of 16.6 iOS, 16.6 iPad OS, TV OS updated.  I have an Apple TV in my office I don't use very much so I turned it on and it was acting kind of funky.  It was still on version 14 so I updated it all the way to 16, which took the rest of the day.  You can update again if you are on the beta. And I did turn on the beta.  Beta on TV OS seems a fairly minor thing.  Watch OS, fourth beta of 9.6.  All of this sounds like new versions are coming imminently, right?  How many betas do they do of a version? Four seems like the limit.

Start time: 323.98
End time: 335.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a clean up, right? This is probably the last clean up of the existing OS versions before they, you know,  put them off on the ice flow. But yeah, it seems like it's close now.

Start time: 337.33
End time: 351.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's kind of pathetic.  There goes Ventura floating away on the ice flow. Yeah, because Sonoma is coming.  Yeah, that's right.  We are, I think, the number one Apple podcast in Sonoma County.  So...  I hope so.

Start time: 372.08
End time: 395.14
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, I imagine it's either things that they, yeah, they have to flip a switch or make some very slight adjustments  or bring things to a gentle resting place. Not that they won't update them further,  but those updates are going to increasingly be about like emergency bug fixes and security updates  because they're pretty much parked, right? Like everybody at Apple has really been working on the new OS versions for six months now  and now they're in crunch time.

Transcript:  The other thing that happened since I left to go to Disneyland and VidCon, what a combo.  You know, VidCon was actually, had more characters, more people in costume than Disneyland did, which is saying something.  Although I should have taken a picture of it. They have a big poster right outside of VidCon,  which is the convention for video creators, TikTok, whose YouTubers think that.  They have a big cosplay rules thing. You can't bring a stick. You can't hide your face.  There are all these cosplay rules. I don't know if that's normal now at Comic-Con and stuff.  Pretty much.  Is it? It's for safety, right?

Start time: 433.34
End time: 472.18
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  The anime cosplayers often have these like, I'm not joking, like six foot long like swords that they carry over their shoulders  and after two hours they're not really paying attention to what happens when they turn.  And so they had to be, there's all kinds of rules on length of weapons, length of props, also fake, anything that could be mistaken for an actual weapon or used as an actual weapon.  You have some people who are like, who are smart enough to say, hey, I just, I got this beautiful like antique sword that looks, makes my pirate costume look great.  Yeah, you're bringing like a three foot long edged weapon into a public space. Maybe that's not a good thing.  Yeah, I would.  It'll be here with your coat when you come back out.

Start time: 472.36
End time: 530.45
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't mind. There were still plenty of people in costume.  It turns out though, I didn't, VidCon, which was at the Anaheim Convention Center, we were there because Lisa was on a panel, which was great.  She did a great job. But it turns out that wasn't the place to be at VidCon.  The Hyatt Hotel, which was several blocks away, was where all the creators, they didn't even bother going to the show.  All the creators are hanging out at the hotel.  The CEO of TikTok came, but he didn't come to the convention.  He went to the Hyatt and hung out at the hospitality suite there.  It's all about the collabs, baby, the collabs.  I felt so old and out of, I mean, I was an influencer back when influencers were made out of wood and stone.  To see, I mean, it's really interesting.  And what's interesting is how niche it is now, which is good.  I mean, we're niche, obviously.

Start time: 532.64
End time: 545.86
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  What's also interesting is that some of them might be, they're only 28 years old or 30 years old, but they've been doing it almost as long as we have.  A lot of them, they started when they were eight or 10 or 12.  They started very early.

Start time: 546.20
End time: 574.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The big guys, Mr. Beast didn't go.  The big Marquez Brownlink didn't go because this was a scheduling error.  Who would have thought?  Canlion, which is in France, is the big upfront for streaming video.  All of these big shots were, including Emma Chamberlain, were in France because it conflicted with VidCon.  What a dumb idea to have VidCon the same week as.  But I guess, I'm betting nobody at VidCon scheduling this two years ago thought, Canlion, why would anybody?

Start time: 575.84
End time: 582.05
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think there was actually another VidCon at the same time as VidCon.  There was like another VidCon in Baltimore or something or near it.  It's gotten too big.

Start time: 583.47
End time: 607.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gotten too big.  Anyway, I really, I quite enjoyed both that and Disneyland, but that's not what we're here to talk about.  One of the things that happened, I was starting to say and didn't finish to sense while I was gone, is the Vision Pro SDK, the software development kit came out,  which means we learned some things, right?  The Vision OS SDK.

Start time: 608.90
End time: 658.16
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  A lot of people now, now that people have the ability to actually run Vision OS inside the simulator,  they're learning things like, oh, wow, there's actually spotlight search in here.  And wow, here's what the keyboard actually like works and looks like.  And we're finding out a whole bunch of other tidbits, like a couple of separate stories about how like, OK,  so now that the Vision Pro will stop working if you are in motion to a certain degree to prevent people from using it while driving or operating a vehicle,  there's a safety zone of something like 10 feet.  When you're in a fully immersive environment, you're inside a box that's about 10 feet across,  again, to prevent you from, I don't know, wandering out on a window or something like that.  Lots of little details that we haven't been figuring out before.

Start time: 658.38
End time: 681.71
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But there is a traveling switch that you can flip, says I'm on an airplane and I'm watching a movie.  So they clear, you know, we learn a lot about what I think some people, Alex, correct me if I'm wrong,  but I got the sense from some people's social media posts that people who spend a lot of time working with ARKit were a little disappointed to see that a lot of the work that they had done would not be able,  would not be applicable to Vision Pro.  Did I get that right?  Well, yes and no.

Start time: 683.72
End time: 737.16
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So what I would say by that is that all the work that you do in these areas, yeah, it may not, ARKit may not line up as far as the code goes,  but understanding how things work, understanding things you have to think about.  But that's, from a coding perspective, that's, in my opinion, a lot more important is the understanding of how to interact with things.  Writing the code is going to be a little bit more work,  but I think that you also don't want them to be trying to figure out how to be backward compatible with something they thought was going to work three years ago.  Exactly.  So I think, but I think that what I've learned over, you know, doing a lot of immersive work over the last, I mean, 25 years is that doing a lot of it means that you understand what you should do next.  And the coding stuff for us, you know, the shooting the footage or building the footage, you can start thinking in that terms.  And that has been far more useful than learning any individual tool or process.

Transcript:  Did you get to play with Reality Composer Pro, which was also released with the SDK?

Start time: 742.44
End time: 795.59
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You know, I haven't played with it yet.  I have watched a lot of videos on it and we're going to be doing some stuff in office hours with it.  I figured, yeah.  We're going to have some labs where we really dig into it.  It's really powerful.  Like and watching the videos has me really excited about it.  Probably the best.  I think I mentioned it before.  Probably the best nodal nodal system that I've ever seen.  Just no kidding.  You're pretty like just it is like a lot of these are that we use are fairly functional, but no one really thinks about how only Apple would like worry about exactly how the little nodes are connected and exactly, you know, how everything gets fit together.  So on that, I'm sure that's just as functional as Unreal Engine or or any of the other ones.  It's functional, but it just looks it looks nice.  As someone who used to have to design those nodes, I immediately opened it up and I was like, oh, I wish I thought of that.  That looks really nice.

Start time: 796.62
End time: 803.58
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the idea is you can import your 3D stuff.  Yeah, you can set up a lot of functions code, right?

Start time: 804.42
End time: 842.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, you can set up a lot of functions that you're going to hand back to Xcode.  Basically, in reality composer, you're able to build your scenes.  That would be really arduous to do with your code.  And so you can build out the scenes and things that need to be triggered.  But those can all be kind of put together and visualized and, you know, and kind of worked out inside of this this environment.  And it's got, you know, adding surfaces and particle systems and lighting and working with the models and placing them in place.  You know, and all of that can be set up inside of this environment.  And it's again, it's what's missing in a lot of the other immersive environments was really good tools to kind of put that together that aren't just Unreal and Unity.

Start time: 843.44
End time: 853.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And it'll import USDZ and other assets and and then work you working with Xcode to make it a program with these assets.

Start time: 853.64
End time: 859.36
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Right. So it's got all the hooks in there.  So you're basically building something that has hooks available that you're going to be able to call from Xcode.  Yeah.

Start time: 861.66
End time: 863.35
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, so we got our first look at that.

Start time: 865.62
End time: 898.84
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It's got but the weird thing is going to be that people all these developers are going to be writing really cool apps that will work for this simulator.  But they it's going to be at least a year before they figure out is this going to have they placed objects too close to the viewport or too far away from the viewport.  How comfortable is this app going to be to use for more than 10 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour, two hours.  And that's still it's still one of the big unanswered questions of the Vision Pro is how long is anybody going to be able to use this given the given the limits of VR as they've implemented them?

Start time: 899.38
End time: 928.71
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, some of the developers will get units right.  Like everything we're hearing is that next month they're going to have these developer kitchens basically in six major cities where people can come who are developers and use it.  And then they've said they've been up front and saying that they're going to open the ability to get a developer unit and you're going to have to apply and you're going to have to it's obviously going to be limited.  In fact, I think the phrase they use is your team, which implies that like maybe James Thompson need not apply.  I don't know.

Start time: 930.83
End time: 932.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's a solo developer.

Start time: 933.28
End time: 985.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  What I've heard is that the hardware is pretty final and that the reason that it's not shipping is twofold.  One, they can't make enough of them.  And two, the software is not all there yet.  But if the hardware is pretty final, then the developer kits will probably be pretty real.  And so developers may in fact be the first people outside of Apple to have a realization about how long can they go using this thing.  Now, that's not the whole wide world and the developer pool, you know, is not as diverse as the whole wide world, even the whole wide world of purchasers of this product.  But I feel like we're going to start getting a sense that if they're in the eight, it'll be through the grapevine.  But I think we'll start getting a sense later this year from developers and other people who've used it, who are actually able to sit there for two, three, four or five hours and say either it's fine or it's terrible.  And one of the better ideas.

Start time: 985.80
End time: 1003.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I did hear some complaint from the open source community that Apple's tools, SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit, Reality Composer Pro are all proprietary.  And there exist analogs in the open source world.  I'm sure Alex, you have a rebuttal to that.

Start time: 1004.03
End time: 1070.34
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I don't think Apple cares.  And nor do I, right?  They give these away for free, right?  I mean, the bottom line is, is that that, you know, trying to like in open source, now you have the GNU license that is a huge problem if you start building the apps that you want to sell.  And so having, you know, incorporating like everything that I every large company that I work for, I have to sign a contract that says I will not use any open source software like it is literally like in every contract, you will, you'll do all this other stuff and you will not use any open source software in any part of the development of doing this because  of the way the licensing works.  And so they don't want to have any, most for-profit companies don't want to have any part of using, you know, anything with an open source license.  And so, sure, but that, you know, and Apple is going to build something that's going to work on their platform and they're not worried about other, they're not really worried about interoperability except for Unity.  You know, and that allows them to innovate and move as fast as they want to move.  This is a brand new thing.  Why would they tie themselves into the past?  I don't see any upside for them.  Yeah.

Start time: 1071.20
End time: 1073.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just want to give you a chance to say that.  Yeah.

Start time: 1077.63
End time: 1087.51
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  At least there's, there was some report I think put in the show notes that it's going to support like 3D web technology.  So at least WebXR.  What is WebXR?  Is that, is that a Pixar standard?

Start time: 1093.26
End time: 1107.20
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  No, it's what's interesting is, and what you can always see from a company when they, when they do this is that they are, they, a company wants to control everything that makes them different and commoditize anything that is just a cost of production.

Start time: 1107.38
End time: 1118.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so WebXR is something under, if you have your highlighter with you, underline that sentence that you just said, because that is really a fundamental concept in all of this.  Say it again, Alex.

Start time: 1119.48
End time: 1223.20
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So, so any company, all the companies, they want to control the things that make them different.  So they want absolute control over those and they want to commoditize anything that increases their cost of production or makes it harder that they're not going to do.  And so you can tell when a company wants things to be open source, when Apple wants to make things open source, that's something they want to commoditize.  They want to let somebody else do the work.  And because it's not a differentiator.  It doesn't, it doesn't help the platform.  And it also, yeah, it's not going to be something that they care about in the future.  So like HLS, they made, they made, they created HLS and they made it widely available because they need to be able to stream to those things and they want everybody to use it.  And so we'll make it free and make it easy for everybody to use.  And when I say open source, I mean, they may open source it or they may make it just free, but they're going to, you know, they don't want a lot.  What Apple didn't want is a lot of other formats streaming out because then they have to support them.  And so by having one that is really good.  And now, even now, we have to think about it, you know, HLS and Dash and so on and so forth.  And so, so anyway, the, you know, so you'll see, you know, the, you know, the Web AR, Web XR, I think it's most of the things.  Yeah, Web XR tools are part of that.  Also, they're not like Apple is.  They're streaming.  They're doing the streaming is the MVHEVC.  So that is a, but that's a standard and that standard has been around since I think 2015, although not a lot of people have used it because just as that standard came out, 3D kind of fell.  The bottom fell out of 3D at the time.  3D just keeps on coming up.  Like every couple of years we go, oh, like right now there's this huge rush.  All of us are trying to find 3D rigs, you know, those camera rigs that we were using for all those 3D films.  Suddenly everyone's trying to like, who's got the rigs?  Like there's warehouses of people that have fortunately kept a couple of rigs that were all.

Start time: 1223.40
End time: 1229.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we were talking about that.  You have that.  What is it?  Oh, there's a there's a sign.

Start time: 1229.24

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I have a $60,000 Oso right there.  I don't even know if it'll work though.  It's like I don't like I haven't turned it on for a long time.  But the and it's but there's these big rigs that they use for film that were like $60,000 rigs.  And now they're like 10,000.  And then there's the Canon.  I think they I don't know if they must have known something was going to happen.  But they have the the R5C with a dual lens on it.  And it can't stream.  But a bunch of us like I was kind of surprised that Canon when they came out, I was like, why are they releasing that camera?  Now it makes more sense because that's going to be a great acquisition tool for you know, for the for the headset.  So the so anyway, so there's a couple you know, a lot of us are trying to figure those things out.  But the MV HVAC format is basically give me a hero eye.  So this is what you'll say.  I'm going to say my left eye is my hero eye and then give me the second eye is going to be compressed into the hero eye.  So that means that it saves space.  You're not sending two whole frames to somebody for stereo.  It only does the delta for the right eye if the left eye is hero.  But if you only have 2D, if you're watching on your phone, you just see the left eye.  You know, and so those are the kind of things that but that makes it more efficient in that process.  And so that's that's the kind of thing.  That's a standard.  That's MPEG.  You know, like it's not it's not something that Apple's making up.  And you can tell that Apple doesn't want to make up things that it wants everybody using so that it's easier for it to do.  But it does want to control its code on how you build it out.

Transcript:  And if they if they're supporting this in the Web, that means that like if in five years from now, as Alex keeps saying, Alex keeps saying the ability to like see what this Ikea bookcase looks like in your house, it becomes a thing.  It would be very, very much improved if you could do it through the Web rather than, oh, by the way, oh, yes, we can want to see what this looks like in your living room.  Download and install this app, which will only take X amount of time.  I mean, if this does become a world standard, it's a very cheap way for Apple to make this to take the advantages of a world that uses 3D in the Web without actually having to commit to like dumbing itself down to Meta's idea of 3D.

Start time: 1357.68
End time: 1417.16
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. And the and the.  But by the way, like with Amazon, if you if you go through Amazon on your phone and you look at furniture, because I'm replacing something underneath my TV right now, whatever the thing is, it will say, hey, do you want to see this in your in your scene?  All you got to do is click on the little button and move your camera back and forth a little bit and boom, it pops right into your living room.  So that stuff is already and a lot of people have been built.  Amazon had a whole team in in building that for quite some time.  So anyway, so the so that's been in the works for a couple of years and it's it's already available on the phone.  Obviously, it'll be more useful in the in the headset.  But it also means that if you go to any web page supporting the web, the Web VR or AR or XR, those web pages, when you open them on a web page inside of your your Apple, you can just click on it and rotate it around and you'll see it in 3D.  So it's it'll be it's going to be pretty that makes it as Andy said, it's it makes it much easier for a lot of folks that don't believe in what Apple's doing to publish something that just happens to work on the headset.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, especially for the first ones that are out there.  You know, we don't know how well the work, but the but you have a bunch of people that spent at some point will have spent thirty five hundred dollars and spending another five on an app or ten dollars on an app to see how it works, especially when a large number of developers.  They're just trying to figure out what it works, how it works and what it does.  They're probably going to spend, you know, so if you're one of those first apps that's being recommended, if you're one of the first apps that gets a little press, if it looks if it gets a little push, you know, it's not like you're going to make 10 bucks.  It's going to be millions.  You know, like, you know, it's and I've talked to other developers that have done this in the past where they launch things right out of the gate.  And, you know, they have a quarter million dollar week.  Now, let me not see anything.  But it's like a bunch of money came in.  So so I think you're going to see a lot of that.  A lot of people trying to be in that first tranche and that first tranche will probably last about a year.  I bought a ton of stuff with other people when I got that question.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, he got it up and running as the iPad app and then got it up and running in the simulator as a native app.  So I would say that the primary thing driving most of what I've seen is not like I want to be seen or I want I mean, it's a gold rush to just be noticed much more often than not.  I mean, it's not like you're going to be seen once before the product ships, right?  It's not there's not a lot of value there.  But a lot of these people are like, oh, my app does X.  Can that be a vision pro app and like exploring and they're doing it in public, which I think is a lot of fun.  But like Steve Trout and Smith, who does streaming audio app called broadcast, like he showed me a video.  It was on Macedon where he's like he's taking his little player.  And and I kept saying, like, I want it to turn into a radio essentially that I can put anywhere.  And he's got like a minimized view of it that he's been working on where you can put it on a table in your kitchen and then wherever you are, you can hear it playing in the kitchen, which is really cool.  And like, I think there's a lot of enthusiasm right now among people who are already invested in this this these platforms, the Apple platforms, trying to figure out what their software, what their existing software does.  I think that there will also be a wave of people writing new software.  But like this is that first little rush.  It's like when the iPad came out where it's like, oh, can I get it up and running on the iPad?  And like they're just enthusiastic about it.

Start time: 1604.36
End time: 1627.65
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, no, I think the iPad app, it's literally iPad app emulation.  They're literally just running it just as you would on a Mac.  You're running on the native iPad app unchanged.  And then they make some changes and they do a build target for Vision OS.  And that gives you the frosted glass look and all of that, which is not there.  You can tell when you're using an iPad app because it looks like an iPad.  So this is the broadcast on the vision pro SDK.

Start time: 1631.20
End time: 1647.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And you can see that the that big screen in the background, that's just the iPad app.  And then he's popped out into a player into the 3D space.  So, yeah, that's cool.  It's not what you know, it's it's not they're working on it.  I want a 3D. I want a 3D like object.

Start time: 1650.48
End time: 1682.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I want a thing that looks literally I can I can pull out a thing that looks like a radio and set it somewhere.  And that's my broadcast player.  I'm intrigued by the idea of like apps as physical objects since we're getting like super skew amorphic here.  Like, let's do it. I want to see if you're an audio player like Steve Troughton Smith's broadcast.  I would love to see your radio literally a physical object I could set somewhere.  And when you when you work through the channels, it's not a blip.  Sure. I mean, the more skew amorphic, the better, I think.

Start time: 1682.54
End time: 1690.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting. It is. It does. It calls for skew morphism, doesn't it?  As Apple has abandoned it. But yeah, I don't know if that's ever was.

Transcript:  I think I think that everybody's going to have to have their chainsaw moment with this, you know,  where you get your first chainsaw, the first thing and everything you want to do in life is cut things with this chainsaw.  And so I think that as people start to write their own virtual reality apps with with Vision Pro,  it's the natural thing is, wow, I've got a podcast player that should actually look like a radio.  And I should be able to I should be able to put it on top of any physical surface in the real world around me.  But it's I think it's going to take a little while for everybody to kind of settle down and realize that that's cool.  That's wonderful. That's a really great demo.  It's not the most convenient way to access and to be using.  I don't I know you're really, really happy about the fact that you've used the virtual soundstage so that when you turn to the left or when you back away from the virtual radio,  the placement of it in the sound field moves and the volume moves.  But actually, I just want to be able to listen to it very, very clearly, no matter where my focus is.  We don't know. Yeah, I mean, we have I mean, remember that the magic cap,  like the first pre Newton message pad control was it was completely skeuomorphic where they use the paradigm of, hey, here is your house.  Here is your here is your inbox tray on your desk.  Hey, look, here is the let's go into the living room where you've got your radio.  And again, it was a really cool demo and it kind of made sense on some sort of Vulcan logic way.  But then again, when you give people or here is a menu with a list of five items and you simply click on the one that you want to use.  Let's see how long people use this skeuomorphism beyond like the first week or two.

Start time: 1788.56

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But the main thing is, is that what's what what's important is to throw it up against the wall, because a lot of times there are so many things that that I've been asked to do by someone who doesn't do what I do a lot.  And I go, oh, that's never going to work like that is like we had one with Richard Branson.  He wanted to do things in the round. He wants to do these.  He wants to do his pot. He wants to do his conversation instead of on stage.  And I was like, there was a lot of me going, hey, that is where there's a reason there's a stage on one side and our cameras on the other.  You're going to see our cameras. This is all going to work.  It's going to look totally chaotic.  And I did it. We did it because, you know, he was going to do what he's going to do.  And, you know, like he just he listened to us and billionaires always have the right of way.  And then we're going to do it this way.  And the thing is, is that we did it and now I won't do it any other way.  Like I will. Like it was so magical to have people in around talking to each other that we've slowly figured out how to make it way better than what we had done originally.  But but it was it was a beginner's mind.  You know, someone going in and going, I don't know.  I know that you've always done it this way, but I want to do it some other way.  And about half seventy five percent of the time, it's horrible.  Twenty five percent of the time being kind.  And but twenty five percent of the time you end up with something magical that you didn't know.  And so I think that the unknowing of it of and I think that's what people are in right now is they're just going to throw things up like what does this look like and does the radio work and does this thing go.  And and I and that's why it's so important for developers to get into it now and to have because right now they're still going to figure out the architecture.  My reality composer pro into those.  So there's a whole bunch of subsystems that you have to figure out on how all those things are going to work inside the simulator so that when you put the headset on all those things, you know how to do all the other things.  And now you're going into I don't feel right or I feel sick or this is too high or this is too low.  And Apple, I will say, I'm kind of amazed if you watch the WBC videos, the level of detail that Apple gives you around the design, you know, like you want all your interfaces slightly below.  I mean, all things that we've said in the past, those of us who've done it, but I've never seen anyone put it in training of all, you know, you want your head to look just a little bit down at things rather than up or you'll get tired.  And and there's a lot of these things that Apple has has figured out for folks, at least to give them a guide of where to start.  And so it's it's going to be interesting.  It's going to be an exciting time next year when the when the headset comes out.  That's really cool.

Transcript:  Steve Travis Smith did this development in public and you interacted with him in it.  But he was he was posting on Mastodon as he discovered a feature.  What you know, as he got an image, he would post, you know, while I have a little downtime of getting the TVOS app to look to see what I can port over.  I actually really liked let me scroll down.  Look at all these screenshots he put up.  I really liked this one.  This is a mini player kind of embedded on the desktop.  Yeah. So this is close to what you're talking about.

End time: 2000.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And to Andy's point, I think he's right.  Like, we don't know. We just don't know.  Is this a novelty that will wear off?  Or I think it's you could argue, are these two dimensional planes in a 3D space going to be like, oh, what were we thinking?  Two dimensional planes. That's so old thinking.  Right. Like, I think the truth is somewhere in the middle that there are going to be some uses for the spatial.  You know, and they're going to be somewhere.  It's it's irrelevant and we're going to have to figure it out.  But I love the idea that you've got some smart software developers who immediately are leaping in and saying like, OK, what what do I do with this?  That is not literally just my iPad app floating in a two dimensional window in space.

Start time: 2000.42

Transcript:  Right. Because that's going to come down to whether people live in this or not.  And I don't think Generation One they're going to live in battery life is long enough for one.  And you can't move around. Yeah.  But in time, if they do get an A.R. spectacle of some kind where you're kind of wearing it all the time, you'll want these 3D images.  You will want them to show up. You know, let's go in the kitchen.  I have the radio there. You I think that that's a natural form of augmented reality.  It's just the form factor for the Vision Pro doesn't lend itself to that forever.

Start time: 2034.52
End time: 2046.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  But some of these developers, I think, are also thinking they're going to play a long game just like.  Absolutely. Absolutely.  The first thing to do is just understand the language you're speaking and what the issues are.  And then and then take your time and grow and learn from there.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  We don't know how long it's going to take, but we have a pretty good idea of how long Apple is going to work on it.  And that's the distinction between Apple and Google is that with Google, you're like, if this doesn't turn out in six months or a year, we don't know if it'll make it to the next I.O.  You know, like, or maybe it gets to one I.O. and maybe not the second I.O.  You know, that kind of thing. And that's been a real problem that Google has had, which is this idea of just killing things off means that people have to put development time in.  They don't know with Apple.  You're pretty sure that they spent the last six or seven years working on this.  They're probably going to spend at least the next five, you know, kind of cranking through it.  And I think that that's a distinction.  Even things that were, you know, probably didn't turn out well, like Final Cut 10 from a PR perspective.  They're still with, you know, you know, 10, 10 years later or more than 10 years later.

Start time: 2096.24
End time: 2119.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You know, that's what I'm waiting for, hoping for.  And if the vision, as skeptical as I've been about the vision pro, it was of that particular form factor.  If the vision pro continues to make progress, it's a good this, you know, it's a good time.  And Steve Troughton Smith is all in on Apple. Right.  So he's not going to go to skill set.  That's what he does.  He's a platform developer.

Transcript:  So this is why would you not and James Thompson's same way.  Right. Like, like, why would you not?  James, I've known James for like 25 years now.  And I will tell you, like, one of the great skills that James has is whatever Apple does, whatever is new.  And you heard this last week, he takes it off the shelf and immediately starts playing with it.  And there's this question of like, can I do something with this? What can I do?  And it's not everybody is going to be like that.  But it's really interesting to see somebody who's like, oh, I have new colors that I can paint with now.  Let's experiment. And I love that on Mastodon, we're seeing them do it out in the open, like literally like, what can we do?  And they only got the simulator.  They don't have any hardware to try, but they're already kind of like just trying to figure out what's the metaphor that works.  What doesn't work? What work do I have to do?  It's pretty awesome to see it.

Transcript:  Just not everybody.  The other good side of this is it is stimulating the competition.  You know, this is what you always want.  Metta is not sitting still.  They're they're scrambling as fast as they can to be prepared for the release of Vision Pro.  As you remember, they announced a thinner, lighter, less expensive quest.  They this week announced a subscription model kind of like Microsoft's Game Pass.  Game Pass. Yeah.  Two games a month. You get to keep them as long as you're a subscriber.  The initial subscription is one dollar a month, but I think it ends up getting to eight dollars a month or sixty bucks a year.  But that's one triple A title a year.  That's a reasonable cost.  And it means you'll get two new games every month for your Metta quest or your quest pro or your question.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I mean, I think that they didn't want it to become.  I think that we saw very little games.  We probably will continue to see very little games because they want to make it a computing platform, not a gaming platform.  But obviously, games will be a big piece of what people want to do with it.

Transcript:  We're seeing we're seeing all these really interesting demos.  What we're not seeing is thank God.  Finally, I can I can create the virtual reality version of my outliner app.  It's this is another thing that we're going to be paying really close attention to that Apple.  I think that Apple has is going to struggle, at least initially, to defend the oh, no, no, no, we're not virtual reality and X, XR.  We are we are we are spatial.  We are the first spatial computing platform.  But I think they got a ways to go before they show anybody that, yes, you're going to want to you're going to want to to run Excel.  Well, you're going to you're going to want to actually like do three hours of productivity with this thing on when you're not like in economy and absolutely forced to do so.  It's I mean, it's they have to make the case that this is going to be better than it's better than what we use the iPhone for for productivity, where we'll use it in a pinch.  We'll use it because, you know, it's inconvenient to use a real thing or we don't have the real thing with us.  But to make it into something that I would prefer to use the the the Vision Pro to my laptop or anything else, that's going to be a big, big leap forward when they make it.

Start time: 2442.24

Transcript:  Well, I think that I mean, you know, I have the luxury of I've got a lot of screens in front of me that people don't see.  And and I have the luxury of having a room that I can do that in.  But in a lot of places, people may not have that.  And whether that's in the office or not, I think that there's going to be a fair number of people that again, I think that the first one might, you know, again, Apple has to get something out so that to get back to what we were talking about.  Earlier, developers have to have something they can wear.  And that's the number one reason that you release this.  The product that's coming out is that Apple will still be able to sell as many as they can make just to developers who want to figure out how to use it.  And for companies and organizations that want to figure out how to use it.  But I think that as it gets a little lighter and I think that one version will stay heavy and just get faster and the other version will get lighter and probably a little less expensive.

I don't like doing rumors, but you know, what else are we going to do these days?  There is a rumor, though, that I think people are very interested in that there might be, this is from Mark Gurman, a 30 inch iMac.  It is not the iMac is not necessarily dead.  Just don't get too excited about it because it's not coming at least until next year.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  30 plus inches, he even said.  Plus. Wow.  How big can this iMac be?  But wait, there's more.  It's 60 inches.  It's 100 inches.  Who knows?  It's an iMac the size of your house.  I'm excited, right?  Because clearly they initially out the door.  They're like, you know, 24 is fine.  Yeah, well, 24 seems like, yeah, buy an external display if you want.  And it's interesting.  I mean, I'm interested in the argument here that some people just want all in ones and they don't want to buy a display and buy a Mac mini or Mac studio.  And they just want an all in one.  And I think there is fine behavior that suggests that that's true.  I just wonder at the high end of a very large screen, do they think how big do they think that market is?  Because there is the argument that up there you might as well just buy a big external display and a computer instead.

Start time: 2916.04
End time: 2948.08
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And it's a shame that that's a lot of e-waste.  I mean, if you have if someone is buying an external display, that's something that could be retasked a dozen different ways.  And if they have no use for it, they put that up by the curb.  That could be retasked by other people and it does in different ways.  When you have that epoxied onto a computer for which there is no current operating system and no current security updates available, again, that's a lot of trash that could have been that could have been pulled out of the trash.

Transcript:  I've got IMAX that are solid 10 years old that I'm still using.  I just use them for something else.  Like these end up in some room working on doing something.  I haven't. That's the one thing about Apple is that a lot of the stuff just keeps working.  I may not be able to update it anymore, but I have it running radio or I have it running some kind of check system or something else like that.  And now that is to Andy's point why I mostly get Mac minis.  And also, you're an unusual consumer.

Start time: 2988.12

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. And also, I can't help but think about a Reddit video that I saw just a few weeks ago where it must have been some like central facility that recycles IMAX for an entire school system or something.  And they were looking at the like the really, really old IMAX, like the kinds where it was a very, very boxy flat panel display.  And they decided to do a viral video of setting up like 100 of them like as a domino run, which is, which is, which is bad.  Which is bad enough.  But then the reason the first thing to knock down the first IMAX was throwing like a 20 inch IMAX onto across the room onto a pile of just haphazardly piled up one of these.  It slides down and knocks over the first one.  So it's like, you know, I do go.  I do occasionally check out like there are websites that do nothing but like government auctions.  And so that's where you can probably find like a shrink wrap bundle of like a hundred like white, white IMAX for like just come and get it for like 50 bucks.  And you hope that the people that the people who buy them find a way to actually recycle the components.  But that's not often the case.  It depends on how if they can take a write off much more easily than they can actually put this on a municipal listing and arrange for a sale and arrange for the money.

Transcript:  You know, one of the big problems we had in Africa was that the varying voltages in the power supply damages the power supplies eventually.  And you and when you first get a PC that has an external power supply, you're like, why would you ever do that?  That is such a pain in the neck.  And then when you're building stuff in Africa, you're like, that's a really good idea, because now when the power supply goes bad, I just buy another one.  And I so but it's so but I think that that was one of the problems we had with the IMAX was that it's all contained.  And there's there's the there's the video.

Mark Gurman and his power on newsletter does says actually says quite a few interesting things this week now that Apple has finally gone public with the vision, bro.  It's roping in thousands of addition thousands of additional employees to figure out, you know, how to get all the software working, testing and availability of the hardware along with user studies, user studies have already expanded internally.

Transcript:  It does say Apple is still only allowing the most senior engineers and executives to bring the product home.  But I think now that we all know what it looks like, we've all seen it.  That's just a matter of time.  Next month, the company plans to start allowing select developers to go hands on with the device.  So there'll be some sort of developer edition, according to Mark Gurman.  Apple's core iOS and iPad OS are still being ported over for the most part.  You only saw a handful of apps, Jason.  I take it.

Start time: 3177.22
End time: 3195.57
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yes, just just those ones that they said are there.  Like, again, you got to read between the lines.  The ones that are there.  It's like when when I got the demo of the original iPhone right after it was announced and I typed on the notes app and it was a screenshot of notes app.  You know, there was a little like there are some apps that are built for it.  And then there are a bunch of apps that just aren't there.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, with more people testing and tasting the headset, tastes like nickel.  Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.  Its shortcomings are coming under greater scrutiny.  Many users are finding that the metal frame device feels too heavy after a couple of hours continuous use.  Again, I don't Mark doesn't source this, but I guess he's he's got his ears to the rail rails or something.  Some also say they've experienced motion sickness, but on a more minor scale than with competing headsets.  Did any of the journalists who got the 30 minute test report any motion sickness?  I don't think so.

Start time: 3232.48
End time: 3246.49
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, no, Joanna Stern did.  I think I'd have to double check that.  But she she she she struck me struck me as having had the most negative physical reaction, although it really wasn't that negative at all.  She coined the term nerd helmet.

Start time: 3247.20
End time: 3264.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So one would expect.  She's clearly biased.  Apple did develop a second strap, according to Gherman, that goes over the whereas head.  It's unclear whether that strap will.  You got it when you got the demo.  You had it right, Jason.  It's unclear whether they'll sell that as an accessory or put in the box.

Start time: 3264.62
End time: 3314.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  He says something about how I currently they think it's not essential.  And, you know, my immediate reaction to that was to say they certainly felt it was essential for the press because we all had it.  So I think I but the truth is that accessory if we think of those as accessories, I think the accessory story with this product is in flux.  They were they came right out and said that they did not have a very many different sizes and shapes of that light.  What do they call it?  The light blocker.  I forget what it's called, but it's basically the cushion that goes between your face and the hardware.  And they said there will be many more when it comes out.  And how many?  Many more like they are still figuring it out.  The light seal.  And figuring out like light seal.  That's it.  So the the there are many that they go down to Pier 39 and they find.  I think so. Yeah, you'll see them sometimes at the ballpark.

Start time: 3314.20

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 3315.44
End time: 3344.53
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So it's up in the air.  Right. Like I think they are still figuring out which ones they can make and that are going to be the best ones.  And like they probably don't want to make 20.  They probably don't want to make three.  So they're like trying to figure it out.  And that strap, I think, is part of that story.  You have to test this stuff with a large number of people before you really know what needs to be done.  But like is it necessary?  Like they may find that so many people's experience are so much better.  And I can't imagine that strap cost very much.  Meta sells it separately.

Start time: 3345.93

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  But yeah, my Quest 2 I had to buy the comfort strap or whatever because the one that shipped with it was terrible.  And like, yeah, but this is Apple, right?  It's a $3,500 device.  So I think it's one of those things where I wouldn't put it past them to put it in the box if they feel like it really is necessary.  And I will just point to the demos and say that they certainly thought it was necessary for us to have it.

End time: 3393.92
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Well, you don't get a charger with a lot of stuff.  It's true.  But on the other hand, it also makes you think that is this going to be something that they're going to trust people to simply buy it and have it delivered?  Or are they going to basically say come to the Apple store for a concierge level experience so we can fit it to you correctly just to make sure the people who buy it at least and the people who talk about the comfort?

Start time: 3394.26
End time: 3416.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, go ahead.  To market the device, Apple is planning to create new areas within its retail stores for demonstrations.  The spaces will also let buyers choose the correctly sized bands and light seal.  The company is considering initially requiring appointments for purchases, something it did with the original Apple Watch in 2015.  He's not right. You didn't have to make an appointment to get an Apple Watch. I got my mail order.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  What they told me, and again, what they told me is what they believed a few weeks ago and this mail changed in six months.  But what they told me is they expect that most people will want to go into a store because they'll actually want to try it out if they've never tried it out before.  But that there will be an online ordering option and it will be with the Apple Store app and they will use that face scanning and ear scanning stuff to like make a guess about what your right sizing is.  That's what German writes.  We'll be able to do it.  But I think they've got a little level of reality that most people are going to want to see it before they buy it.

Start time: 3450.62
End time: 3466.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple has developed an iPhone app to scan customers' faces to help determine the correct size for the light seal.  They will issue that app to its retail stores for the purchase process and could also release it as an app to consumers who are shopping online.

Start time: 3466.87
End time: 3481.05
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  That's it. But that's no, that also does.  That also gives them a lot of data for which to develop, like to figure out what are here.  Let's have thousands and thousands of scans of people's heads.  Yeah.  How we should generate the next generation of face shields.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 3482.34
End time: 3500.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see.  One problem Apple might face, according to German, and I think he's probably right, is that if you ship it too soon, you might have to put an M2 chip in it at the same time as you're releasing Macs with an M3 processor, which might bother consumers.

Start time: 3500.22
End time: 3506.36
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think it's going to go. Yeah, I think it's going to go out with an M2.  I don't think it's going to.  Yeah.  I think if they, no matter what.  Yeah.

Start time: 3507.60
End time: 3525.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that would indicate maybe releasing it earlier in the year than May, according to German.  Apple is already looking ahead to the next headset models.  It has shifted some employees working on the original Vision Pro to new versions, a second generation high end model and a lower end headset.

Start time: 3527.96
End time: 3540.49
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think that the higher end model will probably go to 120 frames a second and probably be 6K per eye.  And the lower end model will probably be not very different than the one we have now, just less expensive and lighter.  At least less expensive.

Start time: 3542.00
End time: 3565.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  These are the features that will not make the cut for the first version, but are still planned for the second generation.  The ability to show multiple Mac desktop screens when connected wirelessly to a Vision Pro.  Right now you can only see one desktop at a time.  I don't know why you'd need multiple Mac desktop screens.  That does not seem like, I guess if you're spending $3,500 for it.  That's perfectly fine for me.  I have for you.

Transcript:  I was absolutely thinking about the idea.  Well, I mean, imagine having spaces and having the spaces actually all be visible.  Wouldn't that be cool?  You get these multiple monitor set up.  Because right now you can only have, a lot of people have two monitors.  So you're traveling and you want to use this with your Mac, but it will only display a single monitor.  So I can see it.

Start time: 3587.20

Start time: 3592.64
End time: 3625.20
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  You know, but that's another problem.  There's a reason why, like ergonomically, if you have multiple monitors, the best way to arrange them is like one on top of the other.  People who have like the War Games NORAD set up on their desktop.  You are always doing this to like get through your daily work, even if you, if you designate the front ones as the most important ones.  And when you add that problem to the problem of now you've got this big heavy weight on your head that you're shifting around with your neck.  There's a, add that to the list of things that developers and users are going to be learning about during the first generation of this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also, a bit of a hot ticket, if you don't mind.  Also missing for the first generation, but possibly the second generation.  Again, this is according to German and he, you know, he doesn't quote, he doesn't say according to unnamed sources or anything.  So I don't know if this is speculation or the ability for multiple vision pro users and several person FaceTime conferences to use personas, which no one wants to use.  But okay.  The first version will only support one to one chats with personas.  And actually a big thing that was missing in the demos, which was fitness plus, because that seems like a very natural use for this.  And he says that will not be in the first generation.

Start time: 3690.24
End time: 3708.04
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I have a hard time believing.  Well, here's the thing.  People are going to make fitness apps for this thing.  So I think Apple would be making a mistake if they didn't have fitness plus there for this particular model.  I understand there might be some issues here, but like Facebook has already shown that with supernatural, like people want to.

And how do you and how confident is Apple that this is moisture sealed enough to prevent like ingress?  You never want to play Beat Saber in a group.  It's just not pleasant.  Plus, plus is that is the light shield?  Like, is it machine washable?  Can you at least spray that?  It's fabric, right, Jason?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, everybody should have their own light seal.  This is a little a little health tip for you.  OK, what else did Mark Gurman say?  So 30 inch plus IMAX, those are the Vision Pro rumors.  He said, in addition to the iPhone 15 lineup this fall, there will be two Apple Watch Series nine models and an updated ultra.  Of course.  Nice.  I mean, I love my ultra, but expensive.  Other products.  I guess, yeah, I don't have to buy it, do I?  But I will.  Other products may come later.  Not this fall.  An M3 13 inch MacBook Pro and 14 inch and 16 inch MacBook Pro.  M3 Pro and M3 Max.  These new IMAX.  The company is also conducting early work on an IMAX with a screen over 30 inches, I'm told.  New MacBook Air models, revamped iPad Pros with OLED screens.  I would like that.  That would be nice.  New iPad Air to replace the current M1 model.  Third generation AirPods Pro.  No mention of the Max.  And new home equipment.  Such as smart displays as well as an Apple TV set top box.  You know, I got the Pixel tablet.  The docks, I should bring it in here and show you.  The docks on the base.  I would love to see Apple do that with the iPad.  That is a very natural way to store your iPad, keep it charging.  It's very easy to take it off and then sit down somewhere with it.  I think that's a really, I would love to see Apple do that.  Yeah.

Start time: 3862.52
End time: 3927.87
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  That was one of the things that really struck me about all the reviews for the Pixel tablet.  And to be honest, it is a very, very like mediocre tablet.  It is essentially an entry level iPad.  But it seems like every single reviewer was saying how much, how often they were using this tablet.  Simply by virtue of the fact that it was there on the end table.  And every time they wanted to hit Reddit while watching a movie, they would just pop it off the dock.  Do what they wanted to do.  Pop it back on again.  And it became a very, very heavily used machine.  So yeah, if Apple were to create like a car mode, only the opposite of butts in motion mode.  The butts on a sofa mode.  Where it's actually doing something when you're not actually using it, like acting as a smart display,  like acting as a home controller or something that will show you a video camera or a different kind of feed or streaming feed.  That would be a very, very interesting product.  They could do it without the, they got the Pogo pens.  They could just build the hardware and put it in a new mode.  We got the Pogo pens right here.  They got the magnets.  With magnets and Pogo things, all things are possible.  So here it is.

Transcript:  Here's the base.  And it's not plugged in, but because it's a tablet, it's a battery.  So it continues to operate.  And then it just separates from the base.  There's speakers on the tablet and on the base.  I got to say, though, this is 500 bucks.  For 230 bucks, you can get the Nest Home Max, which is pretty much the same thing.  It's not an Android tablet.  It's not removable.  It's not removable.  But as you said, it's not the greatest tablet ever made.  Android tablets are not, are so disappointing.  It does have a fingerprint reader and so forth, and I can run apps on it.

Transcript:  Apple just has all the pieces for this product, right?  They do.  Whether it's an iPad that goes into a mode or whether it's a product that is intended to be placed somewhere and just be used in that format.  They've got Center Stage.  They've got the new widget view that they're bringing to the iPhone when it's when it's docked this fall.  That's got a whole bunch of widgets in it.  They've got a bunch of different.  They've got the Apple TV interface.  They've got all the widget designs that are out there now.  They've got Siri, which they I mean, it's OK.  And like they have all the pieces for all this stuff.  And it feels like when Mark Gurman reports like multiple home products are in the works, maybe not like for the next few months, but like in the works.  You can see it's typical Apple, right?  You can see them assembling all the functionality and the need the idea of continuity camera with the Apple TV.  Like it's all because that'll get zoom on Apple TV.  So if they do a box that's an Apple TV that also has a camera in it, they've you know, they've already got all the apps on it.  Like they're they're assembling a home strategy finally out of these pieces.  And you can see and you know, as somebody who had a what did I have?  I had an Echo show in my kitchen until it's it kept trying to sell me stuff every time I talked to it.  And now I've got a Nest Home, which is really slow and desperately needs an update.  But at least it's functional and is not constantly trying to sell me.  So I keep thinking, boy, Apple could really make a good product in this category that would be kind of half home pod, half iPod iPad that I would really want in my kitchen to do timers and play media and look at widgets and all those things.  Show me photos, all the things.

So it's kind of like a mini TV.  It's a very natural kitchen object.  And then to be able to pry the iPad off and take it over to the stove so you can look at the recipe.  There's a lot of I think there's that makes a lot of sense.  And I do you know, this is this is where Apple has a huge advantage.  So you've got Amazon and you've got Google and they making kind of half assed basically half assed versions of these products.  Apple sits back and I think when Apple releases it's the same thing with the Apple TV.  It's twice as much, maybe three times as much as a Roku, twice as much as everybody else's streamer.  But it's the one you want.  It's the best one.  And I think they could do the same thing with home.  They're poised.  The bar is low.

Transcript:  Nvidia Shield is 300 bucks or whatever.  I mean, I have it.  It's very expensive.  But it's an Apple TV cost.  And by the way, because it's Nvidia and it's Android, you can't get a lot of the apps that you get on Apple TV on it.  It's limited in the number of apps you can get.

Transcript:  I will say, and probably I'll agree with Andy to some degree here, is that I have a bunch of Android tablets and that's because they're less expensive and I have a single use for them and I don't want to spend $300 or $800.  Like I've got 14 of these controllers for our Zoom rooms because we need to do Zoom rooms for our remote events and so on and so forth.  I'm not going to buy 14 iPads.  So these are inexpensive.  Samsung's that cost me $119 each.  They're cheap.  And they all run across and they only have to run one interface.  And I think that I've used a lot of Android devices for that because I think in that environment they work great.  Now, do I carry that with me on the plane?  No.  But putting those, the Android, I will say that I love the Android ecosystem when it comes to I want a couple things.  Like for instance, I have, we used to have them in our office.  We had a wall where we had pictures we wanted to keep on changing behind the scenes of what we do.  I did that all with Android.  I'm not going to put a bunch of iPads on the wall.  And you're a unique user.

Transcript:  It's just like I'm not going to buy, you know, and like for cooking, the real problem is my family uses iPads a lot in the thing.  But it's getting flour and stuff on them.  You know, it just, you know, they're a little more expensive.  And you're like, do I really need to use this in the kitchen?  And where an Android sees all recipes just as easily as well.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's a it's only it's a larger issue when you talk to talk about streaming Donald's where the only there's only one TV in my house where it's worth spending two hundred dollars for something like an Nvidia shield or an Apple TV.  The rest of them, like I'm not going to spend a hundred dollars, even a hundred dollars on the on the TV in my kitchen or the TV in this other room, even in the bedroom.  Really, I've got a I've got a fifty dollar dongle that's fifty dollar Google made dongle that's actually because it's not even hooked up to a 4k TV.  I could get by with a thirty dollar one and it would work just fine.  It's it's it's nice to have that kind of a balance.  But you're you're absolutely right that this is something especially with the point that Jason made with the change that's going to come to all iPads.  Once you have these these widgets on the screen that are widgets on the lock screen, it's Google did come up with a very, very simple but I thought really, really powerful idea with with their Google tablet, which is the simple statement.  This is something they were they're talking from the very beginning that what if we have a tablet that does something when you're not actually using it as a tablet?  What if it could be useful to you while it was charging?  And that's something that however Apple chooses to articulate that that's a really good idea.  And I hope that Apple tries to try something along those lines with the iPad.

Transcript:  And by the way, I don't mean to dismiss the shield because it's I mean, it's of course, it's a great product.  It's amazing product.  And to Nvidia's credit, they've they've kept putting the latest version of Android on it long after they could have stopped.  But it's priced a little more than the the Apple TV.  And in some ways, this encapsulates the whole issue.  It's a great product, but it's in its own.  It's an outlier. Right. And with the Apple TV, you feel like you're part of a larger ecosystem.  If you only had one TV, you'd get an Apple TV.  You got two or three. And I understand.  Believe me, I've been thinking about this a lot.  We had to cancel all about Android this week because there just there wasn't that much interest in Android.  I think advertisers feel like probably wrongly people who buy Android are like Alex and they just want something cheap,  which means it's not a great place for an ad to be.

Transcript:  Like I can't. And I think Roku is going down that path where I used to really recommend the Roku.  Like that was it was inexpensive, sixty nine bucks.  And it did everything and it was good.  And now with the ads and stuff, it's just kind of they're all kind of getting crapified.  And I think it's a real opportunity for Apple to say we are not going to be that way.  We're not going to sell ads. We're not going to get crapified.  We're going to focus on great products.  Yeah, they're going to cost a little bit more like the Apple TV.  But you're getting an ecosystem that really works.  And as much as I hate lock in and gated communities, their story is very effective.  And when it comes to home automation, that's a big deal because people have been burned.  I'm sure, Jason, you've been burned dozens of times by different platforms and stuff, not talking other stuff.  We all have huge hubs that don't, you know, that are.

Transcript:  I so want it. You know, I want it, you know, and I've got parts of it done.  You know, like if I if I, you know, if I click on my watch, hold on, my watch is not good.  Not getting along with me. If I click on my watch and I go, oh, when all my lights out, then then then, you know, then theoretically, see, doesn't work.  I'm on I'm on TV. There we go. See that.  Finally. How long did that take?  I know. And then I'm but I turn it and I hit my watch again.  And then hopefully they'll all turn back on and this will be a really dark show.  It's going really slow right now. So see, this is this is this.  I just outlined exactly the problem.  Put yourself on like a voice scrambling just to get the full effect.  And finally, five seconds later, it goes back on.  Think about it. You know, so so anyway, so the and but that's and that took me took me a while to get that to work.  So and but that's the simplest thing that you would possibly do.  I know. It's an outlet, you know, and I can't get it to like, you know, and it's like, OK.  And for me, I just feel like I just want Apple to do the lock, the outlet, the camera, the light.  Do you think they're planning to that they just want to get a thermostat?

And then after that, everyone else can build around.  There's matter. There's matter which gives them a chance turned out to be a dumpster fire.  It's just it's not it's not working. It's it's not working.  I thought we'd have a unified standard.  We did when matter came out. We were excited.  But I've talked to home automation folks and it's just like it's not you know, it's not tying together.  I'm going to ask Stacey Higginbotham.

Transcript:  This is her among others.  This is one of her fields tomorrow and this week in Google.  But I TP link just came out with Wi-Fi enabled light switches that support matter.  They've had non matter switches.  And I was hopeful that now I can because the hue thing is just not I have some hue lights and I can say I could tell my Google or my Echo, you know, turn the lights off or on.  But it's it's pretty janky.  If I could put everything on a Wi-Fi light switch that I could then control, just like you do with your Apple watch or with an iPad or with my voice, because matter works with Echo and and Google Assistant as well.  Then maybe that holy grail of at least being able to control your lights.

Transcript:  One again, I just think that I think that Apple, I mean, Apple's jumped on with material and is saying, hey, we can support it.  But it's just it hasn't been working.  And and the thing is, I just think of Apple just said, well, we're just going to do it our way.  There's a lot of people that would jump on and just start building it that way.  You know, and they don't have to keep on trying to figure out how to integrate.  But I would like that.  Integrating with everybody else is not.  With their stuff. I really would.  It's not working with others is not Apple's strong suit.  They're good at a lot of things.  Just working with others on their standards is not one of them.

Transcript:  That's that's even an apple.  You can always tell the difference between when something is a priority and something is not a priority.  And it's the Apple's no different from anything else.  The HomeKit is they figure that, OK, well, we kind of we kind of got to have it in some way, shape or form.  But there is nobody that's jumping up leaping on someone, a product, another product manager's desk leaping up and down and demanding to know why they're not doing more to support their HomeKit projects.  It's it's and I don't think that there are a lot of competitors that have the same sort of.  No, nobody's doing.  Yeah.

Start time: 4662.26

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that matter is an example where Apple's basically said, look, we're going to let HomeKit become matter, more or less.  And that means their strategy there, I think their strategy is to find partners that are on the Apple bandwagon and are going to do good HomeKit and matter support and build a business and compete with other partners maybe.  But like you look at something like Ecobee, right?  Like Ecobee in Apple are tight and they work really well with HomeKit and their next competitor, which is great, I think, for Apple, too.  But like Apple doesn't need to build a thermostat.  They don't want to build a thermostat, but they have found a partner who wants to support Apple platforms.  And I think that that's their strategy is like they don't want to build a lot of these home products.  But what they want to do is find and it might be under the guise of like we're selling it in the Apple online store or we're putting it in Apple retail stores.  But there's they've got some leverage there to say like, look, our customers have a lot of money and they want to buy smart home products.  And if you work really well with us, we will highlight you.  And that gets them the equivalent.  And I know Alex might bristle at this like it's not quite the same as if Apple built it, but Apple's not going to build it.  So it's like tear down from there, which is like we're going to work with somebody to make sure that this is good enough for us to sell in our stores.  And that's how you get those home accessories out there that are sort of like and they're they're out there.  There are good citizens of HomeKit and presumably will be of matter at some point.  And like that, I think that's their strategy.  And then they're going to keep the core to stuff that's running their operating systems.  And that's going to be like, yeah, we might see a kitchen device with a screen or we might see an expanded Apple TV that's like a sound bar with a camera.  But they're not going to, I think, make light bulbs, right?  They're just not going to do it or a doorbell.

Transcript:  And the other thing is that we might be seeing a preview of what the VR industry becomes like where we've had home automation for a number of years and a lot of basic stuff has worked pretty well.  And it's possible that there is no magic solution, that there is no somebody that no matter how much commitment you put into it, people like home automation for turning lights on and off for door locks and security cameras.  And they really like turning lights and they really like setting kitchen timers.  But and finding out what the weather is.  But the idea of home automation or voice assistance as an entire platform for computing through smart speakers, maybe humanity has said this is enough.  We don't care about anything above this level.  We appreciate we love how much energy you're putting into this, but we will enjoy watching these videos and these demos.  But so long as we ask what to ask what the weather is and it tells us what the weather is, we're good.

So we put in a Lennox heat pump and you know, for a small additional fee, I don't even want to know how much they give us a Lennox smart thermostat.  But of course, it's in a world of its own.  It doesn't support anything.  I have to have the Lennox app on my phone.  I mean, it actually is pretty cool.  It does a good job.

Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say just I wrote a smart thermostat for the wire cutter back right when I was starting.  So it's it's long been replaced.  But one of the things I did is I talked to experts in HVAC and they said if you've got a first party system that has a smart thermostat, you should use their thermostat.  Don't go buy a nest.  And the reason is they have access to all the like special quirky codes about their stuff.  So even though you're getting this Lennox thing, although who knows, maybe there's a bridge like a home bridge plug in or something.

Is that it?  You know, and that that's a Wi-Fi switch.  You switch.  Now, here's the worst part is I went and bought the Eve power.  That's what turned these all these lights got turned on and off with the power strip.  But so I didn't because there was no other place to go as far as I was concerned.  Like Eve is making these outlets and that one works fine.  This one still is really, really slow.  But it but it does work now.  So all it takes, unfortunately, I don't know.

So those are Wi-Fi controlled and I can have them on timers and I can use a remote.  But the fact is, there's a thing in the wall.

We'll get to that in in just a second.  But first word from our sponsor.  I love this stuff.  A.G. one, the daily foundational nutrition supplement that supports whole body health.  I look forward to this drink every morning like countless others.  I've you know, I've always wanted to support my health.  I've taken a lot of pills.  It got to the point where it was a fistful of pills and it was costing me twenty dollars a day or something.  I decided I didn't want to sacrifice my taste buds or incorporate more pills through a science driven formulation of vitamins, probiotics and whole foods source nutrients.  A.G. one delivers comprehensive support for the brain, the gut and the immune system.  And by the way, it tastes so good.  I look forward to my A.G. one every morning.  It's a it's just a great routine.  Since 2010, A.G. one has improved their formula 52 times in the pursuit of making the best foundational nutrition supplement possible.  Highest quality ingredients.  You'll be glad to know rigorous standards of manufacture.  So A.G. one has really become part of millions of daily routines.  As I've asked around when I thought about trying to change in A.G. one, everybody said, oh, yeah, I've been using that for years.  And it's an oh, yeah, A.G. one is the best.  Individual supplements can quickly add up.  But A.G. one saves you time, confusion and money with each serving costing less than three dollars a day when you subscribe.  A.G. one makes it easier for you to take the highest quality supplements, whether it's improving digestion, supporting your sleep.  A.G. one is the best bang for your buck.  A simple drinkable daily habit.  Just one scoop.  You get the nutrients, the gut health support that helps your body thrive and covers all the nutritional bases.  And I love these A.G. one packets when we were traveling.  It's great.  You just bring these around.  That's the whole day's supplements right there in this little packet.  So made in New Zealand.  So if you're looking to take ownership of your health with a simpler, effective investment, start with A.G. one.  Try A.G. one to get a free one year supply of vitamin D and five free of these A.G. one travel packets with your first purchase of a subscription.  Go to this is a new address, by the way.  Please use this drinkagone.com slash Mac break.  It's actually a little easier than it used to be.  Drinkagone.com slash Mac break.  It's in the it's in the name of the URL.  Drink A.G. one.  You'll love it.  We thank them for their support and for these great A.G. one products.  My mouth's watering.  As soon as I get the packet out, I go, I want some moving, moving right along.  Well, there's still quite a few stories here.  Let me let me kind of rip through a few of them.  There were zero days.  If you haven't updated your various Apple devices, do so.  Apple fixed zero days used to deploy spyware called triangulation.  It's another iMessage zero click exploit.  And you probably see the dot one updates on your iOS, your iPad OS, your Mac OS.  Do not delay.  These were discovered by Kaspersky.  Zero click is the big scare because it means essentially they can send you a message.  You don't even have to open it, read it or do anything and it will infect your computer.  And it's of course used by state hackers.  These are very powerful exploits, which means, you know, you're probably not a target.  They're not going to use them.  You know, hackers aren't going to use them to put ransomware on your machines or stuff.  It's really used by because they're so pricey to get these exploits.  But still update.  Oh, another tip.  If your car gets stolen and you have an air tag in it, call the police.  Do not go to where the car is.  Bakersfield woman 61 shot to death.  Jesus.  After she confronted suspects who stole her car.  She the car was stolen.  It had an Apple Air tag in it.  She didn't tell law enforcement, according to Bakersfield police.  She just went to the 5600 block of Ginger Avenue and found her car and found four guys who had stolen it.  And they shot her dead.

I mean, this is the challenge is that people get, you know, get a hold of these.  I had a situation where someone stole a camera from me when I was in Africa and I was at a big event.  And I was wearing a Scotty vest and I had thought about putting the cable, you know, there's a little cable on the inside of the inside of your pocket.  And someone and someone stole it.  And someone said, why didn't you put that cable on it?  And I was like, because I don't want someone to pull that camera out and then I'm looking at them and they're looking at me.  That puts me in danger.  Yeah, like I'd rather just take the kind of people who might steal that camera or steal your car.

All it needs to do is you go together for about a 10 feet and it goes, I think it's you, you know, and and and that's not hard for them to get a hold of.  And so, you know, so things going going in the same place together is something that that's why when you think about the government wanting all this data, it's one of the things that it shortens the list really fast about what's possible.

Transcript:  But also did you read, so Apple is now suing, basically taking legal action in Switzerland to own all trademarks of all apples everywhere.  And every company, even even like the the Apple Growers, the Apple Growers Association trademark, which is simply an apple with a plus inside it.  And they basically want to either be granted exclusive rights to use the any sort of like an Apple logo anywhere or to at least get all these people to sign non non compete and non basically signed.  So you're essentially bending the knee to Apple saying that, yes, your 50 year old, 60 year old trade group uses it only with our benediction.

Start time: 5808.20
End time: 5867.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a hundred and eleven year old trade group. The fruit union Swiss for most of its history has had a symbol that's a red apple with a white cross.  The Swiss flag.  Apple says no, you can't do that.  We have a hard time understanding this because it's not like they're trying to protect their bitten apple, which is right.  Apple's got a bite out of it.  The the objective, according to Fruit Union Swiss director Jimmy or Jimmy Marietta's, their objective here is really to own the rights to an actual apple.  Which for us is something that is really almost as universal as a taco Tuesday.  The case has left Swiss fruit growers puzzled, according to Wired.  Apple did not respond to requests for comments.  You know, I think Apple hires lawyers and says go forth, go the fourth and protect our trademarks.

Start time: 5868.38
End time: 5914.20
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  If I read that correctly, I think that they either want to own it or they want to have no one tell them that they can't own.  They want mutual exclusive whatever with the brand.  And so what they're usually this kind of thing happens because somebody sent them an email.  You know, like this is how lawyer this is how you stir up a beehive is that somebody with an apple ish logo sent a cease and desist to Apple or something at some point in time, probably four or five years ago.  And then there were then they crushed them, you know, like that, you know, like there's a whole bunch of legal whatever.  But they were like, we got to make sure this never happens again.  And then there's like a plan.  There's a bunch of meetings and there's, you know, and then there's some initiative.  They're not. Apple's not trying to take the take the brand.  What they want to do is make sure that no one can ever claim against.

Transcript:  OK, but let me tell you the history of Apple's lawsuits.  So you remember the Apple Corp lawsuit where they fought back and forth with the Beatles.  Beatles said fine, just don't do any music.  Then Apple said, you know, we have this thing called iTunes.  We were thinking.  So anyway, they finally settled that back in 2007.  But but Apple has also sued a meal prep app that had a pear logo, a singer songwriter named Frankie pineapple, a German cycling route and a pair of stationary makers in a school district, all for using an apple of some kind in their logo.

Start time: 5949.95
End time: 5968.90
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is.  So it's when I see stuff like that and how regularly they've been doing that, I think that the legal department at Apple, like independently, they know that we got a pretty good scam going.  So long as we keep filing these lawsuits, all our kids are going to Ivy League colleges.  We can we can keep trading our boats for bigger, better boats.

Transcript:  I should also point out, and I've been told this many times because we have a trademark for twit and the twit logo and stuff like that, that you have to defend these.  Otherwise, they, you know, people assume you're not defending them anymore.  And so it's it's it's fair game.  So to a certain degree, a company that has trademarks does have to defend them.  I think common sense, perhaps is pretty super aggressive.  Nevertheless, Taco John's says, I think Taco John says it's OK.  Let's see. Taco John's parent company, Spicy Seasonings, denied that there is, quote, anything not cool about obtaining a trademark for the phrase.

Transcript:  In a little bit more serious lawsuit, the Supreme Court has rebuffed Apple.  In the Caltech patent case, you may remember that Caltech says they have Wi-Fi patents that Broadcom uses and Apple, when it used Broadcom chips in their devices,  infringed Caltech at 1.1, a $1.1 billion verdict.  But a lower court said last year the amount of damages needs to be recalculated.  This lawsuit has been going on since 2016.  Apple and Broadcom asked the Patent and Trademark Office Administrative Court to reconsider whether the patents were good in the first place.  That's one of the ways you can try to get around these, I know, because there was a podcast patent.  It ended up getting overturned, thanks to the EFF, in an inter partes case at the PTO.  But the Patent Office Tribunal agreed to review the patents and ultimately upheld their validity.  That's the risk.  If you challenge it at the Patent Office and they say, no, no, that's a good patent, now you've got a double trouble.  So Caltech won a Los Angeles jury in 2020, sided with Caltech.  The company's appealed.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in February of last year upheld the jury's findings.  Apple said, well, and Broadcom, let's take it to the Supreme Court.  In January, the Supreme Court asked the Biden administration to weigh in.  The Biden administration said, don't take the case.  The law is properly applied and the Supreme Court, in fact, did not take the case.  So I'm not sure where the award stands, but as of now, Apple and Broadcom, now we're going to have to face a trial to find out how much they owe.  Because they owe. You owe.  It's just a matter of how much you owe.  Let's see.  Anything else in the listing here?  Studio Pro headsets from Beats are now in the FCC database.  That sounds like they're going to do a kind of Pro Max version of Beats.  Yeah.

Transcript:  There are some functional differences.  I think they make more of an effort to do the proper Bluetooth pairing because they're meant to be more cross-platform than AirPods are, even though AirPods are that.  There is a sport version, right? There's a little more variety there.  I think there are some features that they lack that the AirPods have, but they're pretty close.  It's an exercise in branding and Apple focusing on AirPods on a very particular market.  They're good, is my understanding. They're very good and they have a lot of that Apple secret sauce in them, even though they're not Apple branded.

Transcript:  I keep buying third party earbuds. Not Beats so much, but others, just to compare them.  And Apple's AirPods Pro are really kind of the standard.  They've just got the new Denon Pearl Pro.  They have a special technology that they place sounds in your ears and condition the sound based on that.  It's kind of like a hearing test without you doing anything.  They sound very, very good, but they're missing that ecosystem.  This is what made me start thinking about ecosystem.  The transparency and the mix of the new features that are coming soon.  All of that Apple can do because they have the phone.  It just gives them more capabilities, even if you could make an equivalently good sounding headphone.  By the way, the Denon Pearl Pros are twice as much as AirPods.

Transcript:  That's actually one of the bigger qualities that has gone to my own decision making.  The thing is, all of the truly wireless headphones that I've had, they've got an end of life that's measured in a couple of years.  Either because the battery is going to go comfort or because simply I'm going to lose them because things happen and I'm me.  I love Google's Pixel Buds A because I think that 99 bucks for me is exactly the right amount of money to spend.  I'm willing to spend like $40 a year for use of truly wireless headphones.  The sound is certainly not as good as Apple's Pros or the best Sonys or probably the Denons, but they're really, really good.  The other thing is that I love the design where they have that little silicone little tail that sort of nestles into one of the folds of your ear.  They're by far the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used.  That's why even though I do have a nice pair of Sonys, usually when I'm going out for my walk or for any real reason, I'm using the Pixel Buds.  It's a complicated piece of math.

Transcript:  Also with my iPad, with my Apple stuff, I agree that the secret sauce of having Apple created earbuds working with an Apple created product all tied together with Apple created software is awfully nice.  I really wish I had that kind of like the ability to check the charge on everything I had.  But again, when it comes to, it's hard for me specifically to particularly to spend 200 and some odd dollars on something that even if I don't misplace them, I know that in a few years they're just going to be garbage.  And even if that weren't the case, they're not as comfortable as these cheaper ones.  I'm sure that there are $60 earbuds that have certain elements they're designed that suit my ears better than the other ones.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So, you know, my biggest complaint is that if you have any other Bluetooth app other than Apple, and I don't know if this is the W1 chip or whatever, but when someone calls me and I'm on a different headset, which I'm often on, I'm on.  So I when I'm talking on the phone and I'm working or doing something, I'm on an open com.  Yeah, I bought those because they're great.  Yeah, you can.  No one hears anything.  If you have a little boom that comes down and everything else, it's great.  When I'm purely listening and I might answer a call, I'm on the ultimate ears fits because they fit, you know, like they're they're great.  And they're they're really in my ears.  And when I'm on kind of general purpose, I'm on my AirPods, you know, and but what's interesting is, is when someone calls me, no matter how often I've been using this open com, it's the only one connected to my phone.  And when it answers, it doesn't answer to the open com.  I have to go select it every single time.  And I'm just like, and I can't decide whether it's conspiracy or just missing that chip or something because it's so it's just like if I'm driving, I don't want to use it because I don't want to.  I use the AirPods because I, you know, I want to just answer to the headset.  So it's just it's annoying.

Transcript:  Anyway, I did think there was an interesting story like last week, the week before there was an interview with Kevin Lynch of Apple and Deidre Kullback about finally answering at least the first substantive answer to the question, why doesn't Apple allow third party watch faces?  And they ascribed it to just reliability that they were basically saying that they don't know.  Like if they if if they allowed third parties to developer to develop watch faces, then maybe the next time they off, they upgrade iOS, then the watch face would break.  And I thought that was an interesting point of view because they have no problems when they allow developers to write other kinds of apps for the watch and they don't worry about breakage.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.  Somebody in our chat room said there's a he's got a bet on whether you'll have custom eyeballs for the spooky eyes before you have custom watch faces for the Apple watch.

Start time: 6610.20
End time: 6672.08
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's gotten to the point where WBC, the number one thing I want to see is custom watch faces like I would literally tweet it out like, oh my gosh, there's there's production things that I want to do with my foot with my watch, you know, with I want a very specific thing with second hands and certain things.  And I want my my complications to be in a very specific way.  And, you know, it's if Apple did that, then I probably wouldn't care anymore.  But if given that they haven't done it and I desperately there's only one on watch face with second hands.  If you're in production, you really want to know how many seconds are left.  You know, there's there's an exercise one and then there's a dorky one, you know.  And and so the the thing and so the fact that Apple doesn't do that, just like, oh, like, let us experiment.  And if it doesn't work, let us know.  You can give us three warnings that we might break the break the watch or it might run out of battery or whatever.  That's fine. But this is definitely a place where usually Andy's talking about it, where Apple's being over controlling and they should just let us free our watch faces, free the watch face.

Transcript:  This is one of those areas where Apple's reliance on a curated app store, you know, kind of proves the point, which is, you know, you could say, oh, no, no, no, we can't allow that.  Like, you never know. There might be trademark issues. We might be lawsuits or they might not work right.  It's like, yeah, you've got an app store. So only let in the ones where you've checked and they're OK.  And then wouldn't that be nice? So I still feel like it's going to happen eventually.  But I would have lost the bet if you would ask me back when the back almost, you know, like nine years ago when they announced the first Apple watch, how long it would take to do custom third party watch faces or even if they allow if they they basically allowed a handful of studios to create the right to the authorization to do that sort of stuff.

Transcript:  Because I could I could absolutely see where they don't want the design of the Apple watches was just as important as like the engineering or the software.  They just they wanted to make what looked like a beautiful, elegant, timeless classic watch and that that they wouldn't have to keep updating every two years as the fashion's changed.  They could just update the software. So I absolutely see where they would want to have some control over to make sure that let's not have when the when the Calvin is pissing on the floor.  Or that means that it's a four o'clock, you know, but but if they simply said here are some here are some studios that we really, really like.  We have given them like license to produce the following eight watch faces that are optional downloads or optional purchases and to see how well those those things work out and then keep keep expanding the program as they see how people are reacting to the source stuff.  I'll say having a Snoopy and Woodstock watch face as with the new watch.  I was that that delayed my my attention a little bit because I want to snoopy.  That's all you really needed.

Transcript:  You can always here's the secret is you can always go to six colors when I link to it and see my headline that I wrote, which was something like pro tip.  The iPhone has a discover ability problem.  But I see it was not as good on that.  I don't think this one.  This one made me laugh.  I like some of those.  I think the headlines are a little too much.  But this is the point is like Apple can ship new features.  But how do users ever discover them?  And there's a new thing.  My news angle is that there's a thing called Tipkit and I was 17 that is going to try to standardize so that app developers have a standard way.  And Apple is using it to a standard way of rolling out little tip bubbles that will pop up.  And it's and they don't want them all at once.  Like you can set it to be like when a user does this behavior or does this behavior for the third time.  You can pop up a little tip that said here's a thing you could do and they don't do five at once only do one every few days or weeks or whatever because they're trying to improve discover ability.  The reason that this came up is that while I was in Oregon for my daughter's graduation, my wife and I go out to lunch and she comments that I don't have pictures of our kids on my lock screen.  And she says how will she works in an office with other human beings?  She's like, how will people know it's your phone?  Because people know interest because it's got her pictures of her kids on it.  And I said, oh, well, you could have a lock screen that shuffles through all the pictures of our kids because that's an iOS 16 feature.  And I opened it up and I so she didn't know about that feature.  I found a bug, which is that the faces that it offered were totally random and not our children.  It's like, why are these pictures there?  They're like people we took two pictures of and they're like, would you like to shuffle between those two pictures of randos?  It's like, no, no, Apple.  So I filed the feedback about that.  That's fine.  But like then I'm looking at her app screen and she's got nine pages of apps just going off into oblivion.  And I realized she Apple like three or four years ago, Apple completely simplified and adjusted how we handle apps on iPhones so that you don't have to have them on the screen anymore.  They're still in the app library.  You can still search for them, but you can sort of like simplify your life and delete all those extra screens and only sort of have instead of having a junk drawer, which is what she has.  You can just have a cup like your favorites on a page or two and then the rest are just in the app library.  And I explained this to her.  But and it was she was like, oh, well, that's that's cool.  Right. But like she never thought about it.  And I thought, well, what did Apple do to try and prod her to completely change the way that she handles apps?  And it struck me that like what happens with most people is they learn once how to do something.  So they learn how to manage apps on an iPhone.  And then five years pass and Apple says, hey, it's getting kind of messy on that iPhone.  We're going to do a cool new feature that lets you organize it better.  And the all those people who learn that they just don't notice and they keep doing what they learned.  And it just struck me that like it's a hard problem.  Like how do you not get super annoying?  Like when they update their phone, if you bombard them right then, they're not going to do it.  And I realized that it's not our our viewers and listeners.  Right. It's the it's like everybody else.  We're we're the discovery system for the people who listen to our podcasts.  Right. But but the general public and my wife was a good example, because believe it or not,  I do not replicate Mac Break Weekly at the dinner table.  My wife, my wife was like she learned in 2014 or whatever 2012 2010 how to manage apps.  And it never knew that Apple made it easier.  So it's a real it just got me thinking like we're about to enter this beta cycle again.  And new apps or new OS features are coming in the fall.  But the core problem is like how do regular people ever know that something like that lock screen thing  that got out of the last month last fall, which is so oblique.  Right. It's not even an app.  You have to be in the lock screen and then press and hold.  Like how do people even know that that exists?  And what if you're Apple, how do you strategize to try and get it to be discoverable in some way?  You know, I don't have an answer.  I just I'm fascinated by how hard the problem is.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry that they don't that Apple doesn't continue to publish like update manuals on on Apple books  that they used to be like here is an entire like 192 page manual on how to use your iPad.  Or specifically, here is how here is how to use the iPad, iPad, OS, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.  With a full prefixes, here's the stuff that's brand new with this, because there is this.  I mean, ideally, things would be simply discoverable and ideally simply having when you finish the update,  walking you through a simple slideshow of advertisements of things that are that are different also would be sufficient.  But if people just got into the habit of, hey, look, there's a whole document that explains not only what these features are,  but how actually to use them.  I don't know why Apple doesn't do that anymore.  I wish they did.

Transcript:  I think they leave it up to people to do it.  And I think that not as many people do it anymore that they used to.  There used to be those those great little manuals that people would put out.  I know that for me on a daily basis on some app, I'll do something like I wonder how to do this.  And then when you see what Apple did, you're like, whoa, that's cool.  You know, like I did.  I was doing this thing where I was showing countdown clocks inside of keynote.  Like you can do a countdown clock for your show.  And when I was prepping for it this morning for office hours, I went did magic move from one to the other.  So thinking that, oh, it'll reset and move my countdown clock.  It kept the countdown clock running like it just I started on by the third slide.  It was it just kept on running in seconds and just moving it along and changing the images behind it.  And that was like, you know, like I've never seen that published anywhere.  Like I'm sure that they did somewhere.  It's in some note that, oh, by the way, magic moves will keep your video running.  I mean, it's probably connected to the backgrounds that run and everything else.  But but the you know, Apple does a lot of things and they do.  One thing Apple does that if you're listening, you're an educator, they do education seminars,  like WebEx or something like that.  And I've sat in some of those.  And that's another one of those ones where I sit in.  I sit in the keynote once because I use keynote a lot.  And there's stuff on the iPad that I, you know, like you can just take your pencil,  grab onto an object with your pencil and just swirl it around.  And you've now built an animation path like, you know, like you've just, you know, and and the first time they did that,  I feel like I know keynote pretty well.  I've been using it since version one.  And as soon as they do it, I think I had an audible like, oh, like, holy smokes.  And I think to your point, it's unfortunate that Apple leaves out, you know, doesn't educate us because, I mean, half of the problem is I and I will say this is not an Apple problem.  This is everybody's problem is that there is so much value locked in devices that we don't know about.  They spend millions of dollars developing things.  I've said this oftentimes about my microwave that I know how to turn it on and I know what the power is.  It's got all kinds of fuzzy logic in there that can cook my my chicken and everything else.  But it's hard to figure out how to do it.  And so I don't do it. I just turn it on and give it some time and move on.  Yeah. And that's the the delta there is wetware development, which is teaching me and creating an app.  And nowadays I get these apps all the time.  I'm almost expected. I get I'll get some app and I'm looking for the QR code.  Like, where's the QR code? Because there's somewhere like if you buy the screen for this, this little protective screen that I have on the front, had a QR code.  I put I hit it. It opened up a movie on YouTube that showed me exactly how to do how to put that that project project.  You know, and there's no amount of explanation.  There's no there's no manual that can tell me how to put that screen on as well as a video.  And so they just they have a manual.  I mean, you have a step by step that's there that you can follow.  But there was a little QR code and I hit it and boom, I knew I understood it.  And I think that not just Apple, but everybody has to get better at that because, you know, especially with software.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's a it's a super hard problem in the discord.  The wheel, right? Said, well, don't they?  You know, when when you update to your new OS, isn't there a big thing that says here are all the new features?  The answer is yes. But the problem is I think a lot of times people just want to use their phones, right?  They're like, oh, I had to wait for it to restart. Now I want to use your phone.  I this happens to me when I use I'm on a lot of beta.  So I'm on a lot of test flight things and like test flight.  You open the app and it's got a thing. It's like, here are all the new beta features and check this out and all of that.  And every time I launch an app that's got one of those, I'm like, not now.  Just like I want to use this app, right?  Because in the end, I didn't launch it to read about beta features.  I launched it to use the app. And so when you're you can do that and maybe you'll get them in the right moment.  But I think that the challenge is that a lot of times they're not ready to learn and they're not ready to sit down and have a whole session about the 20 features that you added.  You think they should know about. So like, how do you get them later?  And like an example that I found that every time I recount this, there are people and there'll be people who are listening now who are going to be like, no way.  I can't believe you could do that.  One of my wife's complaints was when she's got an app that gets added to page nine and she wants it on page one, she has to tap and hold until it wiggles.  And then she drags it over to the left side to the edge and then it moves one page and then she waits or wiggles it and it moves another page.  And I said, well, did you know that if you put another finger down, you can swipe with that finger while I didn't know that I didn't even know all the way to page nine.  Really fast. They added that like two years ago.  Does anybody else so so then I would say, wouldn't it be interesting if Apple could do something like see somebody slow dragging an app and say, hey, did you know that there's a faster way to do this?  But that's the challenge is like, how do you do that?  How do you cue that? How do you observe behavior?  And then, and then, you know, you don't want to be clippy, but you do want to like it or seed at some point and say there's a faster way to do this or or how do you put something up on the lock screen that says, hey, would you like a cooler lock screen?  You know, tap me to find out.  Right.  And the problem is, it's a challenge.  It's just really hard.

But again, you have this user problem of like, a lot of users are like, oh, boy, I will read some tips now.  Right.  Like, or they, or they come out as push notifications and they end up getting in your way.  And like, that's part of the challenges is like Andy said, well, any analysis both covered this, like the microwave problem is great.  Right.  Which is just like, I just push the button and it cooks the food.  I don't want to read a manual about it.  And that's like, there are manual readers out there and bless them.  But like, you do, you do it software, like you need to hold people's hands a little bit more and be like, don't want to bother you.  Sorry to bother you.  But did you just noticed?  Did you notice this thing?  Because people are most people are not going to curl up with the manual.  They're just not.

But, oh, you can attach your phone and oh, you know, like, and they have, they have stuff that you can learn how to make, like, you know, and you, you learn how to make something.  And we make something, I think we learned how to do something with the June, like the first week and we, we make it at least once a week, you know, like, you know, and we don't do it the same way.  Roasted Brussels sprouts.  Yep.  Yeah.  For us, it's like, it's like potatoes with carrots or something like that.  And the thing is, is that, but what they did really well, and I think Heston does this really well, where they have these tutorials on how to make new dishes with their product, you know, and they spent a lot of money on those.  Like, like, it's not like they said, oh, we're going to give you a little like how to there's little videos of how to do each piece and how to put all that together.  And it makes a big difference in you.  And it adds a lot of value to the product without actually engineering anything new.  It's just video, you know, and, and I think that, you know, it's, it's, it's missing.  And it feels like it should be everywhere.  Yeah.  It's a huge problem.  All software.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Transcript:  We're going to take a little break.  Come back with your picks of the week.  So guys, get those ready.  You're watching Mac break weekly.  And those of you who are in club twit, the picks are going to happen right away because you don't get any ads.  Now, ad free is just one of many benefits club members get.  Really important to us.  I mean, the biggest benefit you get is that twit sticks around that we will continue to do this show and our other shows because times are tight for podcasters everywhere.  They're cutting back.  They're laying off.  Shows are disappearing.  We realized at least I realized two years ago that the real future of twit lay in its audience.  You are community.  That's the strength of twit.  And so as a result, we started Club Twit seven.  I'm going to lead with the most important part.  Seven bucks a month.  It's a couple of lattes a month.  Actually, not if you go to Starbucks.  It's like a half a lot.  But nevertheless, seven bucks a month, you get completely ad free versions of all of the shows, including this.  You get access to our discord, which is a really fantastic.  Even Mr. Beast says you should subscribe to our discord.  Fantastic community of itself.  You also get shows that we don't put out in the public, including the new A.I.  show with Jeff and Jeff Jarvis and Jason Howell are putting together for us.  We're very excited.  That's going to launch in the club.  That'll be a club special.  Home theater geeks with Scott Wilkinson's Club Only Mac.  Hands on Mac with Micah Sargent, Hands on Windows with Paul Thurotte, the Untitled Linux show.  We don't look.  I would like to put every show out for everybody, but the club members are paying for these shows.  They're making it possible.  So we want to make sure they get access.  And you know what?  If a show does well and builds an audience like this week in space did, we start it in the club.  We put it out in public after it builds an audience.  So the club is really an important incubator for us.  It's a way to keep the lights on, keep the staff employed.  I don't want to beg, but I'm on my knees.  Please join Club Twitter.  Seven bucks a month, eighty four dollars a year.  There is a family plan.  There's a corporate plan.  Both of those will save you money.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  Twit on.  Oh, and yeah, we're bringing back hands on tech.  Some of our views.  In fact, that's where my review of the Pixel tablet will appear first.  It's also where my review of those Denon Pearl Pro earbuds.  Really, the whole point of them is apt this new aptX lossless codec.  And I have to first find something that will play aptX lossless.  But that review will be part of hands on tech.  The re returned review show.  That's club only.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  Sorry to interrupt.  Sorry to do this.  But if if only a few percent right now, it's about one percent of the audience.  If five percent of the unsubscribed, we'd be golden.  That's all I need.  That's all I need.  Maybe you're one of the five percent time for our picks of the week.  Jason Snell kicker off, if you will.  Sure.

Transcript:  I have had a Mac server in my house forever.  Aren't you fancy?  Since the since the beige G three days.  And really, you know, I used to do very different things that I do now on the Mac server,  but I love having a Mac mini.  It's been a Mac mini for a long time now in my house.  However, if you don't know, like back in the day, Mac OS 10 server was a thing and Apple  built all these tools that would go on top of the Unix stuff that's in Mac OS and Mac OS 10  to do server stuff.  And over the years, Apple has gradually sloughed off every single one of those features.  They in the latest couple of versions, they don't even do, you know, Python's not in there.  And you like all of the scripting stuff is dropped and a lot of the server stuff is dropped.  There's very little left of that.  And I still run a web server on my for a bunch of stuff on my on my home server.  Anyway, I I just upgraded to an M2 Mac mini and that meant updating to beyond Mojave,  which is what I was on on my old server classic.  And all and it stripped away the last vestiges of anything that Apple built in of scripting  languages and and Unix servers and stuff like that.  And I decided finally to just not not keep migrating the same server I've been migrating  for 20 years, but instead embrace the new world.  And so instead of, you know, getting out, I mean, I installed homebrew, but like instead of  installing a million different things on the command line, I decided to I actually already  bought a license for it to do some WordPress testing thing called MAMP and MAMP Pro.  It basically MAMP.  It sounds like a horror movie monster.  But what it is is is Mac AMP in the sense of what is that Apache, MySQL, PHP.  Basically, it's an app with an installer and there's a pro version that has more features.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. But the idea here is that instead of doing all that, especially since Apple used to provide  graphical interface controls for all of these features and has abandoned it entirely, this is a  Mac installer that runs a web server and will run WordPress.  It will install PHP so you don't have to do it through homebrew or something like that.

Transcript:  Yeah, it is. In some ways, this this app reminds me so much of what Apple was trying to do with Mac OS  10 server back in the day, which is create a Mac app that has all that Unix server stuff behind it.  It was very easy. I was able to use Let's Encrypt to to get my own SSL certificate and it in a point it at  the certificate. And then it just worked.  You know, it was not it was a lot easier, let me tell you, than trying to install all of that software  and edit all those text files to get it to be exactly what I wanted.  So if you were thinking and I will say the number one reason I started using MAMP was because I was  doing WordPress development for Six Colors when we moved to WordPress and I needed a local server to do  that. And rather than I tried to install all the things that were required to get WordPress up and  running on my Mac.  And it was a nightmare.  And with MAMP, you literally turn it on MAMP Pro.  You turn it on and you say yes, WordPress, please.  And it's done. Can I still use my Mac if it's running?  Yeah, yeah, it runs in the background.  It's it's invisible. In fact, other than when you're administering it, it's just running.  It's just, you know, if it's your Mac, then if you restart it or sleep it or whatever, then your server  goes away. But but yeah, you can do it.  In fact, that's what I did. I spent an entire summer doing WordPress development where what I was doing  was on my on my Mac here on my desk.  I just had that as a local host server running WordPress so I could fix my templates and debug them  and do all of those things.  And it was a lot easier than trying.  I know if you're super Unix savvy, it's going to be second nature for you to install this stuff.  But if you're a Mac user who knows just enough to be dangerous, you know, you could be a little less  dangerous and use your Mac user skills by using this app instead.

Transcript:  Slightly controversial pick.  Now that I'm not going to recommend Ulysses again, but it is one of the signatures of 2023 is that I now have gone from,  oh, I should definitely like give Ulysses another deep dive because there's a lot of new features to this is now like the center of all of my creative work.  Almost completely just replacing Scrivener's.  I use Scrivener's Scrivener for some novels I'm working on, but that's about it.  And, you know, I can I always know when a certain like note taking app or writing app or whatever has reached that level of, you know, you know, like on in Toy Story when Andy writes his name on the bottom of one of the toys is feeding.  OK, hey, I'm officially accepted.  It's when I finally start to fine tune the editing environment to make it look exactly the way I want.  And so I've been playing with different monospace fonts.  I'm just like just like Jason.  I used to do most of my writing in BB Edit and sort of that's that's the environment that kind of put my puts my brain into, hey, I'm writing, writing, writing for duration, not just for fun.  And so I came across a fork of a fork of comic sans called Comic Mono.  And what they did what I like.  OK, first of all, it's monospace, but it's fine tuned to not look like comic sans so much as it looks a little bit like a friendlier version of Monaco for a friendlier version of like these monospace terminal fonts that I normally wind up going with.  And yeah, when you put it up at like an 18 points.  No, it doesn't look very good.  But at text editing size, it looks pretty nice.  And it's free.  Do you do the titles in Papyrus?  You know what?

Because it's very nice, sturdy, nice, sturdy.  It's all about it's all about the the character spacing.  It's all about new.  Helvetica new.  I mean, you know, but but but you know, but you know what I'm talking about where what I like about the editing environment that like that BB Edit threw me into is that it really when you're  just using Markdown for all your formatting, because yeah, I do need to throw some italics in there.  Sometimes I do need to throw headers into there.  It's nice to be able to say I don't care what I my mind gets distracted by.  Oh, you know what?  There's there's some space between the header and the following paragraph.  But I'd like there to be a little bit more space between whereas if I'm just using a monospace font and just tagging as I go, I don't care.  I just get to the words.  But that that isn't to say that you can't get something a little bit better than like a basic typewriter font for your terminal.  And I don't know if I'm going to keep it, but I like it.  And I will certainly I will certainly never print this out or share this in a PDF of anybody who has to read it.  But as someone who sometimes has to read like four or five, six thousand words worth of stuff that I just read before, like turning it to something that is going to be a PDF for the people to read.  It's a little bit more pleasant than like Menlo was my previous default.  And it's kind of a toss up between the two.  I actually like this a lot.  Yeah.  Comic mono has a little something about it.  Yeah.  Just a little bit of difference.

Transcript:  We actually had a you know, we had a discussion in office hours about it with someone who works in topography.  And she actually was talking about how readable Comic Sans is.  I mean, there you go.  It's actually a very readable font that that very specifically.  So while a lot of make fun of it, it actually has a certain power.

Start time: 8378.38

I'll make it bigger so you can see it.  Look at see, that's pretty.  That's pretty.  I think that looks nice.  I'm going to use that from now on.  Yeah.  Thank you, Andy.  Good choice.

Transcript:  So I was talking earlier about the little thing that I was doing in keynote.

Start time: 8428.38
End time: 8448.05
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Let me see if I can get this to see.  So this was this is what I was talking about before was this.  And the thing you want to know is these images are all made.  So this is this is all in mid journey.  But this is the cool thing with keynote is you go like this.  It keeps on ticking.  And then it goes like this.  And then it just these are all mid journey five point two generated.

Start time: 8449.20
End time: 8451.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, these are also my tip.  My pick is mid journey.

Start time: 8452.24
End time: 8611.18
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  This is this is all.  Everything is fine.  Or it's all that is.  This is fine.  Yeah.  With a with a minion.  You know, you know, despicable.  This is fine.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So anyway, five point two is out.  It's it's pretty slick.  You know, if we let me see if I can pop over to this is the interface here.  If you look at it here, one of the things you'll see now is this zoom out.  So you can zoom out one point five.  You can do a custom zoom.  You also can vary it a lot or a little.  So if something's close, but not quite right, you can do do a subtle variance,  whereas you can or you can do strong, which is kind of the normal one that they  have out there.  And you can build really fun things.  So this is the I think we were talking about a light seal earlier.  So I put the light seal in and you'll see me.  All I did was type it in and then I started zooming out and picking ones during  the commercial breaks.  And and so I started doing that.  And what I ended up with is just to give you a sense of this.  And this is just during the turner commercial breaks.  Everybody has a hobby.  And so this is mine.  And so here you have this kind of infinite zoom of I got to grab one of this.  So just keep zooming in to our seal.  You know, so basically I started here and now you'll see I look at the  screen and I'm like, oh, I'm going to do this.  Seal.  You know, so basically I started here and now you'll see a little edge.  I'd have to paint that out, but it's pretty close.  It would take very little to fix it.  This is what a lot of people are doing right now is doing these zoom outs.  But so as you start to zoom out, that's just so wild.  You're just stacking these images on top of each other.  And then it comes up with another seal.  You're like, it hallucinates.  Yeah, like, you pull out a little further.  There's no other seal.  So it's a good one.  Adding seals to it.  But but anyway, the point is, is that it's it's a really slick, you know, for a  lot of us who got a close up but really wanted something a little further back or  you didn't get the full, you know, gave you a waist up when you wanted the full  body shot.  All those things are now kind of doable and its quality is way higher again.  One thing that people are showing that I haven't gotten to work yet is the ability  to do paint in and then have it actually just build something.  This is new in Photoshop or at least they showed it in Photoshop where you can  basically take a big marker and just say this is green and this is blue and then  say, give me a valley and it'll just follow.  It'll just build that for you.  And that's they're showing that in Photoshop and some people say, no, that works in  mid-journey too.  I haven't got that to work yet.  But but the but five point two is, you know, it's a huge probably the biggest jump  since three to four.  I mean, or three to three point whatever to four.  So it's a it's a big jump forward.  So it's worth checking out a few.  It's beautiful images.  I mean, it's just it's yeah, it's crazy.  We'll just try it again.

Transcript:  It's like, yeah, you're playing a lot with the Photoshop in-fill feature.  But though that's like, oh, my goodness, this is this is the best kind of like exciting  technology, the kind of technology that might get a lot of people scared because it's so  easy.

Start time: 8634.20
End time: 8657.74
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So we do cool things with the cool thing is you start you can use the Photoshop in-fill  with five point with with mid-journey.  So what you do is you build the image in mid-journey, but you want to change a couple  things and you just select it in Photoshop and say put a screen here or put this here  and Photoshop will in-fill the it'll take the mid-journey image, but in-fill the new  thing that you asked for, but blended into, you know, the mid-journey thing that you started  with.  And so there's the two of them together.

Start time: 8658.53
End time: 8677.99
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Give me a mid-journey tip.  So I'm in our we have a mid-journey channel in our club, twit discord.  I'm and I slash settings to launch the mid-journey bot.  Look at my settings here.  I don't know how well you can see those, but I've got mid-journey five point two raw mode,  right?  Stylize medium, low, high, very high.  What do you like?

Start time: 8680.09
End time: 8726.18
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I leave it on medium and then I'll change it if I have to.  Yeah.  And then I leave the raw mode.  I don't leave on all the time because it's a little bit more.  I mean, it's a little more verbatim.  So the reason when I use raw, I'm usually generating the term.  I'm generating the prompt from chat GPT.  Right.  So what we have, we have a I'll put in a thing that tells it what I want.  Like in general, this is how to do it.  And I got this from Ken Jordan in office hours.  And so Ken sent me this thing that is like this long description of how to do chat GPT  or how to do mid-journey for chat GPT.  So you set that up in the chat GPT setting and then you say what you want and then it'll  build out and then it builds out.  So when I do that, oh, yeah, it builds the prompt.  Is that how you always do it?

Start time: 8726.30
End time: 8728.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You do chat GPT for the prompt?

Start time: 8728.20
End time: 8754.70
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  No, no, sometimes I just if I'm having trouble getting it done with my own prompts is when  I use chat GPT to see like chat GPT do with us.  And so so anyway, but the I mean, the big thing is, is picking cameras and sensors tends  to be really powerful.  So what's the thing that I got a couple of them.  It depends on what I'm shooting.  We've been using a lot of Alex's thumbnails.

Start time: 8756.61
End time: 8766.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you see the Windows Weekly thumbnail, it's Paul Theron and the dinosaur from last week.  It was quite good.  I liked it quite a bit.  Yeah, it's it's great for thumbnails.

Start time: 8766.46
End time: 8906.16
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I will say that this is it is a it is just a killer.  Let's see.  I use I have a lot of a seven s threes, you know, that I use.  I use that and do short depth of field.  I have one that I it's underwater that I use an EOS rebel.  You know, it's like and I steal these from other people like you see someone else.  You see an image that you like.  You go, what are they doing?  And then I copy their prompts and I have a notes in my Apple Notes.  I have my cheat sheet, which is just all the things that I that created something that I liked.  And I keep it there so that I can grab the pieces out of it.  Are eight.  But but like a panoramic view captured by a Canon R8 400 millimeter F five cinematic photography style.  And then and then I so I put something in front of that and then I put that in there and I get an image and I play with different ones.  But like an eight D8 50 DSLR 105, you know, with a two point eight lens.  I mean, now the interesting thing and I haven't had time to do this in five point two.  There's a shortened command inside of mid journey now where you put your prompt in and say shorten this and it'll shorten it.  But it'll also analyze it.  It'll say, hey, this is this is what I actually paid attention to.  So I'm learning because we've always had this thing like I don't know if those terms actually mean anything.  But within mid journey, you see them a lot. So I put them you put them in and you end up with these really long prompts to try to define something.  And now mid journey will tell you, yeah, I'm not paying attention to that.  These are the only things I was paying. This is this is what I do.  You gave me this big prompt and I took these things out.  So if you just so the so I think that there's a lot of things that we're you know that we're learning.  It's a it's it's moving at a fairly frightening speed.  You know, it's it's really it's it's an amazing and it's a lot of fun.  And I you know, I use both, you know, chat GPT and mid journey every day.  And I do a lot of presentations. And so all of my to make my presentations much more fun.  I use mid journey all the time over over a plain white background.  I'm just make objects. You like those backgrounds.  I know. Yeah, well, it's just that because I put it over, it makes it easy to put it over a keynote document.  And then you but you can have things appear and disappear and it just looks like they belong there.  And so I that's why I do it.  It's just the easiest thing to keep if you do it over a plain black background, by the way, it just becomes a really dark image.  So it's not very, you know, just very dark, you know. And so that's why I don't do that.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And the most interesting thing is, is that I mean, now the mid-journey now is like 17 million users on Discord or something like that.  And it goes so fast.  There's no conversation.  But at least I haven't seen a lot, but just looking at images and going, oh, I really like what they did there and taking them and I grab them and put them into somewhere.  I've gotten to the point where my mid-journey cheat sheet in notes has to become like a database, like search for this because I don't.  It's not. I have so many in there now.  It's not as useful. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 8975.20
End time: 8983.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 8984.40
End time: 8998.53
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. And they set it up so that the cost structure is different.  Like people like me pay for private.  So I don't like my stuff is all on my own.  But everybody else is like feed into that system all the time.  Or if you're paying just a little bit, you're always feeding into that system.  So it's a great way to learn.  OK, I made it more realistic.

He's actually holding an A7S.  No, it's a Canon.  Never mind.  But you want to you.  You kind of have to.  Like you do learn when you prompt, when you're prompting for chat GPT or prompting for mid journey, like every word that you put in there matters like it.  You know, because it's going to drive the whole.

Start time: 9051.26

Transcript:  And this is what I'm loving about this generative AI chatbots and everything is that it really is almost exactly what artificial intelligence sort of like what science fiction told us artificial intelligence would be like programming computers and using computers.  Where it's not so much writing code.  It's knowing how to speak in natural language to the computer so that what you're doing is clear.  Like remember, remember they seen in the sequel to 2001 where Bob Balaban's character is like try is explaining to the backup computer of the backup version of how that I'm going to run some tests.  Do you do you under do you remember what happened to how we'd like to figure out what happened to it?  Like do you what do you how do you think we should do that?  Yeah, I tried to.  So if I really hi, I'm going to unplug you just to see what happens and hope that when I pull you back in.  But if you but if you ask the right way, the computer will completely be on board and help you do that.  Yeah, yeah, it's it's a lot of fun.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's great.  You know, and it and I think that it you know, a lot of this we know is going to get a lot easier.  Like everyone will be able to do it and you will be much more real language.  But there's a there's a kind of an adventure right now of creating stuff.  And I will say, you know, I don't use other than my keynote stuff.  I don't use the images generally verbatim for anything that I work on.  But what I I do use it a lot for concept.  And as we start getting these paint in things where I can define where I want people and what I want them to look like, being able to just say, like, I just think we're going to see a lot of pitch decks for a movie or a concept where I can just throw those, you know, you know, a lot of things.  You know, a lot of times you build something mid-journey and you're like, I could build a whole movie around that.  You know, like, you know, it's it's one of those, you know, like the let's see if I can find it here.  Hold on.

Neat.  Like board games.  You know, it's trivia or or mind games or yeah, it's it's not board games so much because  it's audio only and board games kind of required the visuals.  But it's yeah, lots of different party games kind of stuff.  It's fun.
