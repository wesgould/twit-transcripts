[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's time for Mac break weekly. Alex and the and Jason Snell are all here lots to talk about.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   Yes, believe it or not, the new versions of all the Apple operating systems are out now.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.240]   The final betas before the next releases. There's also a big security update. Everybody should get
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.440]   a zero click flaw in messages has been patched. We'll talk about the rumors, including a new
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.960]   iMac with a bigger than 30 inch display. The Vision OS SDK is out some of the new features
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.360]   in the Vision Pro headset and Apple loses in the Supreme Court. It's all coming up next.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.480]   I'm Mac break weekly.

[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   the latest Mac news of which there is precious little. Jason Snell's back. How was graduation?
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.480]   Your kid is now a professional something. It worked. She graduated. Yeah. Yeah. It's great.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.320]   Nice. We have a good time. We missed you. We just happened to counter schedule us with
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.920]   Mac break weekly. I think that was the university's plan all along. It gave us a chance to get James
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.280]   Thompson on it. It was great to have him on catch up with him and talk about as a developer what he
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:20.880]   sees coming down the pipe with iOS 17 and Mac OS Sonoma. Also with us Mr. Andy and I co WG.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   The H Boston. Hello Andrew. Hey there Heather. Who there? That's all we have to say.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.160]   No questions. It's human. It's a human Tuesday here. No. I heard that it's pretty warm out there.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   Yes. I'm wearing a shirt. I think that shows an admirable level of commitment to a professional.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.720]   Brave man. Actually I really like your color coordination. Andy is wearing a gray shirt.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.320]   I'd say 30% gray. A black. Black.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.240]   Logolas hat that matches his Sony headphones. No I was a little embarrassed last week. I was in
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.640]   town to I was in Boston. We're doing a GBA in the studio and so I had like a nice shirt on and a tie
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   and a little thing thrown over that but then was hot. So I turned so I took those off and then I
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.840]   realized that I was wearing like black sneakers black pants black t-shirt.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.800]   Like oh dear Reverend Andy is is enjoying the summer in Boston isn't it?
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.920]   On the radio no one knows you're a priest. It's good. I try not to make that let that happen.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.760]   Ninja I would say ninja Andy instead. And also with Alex Lindsey we had a good dose to Alice on
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.080]   Sunday on Twitter if you haven't heard it he was fantastic. Great to have you back.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   In your regular seat? Yeah it was a good it was a good show. Really enjoyed it. It was also
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.520]   almost a record holder three hours. We had Jason Delray on who wrote a book really interesting
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.680]   book called Winter Cells All about Amazon versus Walmart. A lot of really interesting stuff about
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.720]   Walmart among among other things. Anyway fun conversation if you didn't get it here.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.000]   Twit 933 tune in for more Alex but Alex is here today to talk Apple as we all are.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.840]   Just as we went to press I say that for you Jason since you're the old print guy.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.920]   Breaking news. Breaking news every press. Beta versions.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.560]   Copy Boy standby. Don't listen here. I got a new headline for page one. Are you ready?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.520]   Get the copy. Boi in here. It's right on the front page here. Apple seeds fourth beta of
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:46.480]   Mac OS Ventura 13 5 fourth betas of 16 6 iOS 16 6 iPad OS TV OS updated. I have an Apple TV in my
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.960]   office. I don't use very much so I turned it on and wasn't was acting kind of funky. It was still
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.680]   on version 14 so I updated it all the way to 16 which took the rest of the day.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.960]   You can update again if you are on the beta and I did turn on the beta. Beta on TV OS seems a fairly
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:16.400]   minor thing. Watch OS fourth beta of 9.6. All of this sounds like new versions are coming
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.240]   imminently right. How many betas do they do of a version? Four seems like the limit.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.160]   Yeah this is a cleanup right. This is probably the last cleanup of the existing OS versions before
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:38.240]   they put them off on the ice flow but yeah it seems like it's close now. It's going to be that
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.640]   there goes Ventura floating away in the ice flow. Yeah because Sonoma is coming.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.600]   Yeah that's right. We are I think the number one Apple podcast in Sonoma County so.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   I hope so. I think we're the only probably. I imagine if like Mac OS can drop sitting is like
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:08.000]   oh I got you. Damn it. Where you live? Damn it. Anything to say about these betas they're
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.200]   cleanups. They don't add features or turn things on or anything like that.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.280]   Yeah I imagine it's it's either things that they yeah they have to flip a switch or make some very
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.080]   slight adjustments or bring things to a gentle resting place. Not that they won't update them
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.760]   further but those updates are going to increasingly be about like emergency bug fixes and security
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.440]   updates because they're pretty much parked right like everybody at Apple has really been working on
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.360]   the new OS versions for you know six months now and now they're in crunch time so.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:43.360]   The other thing that happened since I left to go to Disneyland and VidCon what a combo you know
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.840]   VidCon was actually had more characters than more people in costume than Disneyland did which is
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.000]   saying something although they should have taken a picture of it. They have a big poster right
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.880]   outside of VidCon which is a convention for video creators TikTokers you to rethink that.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.520]   They have a big cosplay rules thing you can't bring a stick you can't hide your face they're
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.160]   all these cosplay rules I don't know if that's normal now a comic con and and stuff pretty much
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.360]   is it it's for safety right. The anime cosplayers often have these like I'm not joking like six foot
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.160]   long like swords that they carry over their shoulders and after two hours they're not really
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.040]   paying attention to what happens when they turn and so they had to be there's all kinds of rules on
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.400]   thing on length of length of weapons length of prop rank length of props also fake anything that
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.640]   could be mistaken for an actual weapon or used as an actual weapon you have some people who are
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.720]   like clip who are smart enough to say hey I just got I got this beautiful like antique sword that
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.800]   looks makes my pirate costume look great yeah you're bringing like a three foot long edged weapon
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.040]   into a public space maybe that's not a good thing yeah I would I know it'll be it'll be here with
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.400]   your coat when you come back out I didn't mind there were still plenty of people in costume it
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.080]   turns out though I didn't the VidCon which is at the Anaheim convention center we were there
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.000]   because Lisa was on a panel which was great she did a great job but it turns out that wasn't the
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.600]   place to be at VidCon the Hyatt hotel which was several blocks away was where all the creators
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.680]   they didn't even bother going to the show all the creators are hanging out at the hotel
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:23.280]   fantastic the CEO of TikTok came but he didn't come to the convention he went to the Hyatt and
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:30.240]   and and hung out of the hospitality suite there so it's all about the collabs baby the collabs yeah
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:37.680]   I'm just I felt so old and out of I mean I was an influencer back when influencers were made out
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:45.440]   of wooden stone uh to see I mean it's really interesting and what's how what's interesting
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.720]   how how niche it is now you know which is good I mean we're niche obviously uh and and what's
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.920]   also interesting is that the some of them might be that they're only 28 years old or 30 years old
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.840]   but they've been doing it almost as long as we have I know like they a lot of them they started
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.160]   when they were eight or 10 or 12 you know you know they they they started very early although the
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.880]   big guys you know mr. Beast didn't go you know the big mark has brown link didn't go because this
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.840]   was a scheduling error who would have thought can lion which is in france is the big upfront for
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.080]   streaming video all of these big shots were including Emma Chamberlain and we're in france
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.160]   because it conflicted with vidcom what a dumb idea to have vidcon the same week as
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.240]   but I guess I'm betting nobody at vidcon scheduling this two years ago thought can lion why would
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.560]   anybody I think it was actually another vidcon at the same time as vidcon and there was like
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.160]   another I think a vidcon in Baltimore or something or near it it's gotten too big it's gotten too big
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.800]   anyway I really I quite enjoyed both that and disneyland but that's not what we're here to talk
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.040]   about what one of the things that happened I was starting to say and didn't finish the
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:02.320]   sense while I was gone is the vision pro sdk the software development kit came out which means we
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:11.280]   learned some things right the vision os sdk a lot of people now now the people have to the ability
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.640]   to actually run vision os inside the simulator they're learning things like oh wow there's actually
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.440]   spotlight search in here and wow here's what the keyboard actually like works and looks like
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.040]   and we're finding out a whole bunch of other tidbits like a couple separate stories about how
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:35.040]   like okay so now that the that the vision pro will stop will stop working if you are in motion
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.680]   to a certain degree to prevent people I don't know from like using it while driving or operating a
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   vehicle there is a safety there's a safety zone of something like 10 feet like when you're in a
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.800]   fully immersive environment that you're inside a box it's about 10 feet across to again to prevent
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.240]   you from I don't know what you're wondering on a window or something like that lots of little
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.920]   little details that we haven't been figuring out before but there is a traveling switch you can
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.240]   flip says I'm on an airplane and I'm watching a movie so they clear you know we learn a lot about
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.840]   what I think some people Alex correct me from wrong but I got the sense from some people's
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.160]   social media posts that people who spend a lot of time working with AR kit were a little
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.520]   disappointed to see that a lot of the work that they had done would not be able not be applicable
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:26.000]   to vision pro did I did I get that right well yes and no so um so what I would say by that by
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.960]   that is that all the work that you do in these areas yeah it may not AR kit may not line up as
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.680]   far as the code goes but understanding how things work of course understanding things you have to
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.720]   think about but that's from a coding perspective that's in my opinion a lot more important is the
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.040]   understanding of how to interact with things I'm writing that you know writing the code is going
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.480]   to be a little bit more work but but I think that you also don't want them to be trying to figure
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.600]   out how to be backward compatible is something they thought was going to work three years ago
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.520]   exactly so so I think but but I think that the what I've learned over you know doing a lot of
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:03.440]   immersive work over the last I mean 25 years is that doing a lot of it means that you understand
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:09.680]   what you should do next and the coding stuff for us you know the shooting the footage or
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.160]   building the footage you can start thinking in that terms and that that has been far more useful
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.520]   than learning any individual tool or process did you get to play with reality composer pro
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.440]   which was also released with the SDK you know I haven't played with it yet I have watched a
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.200]   lot of videos on it and we're going to be doing some stuff in office hours with it you know to
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.720]   yeah we're going to have some labs where we really dig into it it's really powerful like
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.120]   and watching the videos has me really excited about it probably the best I think I mentioned it
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:46.480]   before probably the best nodal nodal system that I've ever seen just no kidding pure pretty like just
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.400]   it is like a lot of these are that we use are fairly functional but no one really thinks about
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.160]   only apple would like worry about exactly how the little nodes are connected and exactly you know
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.080]   how everything gets fit together so on that I'm sure that's just as functional as unreal engine or
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.080]   or any of the other ones it's it's functional but it's it's just looks it looks nice as someone
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.520]   used to have to design those nodes I I immediately opened it up and I was like oh it's uh I wish I
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:20.080]   thought of that that looks really nice so is so the idea is you can import your 3d stuff
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.600]   yeah you can set up a lot of fun to X code right yeah you can set up a lot of functions that
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.160]   you're going to hand back to X code so basically in reality composer you're able to build your
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.040]   scenes that would be really arduous to do with your code and so you can build out the scenes and
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.320]   things that need to be triggered but those can all be kind of put together and visualized and you
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.840]   know and and kind of worked out inside of this this environment and it's got you know adding
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.800]   surfaces and particle systems and lighting and working with the models and placing them in place
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.360]   you know and all that can be set up inside of this environment and it's a again it's what's missing
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.200]   in a lot of the other immersive environments was really good tools to kind of put that together
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:08.960]   that aren't just unreal and unity right and it'll import USDZ and other assets and and then
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:15.200]   work you working with X code to make it a program with these assets right so it's got all the hooks
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.880]   in there so you're basically building something that has hooks available that you're going to be
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:26.720]   able to call for X code yeah okay so we got our first look at that it's going to but the the
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.040]   weird thing is going to be that people all these developers are going to be writing really cool
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.240]   apps that will work for this simulator but they it's going to be at least a year before they figure
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.840]   out is this going to have they placed objects too close to the viewport too far away from the view
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:47.360]   port how comfortable is this app going to be to use for more than 10 minutes 20 minutes an hour two
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:53.120]   hours and that's still it's still one of the big unanswered questions of of the vision pro is
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.960]   how long is anybody going to be able to use this given the given the limits of VR as they've implemented
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:05.760]   I don't know I mean some of the developers will get units right like everything we're hearing
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.840]   is that next month they're going to have these developer kitchens basically in six major cities
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.400]   where people can come who are developers and use it and then they've said they've been up front
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.480]   and saying that they're going to open you know the ability to get a developer unit and you're
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.400]   going to have to apply and you're going to have to it's obviously going to be limited in fact I
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   think the phrase they use is your team which implies that like maybe James Thompson need not
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.200]   apply I don't know but he's a solo developer yeah under what I've heard is that the hardware is
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.000]   pretty final and that the reason that it's not shipping is twofold one they can't make enough of
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.880]   them and two the software is not all there yet but if the hardware is pretty final then the developer
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.720]   kits will probably be pretty real and so developers may in fact be the first people outside of apple
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.520]   to have a realization about how long can they go using this thing now that's not the whole wide
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.400]   world and the developer pool you know is not as diverse as the whole wide world even the whole
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.360]   wide world of purchasers at this product but I feel like we're going to start getting a sense
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.840]   if they're in d8 it'll be through the grapevine but I think we'll start getting a sense later this
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:19.440]   year from developers and other people who've used it who are actually able to sit there for two three
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:26.720]   four five hours and say either it's fine or it's terrible and well have a better idea I did hear
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.080]   some complaint from the open source community that apples tools swift ui reality kit arkit
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:40.480]   reality composer compro are all proprietary and there exist analogs in the open source world i'm sure
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:46.400]   Alex you have a rebuttal to that i don't think apple cares but you know this is there this is
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.440]   you know you know do i right now like like i don't think the bana tree right i mean the bottom line
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.640]   is is that that you know trying to like in open source now you have the ganoo license that is a
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.440]   huge problem if you start building the apps that you want to sell um and so having you know
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:09.360]   incorporating like everything that i every large company that i um work for i have to sign a contract
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.160]   that says i will not use any open source software like it is literally like in every contract you
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   will you'll do all this other stuff and you will not use any open source software in any part of
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.880]   the development of doing this because of the of the way the licensing works and and so they
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.560]   don't want to have any most most for for profit companies don't want to have any part of using
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:34.400]   um you know anything with a with an open source license and so so sure but that you know and apple
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.360]   you know is going to build something that's going to work on their platform and they they don't
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.440]   they're not worried about other they're not really worried about interoperability except for unity
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.320]   you know they're and that allows them to innovate and move as fast as they want to move this is a
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.120]   brand new thing why would they tie themselves into the past yeah i don't see any upside for them yeah
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:57.440]   i just want to give you a chance to say that yeah yeah i think i'm sure the other thing at least at
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.280]   at least there's uh there was some report i think put in the show notes that it's going to support
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:08.080]   like 3d web technology so it's the web xr yeah the big star what is web xr is that
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:16.880]   is that a a pixar standard uh no it's what's interesting is and what you can always see from a
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.440]   company when they when they do this is that they are um they company wants to control everything
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.400]   that makes them different and commoditize anything that is just a cost of production and so oh by the
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.320]   way under if you have your uh highlighter with you underline that sentence that you just said
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:41.440]   because that is really a fundamental concept uh in all of this say it again else so any company
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.640]   all the companies they want to control the things that make them different so they want absolute
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.360]   control over those and they want to commoditize anything that increases their cost of production
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.120]   or or makes it harder that they're not going to do and so you can tell when a company
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.160]   wants things to be open source when apple wants to make things open source that's something they
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.640]   want to commoditize they want to let somebody else do the work and because it's not a different
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.560]   indicator it doesn't it doesn't help the planet also yeah it's not going to be something that
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.360]   they care about in the future so like hls they made they made they created hls right and they made
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.800]   it widely available because they need to be able to stream to those things and they want everybody
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.880]   to use it and so we'll make it free and make it easy for everybody to use and when i say open
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.840]   source i mean they they may open source it or they may make it just free but they're going to you know
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   they don't want a lot what apple didn't want is a lot of other formats streaming out
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.880]   so because then they have to support them and so by having one that is really good and now even
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.640]   now we have to think about it you know hls and dash and so and so forth and so so anyway the um you
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:47.200]   know so you'll see uh you know the um you know the web they are web webxr i think it's most
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.720]   i think yeah webxr tools um are are part of that also they're not like apple is they're they're
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:20:00.080]   streaming they're doing the streaming is the mv hvc um so that is a but that's a standard and
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.840]   that standard has been around since i think 2015 although not a lot of people have used it because
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.720]   just as that standard came out 3d kind of felt the bottom fell out of 3d at the time 3d just
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.960]   keeps on coming up like every couple years we go oh like right now there's this huge rush all of
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.760]   us are trying to find um 3d rigs you know those camera rigs that we were using for all those 3d
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.600]   films suddenly everyone's trying to like who's got the rigs like there's warehouses of people that
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.840]   have fortunately kept a couple rigs that were all yeah we're talking about that you have that
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.800]   what is it thirty thousand dollar uh oh so there's a six-hind you i have a sixty thousand
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.960]   dollar ozo right there um i don't even know what to work though it's like like i don't like i
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:39.680]   haven't turned it on for a long time but the uh and it's uh but there's these big rigs that they
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.760]   use for film that were like sixty thousand dollar rigs and now they're like ten thousand and then
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.040]   there's the cannon i think um they i don't know they must have known something was going to happen
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:56.160]   but there they have the the r5c with a dual lens on it and um it can't stream but a bunch of us
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.600]   like i was kind of surprised that cannon uh when they came out i was like why are they releasing
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.480]   that camera now it makes more sense because that's going to be a great acquisition tool for um you
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.120]   know for the for the headset so the um so anyway so there's a couple you know a lot of us are trying
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:17.920]   to figure those things out but the mv h hvac um format is basically give me a heroi so this is
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.880]   let's say my left eye is my heroi and then give me the second eye is going to be compressed into
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.000]   the heroi so that means that it saves space you're not sending two whole frames to somebody for stereo
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.440]   it only just does the delta for the right eye if if the left eye is hero but if you only have 2d
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.880]   if you're washing on your phone you just see the left eye you know and so those are the kind of
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.120]   things that but that makes it you know more efficient you know in that process and so
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.840]   that's that's the kind of thing that's a standard that's mpeg you know like it's not a it's not
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.360]   something that apple's making up and you can tell that apple doesn't want to make up things that
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:54.240]   it wants everybody using so that it's easier for it to do but it does want to control its code
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.440]   but kind of how you build it out and if they if they're supporting this in the web that means that
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.440]   like if in five years from now as alice keeps saying Alex keeps saying the ability to like see
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.720]   what this IKEA bookcase looks like in your house it becomes a thing it's it would be very very much
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.760]   improved if you could do it through the web rather than oh by the way oh yes we can
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.840]   want to see what this looks like in your living room download and install this app which will
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.160]   only take x amount of time I mean this if this does become a world standard that's it's a very
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:30.640]   cheap way for apple to make this to take the advantages of a world that uses 3d in the web
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.960]   without actually having to commit to like uh dumbing itself down to meta's idea of uh three
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:45.280]   yeah and and the uh by the way like with amazon if you have if you go through amazon on your phone
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.960]   and you look at for a trick because i'm replacing something underneath my um tv right now that
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.560]   whatever the thing is it will say hey do you want to see this in your in your scene all you
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.600]   got to do is click on the little button and move your camera back and forth a little bit and boom
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.320]   it pops right into your living room so that stuff is already yeah and a lot of people have been built
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.160]   amazon had a whole team in in uh building that for quite some time so so anyway so the uh so that's
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.680]   been in the works for a couple years and it's it's already available on the phone obviously it'll
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.160]   be more useful on the in the headset but it also means that if you go to any web page supporting the
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   web uh the web VR or AR um or xr those web pages when you open them on a web page inside of your
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.360]   apple you can just click on it and rotate it around and you'll see it in 3d so it's uh it'll be it's
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.560]   gonna be pretty that makes it as andy said it's it makes it much easier for a lot of folks that
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.720]   don't believe in what apple's doing to publish something that it just happens to work on the
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:44.080]   headset already it's been out six days there are already apps i'm more head a list of
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.720]   developers are only working on apps for vision pro here are five we love
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.760]   uh it's a gold rush it's a gold rush yeah yeah for especially for the first ones that are out there
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.560]   um you know we don't know how well they'll work but the but you have a bunch of people that spent
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.680]   at some point will have spent thirty five hundred dollars and spending another five on an app or
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.240]   ten dollars on an app to see how it works especially when a large number of more developers than just
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.480]   trying to figure out what it works how it works and what it does they're probably going to spend
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.000]   you know so if you're one of those first apps that's being recommended if you're one of the first
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.480]   apps that gets a little press if it looks if it gets a little push you know it's not like you're
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:27.200]   gonna make ten bucks it's gonna be millions you know like you know it's and i've talked to other
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.520]   developers that have done this in the past where they launch things right out of the gate and you
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.880]   know they have a quarter million dollar week now let me not see anything after that but it's like
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.360]   it's like a bunch money came in so so i think that you're gonna see a lot of that a lot of people
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.320]   trying to be in that first tranche and that first tranche will probably last about a year i bought
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.360]   a ton of stuff is what other people when i got that question go go ahead
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.720]   no just or at minimum to basically advertise to the world that hey look i know how to do how
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.240]   to program apps for this thing perhaps you should hire me for quarter million dollars and give me
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.440]   dental and medical care i mean james toda was on a week ago the next day the sdk comes out
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:08.640]   peacock is already available yeah well i mean he got it up and running as the ipad app and then
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.840]   got it up and running in the simulator as a as a native app but you know i i would say a lot of
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.360]   the developers especially the indie developers who are gonna be showing up in these kinds of
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.480]   stories and are posting their things to social media they are just really enthusiastic about
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.720]   being able to take their skills as an apple platform developer to a new platform yeah and
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.680]   figure out where it's applied so i would say that the primary thing driving most of what i've seen
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:39.280]   is not like i want to be seen or i want i mean it's a gold rush to just be noticed
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:44.160]   months before the product ships right it's not there's not a lot of value there but a lot of
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:50.480]   these people are like oh my app does x can that be a vision pro app and like exploring and they're
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.600]   doing it in public which i think is a lot of fun but like steve trent and smith who does streaming
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.640]   audio app called broadcast like he showed me a video it was on mastodon where he's like he's
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.280]   taking his little player and and i keep kept saying like i want it to like turn into a radio
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.360]   essentially that i can put anywhere and he's got like a minimized view of it that he's been working
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.240]   on where you can put it on a table in your kitchen and then wherever you are you can hear it playing
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.280]   in the kitchen which is really cool and like i think there's a lot of enthusiasm right now
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:26.640]   among people who are already invested in this uh this these platforms the apple platforms
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.120]   trying to figure out uh what their soft what their existing software does i think that there will
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.800]   also be a way of people writing new software but like this is that first little rush it's like when
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.520]   the ipad came out where it's like oh can i get it up and running on the ipad and like they're
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.920]   just enthusiastic about it is it catalyst i mean is it a catalyst like environment that they're
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:51.120]   using i mean no i think the ipad app it's literally ipad app emulation they're literally just running
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.160]   it it just as you would on a mac you're running on the native ipad app unchanged and then they make
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.280]   some changes and then do a build target for vision os and that gives you the frosted glass look and
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.040]   all of that which is not there you can tell when you're using an ipad app because it looks like an
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:12.320]   ipad so this is the biggest stuff in frosted glass broadcasts on the vision pro sdk yeah and you
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.600]   can see that the that big screen in the background that's just the ipad app and then he's popped out
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:25.680]   into a player into the 3d space so yeah that's cool it's not what you know it's it's not they're
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.720]   working on it they're working i want to show it i want a 3d i want a 3d like object i want to
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.360]   think that looks literally i can i can pull out a thing that looks like a radio and set it somewhere
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.480]   yeah exactly and that's my broadcast player right i i'm intrigued by the idea of like apps as physical
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.200]   objects since we we're getting like super skeuomorphic here like let's do it i want to see
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.800]   uh if if you're an audio player like steve tran spiss uh broadcast uh i would love to see
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:56.240]   literally physical object i could set somewhere when you when you when you work through the channels
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.640]   that's not working up bleb du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du du
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:04.240]   i mean as the more skeuomorphic the better i think that's interesting it is it does it cause
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:10.160]   for aschemorphism doesn't it uh as apple has abandoned it but yeah but i don't know if that's ever
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.880]   was it's it i don't know that that's never really trans is it transitional we've had
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.320]   andy or is it we've had long term i think i think that everybody's gonna have to have their chainsaw
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.240]   moment with this you know where you you get your first chainsaw the first thing and everything you
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:30.080]   want to do in life is cut things with this chainsaw and so i think that as people start to write their
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.280]   own virtual reality apps with with vision pro it's the natural thing is wow i've got a podcast
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.720]   player that should actually look like a radio and i should be able to i should be able to put it on
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:45.360]   top of any physical surface uh in the real world around me but it's i think it's gonna take a little
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.560]   while for everybody to kind of settle down and realize that that's cool that's wonderful that's
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:56.720]   a really great demo it's not the most convenient way to access and to be using i don't i i know
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.880]   you're really really happy about the the fact that you've used uh the the virtual soundstage so that
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.360]   when you turn to the left or when you back away from the the virtual radio the placement of it in
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.600]   the sound field moves and the volume moves but actually i just want to be able to listen to it
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.680]   very very clearly no matter where my focus is yeah we don't know yeah i mean we have i mean
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:20.240]   remember that the magic app like the that that first like pre newton message pad control was
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.120]   it was completely skewmorphic where they used the paradigm of hey here is your house here is your
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.320]   here is your inbox tray on your desk hey look here is the let's go into the living room where you've
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.520]   got your radio and again it was a really cool demo and it kind of made sense on some sort of
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:41.760]   Vulcan logic way but then again when you give people or here is a menu with a list of five items and
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.160]   you simply click on the one that you want to use let's see how long people use this
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.400]   chemorphism beyond like the first week or two but the main thing is that what's what what's
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.240]   important is to throw it up against the wall because a lot of times there are so many things that
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.240]   uh that i've been asked to do by someone who doesn't do what i do a lot and i go oh that's never
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.160]   gonna work like that is like we had one with Richard Branson and he wanted to do things in the in
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.000]   the round he wants to do these he wants to do his part he wants to do his his conversation instead
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.320]   of on stage and i was like there was a lot of me going hey that is we there's a reason there's a
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.760]   stage on one side on our cameras on the other you're gonna see our cameras this is all gonna work
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.040]   it's gonna look totally chaotic and i did it we did it because you know he was gonna do what he's gonna
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:26.800]   do and um you know like he just he listened to us a million years always have the right of way
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.520]   and then we're gonna do it this way and and the thing is is that and we did it and now i won't do
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.480]   it any other way like i will like it was so magical to have people in a round talking to each other
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.400]   that we've slowly figured out how to make it way better than what we had done originally but but
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.040]   it was it was a beginner's mind you know it was someone going in and going i don't know i know that
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.640]   you've always done it this way but i want to do it some other way and about half 75 percent of the
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:58.560]   time it's horrible i do 25 percent of the time being kind it's and uh but 25 percent of the time
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.040]   you end up with something magical that you didn't know and so i think that the unknowing of it of
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.320]   and i think that's what people are in right now is they're just gonna throw things up like what
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.040]   does this look like and does the radio work and does this thing go and and i and that's why it's so
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.200]   important for developers to get into it now and to have because right now they're still gonna figure
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.280]   out the architecture like how do i tie in my reality composer pro into those so there's a whole
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.440]   bunch of subsystems that you have to figure out on how all those things are going to work inside
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.160]   the simulator so that when you put the headset on all those things you know how to do all the other
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.280]   things and now you're going into i don't feel right or i feel sick or this is too high or this is to
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:40.000]   go and apple i will say i'm kind of amazed if you watch the wwc videos the level of detail that apple
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.040]   gives you around the design you know like you want all your interfaces slightly below i mean with
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.720]   all things that we've said in the past those of us who've done it but i've never seen anyone put
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.960]   it in training of all you know you want your head to look just a little bit down at things rather
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.840]   than up or you'll get tired and and there's a lot of these things that apple has has figured out for
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.680]   folks at least to give them a guy to where to start and so it's it's going to be interesting it's
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.440]   going to be an exciting time next year when the when the headset comes out that's really cool
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.400]   let's say Steve Travsmith did this development in public and you interacted with him
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:17.760]   uh in it but he yeah he was he was posting a mastodon as he discovered a feature what you know as he
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:23.840]   got an image he would post you know while i have a little downtime of getting the tv os apple look
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:30.480]   to see what i can port over i i actually really liked let me scroll down look at all these screenshots
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:37.440]   he put up i really liked this one this is uh a mini player kind of embedded on the desktop yeah
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.560]   so this is close to what you're talking about yeah yeah and and to Andy's point i think he's right
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:49.360]   like we don't know we we just don't know is this a novelty that will wear off or i think it's you
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:56.240]   could argue are these two-dimensional planes in a 3d space gonna be like oh what were we thinking
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.560]   two-dimensional planes that's so old thinking right like i think the truth is somewhere in the
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.960]   middle that there gonna be some uses for the spatial you know and and they're gonna be somewhere it's
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.720]   it's irrelevant and we're gonna have to figure it out but i i love the idea that you've got some
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.400]   smart software developers who immediately are leaping in and saying like okay what what do i do
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:20.480]   with this that is not literally just my ipad app floating in a two-dimensional window in space right
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.760]   because that's gonna come down to whether people live in this or not and i don't think generation
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.960]   one they're gonna live in uh battery life is a long enough for one and you can't move around yeah but
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:37.600]   in time if they do get an ar spectacle uh of some kind where you're kind of wearing it all the time
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.040]   you'll want these 3d images you you will want them to show up uh you know let's go in the kitchen i
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:49.760]   have the radio there you i think that that's a natural uh form of augmented reality it's just
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:55.520]   the form factor for the vision pro doesn't lend itself to that you know forever but right some of
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.440]   these developers i think are also thinking they're gonna play a long game just like absolutely
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.760]   absolutely just to understand the language you're speaking and what the issues are and then
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.160]   and then take your time and grow and learn from there risk and we don't know how long it's gonna take
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.320]   to get we don't know how long we don't know how long it's gonna take but we have a pretty good
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.800]   idea of how long apple's gonna work on it and that's this distinction between apple and google is
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.120]   that with google you're like if this doesn't turn out in six months or a year we don't know if it'll
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.440]   make it to the next i.o you know like where or maybe it gets to one i.o and maybe not the second i.o
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.200]   you know that kind of thing and that's been a real problem that google has had which is
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.760]   this idea of just killing things off means that people have to put development time in they don't
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.640]   know with apple you're pretty sure that they spent the last six or seven years working on this they're
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.200]   probably gonna spend at least the next five you know kind of cranking through it and i think that
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:48.960]   that's a distinction even things that were you know probably didn't turn out well like final
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.160]   got 10 from a PR perspective they're still with you know 10 years later or more than 10 years later
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:04.560]   yeah yeah you know that's what i'm waiting for hoping for and if the vision as skeptical as i've
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.800]   been about the vision pro it was of that particular form factor if the vision pro continues like
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:16.880]   progress it's a good time and steve john smith is all in on apple right so he's not gonna go
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.520]   to skill set that's what he does platform developers so this is why would you not and James
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.200]   Tom's Tom's way right like like why would you not what James i had known James for like 25 years now
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.880]   and i will tell you like one of the great skills that James has is whatever apple does
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:37.200]   whatever is new and you heard this last week he takes it off the shelf and immediately starts
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.520]   playing with it and there's this question like can i do something with this what can i do and it's
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.040]   not everybody is going to be like that but it's really interesting to see somebody who's like oh
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.160]   i have new colors that i can paint with now let's experiment and i love that on mastodon we're
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.040]   seeing them do it out in the open like literally like what can we do and they only got the simulator
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.000]   they don't have any hardware to try but they're already kind of like just trying to figure out
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.680]   what's the metaphor that works what doesn't work what work and do i have to do it's pretty
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:09.360]   awesome to see it that's the joy of being an individual developer like steve or james or a
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.960]   small team like rich segal where you it's part of the fun of it is oh look we got a whole new
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:21.120]   toy kit a whole new sandbox let's let's play with it and you know you don't have a the impetus
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   of a large corporation saying well okay but first finish you know the login code for
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:30.320]   our banking app it's it's professional development happening basically is what we're seeing is like
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.360]   these guys are professional apple developers and they are learning new skills and yeah if they
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.280]   were working in a big company the big company would be like uh uh go back to your app
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.280]   and balls and trolls go back to work i'm sure james is steve and rich all look forward to this
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.480]   i mean i think it's fun when it's like getting a new car it's great and there's definitely big
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:53.840]   companies that are building little teams around us right now so lucky developers you know they're
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.840]   like your kids figure out yeah embedded in a big company we'll get to play with it just not
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.480]   everybody yeah uh the other good side of this is it is stimulating the competition you know this
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:09.200]   what you always want uh meta is not sitting still they're they're scrambling as fast as they can to
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.720]   be prepared for the release of vision pro uh as you remember they announced a thinner lighter
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:21.600]   less expensive uh quest they this week announced a subscription model kind of like uh microsoft's
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:29.440]   uh game pass game pass yeah uh two games a month you get to keep them as long as you're a subscriber
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.840]   the uh initial subscription is one dollar a month but i think it ends up getting to
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:40.160]   eight dollars a month they're sixty bucks a year uh but that's one triple a title a year that's a
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.280]   reasonable cost and it means you'll get two new games every month for your meta quest or your quest
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:51.360]   pro uh or your question i'm sure there will be apple arcade for the vision pro at standpoint right
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.720]   yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i wonder are they are they seating arcade developers saying we would
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:02.240]   love a game to ship uh come oh yeah early next year i mean i think i think that they didn't want
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:06.160]   it to become i i think that we saw very little games we probably will continue to see very little
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.560]   games because they want to make it a computing platform not a gaming platform but obviously games
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.520]   will be a big piece of what people want to do with it well it is ironic that that is the number one
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:22.000]   application for everybody else's is it for the vibe for the quest oh yeah the only one it's not
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.840]   for is the number one do you think Netflix and entertainment yeah yeah watching watching watching
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.400]   movies on on your headset is usually the number one thing that people do with their headset do
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   people really do that because that's it's measured and measured in time yeah
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:42.160]   looks so it's it's like i mean i would myself are a little old so far but for a nice
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:48.320]   seventy seven inch cutie but i'll let screen ten feet away that fills my vision and i can have
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.920]   an off plane on a plane do you see it on a plane a lot oh you don't travel what am i i i see it
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.560]   where you know i've done it on a plane i've watched on i've watched movies on planes i have never seen
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:06.320]   anybody wearing a nerd helmet on a plane but okay oh you will yeah you will especially especially
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.560]   with the apple headset there's going to be people who are a that much into it that they're going to
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.600]   be wearing it in places where it would be socially disadvantageous to actually wear it and also you
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.400]   gotta be you gotta flash it man you gotta flaunt it baby you can have it first class it'll be two
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.720]   hours into every flight half a first class will have little heads you do see a lot of iPads on
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:30.080]   flights tons of them uh yeah in fact a lot of airlines have just abandoned their ins their
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.960]   that's because the seat is so close in economy that you can't open your laptop so that's all you
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.000]   can do is open your iPad yeah exactly well we're seeing all these really interesting demos what
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.480]   we're not seeing is thank god my finally i can i can create the virtual reality version of my
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:49.680]   outliner app it's like it's this is another thing that that we're going to be paying really close
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.520]   attention to that apple uh i i think that apple has is going to struggle at least initially to
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:01.280]   defend the oh no no we're not virtual reality in xxr we are we are we are we are spatial we are the
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:07.520]   first spatial computing platform but i think they got a ways to go before they show anybody that
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:13.360]   yes you're going to want to you're going to want to uh to run excel oh you're gonna you're gonna want
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.320]   to actually like do three hours of productivity with this thing on when you're not like in economy
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.400]   and absolutely forced to do so it's i mean it's yeah i mean make the case that this is going to be
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.840]   better than it's better than what we use the iphone for for productivity where we'll use it in a
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.400]   pinch we'll use it because you know it's inconvenient to use a real thing or we don't have the real
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:38.160]   thing with us but to make it into something that i would prefer to use the the uh the vision pro
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.040]   to my laptop or anything else that's going to be a big big leap forward when they make it well i
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.840]   think that i mean i have the luxury of i've got a lot of screens in front of me that people don't
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:53.120]   see and and uh i have the luxury of having a room that i can do that in but in a lot of places people
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   may not have that and and whether that's in the office or not i think that there's going to be
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.800]   a fair number of people that i again i think that the first one might you know again apple has to
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.120]   get something out so that to get back to what we were talking about earlier developers have to
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:08.880]   have something they can wear and and that's you know the number one reason that you release this
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.240]   the product that's coming out is that apple will still be able to sell as many as they can make
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.720]   just to developers who want to figure out how to use it and for companies and organizations
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.280]   i want to figure out how to use it but i think that as it gets a little lighter and i think that
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.600]   one version will stay heavy and just get faster and the other version will get lighter and probably
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:34.880]   a little less expensive if i see somebody with air pods in and a vision pro on their head on an
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:40.320]   airplane like that i'm just gonna steal their peanuts that's all they are actually that they're
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:46.800]   all alone there is there must be something how how is this like is the using the built-in
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:51.520]   audio is that like wearing like open air headphones for people next year and be able to hear what
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:57.040]   you're hearing yeah i think it yeah and then you put air pods into okay yeah yeah it's yeah in a
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:04.240]   plane you use air pods it is not quite maybe as loud as open headphones but you can definitely if you're
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.440]   if you're sitting next to a person who's watching a movie you will hear you hear tinny you'll hear
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.480]   you yes you will definitely be the victim of people taking of taking obnoxious selfies with
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.680]   you that you're not aware of oh god yes you have to listen to that movie for three hours are you able
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:24.880]   to um that they show the air pod pros do you know jason when you put it on if you're talking to them
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:30.720]   about whether they can put can you put the maxes over top or is it you you you you can't as a
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.920]   weight as a weight distribution thing so great you can't because it sounds somewhat better
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.520]   air pods max don't even support any of the new features that are rolling out to the other air pods
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.760]   this fall so i think air pods max there's a real question about where's it going and what to do
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:50.160]   i know don't tell me that i paid five hundred fifty dollars i love it on flights i mean i i have a
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:54.480]   i put these i things over my eyes and i have the air pods and i have all my neck little neck they
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:59.040]   don't i see a lot of sad i know well and i see a lot everybody like it's just like i i will not i will
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:05.200]   not interact i suddenly why do i was surprised given its cost i saw maybe half a dozen uh as we float
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:10.320]   to la uh last week i saw about half a dozen air pod max and they're very distinctive because
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.200]   they're that rectangle shape i just think that you build a whole helmet like i feel like they're
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.920]   playing small they're playing small with this they just just drop a whole helmet down on top and
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.600]   and call the bay you know like a like a pair of french DJ station and they're like totally totally
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.160]   you know totally daft punk you know and and just that would be that would be great
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.640]   you know actually have a purifier you can have an air purifier that goes across the front it might
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:40.000]   you know that that that virtual eyeball that virtual external eyeball thing might be even more
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.160]   interesting if you could do the whole face especially like ghost of or you could be the ghost that
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.200]   could be the one that goes from the one those japanese animes you could be you know it'd be
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.960]   actually like in the haunted house the face is on the on the bus then they'd follow your eyes would
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.920]   follow you it'd be great ad box ghost yeah all right let's take a look right we gotta come back

[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:32.000]   doing rumors but you know what else are you going to do these days there is a rumor though that I
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.360]   think people are very interested in that there might be this is from Mark Gurman a 30 inch iMac
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:43.440]   that is not the iMac is not necessarily dead just don't get too excited about it because it's not
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:51.520]   coming at least until next year 30 plus inches he even said give a like wow big in this iMac B
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:58.080]   but wait there's more it's 60 inches it's it's 100 inches maybe it's an iMac the size of your
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:03.600]   house i'm excited right because clearly they initially out the door they're like you know the 24 is fine
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:09.360]   yeah 24 is fine it seems like yeah buy an external display if you want and it's interesting i mean
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.840]   i'm interested in the argument here that some people just want all on ones and they don't want
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.480]   to buy a display and buy a mac mini or a mac studio and they just want an all-in-one and i think
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:26.080]   there is buying behavior that suggests that that's true i just wonder at the high end of a very
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.960]   large screen do they think how big do they think that market is because there is the argument that
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:36.160]   that up there you might as well just buy a big external display and a computer instead yeah and
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:42.240]   it's a shame that that's a lot of e-waste i mean when you have a if you have if someone's buying
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.800]   an external display that's something that could be retasked a dozen different ways and if they
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.280]   have no use for it they put that up by the curb that could be retasked by other people and it does
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:58.960]   in different ways when you have that epoxy to onto a computer for which there is no current
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:04.640]   operating system and no current security updates available again that's a lot of trash that
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.360]   could have been that could have been pulled out of the trash i've got i'm acts that are
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:13.520]   solid 10 years old that i'm still using i just use them for something else like these end up in
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.280]   some room working on doing something i i haven't that's the one thing about apple is that a lot
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.440]   of the stuff just keeps working i mean i'll be able to update it anymore but i haven't running
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.920]   radio or i have it running some kind of check system or or something else like that and and now
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:32.160]   that is to Andy's point why i mostly get mac minis because well and also you're an unusual
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.680]   consumer i mean most people have one computer they've or maybe a phone tablet right computer they
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:43.360]   don't have i mean and when their mac gets you know got super annuated they don't say oh let me put
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.640]   it in the corner so i can run broadcasts on it maybe they do i don't know
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:53.440]   yeah and also thank for that i i can't help it think about a reddit video that i saw just a few
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:58.720]   weeks ago where it must have been some like central facility that recycles i'm acts for an entire
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.040]   school system or something and they were looking at the like the really really old i'm acts like
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.640]   the kinds where it was a very very boxy flat panel display and they're there they they decided to
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:14.560]   do a viral video of setting up like a hundred of them like as a domino run which is which is bad
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.520]   which is bad enough but then you for them the reason the first thing to knock down the first iMac
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:27.920]   was throwing like a 20 inch iMac onto like i'll cross the room onto a pile of just haphazardly
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:33.840]   piled up one of these it slides down and knocks over the first one so it's like yeah i i i do go i
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:39.520]   do like occasionally check out like uh there are websites that do nothing but like government
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:47.280]   auctions and so that's where you can probably find like a a shrink wrap bundle of like a hundred
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:53.760]   like white white imacs for like just come and get it for like 50 bucks and you hope that the people
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.720]   who buy them find a way to actually recycle the components but that's not off in the case it depends
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.200]   on how if they can take a write off much more easily than they can actually put this on a
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.520]   on a minisabid listing and arrange for sale and arrange for the money you know one of the big
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:13.680]   problems we had in africa was that the varying uh voltages in the power supply um you know damages
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:19.040]   the power supplies eventually and you and when you first get a pc that has an external power
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.560]   supply you're like why would you ever do that that is such a pain in the neck and then when you're
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.000]   building stuff in africa you're like oh that's a really good idea because now when the power supply
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.520]   goes bad i just buy another one and i um so but it's a so but i think that that was one of the problems
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.200]   we had with the iMac was just that it's all contained and oh there's there's the there's the video
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:44.640]   okay don't watch this we should have had a trigger warning uh before we
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:52:00.480]   oh the game's recyclers play uh mark german and his power on newsletter uh does says
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:03.520]   it actually says quite a few interesting things this week now that apple is finally
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.520]   gone public with the vision pro it's roping in thousands of a dish thousands of additional
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.040]   employees to figure out you know how to get all the software working testing and availability of
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:20.960]   the hardware along with user studies user studies have already expanded internally
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.960]   uh i think you had it was all stuff they couldn't do they couldn't do before they announced it yeah
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:30.560]   yeah so now they're just flipping the switch on it does the apple is still only allowing the most
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:35.120]   senior engineers executives to bring the product home but i think now that we all know what it
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:39.280]   looks like we've all seen it that's just a matter of time next month the company plans to start
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:43.040]   allowing select developers to go hands-on with the device so there'll be some sort of
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:51.360]   developer addition according to mark german um apple score ios and ipados are still being
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:58.880]   ported over for the most part you only saw a handful of apps jason i take it yes just just
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.120]   those ones that they said are there though like again you got to read between the lines the ones
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   that are there it's like when when i got that demo of the original iphone right after it was
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:11.600]   announced and i tapped on the notes app and it was a screenshot of the notes app you know there was
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.880]   a little like there are some apps that are built for it and then there are a bunch of apps that just
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   aren't there yeah uh while with more people taste it testing and tasting the headset tastes like
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:29.040]   nickel um yum yum yum yum its shortcomings are coming under greater scrutiny many users are finding
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:34.000]   the metal frame device feels too heavy after a couple of hours continuous use again i don't mark
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.200]   doesn't source this but i guess he's he's got his ears to the rail rails or something some also say
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.520]   they've experienced motion sickness but on a more minor scale than with competing
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:51.360]   headsets did any of the journalists uh who got the 30 minute test report any motion sickness i don't
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:56.800]   think so yeah no jane join us during did i think okay i'd have to double check that okay she she
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:03.600]   she she struck me struck me as having had the most negative physical reaction although it really
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.760]   wasn't that negative at all but he coined the term nerd helmet so one would expect
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:14.640]   she's clearly biased uh apple did develop a second strap according to german that goes over the
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.920]   words head it's unclear whether that strap will you got it when you got the demo you had it right
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.800]   jason yeah but it's unclear whether they'll sell that as an accessory or put in the box yeah he says
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.640]   something about how like currently they think it's not essential and you know my immediate reaction
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.600]   to that was to say they certainly felt it was essential for the press because we all had it so
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:38.960]   i think i but the truth is the accessory if we think of those as accessories i think the accessory
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.120]   story with this product is in flux they were they came right out and said that they did not have
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:50.160]   a very many different sizes and shapes of that uh light what do they call it the light
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:55.760]   blocker or i forget what it's called but the it's basically the cushion that goes between your face
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.920]   and the hardware and they said there will be many more when it comes out and they know how many
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:05.680]   many more like they are still figuring it out the light ceiling out like how light seal that's it
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:13.440]   so the um the uh there are many did they go down to pyr 39 and they finally i think so yeah you see
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:19.440]   them sometimes in the ballpark yeah yeah exactly so it's it's up in the air right like i think they
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:23.520]   are still figuring out which ones they can make and that are going to be the best ones and like
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.680]   they probably don't want to make 20 they probably don't want to make three so they're like trying
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:32.400]   to figure it out and that strap i think is part of that story like you have to test this stuff
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.960]   with a large number of people before you really know what needs to be done but like is it necessary
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.720]   like they may find that so many people's experience are so much better and i can't imagine that strap
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:49.120]   cost very much right meta sells it separately straps sold separately for the quest 16 $15
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:53.920]   quest pro straps sold separately but yeah you can't get it too i had to buy the i had to buy the
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:58.560]   comfort strap or whatever because the one that ship with it was terrible and like yeah but this is
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:02.880]   apple right and it's a thirty five hundred dollar device so i think it's one of those things where
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.800]   i wouldn't put it past them to put it in the box if they feel like it really is necessary
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   and i will just point to the demos and say that they certainly thought it was necessary for us to
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.560]   have it well they don't you'll get a charger with you don't get a charger with a lot of stuff so it's
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:19.600]   true but but on the other hand it it also makes you think that is it is this going to be something
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:24.560]   that they're going to trust people to simply buy it and have it delivered or they're going to
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.360]   basically say come to the apple store for a concierge level experience so we can fit it to you correctly
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.920]   just just to make sure people who buy it at least and the people who want to talk about the comfort
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.000]   of okay go ahead to market the device apple is planning to create new areas within its retail
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.920]   stores for demonstrations the spaces will also let buyers choose the correctly sized bands and
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.840]   light seal the company's considering initially requiring appointments for purchases something
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:54.560]   it did with the original apple watch in 2015 that's not he's not right you didn't have to make
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.120]   it appointment to get an apple watch i got my mail order you could have i think for the gold ones
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:04.720]   there was well there was a gold of course well what they told me and and again they what they told
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:09.200]   me is what they believed a few weeks ago and this mail changed in six months but what they told me is
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.120]   they expect that most people will want to go into a store because they'll actually want to try it out
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:17.760]   if they ever tried it out before but that there will be an online ordering option and it will be
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:22.240]   with the apple store app and they will use that face scanning and year scanning stuff to like
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.800]   make a guess about what you're right sizing that's what they will be able to do it makes sense but
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.400]   i think they they've got a little level of reality that most people are going to want to see it before
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:36.000]   they buy it apple is to go in go in yeah apple developed by nine phone app to scan customers faces
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.040]   to help determine the correct size for the light seal they will issue that app to its retail stores
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:45.840]   for the purchase process and could also release it as an app to consumers who are shopping
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:52.000]   oh that's it but that's no that also does that also gives them a lot of data for which to develop
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.800]   like to figure out what are let's have thousands and thousands of scans of people's heads yeah
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.040]   let's think how we should generate the next generation of face shields oh yeah
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:07.840]   um let's see one problem apple might face according to german and i think he's probably right is that
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:15.600]   uh if you ship it too soon you might have to put an m2 chip in it at the same time as you're
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:22.400]   releasing max with an m3 processor which might bother consuming i think it's gonna go yeah i think
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.720]   it's gonna go out with an m2 i don't think it's gonna yeah i think if they you know no matter what
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:33.680]   yeah so that would indicate maybe releasing it earlier in the year than may uh according to german
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:38.320]   apple is already looking ahead to the next headset models it has shifted some employees
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:44.080]   working on the original vision pro to new versions a second generation high-end model and a lower end
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:51.360]   headset and i think i think that the the higher end model will probably go 220 frames a second
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:57.040]   and probably be 6k per i um and the lower end model will probably be not very different than the one
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:02.160]   we have now just less expensive and lighter because you know you got at least less expensive these
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:07.760]   are the features that will not make the cut for the first version but are still planned for the
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:13.120]   second generation the ability to show multiple mac desktop screens when connected wirelessly to
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:19.280]   a vision pro right now you can only see one desktop at a time i don't know why you'd need multiple
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:24.560]   mac desktop screens that does not seem like i guess if you just spend the 3500 bucks for me i have
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:30.160]   for you yeah i have a lot of my different items actually trade absolutely thinking about the
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:36.640]   idea well i mean imagine uh having uh spaces and having the spaces actually all be visible
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:41.440]   oh with that you get multiple monitor setup because right now you can only have a lot of people
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.280]   have two monitors so you're traveling and you want to use this with your mac but it will only display
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.920]   a single monitor so i feel your field of view with monitors right like you know like liberachi
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:55.040]   you got like five pianos around you you know but that that's but that's another problem there's
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.880]   there's a reason why like ergonomically if you have multiple monitors the best way to arrange
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:05.440]   them is like one on top of the other people who have like the the have the the war games NORAD set
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.760]   up on their desktop you are always doing this to like get through your daily work even if you if you
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.240]   designate the the front ones as the most important ones and when you add the that problem to the
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.920]   problem of now you've got this big heavy weight on your head that you're shifting around with your
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:24.560]   neck there's a that's a list of things that developers and users are going to be learning about for
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.560]   during the first generation of this how did you like working in that missile silo and he was at
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:34.880]   enjoyable you know people were a little bit twitchy but you become a family you know turn your keys
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:43.120]   sir we take we take we they they stop asking me to be the tour guide because i would
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.840]   oh be the one to do the oh my god it's a lockdown you're all stuck with us for the next 40 years
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:54.800]   also a hot ticket if you don't mind also missing for the first generation
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:00.880]   uh but possibly the second generation again this is according to german and he you know he doesn't
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.200]   quote he doesn't say according to unnamed sources or anything so i don't know what he's told me is
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.160]   this is yeah i don't know if this is speculation or what the ability for multiple vision pro users
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.840]   in several person face time conferences to use personas which no one wants to use but okay
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.960]   the first version will only support one-to-one chats with purpose on us and actually a big thing
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:27.280]   that was missing in the demos which was fitness plus because that seems like a very natural use
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.920]   for this and he says that will not be in the first generation i have a hard time believing well
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.920]   here's the thing people are going to make fitness apps for this thing so i think apple would be
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:42.000]   making a mistake if they didn't have fitness plus there for this particular model i i understand
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.240]   there might be some issues here but like facebook has already shown that uh with supernatural like
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:53.920]   people want to and vitz paper really like people i love this plan there's in my uh in my meta
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.000]   quest i and uh yeah and um you know you're i'm listening to lizzo and i'm chopping the notes in
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.840]   half and it's great you you work up a sweat it's fun um and then i throw up but that's another
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.920]   fun weight loss i guess yeah but but when you have all this moisture being generated
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.400]   through it's so i just close the environment how do you clean the inside of that display and how do
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   you and how confident is apple that this is uh moisture sealed enough to prevent like ingress
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.840]   you never want to play with saber in a group it's just not pleasant plus plus is that is is
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.200]   the light shield like is it machine washable yeah can you least spray fabric right Jason the light
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.280]   seal yeah i mean it's fabric with some sort of plastic or something underneath it but yeah it's
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.680]   that it's soft it's meant to be soft you could sponge it off
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:48.000]   actually everybody should have their own light seal this is a little a little health tip for you
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.280]   okay what else did mark german say so 30 inch plus i max that was with the vision pro uh rumors
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.720]   he said in addition the iphone 15 lineup this fall there will be two apple watch series nine
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:08.480]   models and an updated ultra of course nice i mean i love my ultra but it's expensive other
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:16.720]   pro other i guess yeah i don't have to buy it do i but i will other products may come later
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:27.680]   not this fall an m3 13 inch macbook pro and 14 inch and 16 inch macbook pro and 3 pro and 3 max
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:35.200]   these new i max the company's also conducting early work on an i-mac with a screen over 30
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:42.880]   inches i'm told new macbook air models revamped ipad pros with OLED screens oh i would like that
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.200]   that would be nice new ipad air to replace the current m1 model
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:55.760]   third generation air pods pro dimension of the max and new home equipment
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.240]   such as smart displays as well as an apple tv set top box
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:07.040]   you know i i got the pixel tablet that docks i should bring it in here and show you
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:13.360]   the docks on the base i would love to see apple do that with the ipad that is a very natural way to
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.320]   store your ipad keep it charging and it's very easy to take it off and then sit down somewhere
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.120]   with it i think that's a really i would love to see apple do that yeah that was one of the things
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.960]   that really really struck me about all the reviews for the pixel tablet and to be and to be honest
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:35.600]   it is a very very like mediocre tablet it is essentially an entry level ipad but but it seems
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.800]   like every single reviewer was saying how much how often they were using this tablet simply by
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.560]   virtue of the fact that it was there on the end table and every time they wanted to hit reddit
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:48.800]   while watching a movie they would just pop it off the the the dock do what they want to do pop it
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.760]   back on again and it became a very very heavily used machine so yeah if apple were to create
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:00.560]   like a car mode only the the opposite of butts in motion mode the butts on a sofa mode where it
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.880]   when it's it's actually doing something when you're not actually using it like acting as a smart
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:10.640]   display like acting as a home controller or something that will show you a video camera or
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.880]   an or a different kind of feed or streaming feed that would be a very very interesting product
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.280]   they could do and they could do it without and they got the pogo pins they could just build
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.400]   hardware and put in a new mode we got the pogo pins right here they got they got the magnets
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:30.800]   with magnets and pogo things all things are possible it is it so here it is the here's the base
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:37.200]   and uh it's not plugged in but because it's bad it's a tablet it's a battery so it continues to operate
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.080]   and then it just separates from the base that's there's speakers on the tablet and on the base so
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:50.640]   the I gotta say though this is 500 bucks for 230 bucks you can get the nest home max
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.840]   which is pretty much the same thing it's not an android tablet it's not removable
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.920]   but in mo and as you said it's not the greatest tablet ever made android tablets are not are so
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:07.120]   disappointing does have a fingerprint reader and so forth and I can run that and apple just has all
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.640]   the pieces for this product right like they do whether it's an iPad that goes into a mode or
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:17.920]   whether it's a product that is intended to be placed you know somewhere and just be used in that
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.280]   in that format they've got center stage they've got the new widget view that they're bringing to
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.400]   the iPhone when it's uh when it's docked this fall that's got a whole bunch of widgets in it
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.640]   they've got a bunch of different they've got the apple tv interface they've got all the widget
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:38.720]   designs that are out there now they've got Siri you know which they I mean it's okay and like they
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:43.680]   have all the pieces for all this stuff and it feels like when mark german reports like multiple
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:49.360]   home products are in the works maybe not like for the next few months but like in the works
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.440]   you could see it's typical apple right you can see them assembling all the functionality and the
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:59.920]   need the idea of a continuity camera with the apple tv like it's all because that'll get zoom on apple
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.520]   tv so if they do a box that's an apple tv that also has a camera in it they've you know they've
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.160]   already got all the apps on it like they're they're assembling a home strategy finally
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:16.960]   at out of these pieces and you can see and you know as somebody who had a uh what did I have I
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:22.400]   had a an echo show in my kitchen until it's it kept trying to sell me stuff every time I talked to
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:29.680]   it and now I've got a a nest home uh which is really slow and desperately needs an update but at least
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.360]   it's functional and it's not constantly trying to sell me stuff but like I keep thinking boy apple
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:40.000]   could really make a good product in this category that would be kind of half home pod half ipod
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.080]   ipad that I would really want in my kitchen to do timers and play media and look at widgets and
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.840]   all those things showing me photos all the things that's what I do with this uh this being either
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:57.360]   the pixel tablet now or before that the home max and I can even watch tv on it because I subscribe
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:05.040]   to youtube tv so it's kind of like a mini tv it's a very natural kitchen object and then to be able
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:10.400]   to pry the ipad off and take it over to the stove so you can look at the recipe there's a lot of
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:16.640]   I think there's it makes a lot of sense and I do you know this is this is where apple has a huge
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.320]   advantage so you've got amazon and you've got google and they're making kind of half-assed
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:28.160]   basically half-assed versions of these products apple sits back and I think when apple releases
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:33.760]   it's the same thing with the apple tv it's twice as much maybe three times as much as a roku twice
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.720]   as much as a nor everybody else's streamer but it's the one you want it's the best one
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:45.280]   uh and I think they could do the same thing with home they're poised the bottom the bar is low
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:50.960]   the bar is solo and these products yeah everybody's making half-assed or not very good that's the
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.720]   problem and video shield but that's but that is an exception not the
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.120]   and in video shield is 300 bucks or whatever I mean it's I have it and it's very expensive 200
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:05.520]   but it's an apple tv cost and by the way because it's in vidia and it's android you can't get a
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.400]   lot of the apps that you get on apple tv on it it's limited in the app so you can get so
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:16.000]   oh but like there is I mean I will I will say and probably and I'll agree with Andy the
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.600]   some degree of here is that is that we have I have a bunch of android tablets and that's
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.720]   because they're less expensive and I have a single use for them and I don't want to spend
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.640]   they're five hundred dollars or eight hundred dollars and so it works yeah like I've got 14
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.760]   of these controllers for our zoom rooms because we need to do zoom rooms to for our remote events
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:37.120]   and so on so forth I'm not going to buy 14 iPads so these are some these are inexpensive
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.040]   Samsungs that cost me a hundred and nineteen dollars in chief and they all they all run across
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.600]   and they only have to run one interface and I think that I've used a lot of android devices
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.800]   for that because I think in that environment they work great now will I do I put that on
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.600]   do I carry that with me on the plane no but but putting those the android I will say that I love
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:01.360]   the android ecosystem when it comes to I want a couple things like for instance I have we used
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.360]   to have in our office we had a wall where we had pictures we wanted to keep on changing behind
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.440]   the scenes of what what we do I did that I was with android I come I'm not going to put a bunch
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:15.520]   of iPads at the wall yeah you're a unique user I mean I most people don't have multiple iPads
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.800]   but I'm still I'm still making decisions based on price like it's just like it's like I'm not
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.840]   gonna buy you know I and and like for the for cooking the real problem is my my family uses
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.840]   iPads a lot in the in the thing but it's getting you know flour and stuff on them you know it just
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.360]   you know they're a little more expensive and you're like uh do I really need to use this in the
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:39.920]   kitchen and where an android sees all recipes just as easily as well yeah it's a it's a it's a
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.960]   larger issue when you talk to talk about streaming Donald's where the only there's only one tv in
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.520]   my house where it's worth spending $200 for something like an Nvidia Shield or an Apple tv
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.480]   the rest of them like I'm not going to spend a hundred even a hundred dollars on the on the tv
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:00.240]   in my kitchen or the tv in this other room even in the bedroom really I've got a I've got a $50
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.480]   dongle that's a $50 google made dongle that's actually because it's not even hooked up to a 4k
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:11.440]   tv I could get by with a $30 one and it would work just fine it's it's it's it's nice to have that
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.280]   kind of a balance but you're you're absolutely right that this is something especially the
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.840]   with the point that that Jason made with the change is going to come to all iPads once you have these
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.920]   these widgets on the screen that are and widgets on the lock screen it's a google did come up with
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.440]   a very very simple but I thought really really powerful idea with the with their google tablet
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.440]   which is the simple statement this is something they were they're talking from the very beginning
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.720]   that what if we have a tablet that does something when you're not actually using it as a tablet what
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.440]   if it could be useful to you while it was charging and that's something that however Apple chooses
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:53.120]   to articulate that that's a really good idea and I hope that Apple tries to try something along
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.840]   those lines with the iPad and by the way I don't miss mean to dismiss the shield because it's I
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.880]   mean it's of course of course it's a great product it's amazing product and to Nvidia's credit they've
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.640]   they've kept putting the latest version of Android on it long after they could have stopped
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:13.920]   but it's priced you know a little more than the the Apple TV and the and it in in some ways this
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:20.720]   encapsulates the whole issue it's a great product but it's in its own it's an outlier right and
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.480]   with the Apple TV you feel like you're part of a larger ecosystem yeah if you only had one TV you'd
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.720]   get an Apple TV you got two or three and I understand believe me I've been thinking about this a lot
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:36.320]   we had to cancel all about Android this week because there just there wasn't that much interest in
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:42.080]   Android I think advertisers feel like probably wrongly people who buy Android are like Alex and
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.960]   they just want something cheap which means they're not a great place for an ad to be
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.520]   I'm glad that you connected me with it. It's usually not what I'm known for.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.000]   Well that's true that's a good point but when it comes to tablets he buys the crap
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.240]   actually there is worse there's a fire Apple Amazon fire tablets are actually even worse and cheaper
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.560]   oh they're so bad I got one thinking oh I got one thinking oh this will be great because it's only
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.360]   $69 or whatever and I was like oh this is horrible like I can't and I think Roku is going down that
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.120]   path where I used to really recommend the Roku like that was it was inexpensive 69 bucks and it did
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.160]   everything and it was good and now that with the ads and stuff it's just kind of they're all kind
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.560]   of getting crappified and I think it's a real opportunity for Apple to say we are not going to
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.080]   be that way we're not going to sell ads we're not going to get crappified we're going to focus on
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.960]   great products yeah they're going to cost a little bit more like the Apple TV but
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   you're getting an ecosystem that really works and as I much as I hate lock-in and gated communities
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:50.480]   their story is very effective and when it comes to home automation that's a big deal because people
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:56.720]   have been burned I'm sure Jason you've been burned dozens of times by different platforms and
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:01.920]   yeah you know stuff not talking about stuff we all have hues hubs that don't you know that are
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.800]   right yeah it's it's I've been I've been failing at home automation now for a solid 20 years yes
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:14.080]   yes yes that's a good way that's a perfect way to put it failing I so want it you know I so want
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.240]   it you know and I've got parts of it done you know like if I if I you know if I click on my watch
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.240]   hold on my watch is not good not getting along with me if I click on my watch and I go oh
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.520]   and when all my lights out then then then then you know then it theoretically see doesn't work I'm
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.520]   on I'm on TV so there we go oh finally how long did that take I know and then but I turn it and I
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.680]   hit my watch again and then hopefully the law will turn back on or this will be a really dark show
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.640]   it's going really slow right now so see this is this is this I just outlined exactly the problem
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.440]   but you're so much a voice scramble just so we get a little bit finally five seconds later goes back
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:53.360]   on think about it you know so so anyway so the and but that's and that took me
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:00.560]   took me a while to get that to work so and but that's the simplest thing you would possibly do I
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.120]   know it's an outlet you know and I can't get it to like you know and it's like okay and and
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:10.960]   for me I just feel like I just want Apple to do the lock the outlet the the camera the light do you
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.720]   think they're planning to that they're just want to get it and asleep in a thermostat they want a
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:19.840]   five story and they're just I just feel like I just feel like they got a give up on everybody if
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.800]   they did those five things that's like 80 percent of the market like of that of the world and then
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.720]   after that everyone else can build around whatever gives them there's matter which gives them a
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.560]   chance turned out to be a dumpster fire oh that's just it's not it's not working it's it's not working I
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.960]   thought we'd have a unified standard we did when matter came out we were excited but I've
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.720]   talking of home automation folks and it's just like it's not you know it's not tying together I'm
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:48.800]   gonna ask Stacy Eganbotham this is her among others this is one of her fields tomorrow and this
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:56.000]   week in Google but I TP link just came out with Wi-Fi enabled light switches that support matter
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.920]   they've had non-matter switches and I was hopeful that now I can because the huge thing is just not
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.440]   I have some hue lights and I can say I could tell my Google or my echo you know turn the lights off
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.640]   around but it's it's pretty janky if I could put everything on a Wi-Fi light switch that I could
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:19.920]   then control just like you do with your Apple watch or with a iPad or with my voice because matter
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:26.960]   works with echo and and Google Assistant as well then maybe that holy grail of at least being able
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:33.840]   to control your lights well again I just think that I think that Apple I mean I Apple's jumped on
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.520]   with material and is saying hey we can support it but it's just it hasn't been working and
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.000]   and the thing is I just think of Apple just said well we're just gonna do it our way there's a
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.880]   lot of people that would jump on and just are building it that way you know and they don't have
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.000]   to keep on trying to figure out how to integrate their videos I would like them integrating with
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.160]   everybody else is not with their stuff I really would it's not working with others it's not
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.120]   Apple Strong's yeah they're good at they're good at a lot of things just working with others on
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.920]   their standards is not one of them you know well and they're very weird about the home app is
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.440]   terrible the ui's bad I mean they have a lot of work to do so it's I wonder how much commitment
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:12.000]   they have to this this area exactly that that's that's even an apple you can always tell the
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.720]   difference between when something is a priority and something is not a priority and it's there
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.240]   apples no difference from other anything else the the home kit is they figure that okay well we
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.280]   cut we kind of got to have it in some way shape or form but there is nobody that's jumping up
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.680]   leaping on someone a product another product manager's desk leaping up and down and demanding
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:37.760]   to know why they're not doing more to support their home kit projects it's it's and I don't think
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:43.280]   that there are a lot of competitors that have the same sort of nobody's doing so yeah do you think
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:50.880]   maybe apple um does the research and has decided yeah nobody really wants this I think they have
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:57.120]   enough attention and enough people yeah I think that um matter is an example where apples basically
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:03.440]   said look we're gonna let home kid become matter more or less and that means their strategy there
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:12.720]   I think their strategy is um to find partners that are on the apple uh bandwagon and are gonna do
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:18.640]   good uh home kid and matter support and build a business and compete with other partners maybe but
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:26.160]   like you look at something like ecob right like ecob in apple are tight and they work really well
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.680]   with home kit and they're a nest competitor which is great I think for apple too but like apple
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.600]   doesn't need to build a thermostat they don't want to build a thermostat but they are found a partner
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.560]   who wants to support apple platforms and I think that that's their strategy is like they don't
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.720]   want to build a lot of these home products but what they want to do is find and it might be
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.320]   into the guise of like we're selling it in the apple online store we're putting it in apple
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:53.360]   retail stores but there's they've got some leverage there to say like look our customers have a
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.440]   lot of money and they want to buy smart home products and if you work really well with us
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:03.520]   we will highlight you and that gets them the equivalent and I know Alex might bristle at this
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.840]   like it's not quite the same as if apple built it but apple's not going to build it so it's like
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.440]   tear down from there which is like we're going to work with somebody to make sure that this is
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:16.320]   good enough for us to sell on our stores and that's how you get those home accessories out there that
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:22.160]   are sort of like and they're they're out there there are good citizens of home kit and presumably
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.000]   will be of matter at some point and like that I think that's their strategy and then they're
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.320]   going to keep the core to stuff that's running their operating systems and that's going to be like
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:37.680]   yeah we might see a kitchen device with a screen or we might see an expanded apple tv that's like
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:42.960]   a sound bar with a camera but they're not going to I think make light bulbs right they're just not
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:50.000]   going to do it or or a doorbell and the and the other thing is that we might be seeing a preview of
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.240]   what the VR industry becomes like where we've had home automation for a number of years and a lot
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:01.840]   of basic stuff has worked pretty well and it's possible that there is no magic solution that there
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.760]   is no somebody that no matter how much commitment you put into it people like home automation for
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.800]   turning lights on and off for door locks and security cameras and they really like turning
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.680]   lights and they really like setting kitchen timers but and finding out what the weather is but
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:21.680]   the idea of home automation or voice assistance as an entire platform for computing through smart
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.520]   speakers maybe humanity has said this is enough we don't care about anything above this level
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:33.120]   we appreciate we we love how much energy you're putting into this but we will enjoy watching these
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:38.400]   videos and these demos but so so long as we ask what to ask what the weather is and it tells us
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.360]   what the weather is we're good we just put in a we had to replace our furnace so we put in a
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:49.520]   Lennox heat pump and you know for a small additional fee I don't even want to know how much they give
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:55.920]   us a Lennox smart thermostat but of course it's in a world of its own it doesn't support anything
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:01.280]   I have to have the Lennox app on my phone I mean it actually is pretty cool it does a good job
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:07.840]   yeah I was gonna say just I wrote a smart thermostat story for the wire cutter back right when I was
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:13.200]   starting so it's it's long been replaced but one of the things I did is I talked to experts in
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:19.520]   HVAC and they said if you've got a first party system that has a smart thermostat you should use
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:25.440]   their thermostat don't go buy a nest and the reason is they have access to all the like special
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.080]   quirky codes about their stuff so even though you're getting this Lennox thing although who knows
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.000]   maybe there's a bridge like a home bridge plug in or something it works with echo and and
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.040]   Google assistant but but it's not matters it's I don't think it's matter yeah yeah I mean that's
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:43.360]   why I have home bridges to bridge this sort of thing which I hate but I have it because it's
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.720]   necessary to do but but there is like there's a reason it's not just the upsell there the HVAC
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:53.200]   I talked to was like no there it's always going to be better if you're using the manufacturer as
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:57.920]   controller yeah I have this it's got this smart thing where it says well if it's this it does
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:02.720]   it all automatically I don't have to think about it I mean yeah there's stuff in there that if I
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:08.880]   had an eco B I'd have to go well okay fine I have to do I mean this is I will say that even even the
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.360]   very first nest that I installed it was pretty fast like like I put it in and said put this
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.240]   wire into here put this wire into here oh yeah after that it was running you know it was a long
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.920]   third wire that went to the furnace that's the common wire the common wire right a lot of I
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:30.240]   didn't a lot of people don't right yeah like this there's where your troubles begin this is a good
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.640]   example this I believe I think I got this at the Apple Store but definitely this was this is sold
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:41.200]   at the Apple Store or or was and you know two days of tech support is what it took together to
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.040]   actually turn on is that it you know and that that's a Wi-Fi switch you switch oh you know now
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:51.600]   here's the worst part is I went and bought the Eve power that's what turned these all these lights
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.520]   got turned on and off with an Eve you know power strip but so so I didn't because there was no
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.560]   other place to go as far as I was concerned like Eve is making these outlets and that one works fine
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.680]   this one still is really really slow but it but it does work now so it's all it takes
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:14.720]   unfortunately I don't want yeah is is a few experiences like that some of us like Jason
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:22.960]   and you Alex or I can suffer a lot more pain than others but it does at some point people go
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.800]   yeah I give up I wired my I had my whole house with use for a while like I had I don't know how
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:32.560]   many I got them laying around in boxes because I just have I had all use and I built whole thing
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.840]   and everything else and then eventually it stops working right and then and then you're like it's
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:42.000]   too much trouble to get it back and yeah yeah so maybe I won't buy those tp link Wi-Fi lights
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.880]   I asked Lisa I said can I replace there's 25 each so we got I'd have to spend like 500 bucks I said
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:53.760]   can I replace all the light switches with Wi-Fi enabled light switches she said well I what happens
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:59.920]   if the Wi-Fi goes down and I said oh that's an interesting question so I don't know so I'm
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:06.000]   I'm a big fan of the lutron casita yeah yeah yeah and that those are the best ones because
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.480]   and I feel like we have this conversation before but the best smart switches the best smart lights
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:15.440]   are ones that behave like regular lights and then are also smart right right so those are
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.400]   Wi-Fi controlled and I can have them on timers and I can use a remote but the fact is there's a thing
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.640]   in the wall and if you're pressing the light goes on and like that's what you need you gotta have
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.880]   that you gotta have that you're making me think of every single time that I have house over in
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:33.360]   house guests over and I have to like walk them through like the training video of here's how to
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:40.240]   turn the bedside light on and on here's how I have I have a manual I have like an eight page manual
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.760]   with pictures how to turn on the TV how to turn on the lights what to do in the lights come on in
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.160]   the middle of the night oh uh you see that that's what that's what vision pro is going to be all about
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:54.800]   I can actually send them a simulation of what my what the house is like and they could practice
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:01.600]   we we go through a training video together about and now say hey hey slow mo turn on turn on the
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.600]   kitchen lights but turn off the living room maybe I'll get these cassettes instead these do do
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:11.360]   work with home kit as well as Alexa or echo and assistant maybe maybe I should get these do you
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:18.800]   like them Jason oh yeah the lutron casa are the best that's what Stacy said for you yeah yeah yeah
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.600]   not all I have never had a case where I've been like oh why aren't they working and they do have a
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.840]   little dongle that you have to put somewhere on ethernet to be in your house but other than that
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.360]   they just they just work I gotta say it like it just works it hasn't let me down and of course
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.360]   if it does let you down or you know you you have a person who just you have a switch to use a wall
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:42.240]   switch yeah it will work just fine yeah they're really good that's that that's really the goal is
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:50.400]   from Lisa's point of view nothing has changed yeah yeah uh let's take a break wait there's still a
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:56.800]   lot of stuff to talk about we'll get to that in in just a second but first a word from our sponsor

[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:28.160]   one some moving moving right along uh well there's still quite a few stories here let me let me
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:34.080]   kind of rip through a few of them there were zero days if you haven't updated your various apple
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:43.920]   devices do so apple fixed zero days used to deploy a spyware called triangulation it's another iMessage
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:52.160]   zero click exploit and uh you probably see saw the dot one updates on your ios your ipad os
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.920]   your mac os do not delay these were discovered by kaspersky
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:03.040]   um zero click is the big scare because it means essentially they can send you a message
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:07.840]   you don't even have to open it read it or do anything and it will infect your computer
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:13.920]   and it's of course used by state hackers these are very powerful uh exploits
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.960]   which means you know you probably not a target they're not going to use them
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.560]   you know hackers aren't going to use them to put ransomware on your machines or stuff
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:30.240]   it's really used by because they're so pricey to get these exploits but still update oh another tip
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:39.200]   if your car gets stolen and you have an air tag in it call the police do not go to
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:48.960]   where the car is bakersfield woman 61 shot to death Jesus after she confronted suspects
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:55.760]   who stole her car she uh the car was stolen had an apple air tag in it she didn't tell law enforcement
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:00.960]   according to bakersfield police she just went to the 5600 block of ginger avenue
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:07.120]   and found her car and uh found four guys who had stolen it and they shattered dead
[01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.360]   and bakersfield is not like the
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.400]   it's not the place that you just go wandering off
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:16.800]   probably not a good idea try to do that it's it's it's very unfortunate but it's it's a good
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.200]   I mean it I mean this is the this is the challenge is that people get you know get a hold of these
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:26.320]   I had a I had a situation someone stole a camera from me when I was in Africa and I was at a big event
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.640]   and I was wearing a Scotty vest and I had thought about putting the the cable you know there's a
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:36.080]   little cable on the inside of the inside of your pocket and someone and someone stole it and
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.760]   someone said why didn't you put that cable on it and I was like because I don't want someone to
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.440]   pull that camera out and then I'm looking at them and they're looking at me that puts me in danger
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.760]   yeah like I'd rather just take the kind of people who might steal that camera or steal your car
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:53.840]   I don't want to be in that situation they may be yeah I'm so terrible story but it's a good
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:59.520]   warren morning they did catch the guys by the way uh or at least the suspects uh and they're being
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:08.480]   tried for murder uh bad news for Apple by the way I just you know the with the technology that our
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:15.120]   government has at different at various levels with air tags it is going to get really hard to steal
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:21.680]   cars because you know you have to really think about it because they can attach your phone
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:28.480]   in the car and the car's tracking device all it needs to do is you go together for about a 10 feet
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:33.600]   and it goes I think it's you you know and and um and that's not hard for them to get a hold of and so
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:38.960]   um you know so things going going in the same place together is something that that's why when
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:42.400]   you think about the government wanting all this data it's one of the things that it shortens the
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:48.080]   list really fast um about what what's possible yeah ideally but it's still you still have to get
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:52.880]   the cops motivated to actually solve crimes there's I'm not saying that that's not what they do
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:57.920]   but there's there are a lot of incense in which say hi well I got I just got hit and run with lots of
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:02.800]   damage but don't worry I had a dashboard camera I had the license plate I got a video of the person
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.120]   and the stories of oh well they didn't really care they just said well follow your insurance
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:12.240]   company and that's about it so on the other hand there's a lot of moving components to this there
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:19.760]   are happy stories there was a taco restaurant in San Antonio Texas everything every happy story
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:27.680]   starts with the word tacos right tacos don menolito open in January with a giant bull
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.520]   a plastic bull statue out front which of course was immediately stolen
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:40.800]   however don menolito was smart enough to put a air tag in the ball
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:48.960]   and now now he did not go find the bull himself he called police who then helped him
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:55.680]   locate the stolen bull air tech this is the nine to five max story air tag fulfills destiny
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:01.920]   helps locate giant bull statues stolen from taco restaurant thank you scooter x for
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:08.240]   for giving us the good news on air tags that is good because I don't know why dirt bag crimes
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:12.720]   like this bother me more than a lot of other crimes the idea of we could what what if what if
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:17.360]   you just decided that hey here's a cool thing in front of the store why don't we just let it be
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:23.200]   and let other let it let the owner enjoy it let other people enjoy it why do you have to say hey
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:27.360]   i've got a pickup truck i bet i could pull that thing off i don't know why i don't know why it
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:34.160]   bothers me and apple ad oh i hope so with the giant plastic bull that would be nice
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.840]   that would be nice anyway uh don menolito's bull is nicer than those those those those slow
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:45.600]   pans down like a dim dim little dimlet mountain valley you can picture like the crumpled body of
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:52.400]   a sphere i was trapped under the snow using his own blood to scratch out like i love you honey
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:59.840]   raise the kids the way that i would like on the leaves oh my god i just want to make it clear i
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:06.800]   if you've missed this point every mac break weekly it's recorded on taco Tuesday oh

[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:37.840]   trademark owned by taco johns for 34 years good for them because taco bell claims the commonly used
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:46.000]   phrase should be freely available to all who make sell eat and celebrate tacos the defense of tacos
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.840]   act sponsored by taco bell and Doritos right there's got to be a marketing plan here so they got a
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:57.040]   um take away your taco Tuesdays i think i would turn that whether you get it or not i would for
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:02.640]   taco bell i would use them use the moment and taco johns taco johns where is taco johns it's
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:11.680]   regional it's what it says a regional chain um but also do but also do you do do you read so apple
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:17.600]   is now suing basically taking legal legal action and switzerland to own all trademarks of apples
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:24.080]   everywhere and every come even even like the the apple growers the apple growers uh association
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:29.520]   trademark which is simply an apple with a plus inside it and they're they basically want to either
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.880]   be granted exclusive what the rights to use the any sort of like an apple logo anywhere or to
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:40.720]   at least get all these people to sign non non compete uh and non basically signed it's the
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:45.600]   sign agreement is essentially bending into the need apple saying that yes your 50 year old 60
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:51.760]   year old trade group uses it only with our benediction 111 year old trade group the fruit union
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:58.880]   swiss for most of its history has had a symbol that's a red apple with a white cross the swiss flag
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:08.080]   uh apple says no you can't you can't do that we have a hard time understanding this because it's
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.040]   not like they're trying to protect their bitten apple which is right apple's got a bite out of it
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:21.120]   right uh the the objective according to fruit union swiss director jimmy or jimmy marietos
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.680]   their objective here is really to own the rights to an actual apple
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.320]   which for us is something that is really almost as universal as but taco tuesday
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:37.120]   uh the case has left swiss fruit growers puzzled according to wired
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.640]   um apple did not respond to requests for comments you know i think apple hires lawyers
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:49.600]   and says go forth go the forth and protect our trade marks if i if i read that correctly i think
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.920]   that it's they either want to own it or they want to have no one tell them that they can't own
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.880]   they can't they want mutual exclusive whatever with with the brand and so what they're usually
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.720]   this kind of thing happens because somebody sent them an email you know like this is how lawyer
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:11.200]   this is how you stir up a b-a-b hive is that somebody with an apple ish logo sent a c synthesis
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:17.360]   to apple or something at some point in time probably four or five years ago and then there were then
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:21.040]   they crushed them you know like that you know like like there's a whole bunch of legal whatever
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.640]   but they were like we got to make sure this never happens again and then there's like a plan
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:27.760]   there's a bunch of meetings and there's you know and then there's a couple of some
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:31.920]   agreement to do this you know they're not apples aren't trying to take the take the brand what
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:36.080]   they want to do is make sure that no one can ever claim against okay but let me tell you the history
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:40.320]   of apples lawsuits so you remember the apple core lawsuit where they fought back and forth with
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.800]   the Beatles Beatles said fine just don't do any music then apple said you know we have this thing
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:50.960]   called iTunes we were thinking so anyway they finally settled that back in 2007 but but apple
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:58.800]   is also sued a meal prep app that had a pair logo a singer songwriter named Frankie Pineapple
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:06.400]   a German cycling route and a pair of stationary makers in a school district all for using an apple
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:15.120]   of some kind in their logo yeah this is this is so when i see stuff like that and how regularly
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.880]   they've been doing that i think that the legal department at apple like independently they know
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:23.920]   that we got a pretty good scam going so once we keep filing these lawsuits all our kids are going
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:30.160]   to ivy lee colleges we can we can keep training trading our boats for bigger better books i should
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.080]   also point out and i've been told this many times because we have a trademark for twid and
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:39.680]   the twit logo and stuff like that that you have to defend these otherwise they you know people
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:45.600]   assume you're not defending them anymore and so it's it's it's fair game so to a certain degree
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.640]   a company that has trademarks does have to defend them i think common sense perhaps it's pretty
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:40:00.800]   super aggressive yeah nevertheless uh taco johns says uh i think taco john says it's okay
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:10.000]   let's see taco john's parent company spicy seasonings denied that there is quote anything
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.880]   not cool about obtaining a trademark for the phrase
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:20.480]   the Wyoming you might think that we're some stuffy corporation here but not stuffy
[01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:26.000]   as with it as you feel the youngs the Wyoming based companies that taco bells lawsuit is
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.600]   filled with statements of opinion to which no response is required including that tuesday is
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:39.760]   a mediocre day of the week well i never as somebody born on a tuesday i say how dare you
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:44.720]   tell you sir how dare you talk about like we do our taco bell taco bell taco bell is getting a
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.680]   lot of good they're getting a lot of not i don't know what good or bad but they're getting a lot
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.720]   of press for a lot of people are talking about taco bell and we haven't talked about them for a
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.520]   long time leo i thought you were gonna say that taco johns had declared that anybody can use the
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:02.720]   phrase taco tuesday from wednesday to monday it's your it's taco bell that's defending our right
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:08.080]   to call it taco tuesday it's taco johns that is trying to stop that yeah so just so we're clear on
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.400]   that but they're they're willing to let you have tat on tuesday on tuesday or can i have taco
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.960]   taturday and wednesday whatever yeah and chocolate johns we're really excited to have your tacos
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:22.080]   but if you don't this this this offer expires by in the next two weeks after that we're gonna go
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:27.280]   to taco bell and that's right and do a whole ad campaign it was gonna of mac break depending
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:35.280]   our right to fall in taco tuesday i don't care come on and sue us i would like to have tacos
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.600]   delivered to each of your domains on tuesday i'm a hundred percent behind that i'm always
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.680]   familiar as as as a freelance could freelance journalists in a rapidly collapsing market i'm
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.080]   very much in favor of people sending me free protein car pride rates there's always room for tacos
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.080]   in a little bit more serious uh lawsuit the supreme court has rebuffed apple
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:42:00.480]   in the caltech patent case you may remember that caltech says they have wifi patents that
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:08.800]   broadcom uses an apple when it used broadcon chips in their devices infringed caltech at 1.101
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.520]   billion dollar verdict but a lower course said last year the amount of damages needs to be
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:21.920]   recalculated uh this lawsuit's been going on since 2016 uh apple and broadcom asked
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:27.040]   the patent and trademark office administrative court to reconsider whether the patents were good
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:31.760]   in the first place that's a that's like one of the ways you can try to get around these i know
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:38.880]   because there was a podcast patent that ended up getting overturned thanks to the ff in uh an
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:45.920]   inter partase uh case at the pto but the patent office tribunal agreed to review the patents and
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:52.560]   ultimately upheld their validity that's the risk if you challenge it at the patent office
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.520]   and they dis again they say no no that's a good patent now you got a double trouble so caltech won
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:03.920]   a los angeles jury in 2020 sided with caltech the company's appealed u.s. court of appeals for the
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:13.440]   federal circuit in february of last year upheld the jury's findings apple said well and broadcom
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.720]   let's take it to the supreme court uh in january the supreme court asked the biden
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:23.360]   administration to weigh in the biden administration said don't take the case
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:31.920]   the law is properly applied and the supreme court in fact did not take the case so i'm not
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:38.560]   sure where the the ward stands but as of now apple and broadcom uh now we're gonna have to
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:43.840]   face a trial to find out how much they owe because they owe you owe just a matter of how much you owe
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:52.960]   um let's see anything else in uh in the listing here studio pro headsets from beats
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:59.760]   are now are gonna in the fcc database that sounds like they're gonna do a kind of pro max version of
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:05.920]   beats yeah um have we decided what the difference is between apple branded headphones and beats
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.960]   branded headphones they're cute if you're trying to be different i think yes yeah like if you're
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.520]   trying to recommend headphones to people and someone someone is automatically going for apple
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:20.800]   brand like when would when would we steer them towards beats like for for sports no music
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:27.120]   modern music right i don't know what do you think how they look how they look yeah and if you like
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:33.920]   more bass like i think i have i think they're base heavy yeah yeah okay i don't know i did like
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.040]   anybody know i don't know i think there are some functional differences like i think they make
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:43.280]   you know they make more of an effort to do the bluetooth you know proper bluetooth pairing because
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:49.520]   they're meant to be more cross-platform than airpods are even though airpods are that there is a sport
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:53.680]   version right there there's a little more variety there i think there are some features that they
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.280]   lack that the airpods have um but they're pretty i mean they're pretty close so it is yeah it's
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.720]   it's an exercise in branding and and and apple focusing on airpods on you know a very particular
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.960]   market but like they're they're good is my understanding is they're very good and they have a lot of
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:14.240]   that apple secret sauce in them even though they're you know not apple branded i keep buying third
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:20.800]   party earbuds uh not beats so much but others just to compare them and apples airpods pro are really
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:27.920]   the kind of the standard i just got the new denon pearl pro they they have a special technology that
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:33.600]   they place sounds in your ears and and condition the sound based on that it's kind of like a hearing
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:38.640]   test without you doing anything yeah and uh they sound very very good but they're missing that
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.280]   ecosystem this is what made me start thinking about ecosystem you know the transparency and the
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:48.640]   mix of the new features that are coming soon all of that apple can do because they have the phone
[01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:54.240]   they you know and and it just gives them more capabilities even if you could make an equivalently
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:59.920]   a good sounding headphone by the way the the denon pearl pros are twice as much as airpods right
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:03.440]   well that's you know that's actually one of the big uh one of the bigger
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:10.320]   qualities that has gone to my own decision making because the thing is like all of these all of the
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:15.120]   truly wireless headphones that i've had they've got an end of life that's measured in a couple of
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:20.160]   years either because the battery is going to go comfort or because simply i'm going to lose them
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:28.640]   because things happen and i'm me and so there's like a i've i love google's pixel buds a because i
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.800]   think that 99 bucks for me is exactly the right money to write a amount of money to spend i'm willing
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:39.200]   to spend like 40 dollars a year for use of truly wireless headphones the sound is not as certainly
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.480]   not as good as apples pros or the best sony's or probably the denons but they're really really
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:49.520]   good but and the other thing is that i love the design where they have that little silicone little
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:53.760]   tail that sort of nestles into one of the folds of your ear they're by far the most comfortable
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.800]   earbuds i've ever used and so that's why like even though i do have a nice pair of sony's
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:03.920]   usually when i'm going out for for for my walk of running real reason i'm using the pixel buds it's
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:08.400]   it's a complicated piece of math yeah but pixel buds with android makes sense
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:15.440]   uh and and and all but also with my with my ipad with my uh oh okay lapp and stuff i mean i i
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:22.560]   agree that the i agree that uh the secret sauce of having apple apple apple created earbuds working
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.880]   with an apple created product all take a tie together with apple created software is awfully nice i
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:32.080]   really wish i had that kind of like uh the ability to check my my uh the the charge on everything i
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:38.080]   had but again when it when it comes to it's hard for me specifically to particularly to spend 200
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:43.280]   some odd dollars on something that even if i don't misplace them i know that in a few years they're
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:49.840]   just going to be garbage and and and even if that weren't the case they're not as comfortable as
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:53.680]   these cheaper ones and i'm sure that there are 60-dollar earbuds that have certain elements
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:57.520]   they're designed that suit my ears better than than the other one and there's another issue in
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:03.360]   some ways because these for instance these pro pro support aptX which is a high-end bluetooth
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:10.080]   codec that apple doesn't support so so you know the and my biggest complaint is that if you have
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.720]   any other bluetooth app other than apple and i don't know this is the the ww1 chip or whatever but
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:21.200]   uh it when someone calls me and i'm on a different headset which i'm often on i'm on i so i when i'm
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:26.800]   talking on the phone and i'm working uh or doing something i'm on an opencom yeah i bought those
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:30.880]   because you open them great yeah with with the pictures you can yeah no one hears anything if you
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.560]   have a little boom that comes down and everything else it's great when i'm
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:40.720]   purely listening and i might answer a call i'm on the ultimate ears fits because they fit you know
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.720]   like they're they're great and they're they're really in my ears and when i'm on kind of general
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:49.920]   purpose i'm on my earpods you know and but what's interesting is is when someone calls me no matter
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:55.440]   how often i i've been using this opencom it's the only one connected to my phone and when it answers
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.720]   it doesn't answer to the opencom i have to go for that trust right every single time and i'm just
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:05.120]   like i and i can't decide whether it's conspiracy or just missing that chip or something because it's
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.040]   because it's so it's it's just like if i'm driving i don't want to use it because i don't want to
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:13.600]   i use the airpods because like you know i want it to just answer to the headset so it's just it's
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:20.080]   annoying i gotta find something that does aptX lossless so i can try these pearls with it uh
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:26.000]   anyway um i did think there was an interesting story like last week the week before there was
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.560]   an interview with uh Kevin Lynch of apple and duder cullbeck about finally answering at least
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:35.520]   the first sub the first answer to the question why doesn't apple allow third party watch faces
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:40.560]   and they ascribed it to just reliability that they were basically saying that they don't know
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.440]   like if they if if they allowed third parties to developer to develop watch faces then maybe the
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:50.000]   next time they off they upgrade ios then the watch face would break and i i thought that was an
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.440]   interesting point of view because they have no problems when they allow developers to write
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:01.040]   other kinds of apps for the watch and they don't worry about breakage yeah it's weird somebody
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:06.800]   in our chat room said there's a he's got a bet on whether uh you'll have custom eyeballs for the
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.880]   spooky eyes before you have custom watch faces for the apple watch it's gotten to the point where
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:16.080]   wwc the number one thing i want to see is custom watch faces like i would literally tweet it out
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:20.880]   like oh my gosh yeah there's there's production things that i want to do with my foot with my watch
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:25.360]   you know with i want a very specific thing with second hands and certain things and i want my
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:31.760]   my uh complications to be in a very specific way and you know it's if apple did that then i
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.800]   probably wouldn't care anymore but if at but given that they haven't done it um and i desperately
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:40.720]   there's only one on watch face with second hands if you're in your in production you really want
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:44.960]   to know how many seconds are left you know there's there's an exercise one and then there's a dorky
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:51.200]   one you know and and so the thing and so the the fact that apple doesn't do that just like oh
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:58.400]   like let us experiment and if it doesn't work let us know you can give us three warnings that we might
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.800]   break the break the watch or it might run out of battery or whatever that's fine but this is
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:07.040]   definitely a place where usually Andy's talking about it where apple's being over controlling
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:14.560]   and they should just let us free our watch faces free the watch face yeah although i having had
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:19.840]   custom watch faces on samsung watches and others they're usually pretty crappy
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:25.440]   so that's that's true but the thing is like i don't want i don't want there to be 500 different
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:31.040]   watch faces available i want there to be one different one that i absolutely love and i will be
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:36.240]   having on that watch face on that watch until the thing goes into the trash this is one of those
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:42.000]   areas where apples reliance on a curated app store you know kind of proves the point which is
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.440]   you know you could say oh no no no we can't allow that like you never know there might be
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.880]   trademark issues we might be lawsuits or they might not work right it's like yeah you've got
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:55.360]   naps door so only let in the ones where you've checked and they're okay and then wouldn't that
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:01.760]   be nice so i i still feel like it's going to happen eventually but um i i would have lost the bet if
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:07.440]   you would ask me back when the back almost you know like nine years ago when they announced the first
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:11.920]   apple watch how long it would take to do custom third party watch faces or even if
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:18.880]   they allow if they they basically allowed a handful of studios to create the right to the
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:22.880]   the author authorization to do that sort of stuff because i could i could absolutely see where they
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:29.760]   don't want the app the design of the apple watches was just as important as like the engineering
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:34.640]   or the software they just they wanted to make what looked like a beautiful elegant timeless classic
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:39.280]   watch and that that that they wouldn't have to keep updating every two years as the fashion's
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:42.400]   changed they could just update the software so i absolutely see where they would want to have
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:48.000]   some control over to make sure that let's not have when the cal when the calvin is pissing on the
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:53.120]   four that means that it's the four o'clock you know but but if they simply said here are some
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:57.600]   here are some studios that we really really like we have given them like license to produce
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.560]   the following eight watch faces that are optional downloads or optional purchases and to see how
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:09.520]   well those those things work out and then keep keep expanding the program as they see how people
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:13.360]   are reacting to the source stuff although i'll say having a snoopie and woodstock watch face
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:18.800]   as with the new watchOS that delayed that delayed my my attention a little bit because i want to
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:26.160]   snoopie watch that's all you really need i'm i'm not i'm a simple man i'm a simple man with symphony
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:31.280]   we sing we dance we bring in the harvest Jason nadley cray to an indifferent god
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.240]   interesting article in mac world i thought uh we should talk about this while Jason's here
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:44.080]   sorry apple most people will never use any of the new features coming in ios 17 did you write that
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.240]   credit to my editor okay you can always here's the secret is you can always go to six colors when
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:54.400]   i link to it and see my headline that i wrote which was something like pro tip uh the iphone has a
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:00.000]   discoverability problem but i i see it's not as good on that i don't think this one this one
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.560]   made me laugh i like some of those their headlines are a little too much but this is the point is
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:10.400]   like apple can ship new features but how do users ever discover them and there's a new thing my
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.960]   news angle is that there's a thing called tip kit and ios 17 that is going to try to standardize
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:21.120]   so that app developers have a standard way and apple is using it to a standard way of rolling out
[01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:25.840]   little tip bubbles that will pop up and it's and it they don't want them all at once like you can
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:30.880]   set it to be like when a user does this behavior or does this behavior for the third time you can
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:35.200]   pop up a little tip that said here's the thing you could do and they you know don't do five at once
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:40.640]   only do one every few days or weeks or whatever because they're trying to improve discoverability
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:45.520]   the reason that this came up is that while i was in Oregon for my daughter's graduation
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:50.400]   my wife and i go out to lunch and um she comments that i don't have pictures of our kids on my lock
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:54.720]   screen and she says how will she works in an office with other human beings she's like how will
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.640]   people know it's your phone because people know it's interesting because it's got her pictures of
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:02.720]   her kids on and i said oh well you could have a lock screen that shuffles through all the pictures
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.840]   of our kids because that's an ios 16 feature and i opened it up and i so she didn't know about that
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.160]   feature i found a bug which is that the faces that it offered were totally random and not our children
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:16.080]   which like why are these pictures there they're like people we took two pictures of and they're
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:20.560]   like would you like to shuffle between those two pictures of randos it's like no no apple so i
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:24.560]   filed feedback about that that's fine but like then i'm looking at her app screen and she's got
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:31.440]   nine pages of apps just going off into oblivion and i realized she apple like three or four years
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:37.920]   ago apple completely simplified and and adjusted how we handle apps on iphones so that you don't
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:41.840]   have to have them on the screen anymore they're still in the app library you can still search for
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:46.800]   them but you can sort of like simplify your life and delete all those extra screens and only sort
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:51.120]   of have instead of having a junk drawer which is what she has you can just have a cup like your
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:56.800]   favorites on a page or two and then the rest are just in the app library and i explained this to her
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:03.360]   but and it was she was like oh well that's that's cool right but like she never thought about it and
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:09.840]   i thought well what did apple do to try and prod her to completely change the way that she handles
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:15.440]   apps and it struck me that like what happens with most people is they learn once how to do something
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:21.040]   so they learn how to manage apps on an iphone and then five years pass and apple says hey
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:25.600]   it's getting kind of messy on that iphone we're going to do a cool new feature that lets you organize
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:30.240]   it better and the all those people who learned that they just don't notice and they keep doing
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:36.800]   what they learned and uh it just struck me that like it's a hard problem like how do you not get
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:41.200]   super annoying like when they update their phone if you bombard them right then they're not going
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:46.160]   to do it and i realized that it's not our our viewers and listeners right it's the it's like
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:52.480]   everybody else we're we're the discovery system for the people who listen to our podcast right but
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:57.760]   but the general public and my my wife was a good example because believe it or not i do not
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:04.000]   replicate mac break weekly at the dinner table um my wife my wife was like she learned in 2014 or
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:11.920]   whatever 2012 2010 how to manage apps and it never knew that apple made it easier so it's a real it
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:18.080]   just got me thinking like we're about to enter this beta cycle again and new apps or new os features
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:24.080]   are coming in the fall but the core problem is like how do regular people ever know that something
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:29.280]   like that lock screen thing that got out of the last last fall it which is so oblique right it's
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:34.880]   not even an app you have to be in the lock screen and then press and hold like how do people even
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:40.880]   know that that exists and what if you're apple how do you strategize to try and get it to be
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.520]   discoverable in some way you know i don't have an answer i just i'm fascinated by how hard the
[01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:52.000]   problem is yeah i'm sorry that they don't that apple doesn't continue to publish like update
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.320]   manuals on on apple books that there used to be like here is an entire like 192 page manual on how
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.400]   to use your ipad and or specifically here is how here is how to use the ipad you know i i
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:10.000]   ipad os whatever whatever with a full prefix says here's the stuff that's brand new with this because
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.280]   there is this i mean ideally things would be simply discoverable and ideally simply having
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.320]   when you finish the update walking you through a simple slideshow of advertisements of things
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:25.120]   that are that are different also would be sufficient but if people just got into the habit of hey look
[01:58:25.120 --> 01:58:29.360]   there's a whole document that explains not only what these features are but how actually to use them
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:34.720]   i i don't know why apple doesn't do that anymore i wish they did i think they leave it up to people
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:38.560]   to do it and i think that not as many people do it anymore that they used to there used to be those
[01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:43.920]   those great little manuals that people would put out yeah i know that for me on a daily basis
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.920]   on some app i'm i'll do something like i wonder how to do this and then when you see what apple did
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:53.040]   you're like whoa that's cool you know like it and i was i did i was doing this thing where i was
[01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:57.280]   showing countdown clocks inside a keynote like you can do a countdown clock for your show
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:04.880]   and when i was prepping for it this morning for office hours i i uh i went did magic move from
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:10.000]   one to the other so thinking that oh it'll reset and move my countdown clock it kept the
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.400]   countdown clock running like it just i started on on by the third slide it was just it just kept
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:19.120]   on running in seconds and just moving it along and changing the images behind it and and that was
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:23.200]   like you know like i've never seen that published anywhere like i'm sure that they did somewhere
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:27.840]   it's in some note that oh by the way magic moves will keep your video running i mean it
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:32.480]   is probably connected to the backgrounds that run and everything else but but the um you know apple
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:36.640]   does a lot of things and they do one thing apple does that if you're listening you're an educator
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:42.320]   they do education seminars uh any webex or something like that and i've sat in some of those and that's
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:45.520]   another one of those ones where i said i sit in the keynote ones because i do use keynote a lot
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:50.000]   and um there's stuff on the iPad that i you know like you can just take your pencil
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.320]   grab onto an object with your pencil and just swirl it around and you've now built an animation
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:58.640]   path like you know like you've just you know and and uh and the first time they did that i you know i
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:02.480]   feel like i know keynote pretty well i've been using it since version one and as soon as they do it i
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:09.520]   think i had an audible like oh like holy smokes and i think to your point it's unfortunate that apple
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:15.920]   leaves out you know doesn't educate us because i mean half of the problem is i and i i will say
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:21.440]   this is not an apple problem this is everybody's problem is that there is so much value locked in
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:26.560]   devices that we don't know about they spend millions of dollars developing things i've said this
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:30.480]   often times about my microwave that i know how to turn it on and i know what the power is it's got
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:34.800]   all kinds of fuzzy logic in there that can cook my my my chicken and everything else but it's hard
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:39.440]   to figure out how to do it and so i don't do it i just turn it on and give it some time and move on
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:44.480]   yeah and that's the the delta there is wetware development which is teaching me and make creating
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:49.760]   an app and nowadays i get these apps all the time i'm almost expected i get i'll get some app and i
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:54.160]   i i i'm looking for the qr code like where's the qr code because there's somewhere like if you buy
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:59.200]   a the screen for this this little protective screen that i have on the front had a qr code i put i
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:04.560]   hit it it opened up a movie on youtube that showed me exactly how to do how to put that that project
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:11.200]   protect you know and there's no amount of explanation there's no there's no manual that can tell me
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:16.000]   how to put that screen on as well as a video and so they just they have a manual they i mean have a
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.680]   step-by-step that's there that you can follow but there was a little qr code and i hit it and boom
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:23.920]   i knew understood it and i think that not just apple but everybody has to get better at that because
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:29.200]   you know especially with software yeah it's uh it's a super hard problem in the discord the
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:34.000]   wheel right uh said well don't they you know when when you update to your new o s isn't there a big
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.520]   thing that says here are all the new features the answer is yes but the problem is i think a lot of
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.640]   times people just want to use their phones right they're like oh i had to wait for it to restart
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:47.200]   now i want to use your phone i i this happens to me when i use i'm on a lot of beta so i'm on a lot of
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.840]   test flight things and like test flight you open the app and it's got to think it's like here all the
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:56.480]   new beta features and check this out and all of that and every time i launch an app that's got one of
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.960]   those i'm like god not now to the slide i want to use this app right because in the end i didn't launch
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:06.640]   it to read about beta features i launched it to use the app and so when you're you can do that and
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.560]   maybe you'll get them in the right moment but i think that the challenge is that a lot of times
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.720]   they're not ready to learn and they're not ready to sit down and have a whole session about the 20
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:19.040]   features that you added you think they should know about so like how do you get them later and like
[02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:24.000]   an example that i found that that every time i recount this there are people and they'll be people
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.040]   who are listening now or who are going to be like no way i can't believe you could do that
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:32.080]   one of my wife's complaints was when she's got an app that gets added to page nine and she wants
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:36.160]   it on page one she has to tap and hold until it wiggles and then she drags it over to the left
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:40.800]   side to the edge and then it moves one page and then she waits or wiggles it and moves another
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.360]   page and i said well did you know that if you put another finger down you can swipe with that finger
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:50.640]   while i didn't do that i didn't even know that all the way to page one really fast oh my god
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:54.640]   they added that like two years ago but it doesn't anybody else so so then i would say
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:00.640]   wouldn't it be interesting if apple could do something like see somebody slow dragging an app
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:06.720]   and say hey did you know that there's a faster way to do this but that's the challenge is like
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:11.680]   how do you do that how do you cue that how do you observe behavior and then and then you know
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:16.000]   you don't want to be clippy but you do want to like intercede at some point and say there's a
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.160]   faster way to do this or or how do you put something up on the lock screen that says
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:27.840]   hey would you like a cooler lock screen you know tap me to find out right like and the
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:32.480]   pro is judging you we're just saying it's a challenge it's just really hard and the hardest
[02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:35.680]   thing is is that like adobe will try to do that when you open up every time you open up photoshop
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:39.120]   it wants to tell you something new and you're like oh my gosh where do i turn this off you know
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:44.000]   like so it's it's it's that's the the balance is always like it tries to help you and then you're
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.400]   half the time you're like i want your help um yeah yeah and then they have the tips app as uh
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.760]   wheel writes pointing out in the discord and it's absolutely true but again you have this user
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.880]   problem of like a lot of users are like oh boy i will read some tips now right like or they
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:02.320]   where they come out is push notifications and they end up getting in your way and like that's
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:06.800]   part of the challenges is like Andy said well Andy and Alex have both covered this like the
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:10.640]   microwave problem is great right which is just like i just pushed the button and it cooks the
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.800]   food i don't want to read a manual about it and that's like there are manual readers out there
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:21.440]   and bless them but like you do you do it's software like you need to hold people's hands a little bit
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.800]   more and be like don't want to bother you sorry to bother you but did you just noticed did you
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:30.960]   notice this thing because people are most people are not going to curl up with the manual they're
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:35.760]   just not and and the thing is is like a june i have a june at home in my in my house and and
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:41.840]   they do it really well in the sense that it just kind of works but oh you can attach your phone and
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:47.520]   oh you know like and they have they have stuff that you can learn how to you know make like you know
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:51.440]   and you you learn how to make something and we make something i like we learn how to do something
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:54.640]   with the june like the first week and we we make it at least once a week you know like you know like
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:59.280]   you know yeah we need to we don't do it the same way roasted Brussels sprouts yep for us it's like
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:03.920]   it's like potatoes with carrots or something like that and and the thing is is that but what they
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:07.760]   did really well and i think heston does this really well where they have these tutorials on how to
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:12.720]   make new dishes with their product you know and they spent a lot of money on those like like it's
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:16.960]   not like they said oh we're going to give you a little like how to there's little videos of how to do
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:21.200]   each piece and how to put all that together and it makes a big difference and you and it adds a
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:26.880]   lot of value to the product without actually engineering anything new it's just video you know
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:32.000]   and and i think that uh you know it's it's it's missing and it's like it should be everywhere yeah
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.760]   it's a huge problem with all soft hands yeah yeah yeah and hard work and hard work and hard work
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:40.720]   technology it's just technology it's uh they can do a lot of things and nobody ain't nobody got time
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:46.480]   for that mmm it's our or if they don't are totally at sea they'll learn at one time but like to tell
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:51.680]   them we have improved it to do a new way it's like yeah i'm just going to use my way that i use and
[02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:55.920]   and the hard part is is that i've been thinking about putting together uh keynote tips because
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:59.120]   because my whole thing is i do all these keynote things but if you do a search online it's always
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:03.360]   like you know there's like the first minute and a half on youtube of now subscribe to my channel
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:07.920]   and now i would have real problems yes and and the problem that you may have i'm like i know what
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:14.000]   the problem is and it's in the title of the video i just need i want you to start with this is how
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000]   to do the thing that's not how you build an audience on youtube that's a bad youtube video
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.560]   stuff so well i you know i think it's uh just playing the game i mean this is this is the whole
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:27.360]   thing about all of these platforms is you play the you you tune yourself to the algorithm which is
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:32.880]   necessarily what users want but that's how you get discovered have you seen a recipe page on the
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:38.400]   web oh my god oh the recipes at the bottom of the bottom of the word essay is about how they made
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:42.400]   this recipe for their mom and then the recipes at the very bottom with every two inches there's
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:46.000]   like four more ads there's like four more ads in the other two inches or four more ads and it's the
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:51.440]   yeah whenever i make shake and bake i'm always taking back to this my skip period for months
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:58.880]   and i met and i helped all right we we're gonna take a little break come back with your picks of
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:04.800]   the week so guys get those ready you're watching mac break weekly and those of you who are in club
[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:12.560]   twit the picks are gonna happen right away because you don't get any ads now ad-free is just one of
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:18.480]   many benefits club twit members get really important to us but i mean the biggest benefit you get is
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:23.280]   that twit sticks around that we will continue to do this show and our other shows because times are
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:29.600]   tight for podcasters everywhere they're cutting back they're laying off shows are disappearing we
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:36.720]   realized at least i realized two years ago that the real future of twit lay in its audience you
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:42.720]   are community that's the strength of twit and so as a result we started club twit seven but i'm
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:48.480]   gonna lead with the most important part seven bucks a month it's a couple of lattes a month
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:54.640]   actually not if you go to starbucks it's like a half a latte but nevertheless seven bucks a month
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:08:00.880]   you get completely ad-free versions of all of the shows including this uh you get access to our
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:06.160]   discord which is a really fantastic even mr beast says you should subscribe to our discord
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:13.360]   fantastic community of itself you also get shows that we don't put out in the public including the
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:19.760]   new ai show with jeff and jeff javis and uh chase and howl are putting together for us we're very

[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.120]   but the club members are paying for these shows they're making it possible so we want to make
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:46.480]   sure they get access and uh and you know what if a show does well and builds an audience like
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:52.000]   this we can space did we start it in the club we put it out in public after it builds an audience
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:57.680]   so the club is really an important incubator for us it's a way to keep the lights on keep the staff

[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:41.360]   codec and i have to first find something that will play aptix lossless but that review will
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:49.040]   be part of hands-on tech the re-returned review show uh that's club only twit.tv/club twit
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:54.480]   sorry to interrupt sorry to do this uh but if if only a few percent right now it's about one
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:59.760]   percent of the audience if five percent of the audience subscribed we'd be golden that's all i need
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:05.520]   that's all i need maybe you're one of the five percent uh time for our picks of the week Jason
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:13.120]   snell kicker off if you will sure i have had a max server in my house forever aren't you fancy
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:20.000]   since the since the beige g3 days and uh really you know i i used to do very different things that
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.120]   i do now on the max server but i love having a mac mini uh it's been a mac mini for a long time now
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:31.200]   in my house however if if you don't know like back in the day macos 10 server was a thing and apple
[02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:37.760]   build all these tools that would go on top of the unix stuff that's in macos and macos 10
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.560]   to do server stuff and over the years apple has gradually sloughed off every single one of those
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:49.440]   features they in the latest couple of versions they don't even do uh you know pythons not in there
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:53.920]   and you like all of the scripting stuff is dropped and a lot of the server stuff is dropped there's
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:11:00.160]   very little left of that and i still run a web server on my uh for a bunch of stuff on my uh on
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:07.760]   my home server anyway i i just upgraded to an m2 mac mini and that meant updating to beyond
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:13.440]   mohavi which is what i was on on my old server classic and all and it stripped away the last
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:18.720]   vestiges of anything that apple built in of scripting languages and and uh unix servers and
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:25.360]   stuff like that and i decided finally to just not not keep migrating the same server i've been
[02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:32.880]   migrating for 20 years but instead um embrace the new world and so instead of you know getting out
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:38.400]   i mean i installed homebrew but like instead of installing a million different things on the command
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:43.840]   line i decided to i i actually actually already bought a license for it to do some word press
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:51.120]   testing uh thing called mamp and mamp pro um it basically mamp it sounds like a horror movie
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:59.040]   monster but what it is is is mac amp in the sense of what is that apache my sequel php
[02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:04.320]   basically it's an app with an installer and there's a pro version that has more features so there
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:13.280]   is a lamp stack has been around forever linux apache my sql and php this is this is a mamp stack
[02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:18.240]   yeah but the the idea here is that instead of doing all that especially since apple used to
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:23.680]   provide graphical interface controls for all of these features and has abandoned it entirely
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:31.600]   this is a mac installer that runs a web server and will run wordpress it will install php so you
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:35.040]   don't have to do it through homebrew or something like that by the way because a lot of people don't
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:40.640]   want php python pearl and ruby or exactly if you don't want apachee engiennex so it's it's really
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:46.320]   up to date updated which is great yeah it is in some ways this this app reminds me so much of
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:52.000]   what apple was trying to do with mac OS 10 server back in the day which is create a mac app that
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.120]   has all that unique server stuff behind it it was very easy i was able to use let's encrypt
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:03.440]   to to get my own ssl certificate and it in a point it at the certificate and then it just worked
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:09.600]   you know it was not it was a lot easier let me tell you then trying to install all of that
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:14.800]   software and edit all those text files to get it to be exactly what i wanted so if you were thinking
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:20.720]   and i will say i the number one reason i started using mamp was because i was doing
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:26.640]   wordpress development for six colors when we moved to wordpress and i needed a local server to do that
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:32.800]   and rather than i i tried to install all the things that were required to get wordpress up and running
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:39.200]   on my mac and it was a nightmare and with mamp you literally turn it on mamp pro you turn it on and
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:45.680]   you say yes wordpress please and it's done can i still use my mac if it's running yeah yeah it runs
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:50.000]   in the background it's it's invisible in fact other than when you're administering it it's just
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.080]   running it's just you know if it's your mac then if you restart it or sleep it or whatever then your
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:58.960]   server goes away but um but yeah you can do it in fact that's what i did i spent an entire summer
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:04.640]   doing wordpress development where what i was doing was on my on my mac here on my desk i just had that
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:10.720]   as a local host server running wordpress so i could fix my templates and debug them and do all
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:16.080]   those things and it was a lot easier than trying i know if you're super eunuch savvy it's going to
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:19.840]   be second nature for you to install this stuff but if you're a mac user who knows just enough to be
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:25.840]   dangerous you know you could be a little less dangerous and use your mac user skills by using
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:31.120]   this app instead plus it has a nice control panel centralized control panel which makes it
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:36.320]   much easier i think yeah so there's a free version and then pro pro version is 90 dollars and has
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:41.040]   a lot of detail and multi-site and all of that but there is a free version if you want to get started
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:44.640]   but it was totally worth it for me and i'm glad that i've been able to repurpose it now for my
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:53.040]   server yeah m a m p dot info for mamp not a great name but a great name a great product
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:58.720]   and a little elephant icon it's cute oh yeah yeah think about the elephants think about the elephants
[02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:04.480]   andi and aqua pick of the week a slightly controversial pick uh now that i'm not going to
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:11.440]   recommend ulysses again but it is it one of the signatures of 2023 is that i now have gone from
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:16.400]   oh i should definitely like give another ulysses another deep dive because but there's a lot of
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:22.400]   new features too this is now like the center of all of my creative work almost completely
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:26.800]   discreta displacing scriveners i use scriveners scriveners for some novels i'm working on but that's
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:31.680]   about it uh and you know i can always know when a certain like note taking app or writing app or
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:38.000]   whatever has reached that level of you know like on uh in toy story when you know Andy writes his
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.800]   name on the bottom of uh on the toys his feet they're okay hey i'm officially accepted it's when i
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:47.920]   finally start to fine tune the editing environment to make it look exactly the way i want and so i've
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:54.320]   been playing with different mono space fonts i'm just like uh uh just like Jason i used to do most
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:58.480]   of my writing in bb edit and sort of that's that's the environment that kind of put my puts my
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:05.200]   brain into hey i'm writing writing writing for duration not just for fun uh and so i came across
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:13.440]   a fork of a fork of comic sans they called comic mono and what they did what i like okay first of
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:20.480]   all it's mono space but it's fine tuned to not look like comic sans so much as it looks a little bit
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:25.760]   like a friendlier version of monoco of or a friendlier version of like these mono space
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:31.440]   terminal fonts that i normally wind up going with uh and yeah when you put it up at like at 18 points
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.880]   no it doesn't look very good but at text editing size it looks pretty nice and it's and it's free
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:45.600]   do you do the titles in papyrus you know what yeah you're not serious people are they no
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.560]   uh no no it's i mean at least i'm not using helvetica man
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:55.840]   well actually they're there i shouldn't i shouldn't throw shade at helvetica either because it's a very
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:00.240]   nice sturdy nice sturdy it's all it's all about it's all about the the character spacing it's all about
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:04.080]   new it's like how vidica new i mean you know but but but but but you know but you know what i'm
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:08.960]   talking about where what i like about the editing environment that like that bb edit threw me into
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.440]   is that it really when you're just using markdown for all your formatting because yeah i do need to
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:18.480]   throw some italics and there's sometimes i do need to throw headers into there uh it's nice to be
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:23.680]   able to i'm i don't care what i i my mind gets distracted by ooh you know what there's there's
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:27.760]   some space between the header and the fix and the following paragraph but i'd like there to be a
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:33.440]   little bit more space between whereas if i'm just using a mono space font and just tagging as i go
[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:38.880]   i don't care i just get to the words but that that that isn't to say that you can't get something a
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:45.360]   little bit better than like a basic typewriter font if you're terminal and i don't know if i'm
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:50.240]   gonna keep it but i like it and i will certainly i will certainly never print this out or share
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:54.960]   this in a pdf with anybody who has to read it but as someone who sometimes has to read like four
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.760]   five six thousand words worth of stuff that i just read before like turning it to something that is
[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:05.440]   going to be a pdf for other people to read it's a little bit more pleasant than like menlo was my
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:09.200]   previous default and it's kind of a toss up between the two i might actually think i might
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:15.040]   think this a lot yeah comic mono has a little something about it yeah it'll just a little bit
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:21.680]   of difference honestly like the ibm selectric font uh a little bit of like an orator yeah it
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:26.800]   doesn't it doesn't look like what it doesn't look like is comic sans it just looks like a jovial
[02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:33.600]   terminal font a little less a little less of a terminal to monoco but not quite a tighter yeah
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:40.560]   yeah like the monoco if it dropped acid and spent some time in an ashtray i have installed it and
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:46.400]   i'm going to make it be my default font for a while just just for fun i like it comic just just
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:50.240]   don't just don't tell people what it was derived from or people like Alex will just like make you
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:57.600]   feel like you're supposed to be ashamed of it sorry man Alex you're so mean you got you got
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:01.520]   you got to poke holes in my robo don't you Alex every single time i'm gonna break this
[02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:06.480]   cream during my submarine when you're talking about the the impact of of videos anytime someone
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:10.800]   says papyrus or comic sans all i can think of the saturday live sleep skit i can't there's
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:16.480]   like it's just completely embedded into my into my bios at this point yeah comic sans is pretty
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:22.320]   reprehensible but comic mono no not so much i think it's kind of cute we actually had a you know we
[02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:27.040]   had a discussion on office hours about it with someone who works in top topography and she actually
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:31.520]   was talking about how readable comic sans is i mean that's what makes it yeah it's actually a very
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.640]   readable font that that very specifically so while a lot of who make fun of it it actually has a
[02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:42.400]   a certain power and it is a nerd font it does support i'm using it right now and i like it it
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:49.920]   supports the nerd font uh uh ligatures and things so that this is a this is a good choice i like it
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:56.240]   it'll make it bigger so you can see it like i see that's pretty that's pretty i think that looks nice
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:03.920]   i'm gonna use that for now on yeah yeah thank you Andy good choice i made fun of it but i've already
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:11.360]   told it it's not comic sans it's pretty it's uh it looks like order you're right it's uh yeah it's
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:15.760]   it's like comic sans once it's grown out of an it's awkward teens it's grown longer wearing the black
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:21.520]   trench coat it's no longer shopping at hot topic it's integrated it's childhood into a very sturdy
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:28.240]   adulthood yeah exactly mr uh Alex Lindsey pick of the week so i was talking earlier about the the
[02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:34.400]   little thing that i was doing in in uh keynote let me see if i can get this to uh see um so this was
[02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:37.680]   this is what i was talking about before was this and and the thing you want to know is these images
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:42.560]   are all made in the movie so this is uh this is all in my mid-journey but but this is the cool
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:48.320]   thing with keto does you go like this it keeps on ticking and then it goes like this and then it just
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:53.440]   these are all mid-journey five point two generated yeah these are all so my tip my pick is mid-journey
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:20:59.360]   uh of this is this is all everything is fine or it's all or that is this is fine uh yeah with a
[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:04.800]   minute with a minion you know you know and despicable this is fun oh yes yeah yeah exactly um so so
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:11.920]   anyway uh five point two is out um it's it's pretty slick you know um if we uh let me see if i can pop
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:18.000]   over to uh this is the interface here um if you look at it here one of the things you'll see now is
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:24.720]   this zoom out uh so you can zoom out 1.5 you can do a custom zoom uh you also can vary it a lot or a
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:30.240]   little so if something's closed but uh not quite right you can do do a subtle of variance whereas
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:34.720]   you can or you can do strong which is kind of the normal one that they have out there um and uh you
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:39.440]   can build really fun things so uh this is the i think we were talking about a light seal earlier so
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:44.400]   i put the light seal in and you'll see me all i did was type it in and then i started zooming out and
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:49.760]   picking ones uh during the commercial breaks and um and so i started doing that and what i ended up
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:54.800]   with is just to give you a sense of this and this is just during the during our commercial breaks
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:22:00.800]   um everybody has a hobby uh and so this is mine and so here you have this kind of infinite zoom
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:12.400]   um oh i gotta grab one of this so just keep zooming in to our seal you know so basically i started
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:17.120]   here and now you'll see a little edge i'd have to paint that out but it's pretty close it would
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:20.160]   take very little to fix it this is what a lot of people are doing right now is doing these zoom
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:25.520]   out but so as you start to zoom out that's just a while just stacking these images on top of each
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:29.120]   other and then it comes up with another seal you're like it'll lose some eggs yeah like like
[02:22:29.120 --> 02:22:33.600]   because when you pull out a little further oh there's other seals so it's a good one adding seals to
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:38.880]   it but but anyway the point is is that it's it's a really slick uh you know for a lot of us who got
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:42.480]   a close-up but really wanted something a little further back or or you know you didn't get the full
[02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:47.840]   you know gave you a waist up when you went into the full body shot all those things are now
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:54.240]   kind of doable and its quality is way higher again um one thing that people are showing that i
[02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:58.960]   haven't gotten to work yet is the ability to do paint in and then have it actually just build
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:02.560]   something this is new in Photoshop or at least they showed it in Photoshop where you can
[02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:06.800]   basically take a big marker and just say this is green and this is blue and then say give me a
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:10.320]   valley and it'll just follow it'll just build that for you and that's they're showing that in
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:13.360]   Photoshop and some people are saying oh that works in mid-journey too i haven't got that to work yet
[02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:19.520]   but but the um but 5.2 is you know it's a huge probably the biggest jump since three to four
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:26.080]   i mean or three to three point whatever to four so um it's a it's a big jump forward so it's worth
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:31.680]   checking out a few it's beautiful images i mean it's just it's yeah it's crazy i'll just try it again
[02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:37.120]   slash i haven't really gone deep haven't really gone deep dive on it and for like about a year
[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:42.320]   so yeah i think yeah yeah it's come a long way oh it's photo realistic it's like a decade it's
[02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:45.760]   like yeah you're i've been playing a lot with the photoshop infill feature but though that's like
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:50.720]   oh my goodness this is this is the best kind of like exciting technology the kind of technology
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:55.600]   that might get a lot of people scared because it's so easy so we do cool things with it the cool
[02:23:55.600 --> 02:23:59.600]   thing is you start you can use the photoshop infill with five point with with mid-journey so what
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:02.640]   you do is you build the image in mid-journey but you want to change a couple things and you just
[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:08.000]   select it in photoshop and say put a screen here or put this here and photoshop will infill the
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.360]   it'll take the mid-journey image but infill the new thing that you asked for but blended into
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:18.240]   you know the mid-journey thing that you started with and so there's a the two of them together is
[02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:23.840]   pretty give me a mid-journey tip so i'm in our we have a mid-journey channel in our club twit discord
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:29.760]   i'm uh and i slash settings to launch the mid-journey bot look at my settings here i don't know how well
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:38.560]   you can see those but i've got mid-journey 5.2 raw mode right uh stylize medium low high very high
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:44.560]   what do you like i leave it on medium and then i i'll just fast if i have to yeah and then i leave
[02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:49.040]   the raw mode i don't leave on all the time because it it's a little bit more i mean it's a little
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:54.960]   more verbatim so the reason when i use raw i'm usually generating the term i'm generating the
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:25:03.680]   prompt from chat gpt right so um what what we have we have a um uh i'll put in a thing that tells
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:08.800]   at what i want like in general this is how to do it and i got this from ken jordan who's in office
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:14.800]   hours and so kensen me this thing that is like this long description of how to do chat gpt uh or how
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:19.920]   to do mid-journey for chat gpt so you set that up in the chat gpt setting and then then you say
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.320]   what you want oh and then it'll build out uh and then it builds out so it builds you want to do that
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:29.600]   oh yeah builds the prompt is that how you always do it you do chat gpt for the prompt no no
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:34.880]   sometimes i just if i'm having trouble getting it done with my own prompts is when i use chat gpt
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:41.680]   to see like oh chat gpt do with us and so um so anyway but the i mean the the big thing is is
[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:50.160]   picking cameras and sensors tends to be really powerful so um what's the thing that's uh i got
[02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:55.280]   a couple of them uh it depends depends on what i'm shooting um we've been using a lot of Alex's
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:26:02.240]   thumbnails if you see the windows weekly thumbnails it's Paul tharata the dinosaur from last week
[02:26:02.240 --> 02:26:08.640]   it was quite good i liked it quite a bit yeah the it's it's great for thumbnails i will say that this
[02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:14.960]   is it is a it is just a killer um let's see i use i have a lot of a7s threes you know that i use
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:20.800]   i use that and do short depth of field um i have one that i it's underwater that i use an eos rebel
[02:26:20.800 --> 02:26:24.720]   uh you know it's like and i steal these from other people like you see someone else you see an
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:29.360]   imposive like you go what are they doing and then i copy their prompts and i have a notes i in my
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:34.480]   in my apple notes i have my cheat sheet which is just all the things that i that created something
[02:26:34.480 --> 02:26:41.120]   that i liked and i keep it there so that i can grab the the pieces out of it uh r8 uh but but like a
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:49.600]   panoramic view captured by a canon r8 400 millimeter f5 uh a cinematic photography style and then and
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:54.800]   then i um so i put something in front of that and then i put that in there and i get an image and
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:27:01.520]   i play with different ones but like a d850 ds lr 105 you know with a 2.8 lens i mean it now the
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:05.440]   interesting thing in the and i haven't had time to do this in 5.2 there's a shortened command
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:09.680]   inside of mid-journey now where you put your prompt in and say shorten this and it'll shorten it but
[02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:15.040]   it'll also analyze it it'll say hey this is this is what i actually paid attention to so i'm learning
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:19.520]   because we've always had this thing like i don't know if those terms actually mean anything but within
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:23.440]   mid-journey you see them a lot so i put them you put them in you end up with these really long prompts
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:27.520]   to try to define something and now mid-journey will tell you yeah i'm not paying attention to
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:31.600]   that these are the only these are the only things i was paying this is this is what i
[02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:36.960]   thought you gave me this big prompt and i took these things out wow that's so few just uh so the
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:40.400]   so the i think that there's a lot of things that were you know that we're learning it's a
[02:27:40.400 --> 02:27:46.880]   it's it's moving at a fairly frightening speed you know it's it's really it's it's an amazing
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:53.200]   um and it's it's a lot of fun and i you know i use both uh you know chat gpt and mid-journey
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:58.320]   you know every day and i do a lot of presentations and so all of my to make my presentations much more
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:04.800]   fun i use mid-journey all the time over um over a plain white background i just make objects you
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:09.040]   like those plain white backgrounds i know yeah well it's just that because i put it over it makes
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:13.120]   it easy to put it over a keynote document and then you but you can have things appear and disappear and
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.480]   it just looks like they belong there and um so i i that's why i do it is it's just the easiest
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:22.240]   thing to keep if you do it over a plain black background by the way it just becomes a really
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:26.880]   dark image so it's not very you know just very dark you know and so that's why i don't do that so
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:34.800]   i tried the a7s three with uh the prompt a typical comic sans user unfortunately it's all the word
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:41.120]   comic and decided forget the a7s three i'm making this like a comic book well so so yeah add something
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:49.040]   like realistic to it uh photo real realistic yeah um and and say shot with a7s three you don't want
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:54.240]   to just say a7s three i'll say shot with shot with oh good see learning learning learning
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:59.040]   this is fun it is fun to play with you can if you are a member of club twit go into our
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:05.440]   little mid-journey channel and uh and start playing with that among many great channels in the uh
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:10.320]   club twit discord and the and the most interesting thing is is that i mean now the mid-journey now is
[02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:16.480]   like 17 million users on discord or something like that and um it goes so fast there's no
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:21.520]   conversation but or at least i haven't seen a lot but just looking at images and going oh i really
[02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:25.600]   like what they did there and taking them and i grab them and put them into somewhere i've gotten
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:29.280]   to the point where my mid-journey cheat sheet and notes has to become like a database like search
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:35.360]   for this because i don't it's not i have so many in there now it's it's not as useful yeah so yeah
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:38.640]   yeah it's nice to see what other people are doing that was actually smart of them to make it a
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:43.280]   discord uh channel instead of just a general server that anybody could use i thought that was
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:46.640]   very clever yeah and they they set it up so that the cost structure is different like people like
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:50.960]   me pay for private so i don't like my stuff is all on my own but everybody else is like feeding
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:54.960]   into that system all the time or if you're paying just a little bit you're always feeding into that
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:30:00.400]   system so yeah it's a good great way to learn okay i made it more realistic it's still the same guy
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:06.480]   i know but it's realistic hold on he's still rendering he's still rendering here it's gonna be
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:14.560]   it's more realistic but it's 2009 hipster doofus typical comic sense you like shot you're like and
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:21.920]   and it's interesting that it did uh in a realistic you want to do photoreal uh not photoreal not realistic
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:28.640]   but photoreal and and you want to say sony you probably want to say a sony a7s with three eyes uh
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:35.840]   no it's it's pretty like he's actually holding a7s three no it's a can of nevermind but but but
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:43.440]   but uh but you want to you you you kind of have to um like you do learn when you prompt whether
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:48.800]   you're prompting for chat gpt or prompting for mid-journey like every word like that you put in
[02:30:48.800 --> 02:30:53.040]   their matters like it you know because it's gonna drive the whole yeah well this i think is a pretty
[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:59.200]   good uh realistic uh image of a guy who might use comic sans yep some point or another
[02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:07.040]   and this when i'm loving about this generative ai chat boss and everything is that it really is
[02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:11.520]   almost exactly what artificial intelligence sort of uh like but what science fiction told
[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:14.960]   this artificial intelligence would be like programming computers and using computers
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:20.960]   where it's not so much writing code it's knowing how to speak in natural language to the computer
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:25.840]   so that what you're doing is clear like remember remember they seen in the the sequel to 2001
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:32.960]   where uh bob alabones character is like try is explaining to the backup computer of the backup
[02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:37.760]   version of how that i'm gonna run some tests but do do you under do you remember what happened to
[02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:43.040]   how like we we'd like to figure out what happened to it like do what what do you think we should do
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:49.120]   that and try to so if i really hi i'm gonna unplug you just to see what happens and hope that
[02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:53.360]   when i pull you back in but if you but if you ask the right way the computer will completely
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:59.120]   be on board and help you do that yeah yeah it's it it's a lot of fun it's great you know and and
[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:04.880]   and it and i think that uh it you know a lot of this we know is going to get a lot easier like
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:08.320]   everyone will be able to do it and you it'll be much more real language but there's a there's a
[02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:13.440]   kind of an adventure right now of creating stuff and i will say you know i don't use other than my
[02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:18.720]   keynote stuff i don't use the images generally verbatim uh for anything that i work on but what i
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:23.040]   i do use it a lot for concept and as we start getting these paint in things where i can define
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:27.520]   where i want people and what i want them to look like um being able to just say like i just think
[02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:33.120]   they're we're gonna see a lot of pitch decks for a movie or a concept where i can just throw those
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:36.400]   you know you know a lot of times you you build something a mid-journey and you're like i could
[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:41.440]   build a whole movie around that you know like you know it's it's one of those you know like the uh
[02:32:41.440 --> 02:32:43.360]   let's see if i can find it here hold on um
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:50.720]   it can make your kinematics this way like this one this one i was like there's a movie there
[02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:54.400]   yeah there's something going on yeah there's something going on you know like there's you know
[02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:58.880]   there's a story somewhere yeah yeah there's a story there that it that it you know and and so
[02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:03.120]   that's the kind of thing that that you can uh you come up with those concepts you know it's really
[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:10.880]   cool well there's definitely a story in this photo uh this uh this um mid-journey of a homeless
[02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:18.560]   podcaster shot with a sony a7s uh it's gonna quick me that's not fair that's so natural
[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:25.040]   i feel seen hold out i like the i like number four yeah that's the one i'm up scaling yeah here you
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:30.400]   go number four this is uh this is your uh your average now do now do straight-play master see
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:35.600]   how good they actually how do you zoom out how do i do zoom out okay scroll down yeah scroll down
[02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:41.120]   oh zoom out zoom out two out two x two x oh yeah look at that there's just a button to do it that's
[02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:45.440]   so now what it's going to do is it's going to infill it's going to give you uh we can see the scene
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:51.440]   yeah and just keep on going if you want and and um so that's the original and it's working
[02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:56.400]   it's waiting it's waiting there's got got busy now all right well i'll wait that's pretty good
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:34:03.120]   though i kind of like this image yeah this is me in a couple of years i think uh doing the show
[02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:06.560]   it's got a lot of electronics yeah i think being homeless with that much
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:11.440]   electron i think it's a pretty geeky dude to be on this is actually really cool because uh in the
[02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:15.200]   past they would have had kind of something that looked a little bit like headphones but really
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:21.200]   clearly weren't this has gotten much better in terms of the imagery that it's using it's really
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:27.200]   it's really interesting yeah generally the right number of fingers now so it's oh yeah they they
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:31.040]   trained it on fingers didn't they yeah yeah whatever they did they were like i don't know what else
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:36.960]   we're gonna do but its fingers are gonna work so it's pretty amazing here's the uh let me do the
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:43.200]   upscale on the zoom out here so you can see it full size it did i always have it do four uh images
[02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:49.920]   probably got that idea from you it always does it yeah yeah um by the way lisa said uh i promise
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:54.240]   lisa this show be 90 minutes long i said oh yeah we don't have anything to talk about and uh i'm
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:59.680]   only off by an hour so i think it's might be time to wrap this i yeah zoomed out great look at that
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:05.840]   that's really interesting yeah uh it's it really looks like a painting it's kind of amazing
