Transcript:  When I was a kid, there was a TV show called The Whistling Policeman and he had a baton, which he'd twirl, which is actually in hindsight a little threatening.  And he'd whistle and he'd go around through that exact thing.  He'd beat, cover his beat.  That's right.  Why do they call it a beat?  Is he beating his feet on the street?  Maybe that's it.  Andy Anacko probably knows he's a wordsmith and appears regularly on WGBH in Boston.  Hello, wordsmith.

As soon as I retired from the radio show, I said, I don't want to pay dues anymore.  It's like 300 bucks a year.  And I said, can I just be on abeyance?  And they said, yes.  So maybe I don't have to strike.  And secondly, we're not a signatory, so I wouldn't be striking.  I'd be striking myself.

Also with us, Alex Lindsay, he's a video Smith.  090.media is his day job.  Well, I shouldn't even say that.  He spent some time there, but most of the time he's at office hours.

Transcript:  So public betas are out now.  They came out.  In fact, I think as we ended the show last week and I put it on my, I put, I foolishly  put it on my iPhone, iOS 17.  It's a few things don't work, but it's not bad.

Start time: 348.54
End time: 379.54
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I, I, I look, I have written many paragraphs over the years warning people in various ways  about not installing betas on their main systems because they might regret it later.  And I'm kind of over it now.  Apple certifies this as a public beta, right?  So Apple is like, yep, go to it if you want.  And so, you know, I, all I've reduced it to is check to see if the thing that you depend  on for your livelihood, make sure that that still runs.  Beyond that, if you want to get the stuff early and you're willing to deal with a few  bugs, go for it.  Have fun.  Apple says it's okay, basically.

Transcript:  A few of my widgets went blank and then I re-edited them and they came back and just  a few little weird things like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's good.  It's a good thing.  Also, iPad, iOS 17.  I should do that because I have a couple of iPads.  And now Sonoma is out, is out in its public beta as of July 12th.  Same thing, same rule?  I guess so.

Start time: 405.15
End time: 438.80
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's the developability you want to stay the hell away from.  But yeah, the fact that Apple of all companies is saying this is a public beta, we want everybody  to see this, it means that they really do want to get the value of as many people as  possible trying it.  Although what Jason says is absolutely true.  Like don't at least wait a few days to find out, like to read the news to find out, oh  well it turns out that it works.  The only apps that don't work with it are the kinds that take keyboard input.  Other than that, it's solid.  And so if you've got projects that involve keyboard input, you might want to stay away

Start time: 438.94
End time: 446.83
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  from this one.  That's by the way, that's a hypothetical, right?  There is an actual keyboard problem, just so you know.  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.

Start time: 447.60
End time: 501.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's a hypothetical.  It has definitely been much more stable since Apple has made these public betas.  It's been now quite a few years, but it used to be not that way.  And then everyone was a beta tester when they first got it.  So you're a beta tester now or you're a beta tester after release.  I think from a production perspective, I've gone back to thinking that the production  release, like where I'll put it on my computer is somewhere in January.  Yeah, you're actually doing work.  I'm just sitting around looking at my phone.  But I think that for my home computers, I haven't dived into the beta too much.  We have seen people, I guess there's a lot in the camera, like camera effects that are  just built in the Sonoma that have surprised a couple of folks in virtual meetings because  you do a gesture and suddenly all this stuff happens.  And it's not based on like a zoom camera.  It is in the actual Apple camera.  And it doesn't appear to be limited to the camera that's like on your laptop.  It's like it's managing the web cameras.

Start time: 501.74
End time: 562.64
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm using the Opal camera, so not a camera that is from Apple.  But what Apple is doing in Sonoma, and by the way, there's back rumors has a really  nice post in their forums that is people it's like a wiki post where people are putting  in what's broken and what's not.  Most things are not broken.  But anyway, so it patches into your camera.  So it says, oh, yeah, this is this is your camera.  But what it actually is, is like your camera passed through Apple software layer, and then  back out to third party apps.  It can modify it, including doing all of those reactions.  So, you know, theoretically, if you're if you do a third party reaction, you're going  to get it.  And this is a third party camera doing it.  And it does it anyway.  That also means your third party cameras will get the studio light effect, we'll get the  portrait effect, like all that stuff, because Apple is taking it in through its video pipeline,  analyzing your video, finding like subject detection and all that doing layered 3D effects  behind. And they're they're able to do all of that stuff dynamically.  So that's a thing that we can do now.  It's pretty amazing.

Start time: 563.04
End time: 576.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's the Mac rumors form.  If you go to the forums, go to iOS 17, you'll see these wiki posts and you can go to, for  instance, iOS 17, all the little things.  That's really a nice feature.  I like that.

Start time: 576.06
End time: 605.12
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you find something that's broken.  So they're there. Yeah, they've got the supported unsupported apps post on Mac rumors for Mac  OS. OK, that's a good one.  And that's that's the post that will tell you before you will the mission critical thing  that I absolutely need to have or I will lose my job.  Is it there or is it not there?  And so it's just it's good.  Like if you rely on audio hijacker, you rely on crossover or something like that.  You know, you might have some issues, but most people won't.

Start time: 605.40
End time: 629.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, very nice. So this is the article.  And I thought it a little odd, but I checked the date and it is July 18th, 2023.  Apple issues release candidates for iOS 15 point seven point eight.  iPad OS, Mac OS, Big Sur and Monterey.  So you think these are like why would they they're they're bigger than just like the  the rapid update security responses.

Start time: 630.02
End time: 738.78
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, but they are.  So Apple is committed.  There's actually a really good article.  Oh, we're going to talk about that.  Yes. Oh, yeah.  About the idea of like how long is a Mac on the on the OS update train?  How long does that last?  And when will the last Intel Macs fall off of it?  Andrew Cunningham.  Apple's policy is basically a couple.  Yeah, it's an R story. Right. That's right.  So basically, the idea here is that you're on the train for a while  and then and then you fall off of it.  And what happens is you don't fall into the wheels and die.  What happens is your Mac on the on its old OS that it can't update from  is still updated for a couple of years for not features,  but for like security fixes and maybe compatibility fixes.  So they keep a longer stretch.  So if you're too back on.  So Big Sur is a good example where Big Sur is getting close to closer to the end.  But it's not at the end yet.  So they'll do ultimately, you know, you'll take Big Sur and Ventura  and Big Sur is one back now about to be two back.  Right. And so you get your moment.  I think it's because it's a monorail in between.  So yeah, it is. Right. All right.  So Big Sur is basically this is fixing the fix and to die.  Pinin for the fjords release of Big Sur.  It means that if you can't if you're running a Mac that can only run as far as Big Sur,  that's that's kind of way back and you still are protected.  But once once we ship, you know, we get our Sonoma in the fall.  Big Sur then goes into the parked permanently category.  But you still have moderate and Ventura.  So it's a nice feature that I mean, as somebody who occasionally buys these Google  Pixel phones and then like the next year, they're like, not for you.  But Google, you made it.  Apple tries to stretch it out, but it does vary.  As the Andrew Cunningham story pointed out, that sometimes you can really luck out  and you're supported and on the main OS for a very long time.  And other times, not so much.

Start time: 739.16
End time: 827.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, yeah, I was surprised that there isn't a set policy  because Google has now done that with both Android and and encourages  all Android developers to do some sort of commitment as to the number of years of  updates and Chromebooks are technically have, I think, eight years.  So if you buy a new Chromebook today, you're guaranteed eight years from it.  Well, and this is the thing not from the day you buy it from the day of its release.  So if you buy a three year old Chromebook, that's going to give you five years.  Windows is pretty much is pretty clear about each version of the operating system.  You know, 10 years to end of life.  And then but Apple is and this is an interesting article.  I was very interested in Andrew Cunningham's  maintaining a spreadsheet on how long each Mac is being supported.  And it really does vary.  The average Mac gets six point six years of Mac OS updates  that add new features, another two years of security only updates. Right.  But that's not always the case, depending on the Mac.  The shortest lived Mac is the 2008 version, the white Mac book,  which only got two point seven years of Mac OS updates  and another three point three years of security updates.  So I guess you could say, well, we're pretty sure we're going to have six years  and we might have more.  And then if you transition like from PowerPC to Intel or Intel to M1,  that changes things a little bit, too.  So this I would I would recap this article if I could.  But it's it's it's kind of hard to see a trend here.

Start time: 829.42
End time: 906.12
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a it's a great article.  Andrew does really, really, really good work.  They're in depth. Yeah.  And this is this is a great example of him doing the math and following the updates.  And I mean, I think what the Apple does have a policy, but their policy is,  you know, your when your Mac finally is not able to run an update,  you've got essentially a couple more years before the security updates don't happen.  It's not like your Mac stops working, but the security updates stop.  And I just changed a server out that was running Mojave. Right.  So I was already off.  I had fallen completely off at that point. It still worked.  It was just increasingly difficult to work with it  because all sorts of new features were launching.  There are a bunch of features this fall that are coming to notes and reminders  where if you've got a device that's not on the latest, it basically says,  it's not going to see this note at all. Right.  It's like it's just it's gone. You can't see it anymore.  So there's a lot of pressure that Apple's putting there.  But the bottom line is you you usually are going to get, you know,  four or five years where you're on the main line of updates.  And then you'll get a couple of years grace where you, you know,  you won't be on the latest and greatest, but you'll be safe and protected.  And it's it's not bad.  But I mean, the variance is if you buy a model that's been hanging out  for a long time, the clock has been ticking while you haven't had that computer.

Start time: 906.56
End time: 935.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We also know because of things like OpenCore Legacy Patcher  that you can often run older versions of the OS on a Mac,  even though Apple doesn't support it.  So I think this is the question.  Is it planned obsolescence or is it a is there a real technical reason for this?  Of course, we should say nobody expects a company to  support anything indefinitely.  There comes a time when you just don't want to devote resources to it.  But it is a legit question if Apple's doing this prematurely.

Start time: 936.90
End time: 992.66
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I don't know. I think their track record is that they've been doing this.  I'm always surprised in the last couple of years,  they had some big changes with Apple Silicon and with the 32 bit thing.  But like I'm usually very surprised at how many Macs, old Macs  are still supported when they do an update.  They they they seem it looks to me like they only migrate them off  when there's a real technical reason when they have to dump them off  and not just because their clock expired.  And you see that where when a raft of systems goes, you're like,  oh, they're all like this.  They all have this thing that they don't have and they've decided to drop it.  So I think that they try really hard to keep things on.  And when they do dump something off and you can do a patch and get it running,  generally, it's because it's kind of janky or it is a missing feature.  And they've just decided they're going to say no.  But I think they try to be aggressive.  At least that's my my impression is that they try to keep Macs  on the current version as long as they can.

Start time: 992.70
End time: 1005.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there any reason they don't make a commitment of some kind,  like as Google has with Chromebooks now?  By the way, Google didn't for the longest time and had the same  kind of weird update schedules.  Well, can we get Apple to do that?

Start time: 1006.06
End time: 1037.36
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think it's I think it's based because it's not based on time.  It's based on what feature set that they're building into it  and whether they can so it's unpredictably support it.  So it's just kind of like, well, we can't, you know, that's I think that that's the  yeah. And again, at some point, I think that they just have to say,  you know, like you can't keep on looking into the past.  So I think that they do keep it going because the current OS also works.  So remember, it's not like it's four year old computer.  Something that can run big sur  is something that goes.  Generally further back from big sur by years, right?

Start time: 1037.44
End time: 1075.80
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So also, it's don't the the I think they're changing how they approach this, too,  because it used to be much more like new features come and everybody gets new features.  And over the last few years, they have changed to a model where you've gotten older Mac,  that you get the new update, but these three features don't work for you.  And that's especially happened with Intel Macs, but it's not just Intel Macs.  They do this thing where they're like, you know, you need here's a new feature of Sonoma,  but these Macs can't use that feature.  You can use Sonoma, but not that feature.  And it makes me wonder if their long game is to try to extend the compatibility  window as long as they can.

Start time: 1076.92

Start time: 1079.76
End time: 1085.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. And rolling out new features that they're not going to support on those old systems.  So your system is supported, but the new features not supported.

Start time: 1086.26
End time: 1149.76
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Also, this is still a competitive market that I know that the market for Macs  is separate from pretty much everything else.  But every time that a computer is bricked, like every time a computer becomes useless  to somebody and gets replaced, that is a window of opportunity for that customer to buy  something else or for them to have someone to talk them into buying something else.  So it very much behooves them to make sure these things have as long a life as possible.  And if Apple doesn't make explicit promises about how long they're going to be supporting  their hardware, it's because they have a really great track record.  I think all of us have that one like sort of mutant like off  a really, really old Mac that's still like it's in the kitchen because it looks nice  and it's good enough to run a browser and to play YouTube videos.  Whereas Google on most of their products, particularly Chromebooks, they really have to  promise school systems that, hey, if you're going to be buying 500 of these Chromebooks,  we promise that you that the you will be still getting security updates until this  date and then it's not going to be ended any any earlier than that.  So that's that's that's pretty damn good.

Start time: 1150.60
End time: 1161.66
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. And I mean, I'm still I got a 2012 right here.  Mac Mini still cooking away, you know, providing some web pages for me.  And you know, and that's the thing is that it doesn't really brick.  It just means that it's not.

Start time: 1161.80
End time: 1205.80
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Right. Meaning that meaning like you can't you can no longer.  It no longer does the thing that you need to get done on this because updates to  APIs mean that you can't get the latest version of Ulysses or whatever word processor  you're using. I mean, but yeah, I've got a 2011 like Intel Mac Mini on the other side  of the office that as soon as I replace it with like an M2, I thought I'm going to get  the M1 on the way for the M2. And now I'm like, oh, the might be able to get a better  one for the M3. But as soon as like I replace it, this 12 year old or 13 year old or 14  year old, this rate Mac is going to still be like it's still going to be a server.  It might become a dedicated Plex server because it's still pretty good.  It's pretty nimble at what it does.  It just it's I just can't use it for the thing that I do every single day.

Start time: 1206.56
End time: 1224.70
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think actually one of the big challenges Apple is going to have is that the M1 and  M2 have so few moving parts and they are so much more powerful than what most people  buying them need. Like I'm just amazed at how much an M1 will do on its own, that the  upgrade path for that could be very, very, very long.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I'm getting ready to finally get my kids some new iPads, but they've had the first pro  one, which was 2015 or 2016, and they've been happily using that since it was released.  And it has to do with I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the and this  is where Apple I think could maybe improve things is that the app developers are just  not doing anything that pushes the hardware that you know, like the you know, that they're  not getting to a point where they're reaching the hardware limit.

Start time: 1256.52
End time: 1318.80
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It makes me wonder if in the Apple Silicon era, we might see extended compatibility if  one of the reasons they're shifting to this like you get it, but not all of it approach  is that maybe Apple Silicon Max will stay on the latest version for a really long time,  but with some features as they come in that they're like, not this feature for you, but  you get to stay on. And I would love that because what that means is that you're on the  mainline security update flow and you're you're on the APIs that everybody expects,  which means your software is not going to degrade and and your iCloud stuff isn't going  to partially break because some systems are you know, all that stuff stays the same.  And it's just that oh, that whizzy new video effect isn't there.  And that I think that would be a much better approach.  Like keep people on the mainline without some of the features that don't work as well or  require a bit of hardware that wasn't in the M1 but is in the M2.  Like, I hope that's where they go with this.  So that like even five, six years out, they're still on the mainline, even if they're  missing some of the marquee features.

Start time: 1319.26
End time: 1387.16
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  There is one area in which I think Apple could improve that.  Again, they built they build the hardware so damn well that they have these machines  that are 10, sometimes 15 years old.  They're still like I have an iMac that is 15 years old that I would love to find a use  for. I'm running I'm running Chrome OS on it because it's the easiest thing to do with  it. I wish that they take took the extra effort to make it really, really easy to  locate old versions of operating systems and do clean installs on older Macs that  predate that really cool just hey, just hold on a button and we'll be able to get you  going via a network.  It's not true for everything.  It used to be there was at least like an FTP site that if you do the secret handshake,  you could download and make an installer media for pretty much anything that's that has  an Apple logo on it. Apple doesn't have to do that no long no more than like GM has to  support a 1950s car.  But it would be nice given that they they do have machines that they don't look like they  were made out of animal skins and twigs.  They're still very modern and still capable.  And so long as it runs a web browser pretty sprightly, it could be super, super useful in  the kids room or whatever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Andrew makes a point that you could always put, you know, Chrome OS on an  old Mac or Linux.  But he also says it would be kind of nice if you could keep these things running Mac OS  for a little bit longer, as you said, like as a server and things like that.  Linux is I mean, look, I guess if you wanted Linux, you should start with Linux.  And if you buy a Mac, you should assume, well, you know, I'm buying a kind of a premium  product that is going to be obsolete in six to eight years.

Transcript:  Yeah, except, I mean, I think we're overstating it.  I really do. Like I was running that Mojave server.  I think the security is an issue.  So like running something and actively using it and doing your email on it and browsing  the web and all of that. But there are lots of other uses for these things that are on  your local network. You're not actively using them.  You're running them as a server.  You're just writing documents and all of that.  And they don't stop working. I mean, I could literally write articles.  I couldn't browse the web.  That's the point. The hard work continues forever.  I could write articles on that iMac back there.  Yeah.  Right. But at the same time, I mean, what broke most of these old computers back here  is actually the introduction of mandatory SSL on every website because they don't  support it. And so you need a proxy and it's too bad.  But otherwise, like Word 4 runs great on that 512 that I've got back there.  And Word 5 will run excellently.  I guess Word 6 never ran excellently, but it ran on that iMac G3 back there.  They still work, but like you do give up the security.  The internet, you give up.  Well, in this case, it's like the exploits in your safety on little slightly more modern  ones. It's your safety for a little while, but it's not like they aren't usable.  And honestly, unless you're a target, it's probably not even an issue for your safety.  And keep in mind, after you fall off the train, you've got a couple of years of security  updates on top of that.

In-house, yeah, like Plex or something like that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, actually, server would be a good use because you can probably you'll probably be  able to do a homebrew update to Apache forever.  That's true.  It's just you don't you wouldn't want to use that to, you know, go out, browse piracy  websites or something like that.  You'd probably be in trouble then.

Transcript:  Actually, side note, I keep reading up on trying to keep current on the hackintosh  movement, and that's one of the greatest successes of Apple Silicon is that it made  hackintoshing a lot less necessary because, hey, now we've got we've got the really super  hot fast wings. But one of the other things that it does, oddly enough, is you can  hackintosh a Macintosh to run a later version of the operating system than what Apple  supports. And that's definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's an interesting  application of what shouldn't be an outdated technology.

But I'm one of those guys who gets rid of the old stuff and just uses new Macs anyway.  It's fun.  It would be fun. But you can't patch it once you do that open core.  Can you what does that what does that mean now in terms of using that Mac?  I can go online, obviously, but I should probably not take updates from Apple.  Or is that not the case?  I don't know.

Transcript:  I think some of them update as normal and others.  If hackintosh experience is any indication, you would basically run the update and then  repatch it. You'd run the update and then and then attach that drive to another system  and run the patch on it and then and then update.  It depends on how how bad it is.  But I mean, here's a thought experiment that I haven't even considered, but I'm just  going to throw it out there, which is when will an M1 MacBook Air fall off the update  train completely?  And, you know, putting this in perspective, I wonder if it's like in the 2030s, right?  Or maybe late 2020s.  But like, I don't know, like an M1 Mac.  I could see it.  I think it goes to 2030s.

Transcript:  Counter argument would be the iPhone where Apple has shown great success in trade in  programs and in growing their install base by getting people to buy new systems, bringing  old systems back or handing them down and increasing the total number of iPhones in  use. And you could make that same argument for Macs and Apple Silicon Macs is that the  people who want to buy a new Mac will do so.  But if that M1 Mac is still viable, it can go to someone else.  And now the Mac market is that much larger.  And I think they do want to do that to a certain extent.  I don't think Apple's at the point now where they feel like they have to obsolete their  computers because there's no growth potential.  Remember, Apple's market share for the Mac is still so small that I think Apple really  does believe they can pick up a lot of new users.  And maybe one way you do that is by getting a refurbed M1 MacBook Air for $699 in the  hands of people who are never going to buy a Mac otherwise.  Yeah.

Do we have some that you can't update like they're stuck on Snow Leopard or or Big Sur?  Yeah.  And but we don't and we don't put those on the Internet.  We just.  They're internal.  Yeah, they're on our network.  They're on the LAN, but they're not on the interweb.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good use for it.  I got a little mini stream deck here attached to it's an old Mac laptop, right?  Because this is the problem in a company where we're a Mac, pretty much a Mac company.  There's a lot of old, you know, Mac minis and MacBooks lying around.  We had a bunch of 2015 MacBooks.  Boy, I really wanted to keep those running forever.  What year is this one?  I'm running myself right now, unbeknownst to me, a 2013 MacBook.  What poor soul had to use that.  Oh, look, anybody want an old Mac mini?

So there is a so John has just posted a picture  and did Colleen built this originally?  It was in a little I remember is in like a rolling TV stand  or something like that that.  And you said it was in general random.  All right. Let me look at our slack here.  Yes, we still use slack. I'm sorry.  Oh, wow. Look at this.  The this was and this is probably the one that was burned.  We had so we had because we would feed a bunch of different sources,  you know, you stream and YouTube.  And I can't even remember all the different places.  YouTube was later.  Bitgravity. Bitgravity.  I remember Bitgravity. Yeah.  There were at least four  and Justin TV before it was Twitch.  And so each one of these would have a dedicated Mac  that would we would feed the video into Colleen built all that.  And they were sitting in like a it was like a TV, one of those rolling TV things.  Those were the days in the early days of of the show.  Eight. What is that? Fifteen years ago. Yeah.  Yeah.

It feeds an ancient look at the bezels on this iPad.  It's a 30 pin, right?  I don't know. I can't. It doesn't.  Slide to unlock. I don't even know how that works.  Oh, yeah, there it is.

It was a set of four.  How come one is so burnt up?  It must have been on the on the top shelf where all the heat was.  OK, that's why there's three here and one still in service.  Moving along. Get one free.  Yeah. What a deal. Yeah.  I got a coupon. We probably did get a quad pack.  I was back in the day.  Alex, Travis was managing the downtown Apple store  and we would go in there.  I remember standing out on the corner with Scott Bourne  out on Market and whatever that street was.  And he had like seven.  He had a dolly with like seven computer boxes stacked up.  And I remember standing there, people would drive by, go, hey!  Hey, would you just just buy out the store? Yeah.  Apple has done something interesting, according to Mark Gurman.  I don't know. I don't know enough about Apple to know.  It's a shift away from Steve Jobs' approach.  Steve had reorganized the company along functional lines,  which is kind of an interesting thing to do.  You had software engineering, you had hardware,  you had machine learning, design services.  And then according to Gurman, contributions from each group  would then funnel into new features and products.  In other words, there wasn't a Mac group, there wasn't an iPod group.  Steve did that in the late 90s.  But Apple apparently is going back to the old, bad old days.  Are they the bad old days?  The Vision Pro headset, for instance, has its own now group, the Vision Group.  And they're kind of responsible for the whole hardware thing.  Is this meaningful? I don't know.  Mike Rockwell, who's a longtime Apple guy,  was running the technology development group since 2015,  but it is now called the Vision Products Group.

Start time: 2494.46
End time: 2547.63
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, it's literally they just renamed it because it's the group  that was building the headset all along.  So I'm not sure how newsy this is.  Also, the watch was done this way.  And even now, part of the watch development, the watch software development,  is still under the group that developed the watch  and not directly under Craig Federighi.  I think it's overstating it to say, oh, they're going back to the old way,  because that's not really what's happening here.  It seems like they create a group to build a new product.  And then over time, it seems to slowly kind of diffuse back out into the world.  But they didn't set up an iPhone group or an iPad group or a Mac group.  It's more like with a watch, like the software is still sort of in the watch group.  The hardware has gone to their hardware group.  And I imagine the Vision OS stuff will probably similarly slowly kind of spread out  until it makes sense to hand it off. But they do seem...  Is it for secrecy that they partition off?

Start time: 2551.08
End time: 2554.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, they probably didn't want anybody to know what the Vision Group was doing back in 2015.

Start time: 2555.36
End time: 2607.94
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Sure. I'm sure it was partially for secrecy, but it's also just functionally.  You can't not ship anything for five years, right?  So you've got to ship your iOS updates and your Mac OS updates and all of that in the meantime.  Plus have a bunch of people who are working with their heads down saying,  you know, nobody's going to see this until 2024.  You're just going to have to work on it.  And so I think it serves both purposes.  But it's almost like the Tim Cook era is sort of hacking.  Like Jobs was like, we've got to simplify this. And so he did.  Tim Cook is sort of like, well, yeah, but now that we're launching this new platform  and I don't know how the iPhone was done,  I imagine the iPhone was at least initially done very similarly in the iPad for the watch.  They're like, we're going to have a group working on the watch.  And then they will sort of like start to dissolve into the greatness of the big  apple soup, I guess, in the middle there.  Apple soup sounds not very good.  No, there's some delicious apple soups.  That's what's going with Vision OS.

Start time: 2608.10

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gurman writes, if the Vision products were developed in standard Apple fashion,  the software engineering for the headset would have been led by Craig Federighi  and his software engineering organization.  The hardware would have been developed alongside Apple's other devices under John Ternes.  The content arm would be with Eddy Q Services.  So but it makes, you know, I think Tim Cook, you could you could safely say  is an operations genius.  And if he thinks it's going to work better in a different way, do it that way.  Steve, remember that Steve went, you know, came back to  or actually before he left Apple,  raised the pirate flag on a building down off in the corner of infinity, one  infinity and and developed the Macintosh completely separate from the rest of the company.  And so that might be his heritage more than it is the right way to do things.

Transcript:  Yeah. And of course, that was his sticking the thumb in the eye of at least a group.  Right. This was like, we're going to steal everything from every other  project. And that and that was and that was like a model that kind of was sinking.  Apple was just as it was weighing down Microsoft and other companies.  We have the heads of divisions that basically consider themselves as independent  fiefdoms and scrambling to to remove  resources from other divisions because they feel like, hey, if this other division  gets an extra 12 million dollars, that 12 million dollars could have been to me.  I need to undermine their work as much as possible.  And that's simply not the culture at Apple.  So that's not it's not alarming.  It's interesting. One of the famous, most famous things about Apple's management  structure is that every every week, you have a weekly meeting of like all the division  heads basically doing a rap, doing a state of a state of the company  on all the different product developments.  And basically, there is no one division holding on to all of their ideas.  At least at least at the very, very highest level, there is there is conversation  between different parts of the company.  So that if one decision made by engineers or made by a manager  is going to impact another product or another thing or another schedule,  that gets borne out really quickly and settled.  So I don't think it's a big deal.  It's it's it'll be interesting if the if upcoming products products  took on this this model, I don't think it will.

We don't have a we don't have a target for it.  Even when we released it, it's not really the thing.  It's the thing we're releasing because we need to release something.  So maybe that's just the simplest way to get things iterate really, really quickly  and get done the things you need to get done without feeling as though, yeah,

Transcript:  I mean, it's almost like a what's the sound of one hand clapping kind of thing.  But like, what's the difference between  going to Craig Federighi and saying we're working on a thing?  I need you to create a group of your best  engineers to write the software for the thing and they will work in secret.  But technically they'll be they'll report to you.  But a dotted line to me.  But they'll report to you and saying we set up a group and got a bunch of  engineers that are in the group and Craig will check in with them because  it's all based on iOS anyway.  So of course, Craig is going to be involved.  Like I feel like this is the way Apple is structured.  It's kind of a distinction without a difference.  You need a dedicated team to work on a future product.  It's going to be not distributed to everyone because they're going to want to  keep it a secret. They want to want to focus those people.  But you can't you also can't like the way Apple Apple's assets are laid out.  Like it's all going to be based on iOS.  If they need a framework change,  the framework engineer is going to need to change it.  Right. Like so they're all kind of working together,  but there's going to be a subgroup that's working separately.  Does it matter where they are on the org chart?  I don't know.

Transcript:  I'm sure there are many management theories and books have been written  about the best way to handle this.  You nailed it, Andy, when you said it almost killed Microsoft,  that they had these fiefdoms, that's definitely what you don't want.  So I'm sure there's some sort of there's a lot of theory behind this.  And I'm sure this is the state of the art.

Transcript:  No, but good leadership resolves that rather than letting, you know,  the story of Microsoft was the Windows team wouldn't let Office come out on any  other platform. I mean, there was there was all sorts of this,  you know, shooting at each other, that famous  cartoon of every division of Microsoft pointing a gun at the other division.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, and I think that there's an advantage  to having a team that is, let's say, 85 percent contained from a security  perspective, from a lack of bureaucracy perspective.  But that last little bit, the danger is again, that not only is it people  competing with each other, but it's also just not knowing what the other ones are  doing. When the when the Canon  the Mark 2 came out, you know, it was 30 frames a second, not twenty nine, nine, seven.  And they and someone asked, like, why is it not twenty nine?  Why can't you do twenty nine, seven on this camera?  Well, the still camera division was not allowed to talk to the video camera  division. Right.  They didn't know anything about twenty nine, nine, seven.  They just knew, well, thirty frames a second seems good.  And and so those are the kind of things that you get when it gets too vertical.  But I think that you can get into a ton of like, where is this engineer going to work  today and who is he working for? And, you know, and and and  things get slowed down because someone's get, you know, you're pulling a hand  shared resources in like six different directions sometimes.

Transcript:  I have an autographed copy of Mano Cornett's famous  org chart cartoon on my wall in my home.  And you can see Microsoft, all this all these little groups pointing guns  at each other when he did this some years ago.  Apple had a center, which the red hot center was Steve Jobs at the time.  And everything, you know, everybody reported to Steve Jobs.  That's not the case anymore either.  No company can run that way either.  So,  yeah. All right.  So I'll continue on with as long as we're doing the Mark Gurman segment.  I will continue on with the power on newsletter.  App, he says, new Macs are going to be coming a little more detail.  Remember, he was the one who said they're  working on an iMac for twenty twenty five that is bigger than 30 inches,  but a little more detail on what Apple might be doing this year.  He's guessing, I think, I don't know if he has a source on this,  that there'll be Mac launches in October  featuring could feature, he says, the first Macs with M3 chips.  Don't expect high end MacBook Pros or desktops.  Do expect I think this matches the cadence that they're on right now,  perhaps an iMac, but certainly a 13 inch  MacBook Air and a 13 inch MacBook Pro with an M3 chip.  I made a note to myself the other day.  You may not buy another Mac until it is an OLED MacBook Pro with an M3 processor.

So it's really the note is more like, Leo, don't buy another one,  because that's one of the big rumors.  And I like that idea of I want to I think  I had a 13 Air and a 15 Air is my current.  And I'm thinking the 14.  I look at least as 14 inch MacBook Pro with envy in my eyes.  I just don't know how you live with one computer.

Transcript:  So what I jump on Zoom with right now is my Mac Studio.  So that's what I'm talking to someone in.  But then I have one computer that's my  tele-strater, so that does this part right.  That just does that little fancier operation.  And then I have another one that does the power does keynote.  So it just does the presentation.  So I can always cut to that so I can cut to the presentation.  And then I have another one that runs  any kind of app or web page that I want.  And I'm looking at buying one more.  So I have another app app system.  But what's nice about it now is when  that all runs into like an ATEM Extreme, you just sit there and just cutting  between them, drawing over top of them.  I can split screen between them.  I can do all those other things that it makes good presentation.  But I couldn't do it.  I kept on getting them because I trying to get like because a lot of things want  to take over the whole screen.  And so I was like, oh, I just it's just better to just put them on a different  computer so I don't have any any of those things.  But it's it I will say that the Mac lots  of Mac minis makes,  especially now makes everything run really nice.

Start time: 3263.26
End time: 3293.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, I always think I call them reports instead of rumors.  Honestly, I prefer that because German is so well sourced and he's not wrong.  He's always right.  And when he's wrong, he's wrong because it was true at the time.  And then they changed their mind. Right.  Like it's his accuracy is it's as close to perfect as you can get.  And so, you know, if you want to know what's happening next, I mean, yeah,  we get we all do the Mark German segment.  We all do it because he is the guy that are that good.  He's the one that's him.  And with a little sprinkling of Minchi Kuo in there.  Yeah, there you go.  That's what you got.

Yeah, Samsung unpacked.  We should mention given,  you know, there there is no folding Apple phone yet.  Google's got one.  There are several companies making them,  but the big one is a Samsung phone and the Samsung flip.  They expect we expect they will announce new ones on the 26th at 4 a.m.  Pacific Time.

It's like a pocket square that unfolds.  I just happen to have in my pocket a pocket square.  It's a pocket square that unfolds and becomes a phone.

Transcript:  A lot. It's raining a lot.  And it's like that's like from a live perspective.  Having a bunch of people walk out with a bunch of mics out in the rain is not  something that you want to see.  And it is something that you're like, oh, this is going to be ugly.  And so there was a lot of  a lot of, you know, it's a very difficult stream.  As someone who does a lot of this,  what they were doing was very difficult to do well.  Most people just decide, hey, let's go do it inside.  But they already had a stadium full of people to do this with.  It's one of the reasons I try to avoid  outdoor streams like the plague.  So so the  and so anyway, the so I think that rain is a problem.  They were obviously trying to do something with the mix.  They very quickly related to it.  One of the things we do a lot of times we do pre shows.  The reason we do pre shows is so that we can do all this correction before the  main person comes out.  And obviously they didn't have much of a pre show.  They wanted to do a big launch.  We didn't have all that energy at the beginning.  And that's the danger of doing that is that you have to make that first 30 seconds.  But it sounded like the first 30 seconds or 45 seconds.  They had corrected to a reasonably good given that it was raining  to a reasonably good level.  But but I think that that was it literally was seconds of stuff.  So what Jason said, I looked at it and I was like, oh, I'm always curious what happens.  I went and looked at it and I was like, OK, whatever.

It's like it's tough out there.  You get a dollop of something.  Right. Somebody forces you to spin it into a whole big story.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, it says during the original.  This is from from a PR person at Black Magic.  During the original Linus Tech Tips video,  they claimed that Black Magic Design had attempted its own testing  and had replicated Linus's results.  This is not accurate.  In fact, Linus has updated the video and provided a correction in their pinned  comments.  We understand you and your guests did not have the proper context when discussing  the video, but it would be possible to edit those sections to remove these  misinformation or add a disclaimer.  I am going to do what we would normally do,  which is corrected a week later and say, I guess  Black Magic did not ever do any benchmarking of Apple products.

Yikes.

Oh, yeah, you know, you know, why did you talk to exactly this  tester and say you couldn't replicate it?  And there's probably there might there could have been like something  a little bit fuzzy, say we didn't we didn't we didn't know if we had the right  the right data, your your own like footnotes were a little bit unclear.  And there was an agreement that there was enough there was enough fuzziness on it  that Black Magic could be convinced to tell Linus Tech takes that tips that we

Not only did they not not replicate the results, the results, they didn't even do  it, the testing so or something, I don't know, like  go go watch Linus again, give him some more hits.  He explains it, I guess.  All right. A little break here as we continue on Apple  losing a big court case in Europe.  We'll talk about that in just a bit.  But first a word from our sponsor, the great folks.  Well, they really are our sponsors who sponsor the studio.  They are the the naming rights of the Eastside Studios ACI Learning.

The two companies signed an agreement in 2018 giving Amazon the status of authorized  Apple dealer and included some clauses.  That, according to Spain, affected the online market for electronic devices  in Spain.  Probably some exclusives, that kind of thing.

Transcript:  Yeah, basically, this isn't the first time  that Apple's faced this in court, not even the first time in the EU.  Italy also instituted a fine against Apple and Amazon for a little bit less  than that a couple of years ago. However, interestingly, they of course,  of course, both companies fought it and first it was reduced and then it was like  passed, it was basically wiped off.  But there is still a similar lawsuit  happening in Washington state as a class action that I think was last month.  It was filed in October or September, something like that.  Again, making the claim that Apple and Amazon basically colluded to keep  Apple prices on Amazon at an artificially inflated level.  I think they're saying that, hey,  the prices of Apple stuff went up 10% immediately across the board on Amazon  after this happened. The latest action, nothing's happened with it  since the last month when basically a judge basically said that, hey,  we're Apple and Amazon both wanted to have this case thrown out.  The judge said, no, this case is going forward.  So now you get into depositions, you get into disclosure and research.  But yeah, this isn't new.  They're probably going to get it elsewhere, too.

Transcript:  reseller. So they were having a lot of problems and they made this deal.  But it is I mean, on another level,  it is anticompetitive in the sense that it's crowding the third party sellers off  of Amazon and basically Amazon and Apple made this handshake deal where Amazon  gets preferred, but the stuff gets cleared off the store that isn't from the  preferred plan. And like I as a consumer, I think we even said this on an episode  recently, like I am more likely to buy a Mac or any other Apple hardware from  Amazon now because there was a period where it felt super sketchy.

Transcript:  But I can see the argument that that was  also two big companies sort of colluding to push other sellers off the store.  I can see that part, too.

And with a proposed 200 million euro fine, it was eventually dropped.  So Apple, of course, and Amazon will appeal this.  And who knows what the outcome will be?  It's a big fine. Two hundred eighteen million dollars in total.

So I don't know whether this is right or wrong.  But as usual, I'm glad that at least they have to defend their actions in court,  because that means that if that means that they are going to be dissuaded from  doing sketchy things in general, if they said, well, we're going to have to talk  to a judge and say this was OK, how did we actually structure this deal so that it  doesn't do the things that these people are claiming it does?  Yeah.

Transcript:  There the Supreme Court is also in the news, speaking of court actions.  Apple  Reuters says Apple has been chided.  Chided.  They weren't scolded.  Apple chided by appeals judge as it heads to US Supreme Court in anti-trust case,  says Reuters.  This was yesterday, US appeals court  judge criticized Apple over legal arguments it made as it prepares to ask  the US Supreme Court to strike down the ruling that would require Apple to change  how the app store payment practice works.  Judge Milan Smith of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said  Apple had made statements in its bid for time to appeal to the Supreme Court that,  quote, may not be technically frivolous,  but that ignore the factual record in the rulings in the case.  Smith did and two other judges on the panel did give Apple 90 days to file a  petition, pause the ruling on payments through apps.  Apple plans to go all the way to the Supreme Court.  The Ninth Circuit upheld a judgment that said Apple cannot ban links within apps  that direct consumers to payment options outside of the app store.  So you know this because if you have the Kindle app, for instance, or the Audible  app, there is no link to push you to the Audible store on the web or the Amazon  Kindle book store on the on the web because Apple forbids that.  And why would why would companies do that?  The 30 percent sales commission, if you buy the book on the web,  they don't have to give Apple a third.  Fortnite sued.  For I make your epic games sued, of course, over this.  And this is the one area where Epic won.  So Apple doesn't like the Ninth Circuit's  ruling, but they did the Ninth Circuit did give them 90 days to prepare an appeal.  Before they are forced to actually do this.  Anything to say about that?  I know how you feel, Alex Lindsey.  I think I think it's you're chiding Apple as well, are you?

Start time: 4736.20
End time: 4757.24
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I know I'm just saying that it's you're chiding Epic going through the courts.  If it going through the courts is the is the direction I'm much more comfortable  with going through the courts than than having  Congress trying to write some law that will most likely miss the target and cause  lots of collateral damage, so so having, you know, it work its way through the court,  I think is fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Ninth Circuit really did did like Epic's points and not Apple's.  They the judge wrote Apple's argument  overlooks aspects of the panel's opinions,  analysis that are inconvenient to its position.  Smith said the epic's role as a games  distributor justified a broad reaching injunction.  Smith said competition law injunctions often have incidental benefits to non  parties. That's because antitrust law protects competition,  not individual market participants.  So Apple seemed to make arguments that, quote, challenge an imagined  panel opinion on an imagined record  did not address the Ninth Circuit's opinion, in other words.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's I'm really interested to see how this one fights out.  I think that I think that I think that Apple can make our grins, as we all have  about how we shouldn't allow people to side load apps because there are threats  to security from there. It's harder when they say, OK, well,  how if you're if you're basically saying we either take 30 percent of your of your  book sales, your comic book sales, your game sales, or you force people to  download and buy it from from a website.  It's hard for them to argue that, oh, my God, the security problems of including  a link within the app, so you go directly to the store.  Like it's for the customers.  We're worried about the customers. That's why we're doing it.  I'm really keen to see how Apple defends that part of it.

Start time: 4870.84
End time: 4935.90
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That's all I think that the defense will be mostly it's going to wrap around  antitrust and where antitrust what a monopoly means.  I mean, that's that's where a lot of this this comes up in into it, which is that  Apple is selling about 17 percent of the global market right now and and less than  or very close to 50 percent.  And so it's really whether you define  the Apple ecosystem as a monopoly or whether you define it as part of the  smartphone ecosystem. So it's really not about I think that what Apple is going to  argue is it's not really about whether they can't should or should not do that.  If they are not defined as a monopoly,  they cannot be forced to open up their store.  So the whole argument is going to that's what they're going to.  I think they're going to argue is that they're not a monopoly because they don't  have a controlling interest of the market.  And so I think that that's going to be the that's what Apple is going to push on.  And we'll see. We'll see if it'll tell us a lot.  I mean, the current Supreme Court will tell us a lot about the Supreme Court.  If it gets up there and they make a decision, whichever direction they go,  it can kind of give everybody a sense of where the Supreme Court stands on that on  that process.

Sadly, Apple's anti-steering rules, that's the anti-steering rules of the things  that prevented from putting a link, putting a link into the say the Epic store  to buy stuff for Fortnite, which both the district court and the Ninth Circuit  court found to be illegal, will remain in place as the Ninth Circuit court  stayed the injunction that puts an end to the practice.  Justice delayed again, says Tim Sweeney.

And it'll be interesting to see, you know, now that Apple is partnered with Unity,  Apple's building a lot of other bits and pieces.  Now, if the headset doesn't go anywhere, then it probably doesn't matter.  But if the headset turns out to be the next platform that really is big on  Apple's side, I don't think that Apple is giving Unreal or Epic  any special treatment, you know, and probably the least it's kind of minimum  effort, you know, connection to Epic.  And so that's that may, you know, again, if they if they they may have cut their  because the crazy thing is the vision platform is exactly what Unreal is built  for. And so to be kind of essentially shunted out of it is  you know, may turn out to be a really expensive mistake.  Yeah.

And Prime and Apple, we have so many, I'm you know, we're watching so much back

Start time: 5132.30
End time: 5190.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the problem is, is that the primary people that they're  striking against are the ones that can last the longest.  And the market that still pays them is the one that can last the least longest.  So what they may end up be doing is basically shunting the business into  because what we may just a lot of people may just stop watching TV and watch  dreaming because there's nothing new.  All there is is reality shows on TV.  And and what there is is still all these things that we haven't seen on all these  networks. And so that's that that's the thing that I think is going to be really,  you know, I think the complicated part of the strike.  You know, I think that I think that what they're striking about is a very valid  and very important subject for them to cover because their business is changing  dramatically. And I think that they have to reset that.  So I'm not arguing with why they're striking.  I'm simply saying that it's going to be tough.  It's going to be hard. It could last.  This could last through into next well into next year.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So as the strike was called at midnight Eastern or whenever they went on strike,  they just walked out one quick glass of champagne and I'm out of here.  Yeah, it's a tough one because like Alex said, I mean, the truth is you are trying  to have two parties do a negotiation for the future of this business when they  don't know what the future of the business is.  That's the bottom line.  Like, I get tired when I see these arguments that say, oh, they can't  the unions can't hold the streamers to task right now because the streamers are  trying to figure out their business model.  It's like, that's true.  But also they can't just mail it in because as the business model has already  changed, the things that the union members relied on for their livelihood has already  been swept out from under them so they could come together and come up with a  reasonable agreement here.  I do kind of wonder if the end game of this is going to be a short agreement  so that because really nobody knows how this is going to go.  And in the end, yeah, I think in the end,  the net amount of money in this business is going to be less.  It's just going to be less.  And that makes everybody want to claw as much of it out as they possibly can.  And I totally get that.  But the challenge is like, we don't even know what the gotchas are right now,  because we we don't know what the final  landing place of all of these changes in the streaming industry are going to be.  So I do sometimes wonder if they're going to do this happens in sports,  which I'm more familiar with sports negotiation is sometimes what you say is,  look, OK, we can't agree on a five year or a ten year or a seven year deal here.  Let's do three years and come back here.  Then we'll keep working under, you know,  slight changes and then that's going to expire and we'll both be able to fight  over what we want to do.  But it's tough because then you're  guaranteeing almost another strike in three years.

Start time: 5332.14
End time: 5372.48
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And the hard part is, is that for the actors and the writers, as technology moves  forward, the producers have less have less reason to negotiate with them every year.  So I think that's why they had to do it when they when they're doing it now.  It's because as AI picks up speed, as the global production picks up speed,  as these as all these other things that these these companies are working on,  picks up speed, they don't they they just may be able to last a lot longer.  You know, and and so I think that it's really, you know, it's a it's a really  problematic thing. Again, I'm not not arguing with the way why they're doing it.  I'm just saying that it's a really hard battle for the  SAG, AFTRA and WGA, that it'll be a be a hard one to win.

Start time: 5372.80
End time: 5453.59
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And a truth of a truth of labor negotiation is once you get something, you never give  it up. And that's that's the challenge in trying to say, can we do something  in the interim and figure this out later is is the the the SAG and WGA are going to  say, we are dying here. We need to make changes now.  We can't push this off for three years.  But the other side is like, yeah, but if I give you something now, you got it  forever. And so that's why we're at this.  It's scary because this this could be  it's exactly the wrong time for this to happen.  Two years ago would have been great for the writers and the actors.  Two years from now, at least the ground might be a little more settled.  But right now it's the worst possible time for this to happen.  I think for everybody, because nobody like there's nothing like  negotiating with a company that is not sure even what it will be in a year.  Right. Like Disney is a good example of that.  Like, are they going to sell off their linear?  Are they going to get a strategic partner for ESPN?  There's some rumors out there that ESPN might end up being like a joint venture  with Apple or Amazon or Google. Right.  Like that that might actually.  Eiger is open to that now, but nobody knows.  And so like it's changed so much in the last two years.  Would you if you were an entertainment  company, make a deal contingent on what you think it might be in two years?  You know, you won't you personally executive may not even have a job in two years.  So who knows?

They're not in the process.  They have side agreements.  Mark Ruffalo tweeted,  how about we all jump into Indies now?  Content creators create a film and TV  making system alongside the studio and streaming network.  So there's actual competition.  So that's kind of interesting.  There will be production, but it'll be from independent producers.  Maybe this is an opportunity.

But they're not going to get  you know, and the hard part really is, is that we're getting I think that the viewer,  even like I watch my kids behavior, even their behavior is that on  things that are commercially entities, they really expect a certain level of  quality that's really hard to get as an Indie.  You know, we're we're now watching lots  of movies that have 100 million, 200 million, 300 million dollar budgets.  And it's really hard for an Indie to do something that feels like it's worth  watching, which really interesting is that kids will go the opposite direction  and they want something with no production value on TikTok or on Snap,  whereas they so they want no production value there.  But when they start watching TV shows,  a lot of times they expect something different.

The parking process at the Emeryville  AMC is so frustrating that I'll never go back.  So it's like they have an app that doesn't work.  And you're sitting there like I don't care how much it costs.  I just don't want to have to spend the next half an hour trying to figure out  how to get out of the out of the parking lot.  So the so so but so that was that took  a chunk out of my my interest in being there.  But but at the same time, the you know, I felt like it was really good.  It was fun to watch on a big screen.  I did feel like I spent a lot of money on it.  And I just watched six all six of them on the balls  at home, you know, one at one at one at one a day.  Not like all at one time.  I didn't.

But I think that what I was left with is all in all, like all the things added up  of driving, parking, paying, doing all those things.  It wasn't that the theater experience  wasn't as was not as good as my home experience.  It was better than my home experience. It's a great experience.

I didn't have to park and have to find a parking space.  I years and years ago, I had already  broken the habit of buying snacks inside the theater.

It's ready for your pre-portioned ingredients.  So you don't have exactly what you need, no more, no less.  So you don't have any food waste.  Step by step instructions make me feel like a professional.  And by the way, these are suitable for framing or laminating or something.  They've got great pictures.  They show some alternatives that you can you can use for vegan or if you don't,  you know, there's an ingredient you don't want.  The step by step makes it so easy and the ingredients are so good.  Make your home the hangout place this summer  with crowd pleasing eats from a backyard bratwurst bar.  See now that's how to do it to tangy Keen Lime Pie.  I love Keen Lime Pie.  HelloFresh Market makes summer entertaining a cinch.  First of all, you're going to get peak time  summer produce and you're going to get it all season long.

MacBreak50 for 50 percent off plus free shipping.  I'm ready.  I should have brought some to work.  HelloFresh.  I got an email.  Time for the picks of the week.  I got an email from Sebastian DeWitt,  who you all know as the guy behind Halide.  He says, it's been a while since we updated Spectre,  but this is a pretty significant update.  Two big changes.  Spectre, which I love, by the way, and I do use.  It's for long exposure.  So it's one of the things the iPhone  can't do without a little bit of help.  It does stabilizing the shots.  It does it over several seconds so you can hand hold it.  You can get long exposures up to nine seconds without a tripod,  which is really fantastic.  I just love the effects of Spectre.  So they made the core Spectre is free now.  I've been paying for it for some time, but it's free now.  For the free version, you can go up to three seconds,  which probably for most of the time is sufficient.  They're also introducing a one time purchase for $4.99 Spectre Pro.  And that gets up to 30 second exposures,  which is I haven't had a chance to use Spectre.  Cam slash download.  But I'm going to guess you guys also have used Spectre.  It is a really nice app.  But of course, Halide is a must have app as well.  But this is this adds a feature  that the iPhone doesn't really have.  So it's really nice to have Spectre now free with a $4.99 Spectre Pro.  That's my pick of the week.  Alex Lindsay, what's yours?

Transcript:  Microphone. There we go.  I've been doing some production with my phone.  The phone is really good. The video is really good.  The audio is not good.  So you're trying to figure out how do I get good audio into the phone.  And so one of the things that I've been using is this  Saramonic, it's called a SmartRig Plus DI.  They have a bunch of different versions of this.  So this is the one that you put in there.  There you go. That's what it looks like.  And it has two XLR inputs on it as well as a lightning connector.  It looks like a little zoom.  It is a little like that.  It doesn't record, but it does have a nine volt battery so you can power your mic.  So if you've got a powered mic that you want to use,  something like 48 volts, you can put it in.  You can you can also set it to either be sending audio in or sending audio out.  It's got some and it also has some eighth inch jacks.  So if you like the little mics that are there.  So in addition to the XLR, you'll see that there's little eighth inch jacks up there as well.  And so anyway, it's pretty simple.  It's got a quarter twenty on the on the bottom there.  So that what's useful about that, of course, you can rig it up.  So if you get a rig, I've talked about small rig things for my phone before.  You can you can attach this right to your rig.  And we've been using these on and off for years.  The and so this one's been the most stable of the bunch that we've used.  And so what it does is it lets you take professional.  Now, we'll do everything from a professional  handheld mic all the way up to like electronic transmitters and receivers.  So we can take a lot.  It seems like a lot.  But if you're doing something to Instagram or you're doing something to some  of the other platforms, they only let you use your phone.  And so you can use your phone but still get great audio.  And we've piped literally mixers worth of audio back into this to get that audio  back in, but you can attach it to a rig and it works.  Works really well.

Transcript:  Yeah, mine is mine is a mystery.  I'm recommending something that I've installed, but have not been outside yet  to try. It is an XR slash augmented reality game by Google and Tito Tito.  Tito makes the space invaders.  It is an augmented reality version of space.  What? Oh, I got to have this.  You go outside and the space invaders are in the sky.  And like if you're in the space, you're in the sky.  A city they slide in and out between like buildings and they know like what the  lines of the streets are.  So basically follows like the lines of the street.  I does your phone go to do do do do do do.  It has its license.  So it has all those all the music.  Oh, I want this so bad.  Look at that.  That's just that's just the trailer.  But I've I've I've I've I've only run it long enough to know realize that you  can't use it inside.  You have to be outside to make it work.  But it's it's free.  There are no in-app purchases.  There is like data tracking, but you can opt out of it.  Like if you go into settings like this number three on the listing opt out of  data of data tracking.  So who knows?  But it's a nice free thing to play with.  This is the sort of like augmented reality that like in twenty twenty three  twenty twenty four I'm most keen about because, you know,  yes, you look like you will look like a dork standing in the middle of the park.  You're playing space.  Look, there's a lot of but at least you'll be able to see you're not wearing goggles.  You'll see people around you pointing and laughing and shooting like abusive  tick tock videos about how stupid you look.  So that's that's a very, very good positive thing.  So I'm I'm also not exactly sure.  Again, I live in a 350 year old quaint New England seaside  boat colony.  I'm not sure if there are enough tall buildings to really sell the effect of  these space invaders.  I intend to find out in about a half an hour.  But hey, if you live in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, I think that will be kind  of fun, kind of cool.  And you get it from just the app store, the Google Play Store, wherever.  Just drop today. There are there aren't even like there aren't even people who  who do like game channels on YouTube who have like, oh, my God, I got to have first.  I got to have the first review out there.  They're not even like first reviews out there.  So that's how that's early.

Transcript:  Yeah. For now, you have awareness of the world around you while having augmented.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's a nice it's a nice demo.  I mean, lastly, it's a nice demo.  They they they tease this at Google I.O.  in May because they have a new AR kit sort of thing that is like if you want to  build third party apps that integrate integrate AR in the real world environment,  not only taking advantage of the camera, but also taking advantage of Google Maps  Street View 3D tech, 3D data.  Here is a way that you can implement into that.  So this is clearly a way to celebrate the 45th anniversary of Space Invaders,  but also to point out that, yeah, we don't have a headset.  We have no plans to make one.  And we probably would screw it up if we did make one.  But it's not as though we haven't been thinking about augmented reality ourselves.  Hey, look, free game.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to pick something that  shockingly hasn't been picked since 2010, which is amazing.  We actually put this app in the Hall of Fame of our awards for iOS apps at Mac  World back in the day.  It's the MLB app, which sounds really generic,  but I've got various reasons to recommend it again.  First off, it is if you subscribe to MLB TV, you can watch all the games except  your local market.  There's this footnote there that I'll get to in a second.  But I'm a subscriber.  I'm very happy I watch it on Apple TV.  But you know what?  Sometimes I want to watch it on my Mac.  And it is the rarest of apps.  It's an iPad app that actually works on the Mac.  So you actually have the ability to watch the video on your Mac.  And I do that a lot.  But there's also a pretty so also a bunch of things are going bankrupt.  The broadcast broadcast MLB games.  I know, isn't that bizarre?  So the air and zone Dimebacks are the latest.  So if you're in San Diego or in Arizona and in those territories and you want and  you're a cord cutter, you will now be able to just pay Major League Baseball.  I think it's like $50 for the rest of the year and use the MLB app and watch all  your home games in your local market because they're no longer.  They will be on cable, but they're no longer exclusive to cable.  You can now actually watch them as a cord cutter, which is pretty awesome.  But the timely reason I wanted to mention  the MLB app is that they launched a new feature that is now available.  It is 3D Game Day.  And what it does is it uses all those  sensors that have the precise tracking of the pitch and of the players on the field.  And rather than just showing you like a little 2D representation of it,  they've animated it on the fly.  It looks like a video game, except it's actually what's happening in the game.  It's pretty amazing.  Mike Petrello from MLB did a tweet about it that I think I'm putting in our show  notes the idea here that you can basically you're watching a game that looks  like a video game, but it's based on all the in-game data and it's happening live.  It's pretty cool.  The only my only caveat about it is that when the inning ends, rather than showing  them all walk off the field, all the players sort of stand around like zombies  and then descend and then descend into the ground.  That part I don't like.  I don't like that so much.  Not my favorite.  It's like Field of Dreams, but way creepier.  But other than that, it's actually a pretty cool idea.  And you can see, speaking of AR and VR, the possibilities there as well.  What if you could actually like put yourself out in the field of play while or put  yourself at first base when somebody throws a grounder from shortstop at 100  miles an hour to you? It's pretty bananas.

Transcript:  I was just amazed like this is because they got all the data.  But somebody was like, we can build a 3D model.  We can have generic play.  But literally, you see the pitcher wind up and they throw the ball and you see the  batter swing. And if it's a ground ball, you see the ball go.  It's other than that point where they where they're absorbed back into Mother Earth.  That is terrifying.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's there's the regular 2D game day.  And then you get the option to do the 3D game day.  And the 3D game day is the one that is like this bizarre augmented.  There it is. Yeah, we've got on the video, there's a microchip.  You can fly around and and it's all like, again, it looks like a video game,  except it's actually what's happening in the game, like I guess 10 seconds ago or  something, but it's the whole thing.  So this is where we are.  Is there they've got so much data on that  field now that they can basically make a virtual version of the game.  And and it turns out they haven't sold the rights to that.  So you can you can like if you're a MLB audio subscriber, you can like listen to  the radio while you're watching the game version of the game.  I mean,

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Talking about HDR and there's probably  50 people that know what they were like, that have ever seen what they were talking  about. I mean, I don't think they may have talked about it, but it was it was really  it was super deep.  So anyway, it was pretty  pretty amazing.  And we know everything from business to animation to we had a lot of great stuff  there, but that one you want to check out the objective color metrics.  I mean, these are the folks that are figuring this out for for football.  Very cool.

And theoretically, you'll be able to see when I do this video,  all the all of the players and also like the the map that's on the table.  So cool. With one without doing because I didn't, you know, I didn't have a film  crew there. It was literally just me.  So I set an Insta360 on the table and pressed record.  Nice. And it actually looks pretty good.  So it's it's we do some fun experiments with stuff like that.  And the incomparable is a place.  This story, my career, Leo, which is one of the ways that I enjoy being a tech  person and a media person is I find new tech and I'm like,  how could I apply this to what I do?  And so I bought an Insta360 and it's it's kind of fun to do for in-person stuff.  So, yeah, I'm just experimenting.
