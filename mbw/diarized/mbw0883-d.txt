Transcript:  It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Jason, Andy and Alex are all here.  Hail hail the gang's all here and there is absolutely no news. You know what that means?  It's going to be a really great show. Why you should be cleaning your Apple Watch band.  We talked a little bit, not very briefly, about new versions of Mac OS. Are we getting close to a  gold master and the passing of a legend in the business? Still coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

It's time for Mac Break Weekly. The show  we cover the latest news from Apple and as we inch our way into September, there's less and  less news. But that's okay because I have people who can make it up as we go, including Jason Snell  from SixColors.com. This is it from Apple. I'm hearing breaking news. No, there's nothing.

She has,  oh, she's walking. Oh, good. She's walking her dog. It's a small town. I mean, the dog was lost.  Like it was on the face group. But I'm glad she found the dog. I don't know what the specials are,  the cafe across the street. A lot of, a lot of smoothies. I think you're  not allowed to say I have nothing else to contribute to this week show, unfortunately,  but I try to do my part. Thank you. If there's, if I get any more news on the smoothie front,

So every, it's almost that I've got a lot  of tools for it though. I've gotten very good at it. That's crazy. So you come out of the pool,

Transcript:  sometimes. So. All right. In the past at tech TV, when stories were light and shows were long,  we would often resort to, you need like wind. We would often resort to bits of cleaning your  mouse ball, things like that. We are now reduced to that here, but the modern mouse ball is your  Apple watch band. And according to nine to five Mac, Apple watch bands are covered in bacteria.  All watch bands to be clear, every watch band. This is, Hey folks, this is from the  advances in infectious diseases journal, which really should be called the adventures in  infectious disease, but that's all right. That's all right. Researchers from the prestigious  Florida Atlantic university, which I think is above a gas station and a beautiful,  Jacksonville reports. The study consists of bands for the Apple watch and other wearables made from  rubber cloth, leather, plastic, gold, and silver. The goal was to find a, between the material of  the wristband and bacteria buildup, which is not even a logical sentence, but okay. Right off the  bat, the study found 95% of all bands weren't obviously not from the store, but had been worn  by people contaminated with all kinds of dangerous bacteria. The most common Staphylococcus,  SPP found on 85% of the bands. However, that was not unexpected said researchers. What was found  more notable was the 30% prevalence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of a germ  that CDC says can cause pneumonia infections in the blood and more. 60% of the wearables  tested contained E. coli. Do not wear your watch to the restroom, I guess, or if you do wash it.  So what did I do yesterday? So wash it. I washed my band. I did do that. And I took an old toothbrush  and I scrubbed the interstices and I was tempted to dip it in alcohol. It is titanium. It should  survive a solvent. Does it feel better now? Do you feel more? I'm so much more healthy.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  As Jason reminded me before the show, I did read the paper and the paper didn't specify  Apple watches. They have a photo of all the things they tested, a couple of them are obviously Apple  watches, but all they're basically saying is that if there's something that you wear every single day  that you sweat into, maybe you should clean it every once in a while and just dunk the  band off. Just dunk the band in 70% alcohol or Lysol. You're good.  If I were writing this headline, if I had to do this, wouldn't you just have to go for  local TV station, local news just before the break headlines? Is your Apple watch killing you?  Tune in. I was a fundamental scientific research board.

Transcript:  I mean, we really boil this down right? Clean your watch band, you monsters. Okay.  Just clean them. If you've got the stretchy kind, like the fabric kind, those start to get really  dusky after a little while. You clean them, hang them up. Wipe the plastic ones down. Just  clean your watch band every so often. It'll do you good. You monsters.

Transcript:  sickened by my watch band, but there's always firsts. Apparently this is not news to Apple because  support document 204522, how to clean your Apple watch has all the deets you need.  This has been around for a couple of years. Is it okay to use a disinfectant on my Apple watch  using a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe as Andy recommended, 75% ethyl alcohol wipe or Clorox  disinfecting wipes. Gently wash the exterior surfaces of your watch. Now this works with  the Solo Loop, the sport band, the Nike sport band, the Oshel band or the metal band. Do not  use on fabric or leather bands. Do not use bleach or hydrogen peroxide. Avoid getting

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  moisture in any openings. Now, I will admit the reason I don't have a fabric band is because I  was afraid that they would smell. But can't you throw them in the washing machine? Probably could,  but I was like, oh, that's going to be a big mess. You know what the study didn't mention

Start time: 550.92
End time: 574.46
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  is the widely ignored issue of dirty digital crowns. Apple, however, has an important note on  that. If the digital crown gets stuck or won't move, it's time to clean it. Check for debris  and wipe down your Apple watch. If you find substances around the digital crown, they didn't

End time: 633.28
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  the hell out of me because again, bad headline. They're saying Apple issues warning about like  don't sleep with your head near your iPhone. Oh dear, that's scary. Yeah. And it was just,  oh, by the way, like when it's charging, they pointed to some sort of tech note somewhere on  the site that happens to mention that like, yes, it's going to get a little bit warm while it fast  charges. So like maybe don't like hold it in your mouth while you're charging or something like that.  There was, it was like nothing related to actually what the headline made you think. I'm like, okay.  I feel as though I would have heard about this if there was a thing where don't, for God sakes,  don't charge it on your nightstand because that's when the goblins come in. It opens the portal  to David Bowie coming in and stealing children. And as the New York Post... And it'll be cool to

Transcript:  wasn't it? After all. See you next week. See you. Good show everybody. We did a lot of good today.  Honestly, that's pretty much it. Wow. Yeah. It's funny. It's funny because like this is the week  where like suddenly everybody has an explosive, not in the literal way, like a new iPhone rumor.  That's like, yeah, it's because like you got like you're in the, you work for like a phone,  a phone store in Iowa and you got like some press materials that you're not supposed to talk about.  And it's always nothing content and, but it's, but it's everywhere. And like tricks you into  thinking that, Hey, well there's no, no, there isn't. Hey, well there's no, no, there isn't.

You know, I did the public beta on my iPhone and I only have  a, I think twice have I had updates. They don't update the public beta as much as the developer

Start time: 821.56
End time: 844.56
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's pretty stable. Yeah. Yeah. I've had it. I've had the screen become unresponsive a couple of  times and I had a problem where the messages you start typing and then you wouldn't see your  response. Like you can just type into space for a little while and messages. I think those are the  only two big, big things that I've had so far. I've had blank widgets, which clean up after a while.

Start time: 845.72

Start time: 850.46
End time: 871.92
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  now. I guess it didn't do it enough. What's the, does the, do they have battery optimization  on lock right now? Usually that's one of the few things that's like a bad thing about  signing up for public beta is they don't, they have battery optimization, but they haven't  fine tuned it yet. So you might lose like 45 minutes to an hour on your runtime.  I haven't really noticed that, but you know, that's just a general thing. It's got so much battery life.

Start time: 873.20
End time: 892.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. One thing though that's done a really good job with this. This tells you, yeah, this tells you  how, how good a job they did. The one thing people didn't like was that the end call button  was moved to the right and now it's back in the middle. Yeah. Wow. That's why we do the beta

Start time: 893.08
End time: 898.48
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko

Transcript:  I want to tell you the, I, it reminded me of one other bug. It, it called the last person I called  over and over and over again. It was a good friend of mine, but, but it was like, it was just like,  it just kept on calling like every time we were in the hotel, we were in the hotel,  setting up for Seagraph. And so it just kept on calling his phone over and over and over again,  like, I mean, every 30 seconds it would just call every time I'd hang it up. It would wait for a  second and then call again. But I haven't seen that since the last update. I wonder, I bet it's

Transcript:  a little harder these days for Apple to test phone features because I don't know about you,  but I mean, obviously you're a little different Alex. You actually phone people, but I rarely

Start time: 939.00
End time: 965.12
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  call or talk to them. Very rarely on purpose. Only by accident. Yeah. Like there's only, there's  only a handful of people that can call me like unscheduled, like they don't text first. Like  there's this thing that I thought my kids were like crazy when they did that, like text me before  you call, like, like I'll tell you if it's okay to talk. And now I'm totally that way. Like I,  if we don't have them, if we don't have a meeting, I kind of expect you to text me before, like, is  this, is this a good time? You know, and then I go, yeah, sure. But calling me straight out, I'm,

Start time: 965.86
End time: 1064.32
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  you gotta be pretty close. Yeah. You need some, you need some time to spin up your,  to boot up your own social software for handling out with phone call. It's, it's difficult.  And also it's also kind of too bad that Apple, like introverts complaint.  Exactly. It's like, it's, it's like, if someone asks you, like if you're working with somebody  on a project, they text you and they ask a question, it's perfectly fine to say,  wow, that's a good question. Let me take a look at that and get back to you. As opposed to on  the phone, it's like, okay, why don't you hang up this call so I can go take a look at it? But oh,  no, that's okay. I'll, I'll stand by. Why don't you take a look at it right now? And I'm like,  well, it could, I, you, I could come back to you in eight seconds. I could come back to you in  eight hours. If you, I don't think, I don't think I want to keep the phone on quite that long,  but, but it is too bad that Apple isn't like looking at better phone features.  The, there, there isn't a whole lot of different, there, there are only a few signature features  that Apple has that like a Google pixel phone doesn't and vice versa. But one of them is like,  when I switched to, to test out another phone, when I lose all of that call screening that is  built into a pixel phone, I miss it. It is so good at saying, yeah, this is nobody I'm going to,  I'm going to let you know that someone's calling, but I'm going to tell you, you don't want to  answer the phone or Hey, why not? Instead of answering the phone, you just tap this button  and listen to the voicemail message that he's, that he or she is trying to leave.  And if it's a language that you don't understand, it's like, it is so good. But actually that kind  of fits into what we've been talking about because all of these features that I love about Pixel's  phone app are basically ones that prevent me from being able from talking to people on the phone.  So maybe we're still making the same case.

Transcript:  Apple Insider took their life in their hands. And so did some unnamed developer who gave them hands  on, on their vision pro, despite of course, all of the restrictions they'd agreed to the developer.  I mean, Insider didn't have any qualms and they shouldn't because that's a journalistic thing.  I kind of feel like the developer really, that's, you promised man, you promised.

Start time: 1092.66
End time: 1151.92
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Oh God, that's so, that's, that is exactly it. I think that like, especially on a device like this,  if there were a device that is like causing harm to people and Apple is trying to put the lid on  this news sort of getting out, everyone, the sky's the limit. But when it's a pre-release piece of  hardware, it's perfectly fine for Apple Insider to, if someone reaches out and say, Hey, you want  to spend two hours with this piece of hardware unsupervised and without Apple looking over your  shoulder and telling you what to do, that's, they almost have responsibility to do it. But as like  someone who's, I've signed a bunch of agreements that say that this is not my property, this is  Apple's property. I'm agreeing that Apple gets to dictate everything I do with this. And 20 of the,  of the 20 and a half pages of the instructions are, I don't get to show it to anybody else,  certainly not a reporter. That's like, again, on these kinds of stakes where it's not as though  this is a whistleblower who's trying to get attention to a problem that Apple's trying to  trying to stifle. That's no good. You don't, you don't do that.

Start time: 1156.30
End time: 1209.84
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. It's just, it's everything. It's kind of a nothing. I mean, the biggest story is that  somebody got a hold of one, but his impressions are not really appreciably different than the  impressions we all got from our canned demos at Apple during WWDC week. It's just a different  person writing about the same kind of things and without the demo, right? It's not, you don't get  the Apple demo here. It's just sort of the hardware and saying, yeah, it looks good. And,  you know, the iPad apps are just iPad apps. And, you know, we looked at Safari and it was fine.  And it's fine. As long as, I mean, again, it is Apple insider's job, as long as they didn't induce  somebody, right? We're like, Hey, anybody out there want to break their NDA? Like that starts  to get unethical, but assuming somebody that this writer knows came and said, I got this,  you can look at it like it's on, that's on the developer who got it. But we didn't, this didn't  change how we look at the vision pro. It's just sort of like, oh yeah, it's what we thought it was.

Start time: 1210.06
End time: 1221.66
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And it's a development. For all of that, that the developer undermined the entire development  developer program and, and try to get support from Apple now. Yeah. Well, what I would say is

Start time: 1222.70
End time: 1271.76
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Apple, when Apple does something like this, they know this is going to happen, right? They know  this is going to happen. And in fact, their best defense for stuff like this is don't include  things in the developer unit that you don't want to leak. Cause you know that they'll leak, they'll  leak. Maybe they won't leak in a first person like this. That's, I think what's extraordinary  is that the writer of the story is like, I used it and let me go through my experience. There are  other ways to couch this stuff and be like, Oh, there's a report that, or, or we are hearing that,  or a developer told us that this thing is the case, but they're going to come out, right? It's  inevitable that they're going to come out. I think you go into it. If you're Apple, just knowing,  constrain what's, you want to tell them, don't share it, but you know, some of that stuff is  going to leak and it's just like anything that's precious. Don't put it in the developer product,  right? Like just don't do it. And they didn't. Anything, anything that doesn't work yet is not

Start time: 1271.76
End time: 1286.72
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  going to be in that unit for exactly this reason. So no one can say, Oh my God, I turned on that,  that eyeballs on the outside of the goggles thing. And Oh my God, it was a nightmare. Yeah. That's  because that's because we only turned it on for one person. Congratulations. You just caught,

Start time: 1286.90

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you just got caught in the flight trap. Also, I think this is another vision pro leak of a French  tech news website. iPhone soft says that a source who tried the vision pro at one of Apple's public  developer labs saw the one terabyte figure listed as storage in the devices settings app. We're

Start time: 1307.62
End time: 1318.18
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  really grasping at straws here folks. Well, but that's, we know that there's larger storage  available. It's just that it's not necessarily going to be on board. You know, I think that

Start time: 1318.34
End time: 1326.17
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  that's the whole thing is that it's not, that's why it starts at, right? The price was starts at  we all focused on my price. Yeah. You want a terabyte. That's going to cost you a little more.

Start time: 1328.30
End time: 1373.20
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Although it is interesting to wonder like about the architecture of this. And  this is, this is why this kind of a number isn't really valuable right now, because one of the  things that's on a lot of people's mind is how often is this device going to have to phone home  to get more data, uh, to, to render an environment or do whatever like that. So the idea, so if we  found out that, oh, but they Apple thought that the base model was going to be 512 gigabytes and  they decided to make it one terabyte instead, that might be an interesting data point about  the latency that they were, the Apple was experiencing when it had less memory rather  than more. But as it is right now, we have nothing to compare it to. So we don't know if that's a  lot, if that's going to be the, how much you get for, for, for, for, for the base model or how much  it's going to be if you spend an extra thousand dollars. So interesting. It is way too early to

Transcript:  was saying ESPN, right? Wasn't that, wasn't that the thing? That's because the Disney CEO has been  fielding questions about selling off units and they, and the only thing he's been protesting  that no, Disney is not for sale. However, we are considering selling off units of like basically  channels that are not streaming content, like things that have live events, like a conventional  TV channel. And he specified ESPN as something that they're considering. And yeah, when the,  when you see articles, they're saying, Oh, don't do Apple buying Disney. That's not as ridiculous  as it might seem. It's like, well, until you wonder why, how Apple is going to run a theme park. And I  don't know if they were going to do that, but yeah, when you consider it, like if they do decide  to break things up and people will just like an estate sale where people descend upon saying, I'm  here to buy the furniture. I'm here to buy linens. I'm here to buy kitchen stuff that could then Apple  could show up at that estate sale and say, I'm going to buy ESPN. I have a hot take on this,

Start time: 1543.02

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but maybe I should save it for let's take a break. And then the hot take, ladies and gentlemen,  this is why you listen to this show. Jason Snell's hot takes got to be a reason.  There's going to be some reason. Andy Anakko, Jason Snell, Alex Lindsay, we will, we will delve into  Disney and Apple in just a little bit. There's also somebody put this in and I think it's kind  of cool. History of presentations. That kind of cool video. We could talk about that too.  But first a word from our sponsor, a company, a piece of software I use not just every day, but  several times a day. It's great software attaching to a great server and it solves the problem that  I think a lot of people have. My, my almost motto over the last few years is if you value email,  don't use a free service. The free emails, which, you know, almost everybody's using Gmail, maybe  outlook.com, that kind of thing. They don't provide any support because it's free. You're at their  mercy. And if something goes wrong, you've got a problem. And the features really are not,  you know, you're not defining the feature set. The user base isn't. Advertisers are. That's why I  use fast mail. I love fast mail. Been using fast mail for more than 10 years. For a while I was  using Gmail because of the spam fighting feature. Then I, then I just filtered my mail through Gmail  and back into fast mail, which is very easy to do. But fast mail is so good. I finally said I  don't even need Gmail at all. Your email it's, and it's worth it. Look, it's as little as $3 a  month. It's not a huge expense, but if you have a business, your email address says so much about  you, even as an individual, you know, and I talk to people all the time who still have at aol.com  or hotmail.com. You need fast mail. Fast mail is real email. They use an open source IMAP server  called Cyrus. They contribute back to it, by the way, all the time. And that means you're getting  true IMAP, but fast mail has added some features that I think are fantastic. For instance, if you  like the, the, the way you can label emails in Gmail, you'll love fast mail because you can use  folders or labels. They have a very powerful search bar and oh yes, the spam filtering is second to  none. In fact, I even have written scripts because they use the open source again, sieve program,  and sieve scripts mean that you could have absolutely fine control of your email spam  fighting, not just spam fighting, but filtering so you can organize your email. The fast mail apps,  iOS, Android are fantastic. The web app is fantastic, but you can use any email app.  It works with them all. The, but I actually prefer the fast mail app, especially on iOS. It has quick  settings from the quick settings menu. You could choose a theme switch between light and dark mode,  change your text size. You don't even leave the email screen. It's just boom. Quick settings also  offer options related to the fast mail screen you're viewing. You can use fast mail to generate  masked email addresses. This is fantastic. An extra security step. So instead of using your real email  when you sign up for something, you use a masked email that doesn't reveal who you are. This works,  by the way, with our sponsor, Bitwarden, with one password and others. I love this because basically  not only do you have a unique password, you have a unique email for everybody. You can  auto save contacts. So when you reply to somebody, it automatically adds them to your contacts. I use  that in my sieve because if somebody's in my contact list, I move them to a special folder,  an important folder, because I know, Hey, this is somebody, this is a real person. This is somebody  I've been talking to. You can have public images of senders from external services, including  Gravatar. I love that because I like to see what you look like. You can set default reminders for  events, change how invitations are handled, turn on notifications for calendar alerts. Oh, did I  mention? Yes. Calendar and contact support is fantastic in fast mail. In fact, I replaced my  Google Calendar and Google Contacts with fast mail and it syncs with all my devices, all my Apple iOS  devices at Linux too. It's great. Fast mail sells domains. You can now buy a domain or add a domain  through fast mail. I have almost all my domains that I want to email to, whether they're a website  or not in fast mail. They're the DNS server because fast mail sets it up so that it has  full authentication, you know, DMARC and all the special, you know, complicated email  authentication protocols. Fast mail just does it. It's easy, which means more people get my email.  I hear complaints more and more from people who say, my email's not going through. That's because  there's so much spam on the internet that most providers now are requiring authentication  that you really are that person on that server. For over 20 years now, fast mail has been a leader  in email privacy. They, your customers to them, you're not the product, you're the customer.  No advertising, no advertisers. You pay for free email with your privacy. Fast mail, your data  stays yours. Better productivity features, as I said, as little as $3 a month. Better productivity.  I mean, I can go on and on. I just love fast mail. I've been using it nonstop. I wouldn't dream of  any other email service and I highly suggest you take a look at fast mail. It's very easy to take  your data from the old email provider and move it over or even set up a forward so that people  still use your old address. It goes into fast mail. I use fast, for instance, because I have  domains associated with fast mail, I have an infinite number of emails. So every time I sign  up for something, you know, I make it be that company at my email, which makes it really easy  to figure out who's selling my name among other things. I really like it. Fast mail is moving  email forward with new internet standards and open source innovations that power many email  services other than their own. There are leaders in the open source email movement. They are the  gold standard. Reclaim your privacy, boost productivity with fast mail. Try it now free for  30 days. Fastmail.com slash twit.

So it all started with an August 9th article in the Hollywood Reporter.  A Disney sale to Apple? Don't count it out this time. Now, Alex, Lindsay, you've been saying  Apple should buy Disney forever and ever. Does Apple have enough cash to buy Disney? I mean,

Start time: 1988.56

Transcript:  outright? I don't know. They have to borrow it, but they could. They could. They could do that. Or  they could do stock transfer. I mean, there's a lot of, I mean, I think that Pixar was bought by  Disney with stock, like I don't think in some cash, but I think it was a split of those things. It  wasn't. Cause I think that that's how Steve Jobs ended up with 7% of Disney or Disney's market cap

Transcript:  quarters, they'd have enough to buy. But I don't like anybody's proposing that they buy Disney  outright or even the Disney is for sale outright. It's just that Bob Iger might want to sell parts

Start time: 2028.58
End time: 2330.24
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  off that don't make sense. Or potentially depending on how Bob Iger sees the end game,  he wants to sell parts off. The theory of the Hollywood Reporter article is Iger may want to  sell some parts off into places that are like declining businesses. And that might be prepping  it for sale to a partner like Apple for the, like what remains. And that would be his exit.  Cause he's famously can't find a successor. So maybe his successor is handing the company  to Apple and running away. But the, the THR story, I thought it was a really balanced story because  it is, it says right in the headline, like we've heard this before. Why is it different this time?  And there are a few reasons it's different this time, right? Disney is under stress. Their biggest  cash machine for the last 15, 20 years ESPN is in decline because cable subscriptions are in decline.  And they invested a huge amount of money in launching Disney Plus, which I would say was  successful, but they have a bunch of pressure saying, you got to show profit. You got to make  more money on this. Even though that was never the original goal, the goal was to stake out the  territory and build a product that would be one of the last ones standing. But the big thesis in  that THR story is the Hollywood insider who basically says, look, all these entertainment  industry companies are now going to be streaming companies and streaming is technology.  And the tech industry has so much more money and power than the entertainment industry that in the  end, the tech industry is going to eat the entertainment industry alive. Like that's what's  going to happen. And that they said something like, in the end, all you're going to get is  Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and one other streamer will be the only ones to survive because Apple,  Amazon, Google, these companies have so much more money and so much more market cap than the  entertainment industry, which we think of as giants like Disney looms large in our minds.  But if you look at the balance sheet and you look at the stock price and you compare it to the tech  giants like Apple, it's not even close. So I think that the most interesting part of the premise is,  if it's inevitable, because of the world we live in right now, that tech companies are going to kind  of swallow the entertainment industry whole, there's not a better better companion for Disney  than Apple because they are two of the most similar companies culturally in existence.  And a lot of what Disney has is stuff that Apple kind of wants. But I think what I see in a lot of  the criticism of this when people like, no, no, it's never going to happen. And I was one of those  people 10 years ago was like, this is not going to happen. But it's different now. And I think one of  the reasons is Apple is a much larger company than they were 10 years ago. They're huge.  And also in relationship to Disney, in relationship to Disney and then in relationship  to itself as well. Right. And they have still have enormous pressure by investors to show growth.  And we can debate like whether that's healthy for companies to have endless growth pressure.  I think it's not. But that's the way the world works. Right. And so that's that's where we are.  And one of the things that Apple has done is gone into completely new markets that would have  seemed ridiculous even 10 years ago, like Apple TV plus and the fact that an Apple TV  movie won an Oscar and they won the Emmy for best comedy with Ted Lasso. Like Apple's playing in all  sorts of games that they never did before. And they're a size unlike the company even 10 years  ago. And when you start to think about that and think about avenues for growth, I don't think it's  unreasonable to say Apple might want to buy a big chunk of Disney and use it to fuel future growth if  they believe they can do it. I still don't think it's super likely unless there's a feeding frenzy  and Apple is like, well, nobody else is going to buy Disney. We're going to buy it. But like Annie  mentioned theme parks earlier and it's like, I don't know. I think theme parks kind of potentially  fit. I don't think it would be an Apple theme park. Right. It would be a Disney theme park. But  Apple might own Disney at that point. Apple and Disney are both really good at focusing on the  customer experience. The Imagineers are right at that same intersection of liberal arts and  technology that Apple is. They're very good at focusing on the customer experience and also  getting as much money out of the customer as possible in all of those situations.  Right. Like I know it seems super bizarre. The idea that Apple as a corporation might end up  owning Disneyland and Disney Cruise Lines and things that are like, how is that even possible?  But what I would say is the Apple of today is not the Apple that lives in most of our minds. It's  already changed so much. It's so huge and the pressure on it to continue to grow is so great  that they are opening up whole new areas. And I think 10 years ago we would have said an Apple  movie. What's that? And let alone that it won best picture, but that's where the world we live in  today. So I think that it's plausible, but I personally think I actually understand why  Bob Iger might want to sell to Apple. I don't think I can see the case for Apple to spend  150 billion on some of the assets of Disney right now, unless it's a situation where  everybody in tech is buying the entertainment industry out, at which point Disney and Apple

Start time: 2330.40

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  are the best partners. And I think some of the timing will depend on some of the strikes as well,  because the movie industry, if the strikes continue that are happening in Hollywood right now until  January or February, which some people think could happen, the movie industry will be in a freefall.  Like it's like COVID level, like people are talking a lot about it right now. But  Apple and Amazon and Netflix actually are in a better position, which they're the ones that  are holding the strings to the strike. That's the real problem with the whole thing. And so they're  in a really good position. So the timing is really defensive because Disney may be as valuable as it  is ever going to be, like right now. So that's probably something that Iger may be looking down.  The problem is that there's a lot of really valuable assets. And for Apple across the entire  ecosystem, Iron Man and Marvel and Pixar and Star Wars and all those things across the entire  ecosystem with AR, VR, interfaces, games, educational materials, stickers, everything,  those are very valuable. Disney, by overusing them, has probably run most of their value out  of that system. So the problem is that can Disney actually continue to make the kind of money it's  been making in the past and it's starting to falter because where do you take Marvel now?  Where do you take Star Wars now? Where do you take those things now? They're not clear that  there's an end product there. It's not that it won't be valuable. The question is will it be  as guaranteed as it was before? And that's becoming unclear. So I think that everyone's  starting to not quite hit on all cylinders. And so I think that if you're looking at that,  you have to be kind of worried. Also, if you're doing location-based AR, you're doing all kinds  of other stuff, there's no better place to do that than at Disneyland. So if you want to add value  to something and have it be like, hey, if you're using an iPhone, all this other stuff is available  at Disneyland, that is a pretty, like it's a great R&D space because of the way that Disneyland  is built in Disney World. But Disneyland, I mean, the way it's built, you can see people using it  all. There's a lot of things about it because it's a known product and it's something that  Apple could really take advantage of. So I think that in a lot of ways, Disney is more valuable  to Apple than it is to Disney. And so because they can use it as a magnifier in a way that

Start time: 2476.90

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Disney can't do by itself. That's the argument for tech companies to buy these companies is  that the tech companies have an engine of money. And for the Apple, it's the iPhone that the  standalone entertainment companies just don't have. And so you look at what Disney can do and they  are now constrained by everybody saying, how are you going to make money? Instead of we're going  to spend billions in order to establish Disney Plus, it's now how are you going to make money?  How are you going to deal with linear TV like ESPN going down? And Apple is like, well, because  we got all that money from the iPhone, like, don't ask us. And we can sell you. Apple could

Start time: 2509.90
End time: 2602.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  just sell more iPhones and make it worth buying Disney. If all of those Disney products and  everything else suddenly were mostly just, you got all the special stuff on the Apple platform  that were related to those things, it's worth it by itself. I think the biggest problem Apple  would have is actually antitrust. It will cinch up so many things for Apple that it's because it's  two different markets. I think that they might be able to do it, but they're under so much pressure  right now. I think people could see an end run here of Apple really closing, especially that sub  18 that they're already at 87%. They could bump that a bit higher with all of those product lines.  So that's the thing that I think Apple has. I think it's a very valuable purchase. I think  it's probably 50, 50, maybe 30, 50 that they would actually do it. Apple's never done more than I  think Beats. I think Beats is the biggest one they could do, three and a half billion. It's a huge  cultural, Disney as Jason said, is probably the closest to Apple and culture in many, many,  many ways. And so it'd probably be the easiest one. You have a CEO that is ready to leave. So  it's not like he's going to be trying to figure out how he remains in play. So he's already left  once. So there's a bunch of things about it that make sense. Obviously it's just such a, everybody,  I think just about every time someone's done this, it hasn't turned out well. So I think that that's  the biggest problem is that Apple would have to prove that they can do it better than everyone else.  Which they do often, but Apple has generally resisted large purchases because of the,  trying to assimilate the culture has been difficult.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Kyle Soria Yeah. And I'm glad you brought up Beats because that's one of my kind of stumbling blocks  in all this. I think one of the reasons why the Beats acquisition worked and got Apple into  streaming music services is that they didn't just buy a headphone manufacturer and like a fledgling  startup music service. They also bought Dr. Dre and they bought Jimmy Iovine who came in saying,  we have the knowledge of this industry that is, that is, we are major players.

Transcript:  Kyle Soria But well, no, well, they both contributed to the launch. They weren't,  it's not as though they were around long enough to make sure that Apple knew how to run  that business. One of my problems that I have imagining Apple's, a wide acquisition of Disney  is who at Disney can basically bring aboard, here is how things work at Disney. Here is why.  No, you are not going to treat Disney cast members on the theme parks that way. Like they're just  college kids who come in and work for three weeks and you can fire them at will. These are people  that are there because they love Disney and we both benefit from that and we also know how to  exploit that correctly. So you're not going to basically say that just because your ability to  shut down certain work or in your Apple stores worked there, that's how you're going to help  the, that's how you're going to keep control of the people that are the last interface between  a five year old child and their parents having a great time at our theme parks.

Transcript:  Kyle Soria I would think that if Apple would make a purchase like this, they would know that one of  the things they were doing is entering areas they don't know about and lean on the executives  who run those parts of Disney to be the experts and join whatever the team is to do that. And my  example would be everybody likes to talk about the early days of Apple TV and they say, oh,  you mean Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps. It's like, well, that was the, no, I don't mean  that because that was the objective lesson of them as people who don't know anything about TV  or the entertainment industry throwing something against the wall. What they did do that was the  smart thing after those two shows were in process was hire the two guys from Sony who run Apple TV  to this day. And those guys are entertainment industry experts. They're the subject matter  experts. They work for Eddie Q, but it's very clear that Eddie Q, although he's thinking about  strategy and who knows, maybe thinking about buying Disney right now, he lets those guys  run that division and they're the experts. And so they've listened to the subject matter experts.  And it's one of those examples where, although there are all those stories about, oh, Tim Cook  doesn't want you to swear on TV or whatever. The truth is that Zach and Jamie, the guys who run  Apple TV, the Sony executives formerly, they're doing their thing and they know how to do it and  they've been successful with it. So I think that could potentially be the model. The other thing  I would throw out there is I think it's an interesting thought exercise and I don't know  where I come down on this, but okay. A hundred, a hundred and fifty billion dollars. Like if they  said to Zach and Jamie, here's a hundred billion dollars and in a year or two, we want Apple TV  plus to be Disney plus. They couldn't do it. They couldn't do it in four years. They couldn't do it  in eight years. That would be the reason you buy something, whether it's Disney or Paramount or  something else is you want to really grow your streaming service and growing it with no catalog  and no intellectual property bit by bit, year by year, show by show, isn't growing it fast enough  for your purposes. And that's why you would make a big sale. So that would be, that would be my  argument, but I doubt they would make the mistake given how they behave with TV plus. If they did  suddenly come in and say, we want to micromanage how the poorest paid people at the parks division  are managed. Yeah, that's going to be a disaster. Right. But I don't, I, I, I'm not sure that that

Start time: 2848.00

Transcript:  would happen. And even with, with, with beats and with other things that Apple's taken over in the  past, it usually was a pretty light step at the beginning. You know, like it's like, well, we're  going to figure this out for a little while and then we're going to start doing stuff. And again,  I think they'd probably leave, I think Apple's interest in the, in the location in Disneyland,  for instance, is going to be more about how do we add AR and extra phone tools. They probably  wouldn't touch the, how the Disneyland works. Cause Apple's pretty good at knowing that you  don't always know exactly what makes something successful and not successful. So I think that  they're, and they've been pretty good at that, that kind of thing of not kind of messing with  things unless they can figure it out. So I, I, I, I don't have any, I don't have any real concern  that Apple would do anything odd with that. I think that it's mostly just, could they figure  out how to assimilate the overall Disney culture into the Apple culture and, and just all the people  and everything's just, you know, just a lot with any of these, there's just a lot of politics and  a lot of people who have, you know, and who, who, when you merge that, like who gets to run this  division versus that division and who gets, is it an Apple person? Is it a Disney person? Is it a,  and so that, and that's just, it's two massive ships getting merged together. And so I think  it's just the overall culture and I would say more executive culture than the edge  that they'd have to figure out like who goes where to make that happen. But I do think that  again, the, the advantage for Apple is as Jason said, the advantage for Apple to fill up,  you can suddenly, you have an entirely full subscription service that is, that has got all  the bits and pieces that it needs and, and the ESPN, you know, and, and so I think that that's  so valuable to Apple. So I think it's, and I think that Apple and Amazon, you know, they don't have  to make money selling movies. Like this is all like glow, like, you know, like someone was talking  about prime, like when you're going to get rid of prime, there was something that I saw and someone  asked me, I was like, never, never going to get rid of prime. You know, like, do you see any books,  packages come into my house? Like there's no way I'm going to get rid of prime. And that's the point.  Amazon is giving me video with my, with my delivery and the, and Apple has got products and this whole  side angle of it makes it, you know, that's why all these technology companies are going to do so  well. And again, I do think that a reckoning is coming because even for me, I'm looking at how  many times am I actually going to these subscription services? And the reality is I'm not going to  Disney very often. I'm not going to max very often. I'm spending most of my time in Amazon, Apple,  Netflix, you know, and, and I'm, I'm not sure if it makes sense to keep all of these subscriptions.

I'm confusing this with succession.  I'm sorry. That's a different, that's a different show. Some of this comes from, and by the way,  this is again, the article from the Hollywood reporter by Kim Webber and Alex Weprin. It comes  from a Biger's book, the ride of a lifetime in 2019. He wrote, I believe that if Steve were still  alive, we would have combined our companies or at least discuss the possibility very seriously.  I believe that Bob Iger really wants this. I do not believe that Apple does. Look at the size.  These dots on the article are fantastic. The size comparison of big tech and you could add Google and  Microsoft and the others to the size comparisons of these, of these media companies, Netflix,  Comcast, Disney, Warner Brothers, Fox, Paramount are tiny compared to this. I think Apple could  reasonably say we would like the streaming library of Disney plus. Maybe we'd like it because we want  to get into sports ESPN. But Tim Cook has always said historically that the biggest, the reason he  doesn't do big acquisitions is the culture clash. He says it's very hard to combine cultures. And  as much as Disney is a similar culture, there are two different unions for park employees,  for instance. Apple doesn't like unions. There's also, and you glancingly mentioned this,  the FTC would absolutely sue to stop this. I mean, there's not even a question about it.  Whether they would win is another matter, but Microsoft's gone through hell with their  Activision acquisition. And yeah, it'll probably end up going through in the long run,  but it was not fun. And I don't think, I don't think Apple has a real taste for going back to

Transcript:  court after their epic lawsuit. I mean, I, I just look at the Disney acquisition of Fox,  where they divested of some stuff and that was a huge overlap. I think that this would even not  have the overlap that Microsoft and Activision has. So I just, maybe I'm, I mean, I'm sure  politically there would be fallout from this, but I, I honestly can't see how they would stop it  because there's so little overlap between the two companies.

Transcript:  that, you know, you. That's true. I mean, the, the succession analogy isn't completely wrong  because you really have kind of an old school media company and a new school technology company.  And that was kind of the thesis of all four seasons of succession was that, that old media  is dying and tech, big tech is taking over. And how do we incorporate that?

Transcript:  I think one of the big problems is, is that the, that Disney undoubtedly has an enormous  amount of value right now. But the question is, is, is, is content going to continue to be valuable  in itself? And it's very unclear that it will be, you know, and so the, you know, the, the content  is, you know, we may be going through kind of a hyperinflation of content where the stuff that  you were sitting on may not be nearly as valuable 10 years from now or five years from now or three  years from now than it is now. But then why would Apple want it?  Because the, the glow of all of those things, while we may not care about that individual piece,  we may, but it attached to the platform is very valuable to Apple because again, you have all of  this IP that you can use inside of your platform. You have all this IP that you can use inside of  your marketing. You have all this IP that you can, you know, go through that system and, and you  have things that again, each piece isn't valuable, but filling out your entire catalog is, you know,  so having a wide catalog is valuable to Apple, you know, wider than what Apple TV plus has right now.  You know, and ESPN is just keeps giving if you're looking at live, because live is the one thing  that you can still make you money. So, so there's a lot of things that are, that are there. So I  think that again, the content in itself isn't valuable. It's the magnifier of it being attached  to Apple's, all of other Apple's other products that make it valuable for Apple, you know, and,  and I don't know if it, I don't even know who else could extract that value from Disney as,  as efficiently as Apple could, you know,

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a tough call for, I think all of the stories and all the discussion about this  make a pretty decent case for why this might be something Bob Iger wants.  Why it's something that Tim Cook and Eddie Kueh want is a, it would be an enormous gamble.  It would be huge. The reason, basically what I keep coming back to, and it's not much of a hot  take, but that this is what it is, is I think people who dismiss it out of hand, don't understand,  haven't recalibrated what Apple is today because Apple has grown so much. It has so much power.  It has so much money. It has so much value and there's so much pressure for them to keep growing  as they've built that services business. Like the services business is bigger than Apple was  12 years ago, right? Like, I mean, they, they feel pressure to grow and at some point, the only way  for them to grow is to be more than they are today. And that is the wild card here for me is  today's Apple, Apple of the 2020s, does it say, sure, we will become an entertainment powerhouse  by making these acquisitions? Or does it look at its competitors in the, in the tech space and say,  they're all going to buy this stuff. So we might as well, or do they say, no, it's overpriced. It's  not worth it. We'll pick some, some stuff off later when they're selling it for parts. I think  that that's a fair argument. I'm, that's why I'm not convinced, but I would say if you dismiss it  out of hand, I think you should pay attention to how Apple has changed the last decade. Cause I  don't, I don't believe Apple of 2014 would do anything like this, right? But Apple of 2023,  wow, it is such a different company that I think you can't rule it out. And just the value of the

You need to get creative in order to  seek growth. And so that's really the question is what is the problem Tim Cook has that this would

And it's, and it's supercharging the services business and adding a whole bunch of  other new businesses that they think they can generate a lot of revenue and profit out of using  their flywheel of their, of their ecosystem, right? That would be the biggest problem right now is

And so they're saying, well, what if, what if Disney plus and, and parks even and cruises or  whatever and other kinds of like entertainment that's very profitable. One of these are things  that can help us point to a number and say, look at how profitable we are. Look at our, our huge

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that makes a lot of sense. And you know what? A company, because of the FTC, you could also look  down the road and say, well, if somebody is going to buy Disney, they're going to have to spin off  parts of it. And if it's a media company, they may well have to spin off Disney plus and ESPN.  And we could just wait till that happens and pick those little fruits up off the ground.

Transcript:  It could be, it could be. I just think that the, if someone asked me, what do you want to build?  What would you love to build AR assets against? I would say Star Wars, Pixar, you know, Marvel.  Like these are incredible IP for Apple to build for its headset, as well as all the things they're  going to insert into it. I just think that, I think that the hardest part is the culture clash  of just any company, taking two companies and merging them together. But I think the math is  there, you know, so it's just a matter of Apple figuring out whether they can get over the culture.

Transcript:  Unless Bob Iger sells off a big chunk. I mean, the premise in the THR story is that he's going to  sell off ABC and ABC News and he might sell off ESPN or part of ESPN. He might sell off Hulu,  like that there are parts of the business that he would sell off and then there would be a slimmer,  more profitable Disney that could he, he could either keep or that he could sell to a buyer like  Apple. And that again, I think is within the realm of possibility for him. I would also argue that  the idea that Apple becomes an unwieldy company that makes toothbrushes and bulldozers sort of  went out the window when they started doing like TV plus and fitness plus and things like that. I  mean, that services business, that aspect of it is weird, right? For a hardware and software company.  So I think that's what I mean. I think they've been headed in this direction,  but that they can't grow that business fast enough necessarily for what the investors want to sell.

Start time: 3581.16
End time: 3608.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think it's that weird. I don't think it's orthogonal because it's, you know, it's basically  putting stuff on the, on the hardware that they sell, which is what they've always done with Mac  OS and system seven. And that, you know, you gotta put stuff, you can't just sell hardware,  you gotta put stuff on it. Having a content arm makes perfect sense, especially since you can  charge for the content and, and hardware sales are slowing down, hardware margins are much tighter.  I feel like that makes that's very consonant with what they're doing. I don't think cruises and parks

Start time: 3608.80
End time: 3668.16
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  are at all. And not to mention, but they're not an intellectual property owner right now. Right. And  so I guess that would be the question is, do you want to own Star Wars and Pixar and, and all the  Disney stuff and Marvel? Because if you do, the argument would be, do you want to let somebody  else handle the parks experience and all of that and have it not be you, or do you want to exert  complete control like you would and like Disney does and have this extended experience where you  part even more money from, you know, your customer and their wallets? Maybe, maybe not. I, again,  I think it's weird. I think it's super weird, but I think we're in weird times where this, like,  I think the core question here is does Wall Street's insatiable need for growth, even from  the most valuable and one of the most profitable companies in the world, cause it to distort itself  in ways that make no sense. And I think the answer might be yes, but I think it's super distorted and  weird for them to even consider something like this, but they might. I mean, the big thing is,

Start time: 3668.26

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  is that on top of whatever happens with the AR headset, the AR experiences at locations,  the next 10 years, you're going to see a big explosion of that. And there would be no lab  better than Disneyland. So, so that, you know, being able to have phones to tell you where to  go, how long the line is, when to get there, how to do, and having all these, all of these services  that you could build in and you have a place that you own that you don't have to keep on arguing  about whether you can do another laser scan of it or do, or figure things out or put my, you know,  you could put, you know, you know, if they put ultra wide band, you know, in the entire Disney,  Disney world in Disneyland, about 160 kids get lost a day. You know, like having something that  just, they, they, they find them obviously. They really do. And only 150 of them are found.

Transcript:  Where are the other? I don't think that's a big suck of money. I don't. Yeah. My, my, I think  my counter argument would be though, they could also give Bob Iger a cash infusion  by licensing and having a strategic partnership about their content and about Apple tech in,  in Disneyland and like they could, they're, the question is, do you need to spend all that money?

Start time: 3745.70

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't think, I think Iger has signaled he wants to sell it off for parts. I think that's very  clear. He was talking about that at the Allen, Allen and co. And I think that really there's  two choices for him either to do it himself or to being in a big private equity company,  buys the whole thing and that's what private equity does. And then they polish it up and they  sell off the parts. I think that's the future of Disney, whether Apple wants to play or not  is another matter. And I think there are some parts that Apple might reasonably want to include  the content arms, but this is, this is pretty, if this weren't August, I don't think we'd be  talking about this. Like when I say that, let me put it that way. I know you, Alex always have wanted  to point out. I've been talking about this. I know you love this idea. Yeah. So, so it's, I just know,

Start time: 3810.34
End time: 3847.82
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  fraction. I just peeled a couple of dollars off the other. This is a big pill for them to swallow.  It's like a horse bill, right? So maybe they won't do it, but I will say this. I, I'm not confident  in saying even giving the odds that Alex gave for a purchase like this. I have a hard time imagining  that by the end of this decade, Apple hasn't bought some giant intellectual property library,  whether it's Disney or Paramount or something else. I have a hard time imagining that they  won't use some of their cash to buy content because right now they are, they've launched  the service and it's very nice. But isn't the timing bad? I mean, aren't streaming companies  bleeding right now? No. Well, that's why the timing is good because they're all bleeding

Start time: 3848.20
End time: 3852.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and they're not going to all survive. But why should Apple build a streaming business?

Start time: 3853.14
End time: 3892.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Well, they already have it. They've already built it. They're doing it because it's extra revenue  and it's very, very profitable. The margins are great and it's part of the whole iPhone revenue  flywheel because their investors don't care that they lose money on streaming because they make it  up somewhere else and because they're building a huge business. Whereas the tiny Hollywood companies,  their investors are freaked out that they're spending so much money on streaming content.  So huge advantage for Apple. I think they will pick some stuff up, but the question is,  what's it going to be? But I have a hard time. The truth of that premise of like,  are they going to eat all of Hollywood? I don't know that, but a lot of the libraries here are  going to get snapped up by companies with big wallets. I don't know if they need anything

Start time: 3892.16

Transcript:  other than Disney. I think for Apple, if they bought Disney, they'd be like, okay, that's what  we have to work with. And then everybody else has to, because it will be, I think,  a turning point in Hollywood of suddenly everybody kind of figuring things out about what happens  next. Because again, the challenge really with the strike is that the strike continues, it keeps on  applying leverage to this and puts a lot of these studios in a really complicated position because  they don't really know how to make money outside of releasing the theaters. And if they empty the  theaters, the theaters are going to have to find something else to do with themselves. And they'll  either close or come into a new business and they'll be a lot less interested in movies in 2026.

Which is very, I think, yeah, that's telling. There's trouble ahead. It seems to me that it's,  as you've already talked about, both of you, Alex and Jason, the advantage Big Tech has in content  is overwhelming. And it strikes me that probably all the content will be eventually owned by  Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Netflix. Netflix? You think Netflix is going to stick

Transcript:  around? Yeah, I think they've built a wall for themselves that is not going to come down. I  think that they're the winner of the gold rush and then everything else, all the other gold rush  stuff happening in the entertainment industry, they all put themselves in a hole. And now they've  made themselves weak trying to be Netflix and it feels like maybe they're all just going to get

Start time: 3986.34

Transcript:  bought up by Netflix's competitors. And the problem is Netflix did what no one else had the guts to  do, which is spend $18 billion a year on content. I mean, I talked to a producer a couple years ago  and he's like, well, there's 900 producers and we're 900 short and we're just jamming out  incredible amounts of content at a fairly high quality. And so I think that Netflix built that  up and now they have a reservoir to sit on for a long time. Because a lot of stuff, I just keep  finding new things. Like there's a new series that was three years old or five years old or whatever  and we start watching it. And so they've got a lot to sit on. That's a good point. The strike

Start time: 4023.72

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  is probably good for Netflix, isn't it? Yeah. One of the reasons why I dropped Disney Plus is because  I realized that it is still possible for me to navigate their entire library and check off the  things I want to see. And there's just no sense of surprise or discovery. It doesn't hurt that they  make a lot of stuff that I'm not interested in. But at least with Netflix, if I'm going to keep one,  if I'm going to keep one commercial streaming service as something that, hey, there's a new  show that people are talking about, maybe it'll be on this or, hey, wow, if I keep digging into  documentaries, maybe it's going to recommend something that's going to be interesting on a  night when I don't know what I want to watch. That's the one that's going to keep, I think  Alex is right. They are the brand right now and everybody else right now is just the,  and in addition to Netflix, maybe I'll also have X. I mean, I'm like a lot of people,  I'm auditing all my streaming this month and the only two that are safe from elimination,  that have immunity models are Netflix and YouTube Premium only because so much of my content is  through YouTube and I don't want to see any of their damn commercials.

So in the long run, that's all just going to go away and there'll be other ways to do it.  But as somebody who subscribes, I subscribe to Fubo, but it's the same thing.  Right. It's like it's a cable replacement for now, but all that stuff is getting  drained out of the cable bundle or at least replicated elsewhere.  And it's possible for some people that paying for something like a cable bundle will still be the  best deal depending on what you want to watch. But in the long run, it's all going to fade away  into nothing. But YouTube itself is huge. And why you can't discount when we talk about Apple  and Amazon and that story that's an Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and somebody else is like,  well, no, no, no. Also, Google will be there with YouTube at the very least.  And YouTube is very different, but it's still huge.

And I got into the battle of Agincourt and I watched like four or five different 15  minute videos that were done about the battle so that I understood what was going on. Because I  was watching Henry the Fifth and I was like, what really happened in this battle? You know, and  it was just amazing that five people had spent so much time building, like one person had like  Unreal Engine people fighting.

Like the, you know, the cost per minute that they wanted to pay was much lower than everybody  else pays. And that wasn't going to, they thought that they could make it incrementally better.

That's part of the power of Netflix and why they will survive is Netflix is so powerful  that they'll put anything in front of you to a certain degree and you will watch it. And the best  example is Suits, a TV show that ran on the USA network like a decade ago and was on available  on Peacock for years and years and years. And it is the most watched TV show of this summer.  Really?  It's just reruns of an old show. And why is it that? Because NBC  universal licensed it, not exclusively to Netflix.

Elon Musk's shadow rule, how the U S government came to rely on the tech  billionaire and is now struggling to rein him in. And it really reminds me of the sci-fi future,  where these big tech companies and in some cases, individuals are going to be the global power,  not governments. And so I think, you know, in some ways we may look back on this 10, 20 years from  now and say, this is Apple beginning to start to dominate, you know, in a way that.

Transcript:  I mean, the thing is, is that like, I don't know, but in that article, like he's the one that had  the satellites there and they act like, you know, he held everybody over, but he told them for months  that he needed someone else to pay for this. Like he's like, you know, like I didn't sign up for this  and he finally had to turn it off to get them to pay. And the DOD should have been paying for that  from day one, like, you know, like it was like, or use their own satellites. It was just crazy.  Like what the government, what our government did there was dumb, you know, and so the fact  that they were relying on a commercial entity to provide their services and their satellites for  free, you know, it was, it was just a nutty thing for them to do. And I don't even know what thought  process was going on that we're going to allow a commercial entity. We're not going to pay for it.  We're just going to hope that it stays there. Well, as Farrell points out, this is kind of what

Transcript:  So that story, the fascinating thing about that story is, and it's an example where you can't  really count out Elon Musk, despite the fact that his Twitter stuff is a complete dumpster fire,  is somebody, whether it was him or somebody at SpaceX, realized that SpaceX had essentially  cornered the market on cheap access to space and they got so much job, you know, so many,  much money out of it and business out of it from commercial satellite launches and from government  stuff. And yet they built this reusable spacecraft and it's so cheap to launch it. And at some point  they had that moment, which is, you know what, we can launch this thing so often for so cheap  that we have enormous unsold excess capacity. What could we do with it? And somebody said,  why don't we just build a bunch of internet satellites and launch thousands of satellites?  And they did it. They've done that with their cheap access to space that nobody else has.  And they've essentially created an entire other huge and important company inside SpaceX,  which is Starlink. And it's all because right now, as that article points out, like they are the  biggest launcher of a mass to space this year is going to be SpaceX followed by China. And then the  rest of the world with about 10%. Like, and they're using it to build other businesses now,  which so they're dominant in other areas. It's really like somebody did something very smart,  but it's also extremely disturbing that is one guy has access to everything around the world.

Transcript:  Especially when you consider that, like that Starlink is responsible for tripling the number  of objects in orbit right now up to up until before Starlink, there's something like fewer  than 1800 objects total in orbit, and they alone have added about 5000. And of course,  but they're being good sports about it and saying, oh, well, both the US government,  you shouldn't be allowing Boeing to create their own constellation for our competing service,  because not enough room up there for us and any other competitor. It's only logical.

Transcript:  Well, the thing is, we've been pushing this. The government has been saying we're going to  keep on paying for really hard things. And then we want everyone else to do the other stuff.  We want to outsource that. And that's been actually pretty cost effective for the government.  So the thing is, is that NASA works on getting to Mars, like in building that building the  infrastructure, Artemis is the first step to that process of building a station for that.  But we don't want to deal NASA didn't want to deal with continually putting up NASA used to  have to deal with it was a big distraction for them to continue to do the satellite work.  So they got rid of that. We've been using we used MCI satellites for a long time. So these  are commercial satellites that we would use for communication. One of the problems they had is  that if you suddenly had a blackout, if you were out of the United States, and there was suddenly  a blackout in some of your kind of connectivity, you knew that special operations were somewhere,  they're doing something, you know, and so and because they'd have priority access to those  satellites. And so so we would buy buy all this stuff up. And it's been something that it hasn't  definitely not anything even remotely new. I mean, this is 3040 years old of us doing this. And  United States puts up we put up our own satellites, but our satellites are hard and  we want to keep them secret and we don't want to but the we've commoditized the other things  are commoditized. You know, GPS is a site is basically a government,  a government funded technology that was then commercialized, which the government still can

Thank you, Jason.  Our show today brought to you by discourse. You know, if you go to our forums, twit.community,  you're using discourse. When I wanted to set up forums, it was John O'Bacon who convinced me that,  you know, we really ought to have a place where people could go comment on shows and that kind of  thing. I looked at a variety of stuff. But John said, don't even don't even look at the other  forum software. Look, this is the one discourse. discourse hosts it for me. They make it easy. It  is the online home for the twit community should be the online home for your community. I am fully  convinced as a as a longtime discourse user now for over a decade. Discourse has made it their  mission to make the internet a better place for online communities by harnessing the power of  discussion they've got now. They just added real time chat AI. Yes, this AI discourse makes it easy  to have meaningful conversations and collaborate with your community anytime, anywhere. Podcasting  is all about community. I mean, that's that was the lesson. You know, it's about the community you  build around you. And we want to make sure our community can interact with us in a way that they  love. And that's why we use discourse. Would you like to create a community? Go to discourse.org  slash twit, you'll get one month free on all self service plans. It is open source,  trusted by some of the largest companies in the world. It's powered powers more than 20,000  online communities. And I have to say, the hosting at discourse saves me so much energy  that it's just I just let them do it because they do such a good job. They keep it up to date,  they keep it secure. All the new features get added in a prompt fashion. It just works beautifully,  whether you're just starting out or want to take your community to the next level. There's a plan  for you. There's a basic plan if you want to have a small private invite only community, very  affordable. The standard plan if you want unlimited members and a public presence. We of course use  the business plan for active customer support communities. Jonathan Bulava, who's developer  advocacy lead at Twitch says, yes, Twitch uses it. Discourse is the most amazing thing we've  ever used. We've never experienced software so reliable ever. I have to say, I never really  thought about the reliability of discourse except that I've never had a problem. I haven't had to  think about it. Our twit community runs on discourse. This is one of many themes you can use.  This is the one I like a dark theme, but not only can you choose your theme when you use discourse  on the twit.com community, you could choose your theme as you set up your discourse community. And  there are a lot of themes that can make it look like whatever you want it to look like. Discourse  is just fantastic. One of the biggest advantages to creating your own community with discourse,  you own your own data. You always have access to all the conversation history and discourse pledges  they will never sell your data to advertisers. Discourse gives you everything you need in one  place with world-class hosted customer support. Make discourse the online home for your community  at discourse.org slash twit. D-I-S-C-O-U-R-S-E. Discourse. Like, you know, we're having a nice  discourse here. Discourse.org slash twit. Get one month free on all self-serve plans. I am such a fan.  And if you want to, you know, try a discourse forum, go to twit.com community, sign up.  I think you'll see what a great place it is. And it's all running on discourse. Discourse.org slash  twit. I'm a, I am a big, big fan as a, as an administrator of our discourse instance. And by  the way, I do it all by myself. Well, I, we have a volunteer, Paul, I'm sorry, I forgot. You help a  lot, Paul Holder, but really it's, it's easy to maintain and easy to run. It doesn't take a huge  amount of manpower. That's, and I really credit them for that. Discourse.org slash twit. All right.  Let's see here. I have a few shorties. This is actually kind of cool. Apple is now,  I guess it's Tesla really, is adding Apple shortcuts, iOS shortcuts to the Tesla app,  which I think is great. I wish Ford would do this. I wish all manufacturers would do this.  Tesla's iOS app mean with, with Apple shortcuts means you can, you know, write your own command,  have Siri lock your doors, start your car, whatever it is you want to do. You can access  the vehicle controls and climate from the Apple shortcuts app. That's version four dot 24.0.

Start time: 4948.90
End time: 5016.30
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. So for example, you could use your Apple watch or your phone to use a Siri command to tell  it to, you know, open the frunk or unlock the doors or set the thermostat or like, there's a  lot of things you can do. And then you could also set up like automations that are based on triggers,  anything you can do with shortcuts in order to, you know, you connect to this, you enter this  location, do this thing to the car. It's all, it doesn't look like a read state. It only writes  state. So it'll, it will let you do something like say if the temperature goes above this inside the  car, then turn on the AC. That's not capable in this. There are, there are other apps that do  stuff like this that are like scraping the Tesla API, but Tesla seems to have finally gotten the,  the news that shortcuts exists after a long time. And it'll be useful because there are things that  the Tesla app won't let Tesla owners do that on like, there's no watch app, for example, right?  So having the ability to run a shortcut or give a Siri command using a watch when you don't have  your phone with you is that's a nice to have. It's a good, it's a good modern app thing. So

Transcript:  this is a weird story from, but I like eclectic light.co and if they're, they dig deep into the  contents, actually should say he digs deep into the contents of the Mac OS. He noted  that Mac OS updates for Apple Silicon Macs are larger than reported.  And there's an easy way to tell. It turns out, I guess that the updates include the Intel content  and then there's a second download for the Silicon Apple Silicon. So for instance, in the case of the  13.5.1 update 500 megabytes for Intel reported as 700 megabytes for Apple Silicon, but there's a  second component only downloaded by Apple Silicon, which is 1.1 gig. So really Apple Silicon's was  1.8 gigs compared to 500 megs for Intel. And you can tell that when you use the software update  command, this is a command line command, but there's a switch include config data,  which I played with and it tells you some interesting stuff. Don't know what it means.  Don't know why we care. But you know, if you've noticed that you're getting these massive updates  on your M1 and M2 Macs, that's, that's what's going on. No comment.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  conscious to the fact that I usually start an update before I go to bed and then I, you know,  I sign whatever it needs to sign and then I go do my thing. Yeah. I wonder if there's a security

Start time: 5155.80
End time: 5179.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  issue here where there's like a sealed volume or something that has to be downloaded in its entirety  right in order for some sort of security. It's signed and sealed and that is different,  you know, because they did some of that stuff on Intel, but I wonder if there's some aspect of what  has happened with Apple Silicon that, that they have to do a more or a less efficient, let's say  kind of download for some security reason. Like part of the installation process involves

Start time: 5180.44
End time: 5185.52
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  and running something under revisions or something like that. Yeah. Or there's a sign volume that

Start time: 5186.38
End time: 5193.56
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  they, they aren't going to update it piece by piece. They're just going to swap in the whole  volume. And so they have to download the whole volume even though some of it changes.

Start time: 5193.80
End time: 5199.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wouldn't be at all surprised the way PFS divides your, your volumes into these hidden

Start time: 5199.50
End time: 5232.32
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  volumes and data and system. I mean, the, I mean the, the, the big, the, the reason why I haven't  I've got an update, I have an update waiting for me on the, on my Mac book. One of the reasons why  I haven't installed it yet is that like, Oh, I'm, I'm visiting someone's house and the power could  go out because like there are storms coming. And the thing that everybody fears is what if,  what if there's something that interrupts the system update right in the middle of it?  So they've, they've been getting better and better at preventing that sort of thing from happening,  but the idea of let's build the entire thing first, get that stable. And then as a last step,

Start time: 5232.44
End time: 5270.24
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  we will write it to the volume. Actually the curious, the most curious thing about this report  is that, you know, you can set up a content caching server so that your one Mac on your house will  download the update and then all the other Macs will just download it from that Mac.  It's an eclectic feature for eclectic light code, but some people do it. The second download for  Apple Silicon won't be cached. It always has to be, it has to be downloaded from Apple, which again,  feels like a security thing to me that they're trying to prevent people from  setting up a fake image somewhere and having that be downloaded instead. But it does mean that that  the great caching server you set up is not going to prevent that 1.1 gigabyte download on every

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I think we get confirmation by visiting like a Hackintosh forum and see how upset they are  about something that's happened in the past three or four days because like anytime Apple's,  a lot of the reasons why Apple makes these, makes these big, big changes to the way installations  and updates happen is because someone has found a bug or a trick and they want that bug or trick

Start time: 5296.70
End time: 5310.78
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  to go away. Although this is Apple Silicon, right? So not Intel where the Hackintosh people are. So  maybe they don't care. But you're right. That's a classic is, is the Hackintosh people find a  loophole and then Apple closes the loophole and then they find another loophole inevitably.

By the way, Howard Oakey and  eclecticlight.co is an amazing website because he's a painter too. And he's, you know, it's a  collect, it's truly eclectic. This is not it, but I will show you the site. There you go.  He also has a, a series of four paintings by Eugene Delacroix and the story of that,  which he published this week as well. So it's a very, it's a very eclectic, Max painting and more

Transcript:  very interesting site. Of course, the, of course the payoff is that he has great content in late,  in late August. We're asked, we were like talking about, well, there's the, there's the, the thing is  you can get on the all season radials until maybe October, but in New England, if you don't switch  to the snow tires, I mean, you don't want to cheap out on tires. That's all I'm saying. That's,  that's where most of your breaking comes from and handling. And if you want to know for eclectic is

I  don't know who put this in, but it's really interesting from the MIT technology review,  Claire Evans article, by the way, I love the MIT technology reviews I pay for.  On the front, the picture is from the 1987 reveal of the sob 9,000 CD sedan,  2,500 people in the audience. They were treated to an hour long. This is sob, an hour long  operetta involving 26 foot tall projection screens, a massive chorus, the entire Stockholm Philharmonic  and 50 performers to announce a car.

Seagrams had an 11 city traveling extravaganza designed to  drum up sales for their booze, a two hour professionally acted stage play about the  life of a whiskey salesman. And in it one of the very first presentation slideshows,  hundreds of images of the distilling process set to music projected across 540 by 15 foot screens.  The overall effect is one of magnificence said one odd witness.  So that was I think maybe one of the first multimedia business presentations, but there's

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  many more in this really fantastic. The time slideshow thing before there was video.  They had these time slideshows plus the stage stuff. If you watched what the last season of  the marvelous Mrs. Maisel, she appears in one of these bizarre acted out stage play, but it's an  ad. It's so strange. But like in the before we had computers and easily done video, one of the cheap  ways to do this was you'd have like 510. I don't even know how many slide projectors and they're  all like timed. So you can like do animations, but they're kind of like two frames a second.  And you can have things everywhere. And this also goes into the invention of PowerPoint. And  when that happened and it actually linked to a PDF, that's the initial sort of like, I think  computers could make slides on the computer. And it's like, Oh, here we go. Right. Like that's the  end of the world for the rest of the next few decades. But it's, it's, business is always  wanting to impart information in the technology. They've used technology aggressively in order to  do that. And there was a golden age of corporate audio video sync slideshows. I put a link in there  to the Apple. There's an Apple video from 1984. That's one of those that you can see that it's a  captured, it's essentially captured slideshow. And like that was, that was the way you did corporate  marketing back then, but until PowerPoint was invented. This will also be of interest to people

So one month, like on Phil, I think it was on the one  called Phil and Dave's excellent CD, where it's like, Oh, by the way, here is, we are Apple. Here  are a whole bunch of other corporate songs that like we found because we have to fill this,  we have room on the CD and you may as well be embarrassed along with this.

Right. Can't believe we haven't talked about bathtubs over Broadway yet. This beautiful  documentary about these like corporate for like the annual like sales conference for like GM or  for, for, for, for Dow Chemical or something. They had so much money to put into this that they  would actually pay like some of the best Broadway composers working hire huge, huge crews to put  together the stage production, huge cast. Many of them are like who are people are going to be like  huge stars in their own right. Like Martin Short, whatever years later. And they, they,  they wrote a complete musical about like bathroom fittings. And so this, this, this, this guy who's  like a producer on the Letterman show, he started, he came across like his first like corporate  Broadway album because he was, he wanted props for like a day's record collection segment. But  he started like getting more and more into it and finding more and more of these things. They would  say, Oh, by the way, and here's a, here's a, it was a mental of that wonderful week we spent together  in Fort Lauderdale. Here's a cast album of the, of this presentation and they're incredible.  It's, it's, it's a great documentary. If you want to see it, it's on Netflix. Guess what? It's on

Transcript:  Wow. I mean, it still, it still happens. I mean, you know, these, these, you know, whether it's  bands or other people, a lot of these corporate events, especially ones that are a little bit more  private, they bring, they bring a lot. And the thing is they do, the unfortunate thing is you  watch, they hire people who are really well known in Hollywood or they're known as the people who  worked on this or the people who worked on that. And then they get them in and those people look  at them as like a big cash cow to experiment with things that they've never done before.  So they're like, let's do this, you know, like, you know, because it's the thing that's in the  back of their head that they've always wanted to do that no Hollywood producer would ever pay for.  And they get the corporations to pay for that, you know? And so that's always the, and that's still,  you know, to this day is still a hole that some corporations fall into is getting, you know,  Hollywood people to do their, to do their shows because they usually spend an enormous amount of  money for something that probably doesn't have any ROI. And so the, so I think that that's always the  challenge, but it still happens. I mean, you see A level bands, A level actors showing up for some  of these things. And, and, and so it's, I don't know if it really helps them that much, but I think  it's been really interesting to watch. We had those with school, remember those, when we grew up,  I don't know, when I grew up, they, we would all be brought into the auditorium and then they have  these little slideshows about drugs and about other things. Your friend's zinc. Yeah. Yeah,  exactly. And so all of those things, you know, were, were built up. And I think the big,  the explosion, as it talks there, the best thing that ever happened was that suddenly everyone was  able to communicate. The worst thing that ever happened was that someone was, everyone was able  to communicate. And so we went from teams figuring out how to properly communicate to lists in bullet  points, which was just the most evil thing ever. Most of these presentations were not

And it wasn't until maybe even Apple,  where they would start doing these and extensively for the press and developers, but they knew that  really this was a big event for consumers. I think Apple put these on the map, right?

Transcript:  a long time ago. I think the problem is that Apple now, at the beginning, what I had heard was that  they didn't want to make it available so that A, the press all had a reason to go out and  report it because they all had it. If you streamed it, then it was already all out there. So the  press suddenly, nobody has it out there. Everybody has a chance to do something with it. And so it  engaged them and they wanted to make sure the press showed up. Now there's no problem with that.  The press is a problem. But now everyone wants to go to Steve Jobs Theater and everybody wants to,  there's a limited number of seats. And so now it's like, who's been there for the longest and  everything else. And they still have to have half of them available for everybody to flap.

Transcript:  The most bizarre one that I ever got walking into an event was I was told no live blogging  because we had done some live blogging. They're like, no live blogging for this. So, you know,  what we did is I had a text message window back to the office to, I think Peter Cohen, who wrote  for us at that time. And I literally would just text him what was happening on stage. And then he  would then write, he would have hit a news story that he would update as things were announced,  but it was written like a news story and not like a live blog. And we were like, what, what?  It's not a live blog. We're covering the news as it happens. And then like they'd announce a new  product, he'd do a news story saying Apple had also announced this product today and I'd send  him quotes. And I was, I was reporting from the scene, but it wasn't live blogging. And honestly,  that was the last time they ever asked anything like that. I mean, I'm sitting there, this was

And the answer to  Apple is, look, if you don't want this to happen, this is what happened with Steve Jobs telling  everybody to turn off their Mifis. It's the same thing, which is here's the solution. Apple  provide wifi in the room for the reporters. And then we won't use those anymore and stream the  thing live and you won't have Leo holding up his laptop, right? Just do it. Why are you withholding  this stuff? You can't pretend that this is a magic bubble and nothing can reach outside it.  Like we're not going to do that. They love that. So they have a cone of silence. I will tell you,  I will tell you the event they held after Steve told everybody to turn off their Mifis, by the way,  for the record, I sat on mine. I did not turn it off. I kept doing my job because you know what,  Steve, I'm doing my job here. I don't care what you are asking. I'm not interested in what you  have to say.

You know, Microsoft just announced that they're  going to do their Surface event the day before Apple ships its new iPhone on the 21st.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Microsoft has been doing movies too. And this is the thing that's really changing is that we  went from slides to PowerPoint to keynote to, I mean, for many years, for nearly every company  out there, people would hand us a PowerPoint and we go or Google slides or whatever and we go,  hey, we're going to prep this for broadcast, which meant that we were going to convert it to  keynote. And it was everybody in the event world would just convert everything to keynote because  it would play out better. And so, but that playback now is now turned into while we can,  and I think COVID finally pushed through what a lot of us thought was going to happen eventually  is just play a movie. Like, let's just make it clean and fast and we can then answer questions  at the end. And I think that the era of the stage performance has probably got less than  five years, I would say, that would be conservatively, I would say probably less  than two or three. You probably won't see very many stage announcements anymore.

His co-founder,  Charles Geschke, passed away in, I think, 2021 at the age of 81. Warnock was 82. And  whatever you think of Adobe today, and I know a lot of it's uncomplimentary,  Adobe, when he started it, was a revolution. I think you agree, Alex, yes?

But what they're doing in 3D, what they're  doing in generative AI, and then still the Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, and the  many other products that they have, they still are an engine within the industry. And they've  really been able to continue to build that and continue to stay in front of things and not be  afraid to... They bought, of course, our friend Emory's company to keep going.  Nice job.

John could see what was necessary, and Tom had  the core, some of the core stuff there. And the two of them together built this incredible  little app that really solved the real problem that had the... And what John needed at ILM.  They're going around showing it. My understanding is they went to Aldous,  they went to other people saying, hey, we've got this little app and people couldn't understand it.  And Adobe snapped it right up. There was not any... There was no... They understood what...  Warnock understood what he was looking at. And that made the company for a while. That was really...  They had other things, but that was... When you think about the 90s and Photoshop just coming out  of nowhere and suddenly it's shipping with every scanner, it's all these other things. It just the...  And it really set you up to buy Illustrator, to use PageMaker, to use other things.  It was just such an incredible gateway drug for the entire company.

Transcript:  The entire Mac windowing infrastructure is based on DisplayPostScript. And of course,  every document in existence is now a PDF, which is the format created out of PostScript.  It's the portable document format out of PostScript by Adobe.  People can roll their eyes at some of the marketing stuff that Adobe does now and all that,  but so foundational to... And remember, PostScript and the laser writer. One of the reasons Apple  and the Mac got so big in the publishing industry in the 80s was because of their partnership with  Adobe and putting PostScript in the laser writer. And then PostScript sort of went everywhere.  And that you got the WYSIWYG concept of publishing where you could see it on screen exactly as it  was going to be when it came out of the high quality printer. All of that stuff, that was  an Apple-Adobe partnership that led to all of that. And it's rooted in PostScript.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And the fact that the laser writer was once the most powerful computer that Apple made  because Steve Jobs immediately saw what PostScript could be. And so we need this printer  to be able to run PostScript. And it was just such a tactile thing. Yeah. PostScript.  I'm one of a lot of people who bought the red book and the blue book  because they wanted to learn how to code PostScript because Illustrator didn't exist yet.  But it's like, our curve to, our line to, oh my God, look at this circle. Everybody look at this

The master's thesis was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for  row finite matrices. His doctoral thesis was the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination  in computer graphics. And if that sounds abstruse, believe me, you wouldn't have a video game today  without hidden surface determination. You just couldn't, you couldn't calculate all of those

Start time: 6622.86

Transcript:  surfaces. Well, and if you really think about the perfection of, you know, because I think that  Photoshop really did spark something for Adobe is that they had, he had, because of his knowledge  of PostScript and because of their knowledge of lines, they had kind of had that figured out.  If someone had come to them and said, Hey, we've got a drawing program that can do whatever they're  like, we have that, right? You know, illustrator was the illustrator 88, I think was the one,  the one that I had there. And they had figured that part out in Photoshop. What was complimentary  to that. And, you know, what the Noll brothers were doing was exactly the compliment to what  illustrator did. And out as who I think I, if I remember correctly, passed on Photoshop,  ended up getting bought by Adobe. Yeah, it's a page maker. Yeah, yeah. So the hidden surface

And it was what allowed you to do solid objects, 3d objects,  instead of those line, those vector tracing objects. So Warnock invented that pretty,  but I think, I think one of the biggest thing is, is that Adobe has been able to stay relevant,

Start time: 6695.42

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  you know, companies that go that far back really have a hard time, you know, there's,  that's true. That is a good point. There's a long set of wreckage of companies and their software.  And, you know, and I think that, and, you know, they, they keep surprising you, you look at like,  what, what they're doing with generative AI right now, when they started it, I was like,  when they started Firefly, I was like, Oh, this isn't going to work. You know, this is nearly as  good as mid journey. And now they're really solving some pretty hard problems with it in a way that  can be used in commercial work. And so I think that it's, so he really, you know, I think that  it's not just that he, and that comes always from the, I don't think it always comes from the  founders, but oftentimes, there's a general culture that keeps moving it forward. So

He worked with Geshki at Park, Xerox Park, worked there in 1978,  unable, this is the, this is a telling line, unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to  commercialize the interpress graphics language for controlling printing. He together with Geshki and  Putman left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. Once again, well done Xerox at their new company,  they developed from scratch a similar technology, PostScript, and brought it to market for Apple's

Well, and that's what happens to the big companies that Adobe has been able to  kind of not have happened very much to them is that big companies, you know, they, they're big,  they can't understand how that's ever going to become a big market. They don't want to, you know,  spend extra resources on it and they just miss the boat. His wife, Marva was a graphics designer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He watched her painstakingly using, remember those curve rulers to make Bezier curves painstakingly.  He said, Hmm, I think we could do better. They invented Adobe Illustrator to automate the manual  tasks Marva had to do. That was released in 1987. In 91, he outlined a system called Camelot that  evolved into the portable document format, PDF. The goal was to effectively capture documents from  any application, send electronic versions of those documents anywhere and view and print those  documents on any machine. I think he had the right idea there. There is an Adobe typeface named after  him, Warnock. I did not know that. I will be start using Warnock immediately. He had seven patents,  it's a really amazing person and a great pioneer of the industry. And I like to highlight these guys  because younger generations often forget where this all came from. And this is a person who

Start time: 6853.86
End time: 6974.08
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  did pretty amazing things. Particularly when in an era where you find out, well, wow, who's the CEO  of this company and what's their history? And you find out, well, they were an investment banker.  And they have to leverage partial. They run this company because they bought this. They invested  early and they moved them. And now because they've been associated with this company for so long,  they imagine themselves to have an intimate knowledge of exactly all about this technology.  And then there are the companies like Adobe where, oh, well, you know the idea of pixels? He invented  it. As a matter of fact, yes, I see. It's like, oh, okay. So he actually helped build all this.  Again, all the talk is about Photoshop. But again, the idea of something as abstract as  PostScript and how important that was going to be. Just here is a common type setting  computing language that you can install on a small office printer like the LaserWriter,  or it could be installed on a huge pre-press systems. And no matter what app you're using  at whatever level, if it's based on PostScript and this is what you're seeing as you're laying this  out and designing it, by the time you spend $200,000 to have all these copies of this book,  these illustrations run off the press, it will look exactly like what you had on the screen of  your $3,000 computer. That was revolutionary. And the power in a pre-internet age of the ability to  be creating newsletters, the ability to be able to create and edit photos on your own without  having to have contact with an infrastructure that will essentially in a way prove or disapprove  whether they want to be involved with you and this thing you want to publish. Or not to say  nothing of the fact that it's going to take you four years of technical training before you'll  even have the slightest idea of how to prepare this photo for press. That's the sort of technology  that I love where it creates opportunities and solves problems for regular people, not just for

Transcript:  mentioned how he likes YouTube and that how there's content on YouTube that you don't see  anywhere else. And I actually have been following a series on YouTube that I wouldn't see anywhere  else. And I love it. I am not a car guy at all, but I saw a link to this and it's just fascinating.  There's a car YouTuber named Tavares and he found a $2 million McLaren P1 for sale on the internet.  It had been completely submerged in floodwaters during the hurricane that hit Florida.  And so it was totaled essentially, but you know, it's still a McLaren P1 that lists for $2 million  and had been driven about 300 miles. And the first video in this series starts with him hovering his  cursor over the buy button at $575,000. Such a deal. Yikes. And this is an ongoing series.  There are like eight parts already where this guy, and again, he's a car YouTuber. He has access to  lots of help and sponsors who can help and all that. But still, it is enthralling to watch  this supercar be taken apart as the water and the sand. There's sand everywhere. And oil. And they're  like, Oh, oh, look, it's oil. Maybe the water didn't. Nope. Nope. There's the water. It just  invades every part of this. And throughout, you've also got this extra little bit, which is,  is our friend the YouTuber going to really regret spending $575,000 on a submerged,  non-functional car? And I just, I love it because if you are a car person, you can take that deep  dive and be really super into the details of the McLaren. I am not a car person, but I just,  I love the spectacle of it. I love the fact that there are these, you know, speeded up sections  where they're trying to clean this thing. That's just sort of tranquil and beautiful as they try  to get all the sand out of it. And, you know, the real question is, will it ever run to be determined?  Although I suspect it will. He may have to just buy a new engine. He may replace literally,  it may become the P1 athesius here before he's done. But I think Tavari is just going to,  my real question is, I want to see the bill at the end of like all the stuff that he spent  and also how many views these videos got and how much money he made. But I'm going to guess that  he's going to end up with a pretty cool car that will have been worth it. And then he'll probably  sell that car and make a profit on that. And he will have created hours of content for his YouTube  channel. So anyway, if you're at all interested in this spectacle of the hurricane destroyed car  and trying to bring it back to life and how the sand, I just can't emphasize this enough,  how the sand gets everywhere. It is a lot of fun. The Tavarish flooded McLaren P1 series on YouTube.

Transcript:  Tavarish. Andy, you've seen this too? Yeah. I mean, and I'm like the first three or four episodes,  I'm like, I've, I've, I've been subscribing to his channel for a while. He does a lot of,  and he's not one of these like car channels where he's like, Hey, we got this lawnmower engine. We  thought, Hey, what if we put it inside a Rolls Royce? Woo. It's like, no, he does. He tries, he,  he, he has a lot of resources and he tries to like take a wrecked car wrecked supercar and  either put it back the way it was, or, well, look, we can't get this engine. So let's see if we can  upgrade it because it's been 12 years since the thing was released. And the first three or four  episodes, I'm like, it's, it's like, Jason, we probably have the same thing. It's like,  we're, we're expecting, Oh, it was trashed in a hurricane. Okay. So I bet that like the, the,  the house collapsed and like, it got really, really, the interior is all wet. It's like,  no, there's video, there's home security video of it, like floating out to sea. And it's like,  and like, and like the sand is like part of the mixture of the water that's flooding it.  And so that it's like eight weeks in and it's like, okay, so here is like, here is the inside  of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of something we took off at the episode one

He, he, he amps up the drama and his thumbnails and all of that,  but it is, it's just, what a spectacle, even as somebody who doesn't really care that much about  cars. It's, it's a great use of YouTube. And I did this, I told my wife about this and she's like,  half a million dollars on a broken car. And I'm like, yeah, but it's YouTube, right? Like  he's seeing all the content and he knows how many ads and how he's got his sponsors and he will make  a meal out of this and boy has he ever, but so fun to watch and so much sand.

Could, but all of this stuff is shorter than a show, right? I  mean, can you, can you make it to make a meal out of it? Can you make a meal?

Transcript:  and the Anacca. You're big of the week. When I saw Jason's pick, I had to add a second to mine  because my favorite channel on youtube is probably a couple of mechanics and engineers called bad  obsession motor sports. And for 10 years they have been doing this project where they're taking  like a vintage 1982 Mini Cooper and say, well, I also, I also have like this performance race equipped  to a four wheel drive, turbocharged sports car. I want to put like the four wheel drive running gear  and the engine from that into this 1982. And again, it's not a, Hey, we're going to do and,  and there's, cause with those, with those others channels, it's like, okay, you have no intention  of actually building this properly. You just want to get a video out of it and you've got it scheduled  for the next eight months. You'll finish it by whatever ways that no, this has been 10 years  because these are two mechanics that their goal is to build is to basically you're watching them  build an entire car from the ground up because that's just the start of things. Obviously nothing's  going to fit inside this, all the car starting with all of the body panels are rusted out. So  they have to replace all the butt, all the body panels. Then the car then, because they don't want  to make it, they would, they want it to look like it's absolutely stock from the outside. So they're  not going to lengthen it. It's not going to add a bump in the hood or anything like that. It's like,  okay, well we were, we decided we're going to have to take off everything on the engine that  doesn't absolutely have to be where it is. Okay. Okay. Now we've got this in the engine compartment,  but now it's half an engine. So now it's like, okay, now we have to go to the wrecking yard  because we need to find a power steering pump that's going to fit in the area that we have  ready for it. And also things like, well, how do we get, how do we get the cooling working in this?  And well, the original didn't have side impact protection, protection, didn't have power windows,  didn't have good air conditioning. They're really, really funny. And the heating system had two  settings on and, or excuse me, had two settings off and might as well be. And they're super,  super funny. You only see an episode like every three or four months when there's something  interesting to share and it's a really slickly produced show. Again, it's not, and so we ordered,  we ordered a custom bracket from our friends over at blah, blah, blah. So no, three quarters of this  job is, and we, we did find a power steering pump, but now we have to, why don't we have to design  and build a bracket to install it? Because of course there's no bracket for it. So it's, it's  just hugely entertaining. They're up to episode number 38. They are finally up to the point where  just like the last episode, they actually started it up for the first time. Cause now it's all,  it's all put together. It's all, it's all put together. It's painted. It's, it's nearly done.  But at this point, like their troubles are probably just starting because at this point,  all they have is a one-to-one scale model of a car. Now they have to not only get the engine  running, but also drive it and figure out where they screwed up and things like that. So highest  recommendation. I support them on Patreon cause it's like, I don't care that I'm giving you money  per month, even though I'm only getting maybe two videos a year. I like the cut of your jib young  men. I want, I want you to, I will look forward to your future operations with considerable interest.

Transcript:  They have other content too, but it's, it's pretty good. The, the, the, fortunately the other,  my other pick is really, really simple. I was looking forward to, I, I'm not at the point where  I've, I have a Plex server and I have all my video library are like videos that I've ripped from  Blu ray and DVD myself, stuff I've downloaded from the internet archive, stuff like that.  Now I'm at the point of obsession where it's like, wow, there's no subtitle. There's a, this,  this Ed Wood movie doesn't have a subtitle like file incorporated into it. Or I downloaded this  like TV movie from like 1974 and it's good, but whoever like put it on the internet archive  decided to stuff like the title box and the metadata with, Hey, get more videos from Wacky  Lose public domain videos.com. And every time you launch it, like it starts by telling the title.  So this is, this is, this is a free app called subler that allow it's a, it's a Muxer and a,  and a, and a, and an editor that will just simply show you all the metadata and all the  metaphiles that are associated with this video file and let you edit them. So I can go in and  change all those titles to what the title should be. So I don't see this little weird ad pop up.  I can embed like a, if even it has a subtitle file, I can download a better subtitle file from a  different source, add that in. I can put in like the poster art. So it's embedded into the actual  thing. And when I, when it's all done, it just simply writes it out. It muxes it into a brand  new file. It doesn't like recompile or re re stuff it or anything like that. And it's free and it's  still being updated. It's a, and it's really, really simple. It was exactly what I was hoping  to find that it's a sort of thing where you find a problem. You're like, I bet there's a really,  really simple tool that's making this a lot easier than I'm doing it right now. And there is, it's

Transcript:  of the week. I'm just going to show off a fun toy. Okay. I like to do this. So this is, this is a  recommended thing if you're into this, but hopefully we'll get people kind of addicted to thinking  about it. At least there are less expensive versions of this. But this is what we call it.  A dead cat. Oh, it's in a dead cat. So it's in a, it's, it's not, it's not really a cat. Just in  case you're wondering, the cats are okay. No cat was harmed. This is, it's an otter everybody.  This outer, this outer part of this is, is there to keep wind from, from hitting the mic. So that's,  that's the big thing. Inside of the dead cat, there is a, a blimp. Oh, this is a blimp within a cat.  A blimp within a cat. So this protects the, the mic from the cat. All right. So then, so then  anyway, so then you have a blimp and sometimes you just use the blimp and then you put the cat on if  it's windy and you can kind of, and then this has a little compartment that pops out. Let's see if I  get this right here. What does the blimp do if the cat's stopping the wind? A lot of times you don't  need the cat. You just need the blimp. You just need to protect it from a little bit. Blimp's a little bit of  protection. And then if it's really protection and then it also protects the mic from anything. If it's Hurricane  Hillary, you need the dead cat and the blimp. And you would need something around the, because you can't  just put the, the cat around the mic because then it's, you know, there's no structure to it. So  you take this apart. This is a little structure in here. It's like a little blimp. And then this guy  is, there's the mic. So this is the mic here. And usually, I don't know why she's followed us. Why?  And then we take off the wind screen, which you showed us this mic before. I think this looks  familiar. I think so. Did I already do this? That's all right. So I like the blimp of the dead cat.  Yeah. So the blimp of the dead cat. So this is the ambisonic mic that maybe I thought I  didn't think, I'm really getting into this. So this is why I'm, now this is a, this is the  ambio, which is the one that I listed. There is, this is what we call a first order microphone.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Almost every possible direction. Now the one that I didn't list there is this is, then when you want  to go to second order, you end up with a mic like this, which I didn't list there, which is a,  this is a core and this is eight, eight of those mics. So this is a second order.

Transcript:  Is this for 360 video? I mean, what would you want this for?

Start time: 8027.60
End time: 8149.56
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, we're doing it not for 360 video. And we, yes, you do a lot of VR stuff with it.  But what, what we're playing with it is using it to add ambient to our show coverage. So,  so, you know, YouTube now, as of last week will, it's now public. I mean, we've been testing it for  about a year, but YouTube will now do 5.1 to over the top boxes. And so, so if you have an Apple TV,  you can have, YouTube will do 5.1. And what's really cool about that, you know, you think about  again, ambisonic as a, as a surround sound, but what we've learned, figured out how to do is take  that ambisonic, it's four channels for the, for the ambio. And we pipe that in along with our  microphones into a live view. We send that to our San Rafael location. And then we take that,  those four channels of the ambisonic out and convert it to 5.1. And then we take the mics  and we put them right down the center channel. And then we put the ambisonic into the rest of  the surrounds and everything else around you. And what you end up with is being able to hear,  you know, really have an immersive and you're going to start seeing us do this more. I think  more people are going to start doing it as well, because that's a really easy way to,  when I say really easy, I mean, relatively easy way to package up an immersive area is to use  this. And I think that I'm really excited that YouTube is finally supporting 5.1 publicly and  everybody can use it now. It's still, still just for over the, over the set top boxes. So it's your,  your Chromecasts, your Apple TVs, that type of thing. But what we found is that the way we're  doing it, the technique that we're using means that you can really clearly hear people talking,  but you also feel a lot more like you're there. A lot of times what we're fighting is you, you  can't use that mic by itself. You can't hear really figure out what's going on. But with the two mics,  the two like SM58s on electrodes, you're getting this nice center channel, but then you really  feel much more like you're there. And we used to always just have the SM58s with the electronics  and just go back to us, but you lose the feeling of being there. It's hermetic. So that's what like,

Start time: 8149.74
End time: 8153.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  like this show, it's very hermetic. You don't hear any backgrounds. Yeah. So, yeah. So, so,

Start time: 8153.92
End time: 8170.84
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  so especially in here, I don't know how much it matters because we'd be in a room talking to  each other. But I think that when you think about going to a conference, you want to feel that  conference or feel that event. Yeah. Yeah. And so, so this is what we're kind of playing with right  now. And so I, I think maybe when I started it, I probably talked about the AMBO and then you mix

Start time: 8171.02
End time: 8175.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a little bit, you're not going to mix it. You're going to just make a little low level, mix it in.

Start time: 8175.46
End time: 8187.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That's the cool thing. The cool thing is, is because we're having two entirely separate  systems, we can bring the ambient up and down based on what we want to do. So we can make,  have you feel it and then we can push it back. We're here at SIGGRAPH and then it gets a little

Start time: 8187.70
End time: 8192.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  quieter. Yeah. That's interesting. Exactly. Yeah. So it's very cool. And what do you use to mix 5-1

Start time: 8193.02
End time: 8267.26
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  sound? We're using Pro Tools. So, so it's, there's a, there's a couple different, there are, you know,  we have to do an ambisonic conversion from the, you know, from the, the, the four channels of the  AMBO. And there's a couple different tools to do that. And, you know, one of them's Dear VR. We,  we use a couple different ones to kind of play with it. And so, so you have to convert that. So  we're running that through Pro Tools to do that live conversion. We are looking at some other,  you know, some other tools down the road as we kind of keep going forward, but that's been the  easiest one. And so we pass it through a little Mac mini with, it's not, Pro Tools isn't doing  anything else. It's just the holder of the plugin and the pass, you know, that we pass, pass through  it. So there's not a lot of work that we're making, that we're forcing down Pro Tools section. And  then there, and then it goes, again, it goes through there. The cool thing is, is that a lot of times  audio is going faster than video. So this just slows the audio down a little bit. And we have  to actually delay the video because as it goes through that process, we, I think we lose,  it's like 400 milliseconds. So almost a half a second as it processes. But we, so then that  goes into a, an FSHTR, a little more expensive. So anyway, so it's, and that, that's what, that's  what embeds that and delays the video so that we can line it back up again. And, and this is open

Transcript:  Or does it matter? I don't, I have to admit that I've been in an Apple TV world for so long.  Yeah. Really hard. I don't really, it's just an area I decided not to specialize in is trying to  figure out what's, I bought all of them. You all have to specialize in something. I was like, I was  like, I had Roku at one time I had Roku and Chromecasts and, and Amazon and all these things.  And I just found that I just didn't like using any of the other ones. And so I just ended up  with Apple TV, you know, and that, so the newer ones could be really good. I just stopped playing

And we've been talking  about showing it for a while. And this is a really great film. This is a filmmakers camera,  really right? Movie. Well, yeah, it does all kinds of, it just, it's basically like having a,  a little techno crane that you can do techno crane style shots with. And, but I think that the  interesting thing about the conversation with my brother is that you'll also just see a bunch of  how filmmaking gets done in the conversation. As, as our members ask him questions, he's  just talking about stuff and, and, and, you know, and just kind of working through it. You get this  kind of flavor for what it's like, cause he works, he's an a camera on, you know, a large streaming  companies shows. So, so he's, so he's really moved up. I mean, since,  yeah, I don't know when the last time you saw that. Yeah, I didn't realize that. That's awesome.  Good for him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

Transcript:  branched out and done some really good stuff. Yeah. That's a great, that would be a great  starter if somebody is like, well, I don't know about Star Trek. It's like strange new worlds.  It's, it's really a good accessible show for anybody, even if you haven't seen Star Trek.  And it really does kind of capture that, like a modern take on what the vibe of the original  Star Trek was where it's sort of episode to episode. It's not like a, a prestige drama where  every episode rolls into every other episode is, you know, the, this is the episode where this  happens and this is the episode where that happens and the characters grow and change over  time in a modern TV way. But the, the, the stories are pretty self-contained and a lot of fun.

Transcript:  Yeah. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Alex. Thank you for joining us. We do Mac  break weekly on Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern. Even if there's no news, we find a way  to stretch it out, fill out your, your requisite two hours and 22 minutes of content. Leave it  to the professionals. Okay. Don't try this yourself. I love it that we started with washing  your watch. I think that's just, that just to me, that's, that's smells like victory.  11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern. We don't bury the leader up here. No, no. Top story. Number one,  1800 UTC. You can watch the live stream, which goes 24 seven.  You know, some of its reruns, obviously that's at live dot twit.tv. If you're watching live chat,  live in our IRC open to all, you can even use your browser to access the IRC dot twit.tv. There's  also a discord, of course, for our club members. After the fact on demand versions of the show at  twit.tv slash MBB W there's a dedicated YouTube channel. You can subscribe in your favorite podcast  player. In fact, that's the probably the best way that way you get it automatically. You don't have  to think about it. Audio or video. You get it. You can get either one. And I should mention this from  time to time. I forget we have a, the new logo art that just was done by the wonderful, talented  Anthony is in the store twit.tv slash store. Anthony Nielsen's blog. I don't know what we would  call that the blob, but I it's really nice. I was wearing it the other day, plus mugs, all that stuff.  We don't make any money on this. This is just so that, you know, you can show your, show your love.  They call it the Anthony calls it the color swirl. I like it though. I think we got those printed up  for the podcast movement so that Lisa and company could wear that in Denver this week. Twit.tv slash  store. We pretty much saw them for cost. Thank you for joining us now. It is my unfortunate  and unhappy duty to tell you to get back to work because break time is over. Bye bye.
