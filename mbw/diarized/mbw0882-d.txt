It was really, it was really the, the, the, the kind of  the, the bow on Steve Jobs return, wasn't it? This was the product that he came back to Apple to make

Start time: 249.66
End time: 352.88
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  in some ways. Yeah, it was the, I think the pivot point in Apple's survival. Obviously lots of steps  after that. But if you think about it, Jobs was really only officially back for a very short time,  officially for like less than a year when they called that event. And think about how little  time there was to put that whole thing together. Johnny Ive design, obviously Johnny Ive design,  he had been experimenting, right? Like the, the beige G3 had a little tiny plastic translucent  button on it. So he was trying out, there was the like all in one molar Mac that had some translucent  plastic, but he's there. Jobs gets there. He looks at the projects that they're working on. They have  this project called Columbus, which is originally going to be like a net computer. It was like a  Larry Ellison. The future is discless computers that are on a network. And they were working on  that with the Columbus project. And I think Jobs came in and basically like, look at Johnny Ive,  looked at the Columbus project. It was, I wrote a piece for The Verge this week about it went up  today. And I said, it's like, literally it's like that scene in the Princess Bride where Wesley is  like, what are our assets? And it's like, if we only had a wheelbarrow and a Holocaust cloak,  and literally it was like, we've got this discless worst station thing. We got Johnny Ive's plastic  and Steve Jobs is like, and I always wanted to make it all in one. That's what the Mac was supposed  to be. What can we do here? And the iMac in very short order was the result. And it changed  everything because it was successful enough to give them cash to stay alive, to make OS 10,  and then open Apple stores and ship the iPod and go on to all the success that they've had.

Transcript:  TG Andy?  AC I was just going to say that the influence of this machine could not be understated for  industrial design. I'm not just talking about like other PCs. You could walk into like a home  goods store and, oh, look, it's a waffle maker. And it's available with like three different  color translucent tops, one of which is Bondi blue, another one is tangerine. You could see  it pretty much everywhere. And that is the pinnacle of success for Johnny Ive or any other  industrial designer when even people who aren't competing with you, who are just simply industrial  designers are saying, that's a great look, let's use it ourselves.

Transcript:  We were happy because the Czech TV just started in May of that year. And we found, because at the  time Apple implied that this whole color is unique. And we really searched everywhere. We went to the  Bondi beach in beautiful Sydney, Australia and found this color. And we found like 20 different  appliances that all had translucent Bondi blue that predated the Apple. I mean, there was a

It like,  it drains the fat away. Whatever George Foreman. Knocks out the fat. Why do you think they hired  him for God's sake? Yeah, that's right. He's punching it, you know, knock out that fat.

Transcript:  And from just a, we have to remember that Apple was on fire when Steve Jobs, I mean, like we forget  that now. Not the good way. I'm sorry. The burned to the ground guy. Yeah. Like Steve Jobs had to get in and he had to find cash. He had to keep partners. He had to do all these things and do all these horse trades and all this crazy stuff that Apple doesn't do. And then the thought that they'd be able to come out with something creative was really amazing because usually when you're trying to fix something, you're just trying to make the things that you have work, you know, and for them to just go, we're going to, you know, it took someone like Steve Jobs to say, well, we're going to throw everything. We're going to basically throw everything else away.  And we're going to go into this one thing and make this one thing really work. I was, was a pretty, uh, gutsy move. Like there, there was a lot of ways that this didn't turn out. Um, you know, it was said that Apple was 150 million or maybe less away from literally going bankrupt. And that was that 150 million that that Microsoft, he got Bill Gates to show up and give them.

Start time: 520.58
End time: 632.70
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It was, yeah, I mean that, that was, there's so many little moves there and it wasn't just, I don't think it was necessarily that it was the check that Microsoft wrote so much as Bill Gates coming on and saying, oh, by the way, we are committed to supporting Microsoft Office on the Mac platform for the foreseeable future.  Whereas if he said, if he basically decided to say in an offhanded comment, but well placed with PR people, yeah, you know what? We're kind of scaling it back a little bit because we have more assets to go anywhere. He could have, I don't think he could have alone killed off the Mac, but that would have caused a further die that I don't think they would have pulled up from.  It was, it was just such a, it was such a beautiful play because the iMac was exactly what Apple needed at that moment. They didn't, they didn't need, they didn't necessarily need to say, oh, by the way, you know how like all of your data is on floppy disks? Yeah. You're going to have to buy one of those because we're not giving you one of those.  And you know that all your peripherals, you Mac people are on this thing we called Apple desktop bus. Yeah, you're gonna have to buy all new ones of those because we're doing a USB. It was, but basically the idea that they're saying here is something is absolutely brand new in a, in an environment in which their Apple's business strategy was let's make things more beige. Let's make things more like the way the PCs work. Let's literally start licensing the Mac operating system so people could put Macs running on.  Boring bays, beige commodity square angled things. This was as much a statement piece as anything else that said that, look, if you have, if you thought that we were just going to be making incremental moves, it's like we are either going to, we are either going to like pull up from this dive and go from aerospace into space flight, or we are going to be riding this missile, waving, waving our cowboy hat and cheering all the way into the ground.

Transcript:  Steve jobs, famously not a particularly sentimental guy, right? And you see it here in a, I mean, this I Mac is like a transgressive computer, like, like you said, Andy, ADB, Mac, cereal, scuzzy, gone floppy disk, which literally every computer in the world had a floppy disk. How else would you boot in an emergency or install software? And they're like, no, we'll just put a CD-ROM in there. No writeable storage at all.  Built built into it. And most wild, they picked up this technology that while it was hanging around and the PC world was like, maybe this is the future, maybe, but it's certainly not the present. And they're like, we're just going to put that on there. And that's going to be how you connect all peripherals. And that, folks, was the universal cereal bus. Your computer still has one today. You might need an adapter if it's USB-C, but like you could literally, literally take that stupid round hockey puck mouse that came out of the computer.  And then you could plug it in and it would work today. And that was, but that was a huge bet because USB was not a thing until Apple made it a thing. And then they wrote it for a long time.

Transcript:  Yeah, I was just laughing at the word work. It was, it was one of the, it's both really, really cool. It matched the iMac, but also in a company that's famous for bad mouses, that was probably the worst mouse of all time.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I had, so James Thompson again, who worked on the Columbus project, which became the iMac. One of the things that he told me on the podcast I did about old Macs in 2020, he said that before every OS X meeting as they were developing OS X and those were all done on iMacs.  Before Steve came into the room, somebody would take the mouse and rotate it so that the first time Steve engaged with it, the cursor would go in the wrong direction.  So they could make the case that that mouse was terrible, which it was. And I mean, I was there in 2000, right? Where they had in New York Macworld Expo, where they said, you got one under your chairs. We're sorry, this mouse is actually good now. And that was, it was a long year.  It was like two years where that bad mouse was there.  For those who aren't familiar, it was

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It was, well, not only that, but, and Jason's about to show us, it was just perfectly circular so that we're asked any other mouse before or since.  It has an orientation that your hand just normally finds. With that one, you grab it and then your mouse is going in absolutely the wrong direction because it's not facing the way you think it is. You have to look down.  That was bad.

Transcript:  Yeah, not good.  They used to actually sell like little docks that you could snap onto it just to give it like a lower half. So it would change it from a disc into like a beetle shape. That's how big a failure this thing was.

Start time: 817.26
End time: 928.52
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a stinker. But the USB thing, I mean, like, I think that is Apple at its best, which is you take a technology that is, you're not the first to adopt it, but like, it feels like now is a good time.  And again, Jobs, one of his great abilities, I think, was just to not be sentimental in him to say, I don't care about breaking compatibility.  This thing is going to be so compelling.  People will buy USB devices to work with it.  There will be adapters, whatever.  And USB, like USB probably would have happened, but it would have been really slow and begrudging on the PC side.  And once Apple made this cool computer with USB, basically the world embraced USB.  And 25 years later, it's still how we connect all our peripherals.  I know all through all these iterations.  I think it's a huge thing.  The fact that they got rid of SCSI and they said, no, it's all going to go through USB.  And the fact that, you know, the world, there were zip drives and jazz drives and stuff.  And basically what they said is, look, writable storage is not necessary for most people.  And you know why?  Because this thing's got built in networking and a built in modem.  And most of your file transfers, if buy a floppy USB floppy drive if you want, but most of the file transfer stuff, you're going to be doing electronically on a network or via a modem.  And they were right, more or less.  Although I will say at working at Macworld back then, when they made this announcement, it was hilarious to see every company, every accessory company in the world announced not just translucent plastic, but also announced these USB devices.  And none of them were ready.  Like they announced there were there were hundreds of brand new USB peripherals, all of which had a little asterisk next to them.  That was this fall because everybody was like caught flat footed by the idea that USB was suddenly going to be a thing.  But the iMac was enough to push them all into making USB products.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So many great stories around this first iMac.  I'm looking at Walter Isaacson's book about Steve Jobs, which has a chapter devoted to the iMac.  He says, I've and his top Johnny I've obviously, and his top deputy Danny Costner began to sketch out futuristic designs.  Jobs bruskily rejected the dozen foam models they initially produced, but I've knew how to guide him gently.  I've agreed that none of them was quite right.  But he pointed out one that had promise.  It was curved, playful looking and did not seem like an unmovable slab mounted to the table.  It has a sense.  It's just arrived on your desktop or it's just about to hop off and go somewhere, he told Jobs.  But Jobs, who was with his binary view of the world, loved it.  In fact, he took the foam prototype and carrying it around the headquarters with him, showing it in confidence to trusted lieutenants and board members.  Remember that there was no handle on the original one.  He insisted on a handle, even though, let's be real, nobody was going to carry that 40 pound machine around by the handle.

Start time: 1002.25
End time: 1005.58
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  That was kind of a sentimental thing, don't you think?  Because it echoes back to the original Mac.

Start time: 1005.92
End time: 1017.64
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was lugable.  I mean, I think Jobs was thinking because they all remember then they added the handles to the power Macs, too.  I think there was the idea like in a school or some environment like that, the teacher might pull it off the cart and drop it somewhere.  And you want to be able to grab it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's Johnny's explanation.  Back then, people weren't comfortable with technology.  If you're scared of something, then you won't touch it.  I could see my mom being very scared to touch it.  So I thought, if there's this handle on it, it makes a relationship possible.  It's approachable. It's intuitive.  It gives you permission to touch.  It gives it gives a sense of deference to you.  Unfortunately, manufacturing a recessed handle costs a lot of money.  And in fact, they spent the money because Johnny was convincing us as he always was.  There's also the problem of the CD-ROM.  Steve wanted a slot.  And now, I don't know if it's apocryphal, but it was part of the movie Jobs.  At the introduction of the iMac, he says, what's this?  Well, Steve, we couldn't source the slot, so it's got a drawer.  And according to the movie, he almost walked away.  Is it a true story?  He said, I will not release this with a drawer.  And it had to be talked down, I think, by his assistant.  So he essentially said, next year, it'll have a slot.

Start time: 1091.93
End time: 1196.38
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  They couldn't source the slot load drives for it.  And they were already on the razor's edge.  My understanding, too, is that Motorola wanted a lot of money for the G3  that was going to kill the project because it was going to be way too expensive.  And they sent a team to Sweet Talk Motorola into a deal that Motorola should never have agreed to,  where they gave them the G3.  My understanding is that Greg Joswiak, who's still around and is their head of communications,  was one of the people there who basically talked Motorola in.  They're like, oh, but it's a consumer.  We're going to ship them in volume and you can get them.  And they were like, no, no, it's going to cost this.  And I believe the story is they got them to base it on the price of the model instead of  base price of the chip.  And then it was a cheaper computer.  And so they they got to buy those chips for less.  And the G3 was a big part of it because the G3 was it was at a moment where the G3 was ahead  of Intel in terms of pure processing power.  And so putting that in a consumer computer allowed them to sort of say, look, you're not giving up  anything in order to use a Mac.  And then the other key moment that Jeff Goldblum commercial that's so great, there's no step three.  This is the moment where the Internet and online services were really taking off to the point  where people wanted instead of it being like in the early days of PCs, it was like, well, I needed  it for my work. I'm going to have the same computer as my work or something like that.  And this era, it was like Internet appliance.  You know, what is this Internet?  What is AOL?  And it didn't matter if you were using a Mac because it was just email and the Web or AOL.  And that was huge for Apple because so many markets were just like it was Windows or nothing.  But the Mac could be a good Internet appliance.  And by having that modem built in and the Ethernet built in, they sort of like made it a lot easier  to choose a Mac instead of a Windows PC in 98.

Transcript:  Thank you. Next.  Next.  So the name is interesting, too.  This again from Walter Isaacson.  Jobs asked Lee Clow and Ken Seagal, who were at Chaiate Day, the ad team,  to fly up and see what they had in the works.  He brought them into the guarded design studio, dramatically unveiled  Ive's translucent tiered shaped design, which looked like something from the Jetsons.  For a moment, Clow and Seagal were taking a back.  We were pretty shocked, but we couldn't be frank, Seagal recalled.  We were really thinking, Jesus, do they know what they're doing?  It was so radical.  Jobs asked them to suggest names. Seagal came back with five options.  He doesn't list the five I wish he did.  One of them, IMAQ.  Jobs didn't like any of them at first, of course.  So Seagal came up with another list a week later, but they said the agency still preferred IMAQ.  Jobs replied, I don't hate it this week, but I still don't like it.  He tried.  He tried silk screening it on some of the prototypes,  and the name grew on him, and thus it became the IMAQ.

Start time: 1296.68
End time: 1321.98
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It's not bad.  I was thinking about OS X.  If you remember the early, the first interface for OS X was called Aqua,  and its whole design was sort of this Aqua color  and then these like vertical lines sort of like ribbing.  And if you think about it, it's literally it's the design of the hardware of the IMAQ.  They designed their entire operating system to look like a computer.  That's how important the IMAQ was.

Start time: 1322.08
End time: 1346.96
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Not only that, but remember the early.  I don't think this didn't make it to release,  but one of the earliest like public released versions of it,  I mean, the early access versions, they had moved the Apple,  the Apple menu to the center of the menu bar, just like it was on the IMAQ.  Now that they lost that battle pretty quickly.  But oh, my goodness, you're absolutely right that that's how big the mentality was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I mean, there's and what's amazing is that those we still  there's still a handful of web websites that still have those little gel buttons,

Start time: 1355.98
End time: 1464.88
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  you know, like it's just because it became the thing like everybody knew how to build.  Like we I built tutorials on how to build the gel button on Photoshop.  You know, there was like a series of of things to do with that.  And it was but those gel buttons became the thing.  You know, everything had to be gel for a couple of years.  So it was. But again, it was just not.  And there's so many things that came together, you know, because like the G3,  the reason it was so much more powerful,  they had a really large L2 cache, so it was actually faster than the G4.  So it was just by, you know, and it was because those teams were working independently.  And I was talking to someone at Motorola at the time, and they were like, well,  the G3 folks keep on doing this presentation.  And said, well, this is right after it happened.  They were doing presentations that said, well, we're putting this L2,  this larger L2 cache, and we think it'll improve performance.  And the G4 folks weren't really paying attention.  And then suddenly the G3 was faster than the G4.  And that's part of what created this huge heart attack at Apple,  because the G3 was supposed to be the low cost version and the thing that they  were giving out to everyone.  And the G4s would be the pro line, but the G3s were faster than the G4s.  And that really caused it.  And they had to plow under when Steve Jobs got there,  they had to plow under all of those power PC boxes to make sure that they didn't get,  you know, they didn't go anywhere.  But you know, I think that what it really also did is it's the pivot where Apple  stopped trying to be like Microsoft.  Like Steve Jobs, the Bondi Blue was Apple saying, we're not going to be trying,  we're going to take advantage of what we do well, which is an integrated solution.  It just works.  You know, it's tight, tightly wound, and we're not going to try to build 20  versions of it. And I think that any, I think in general, it's a good safety.  Like never try to copy Microsoft.  They have a model that works and trying to go after that model is not,  and Apple has proven that they have a model that works as well, but it's a  really hard model to,

Start time: 1465.92
End time: 1550.61
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  that's when they really started to embrace probably by necessity,  the idea of abandoning market share and favoring revenue per customer.  Because I think they, at that point, somebody must've had that revelation that,  look, we are never going to be as competitive in terms of market share as  anything that Microsoft makes. It's just not going to happen.  But we have noticed that there are people that are,  despite the fact that we've been failing our own customers for the past five,  six, seven years with a,  an operating system that doesn't multitask that crashes and takes down the  entire platform, boring boxes that are underpowered compared with Windows  machines, where even our faithful, even, even, uh, commentators that have been  very, very loyal and faithful and cheerleaders for us are saying it's time to,  for me to switch to Windows because Mac just ain't it anymore.  I'm sorry. They got off track. They,  we know that we have people who are faithful to us who will reward us.  If we, if we start making machines that cater to them,  as opposed to the entirety of the market,  then that's going to turn things around for us.  And that's what's paid off for them handsomely.  They don't, they don't have the number one phone operating system in the world,  not by any close stretch.  They don't have the largest desktop operating system in the world,  not by any close stretch,  but there's one company that's worth nearly $3 trillion and there's one other  companies that have to have a shifty explanations to their shareholders every  quarter.

Transcript:  You're right about, uh,  Windows users Microsoft didn't get it at all in their long tradition of not  understanding where the market was going. Uh,  this is also from the Isaacson book.  Bill Gates assured a gathering of financial analysts visiting Microsoft.  The iMac would be a passing fad.  The one thing Apple's providing now is leadership and colors, he said,  as he pointed out a Windows PC that he had jokingly painted red.  It won't take long for us to catch up with that. I don't think.  Jobs was furious and he told a reporter that Gates,  the man he had publicly decried for being completely devoid of taste was  clueless about what made the iMac so much more appealing.  The thing that competitors are missing says jobs is that they're thinking,  they think it's about fashion and they think it's about surface appearance.  They say, we'll slap a little color on this piece of junk computer and we'll have  one too.  Yeah, obviously not. Yeah.

Transcript:  I mean,  it was great that the only disadvantages of the iMac were simply that it was too  forward thinking. And again, I can't, this is,  this is why like I kind of have a semi allergic reaction when Apple does  something that really inconveniences everybody and they say, Oh no, that's it.  There's, you know, they're getting ahead of the ball.  They're skating to where the puck's going to be in five years.  Every computer is going to be like this. And other people like me are saying that,  yeah, but today this is a major pain in the butt and it's a major pain point.  But it was again, looking back in history,  it seems as though consciously or subconsciously with all these,  all these changes they made, despite the inconvenience to people,  what they were saying to themselves is that we are going to put everything into  this iMac that represents future technologies,  where the future is going to be where you don't need a floppy drive.  The future is going to be where you need to have built in networking.  The future is going to be where you have USB to connect all devices,  not separate connectors for everything.  It's almost they're telling themselves that the future in the future,  the Mac will continue to exist so that it's okay for us to build a machine that  anticipates that in three, four or five years,  there will still be an Apple to give you a software and updates for this device.

Transcript:  There were mistakes made. Jobs was really adamant on the slot.  CD Raman got it and subsequent IMAX,  John Rubenstein tried to argue him out of it saying new drives are going to come  along that'll let you burn CDs. Our customers are going to want that.  And they're going to come out as slot, not as slot, but as a tray CD roms.  First, he was right. When Sony released those burners,  they were in tray form or actually was Panasonic. I remember that.  And as a result, the iMac was a little behind on CD burners.  Although Isaacson in his book says it forced Apple to be imaginative  and helped jobs get into the music market with iTunes.  So maybe it was a blessing in disguise.  First time I came out on this day in 1998 for 1299 base price,  which in real and modern US dollars in modern dollars is actually not inexpensive.  1299 is probably almost 3000 today.  He sold 278,000 units in the first six weeks,  800,000 by the end of the year,  making it the fastest selling computer in Apple history.  It is no longer the number one computer though at Apple. In fact,  I just saw a stat that said the,  but the mini and the iMac combined desktop computing is only 2% of a Mac  sales that laptops really are the dominant form factor.  But for its time, the iMac was pretty something.  Yeah. Pretty amazing. Have you,

But the problem was that it was coming in an era where they went 15 and then  17 and then, and then they're like, Oh,  we need bigger screens and the whole like arm thing.  They had a lot of trouble with that arm.  It was not going to work. It was not going to work on larger screens.  They needed to be bigger screen.

Transcript:  Well, the funny thing is, is that Apple, you know,  Apple was one of the patent holders on that, on that, um,  that build and what Apple did about, uh, they let it,  they let the hook sink in for a couple of years and then they applied for,  they, they, then they wanted to get royalties and they asked for the,  they, they demanded royalties for the, for firewire.  And what it did is that all the PC manufacturers pulled firewire from their  thing because it was, even though it was only a $2 cost,  by the time it went from the manufacturing to retail,  it would increase the cost of a PC by $50. And so, um, you know, as,  as it rolled up and you keep doubling up on, on the way through. And, um,  and so, uh, so what happened was all the PC manufacturers pulled firewire from  their chassis,  which meant that the only way to get video from your video camera was on a Mac.  And then so it's part of what pushed and,  and Apple had no intention of making any money on that royalty.  They weren't being greedy.  They literally just wanted the PC manufacturers to pull firewire from the  chassis. And so they, you know, it was a trap. So, so they could,  so they could corner that, that DV market. And it was a really, um,  it was a kind of a, an amazing marketing thing from a little company,  you know, that at the time there was, you know,  we got to remember that Apple was a very small company in 2002 and 2003, um,  compared to where they are now. It's, it's,  it would be obvious now to do whatever they're going to do.  I don't think they just kind of ignore everybody else now, but, but the,  at the time they had to play all this little jujitsu to, to figure out, you know,  how they were going to, to survive. And I think until the iPod came out,  I think that it was cool, but we, we weren't sure if it was going to make it,  you know, like I think, I think until the iPod took off,  I don't think that most of us knew. And I think Apple, I mean, again,  we've talked about this before,  but Apple's DNA is the DNA of the executives that are,  that were there when that happened, when all of that happened, it's deep,  you know, like how, how concerned they are about cashflow, you know,  it's deep. Those are deep scars.

It was the perfect Apple price, right? It's the price where you're like, Oh,  I want it. It costs what?  Just at the edge of affordability.  That hurts, but I can do it.  And that's the price that Apple likes is the price that hurts,  but you'll pay it. And that's what it was. And there were a bunch of people who  were like, well, yeah, but I can buy this PC for cheaper, but it's, it doesn't,  it's not this thing that seems so simple and is more appliance like.  And it was in many ways, I would say that computer for the rest of us thing,  like jobs had this vision of a computer as an appliance and the original Mac was  that, but like the iMac,  I think in a lot of ways was like the ultimate fulfillment of that original Mac  dream that jobs had, which is it's an appliance. You put it on a table.  It's super easy to use people.  There's no step three and that's what he wanted a computer to be.  And the iMac really did do that to a certain degree.

It's a, it's a much,  I don't know what the percentage of sales really is,  but what they said is it's a very large business for Apple, believe it or not.  IMAX. It's just not compared to the rest of the stuff they sell,  but it's a lot of money goes into IMAX.  You see them in all sorts of high profile places.  People buy them for a family there in hotel rooms, your hotel lobbies.  And you know, they're all over the place.  I think you can see in their priority level that there was no M2 iMAX,  that it's not important enough.  It was important enough for them to redesign it for the Apple silicon  generation, but not important enough for them to do an M2.  Possibly because the people who would buy that 24 inch M1 iMAX are not

I mean,  but again, all these like the M1 Air, I feel the same way about it.  They still sell the M1 MacBook Air and it's still great, right? Like it's still,  for so many use cases, does it really matter that it's an M1 and not an M2?  I don't think it does.

Like, you know, like I, if I'm going to buy one,  unless it's a brand new model and I'm at sit for a minute, but,  but generally I buy them, if I'm going to buy a laptop,  I'm going to buy it right after they announce it.  If I'm going to buy a desktop, big desktop or an iMac,  I'm usually going to buy it right after it was released.  The only one that's independent of that for me as a Mac mini,  I just buy them whenever I need them because they're like,  they're way more powerful than what I need. Like they, they, you know,  they, and I think the iMac for the people who use them are the same thing,  that they're just way more powerful than what the average person buying an iMac  needs. And so they can buy them anytime they want. And I think that's,  I think that even 800 days doesn't matter.

If you, if you, if you,  if they sold my Costco, it's cause it's cause it's not, it's,  it's as close as Apple comes to selling the sort of computer that an employee  or somebody gets issued as opposed to something that people choose. Uh,  and they get to, they get a very powerful M one based modern processor,  very nice looking in the color of their choice or at least the color of their,  their boss's choice. Uh, yeah.

Now we go to the future,  back to the future in just a bit with Jason Snell and the Anaco,  Alex Lindsay, our show today brought to you by delete me.  You need to know about this. This is a very modern private problem in the world,  which is if you've ever searched for your name,  you know that a lot of your personal information is exposed.  Your home address, your cell phone number, uh,  since 2010 and it's even more urgent now,  delete me has been on a mission to empower individuals and organizations by  letting them reclaim their privacy and help them remove personal data from  online sources. You know,  I was talking to Mike about this on a Sunday and asked the tech guys and he's,  he's been using this. Uh,  and we compared when I searched for my name and he searches for his name,  it's a very different experience. And,  and I don't recommend you search for your name if you're not using delete me,  cause it's kind of a, uh, it's kind of shocking.  The delete me team is driven by a passion for privacy.  We need it now more than ever in a commitment to making it simple for  customers to use. And of course I don't have to tell you,  but using delete me reduce risks from all sorts of, you know,  bad actors, identity theft, credit card fraud,  even something as, as minorly annoying as spam and robo calls. It's certainly,  if you're an executive in a company or even an employee to company,  having that company address in public opens you to cybersecurity threats,  phishing, spear phishing attacks, harassment.  Delete me is the most trusted privacy solution out there helping thousands of  customers remove their personal information online.  The average person has more than 2000 pieces of data online about them publicly  available and delete me can find and remove it.  You could probably do this yourself. How much time do you have?  There's sites you never even heard of that have this data that show up in those  searches. One customer said, quote,  I signed up and they took it from their awesome service already seeing results.  And that's the key is they know where to go.  Plus they will keep doing it. So here's how it works.  First you sign up, you give them some basic personal information, you know,  the stuff they're,  they're going to be looking for that will be removed from search engines.  Delete me's experts will find and remove your personal information.  They go to literally hundreds of data brokers to reduce your online footprint,  keeping you and your family safe. But this is the important thing.  Once the removal process starts,  you're going to get a delete me report with all the details of what they've been  doing within seven days. And it doesn't stop there.  They will continue to scan and remove your personal information every three  months. And with automated removal opt out monitoring,  they'll ensure records don't get repopulated after being removed.  Thank you GDPR. These companies, fortunately, you know, they hide it,  but they've got a way for you to remove this information and to opt out from  having it be included ever again. And delete me knows how to pull those levers,  knows where to go. I mean, I'm thinking, you probably have your name out there,  your address, your photos, your emails, your relatives, your phone numbers,  your social media, the value of your property and more.  And just think what a bad guy could do with that.  As the data broker industry evolves, delete me continues to add new sites.  There are so always new sites. Every day there's a new data broker,  new features to ensure their service is both simple to use and effective in  removing personally identifiable information. PII.  And since privacy exposures and incidents affect individuals differently,  Colorado, 4 million, 4 million, uh,  Colorado and this information was, you know, Colorado state, state just revealed,  Oh yeah, we were breached. That's why the delete me privacy advisors are so great.  They can ensure that all the customers have the support they need when they  need it. If you're a Colorado resident,  you might want to be checking this out right now. Protect yourself,  reclaim your privacy. Here's where you go. Join, delete me.com slash twit.  Okay.

You know, there's a big curve area that closes up.  And so you don't get to see, they get to set everything up,  but you don't get to see it,  but you don't have to go to some other building or some other room.  It's the same place you came in. So the theater opens in the back.  You can go right, go right in and flows in really nicely. Then it closes up.  And then when you come back out, it's all, it's all just magically there.

Like we need the ability to get a board out of a,  of a demo unit, take off a surface mounted,  I see replace it with something else while somebody stalls on one,  one floor above.  There must be amazing infrastructure hidden from the public or even from like  the press from there.

Like on the law,  on the lowest level,  you should keep an eye out for mole men cause you never know there might be a  mole man in a corner somewhere, a lava man might be in there. So, uh,  and, and some of those low down places have like doors  to stuff, right? And they're like, no, no, no, take the elevator, go up.  And it's like, there's doors to stuff.  And some of that is just like down below the Apple store.  There is a level where there's the bathroom and all of that,  but there's also stuff down there.  I would not be surprised if there is a,  an entire system of tubes connecting all of the underneath of Apple park.  Yeah.

We live in an era where there are active shooters and there are bombers and  there are things like that. Like, I'm sure that they've got many,  many layers of security beyond the, we don't want the public looking,  but like way beyond that.

Sure.  We got one for you. I'm glad that they still have the, okay,  if you are clearly enough of an Apple fan that you came to,  you came to the campus just to be on the campus and just to be at the Apple  store on one infinite loop, we will have special merch.  That is just for you because it's, you know,  there's something nice about having a,  having a really nice pen with the Apple logo on it that you know that at some  point somebody checked off and said, yes, this is,  this brand meets the quality and the assurance and the sophistication that our  customers deserve.

He does warn that the Apple watch they announced on September 12th will be  not much upgraded from the previous Apple watch.  And it's been that way for a couple of years. He says, hold on to 2024,  maybe 2025 for the Apple watch X,  which will celebrate the anniversary, I guess, of the Apple watch.  But that's not going to be for a while to watch X to celebrate the 10th  anniversary.

Start time: 3236.52
End time: 3247.28
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  cause I bought the cheapest one every year, not every year.  I didn't even mind every year because there's just like,  there's not that making that much of a difference. And when I bought the ultra,  I was like, okay, this is going to be like a three year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think at that price. Yeah.  There is a rumor I don't like that they may,  and this will probably be with the watch. Is it 10 or X? I'm going to say X.  With the watch X that they will possibly switch bands to a new  magnetic band because these bands, the ones we have take up a lot of,  I didn't know there's a lot of extra space and they can use that space for a  bigger battery or other things.

Transcript:  Or just to, or just to redesign. I mean the, it's,  it's a beautiful classic square pillow design,  but how many watch lines in 10 years are still going on the  same frame in the same case?  I bet that Apple's designers would be really excited to create something that's  new, particularly something that, uh, I don't know,  is slimmer or at least basically telegraphs that this is not the standard Apple  watch. I don't, I don't think it's a,  the only thing that I don't like about the Apple watch besides the fact that you  can't really use it if you have an Android phone is that you,  you put on your wrist and suddenly you're just another person who has an Apple  watch and that's fine. But it's like, oh,  if there are only like a different design,  if only they made the smaller case slightly different to just show a different  kind of design aesthetic, that would be really, really cool.  So there's some sort of a variance. So it's not just all like the same,  all a tribe of people that have the exact same sigil on their wrist.  So that would be, that would be really, really interesting.

Uh,  Gurman also says we have seen some, um,  processor, uh, reports from the M3, the M3 pro, the M3 max,  and the M3 ultra chips on developer logs. Um,  a lot of cores. I think we, we sort of talked about this last week,  but he's just kind of doubling down on this. The, uh, the max,  the ultra would be 32 CPUs, 24 performance,  and eight efficiency and as many as 80 GPUs.  Now it's just silly time. Now we're just silly talk.  I dare you to max this out. Alex, I dare you. That's what they're saying.

Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I mean, you know, the, the, the CPU is, I mean,  this core is make a big difference. I mean, AMD is,  I think getting close to a 96 core chip, you know, that's CPU.  And so, you know,  having a lot of that parallel processing does make a big difference. And,  and the big advantage that Apple has right now is that they're doing the GPU and  the CPU with the RAM.  So being able to have the memory accessible to those is still a big jump. Um,  you know,  one of the only companies that could compete with Apple with that kind of merged  CPU GPU is AMD, but they, you know, but they,  right now they haven't started packaging the RAM with it.

Sobriquet black hat and Defcon where this past week we talked a lot about various  hacks that were announced and I'm sure we'll do more to this afternoon with  Steve Gibson. There's one that affects Apple comes from Patrick Wardle of  objective C S E E. He's great security researcher.  He makes a program called block block that kind of does the same thing as  April Apple's own background task management tool.  It lets you know block block does and gives you a chance to block it when an app  is installing a background process at black hat Patrick revealed,  or I'm sorry at Defcon Patrick revealed that Apple's background task management  mechanism is trivially bypassed.  And he, and the reason he revealed this without warning Apple ahead of time was  he said he found this problem some months ago, told Apple about it.  They put out a patch, which he said was merely a bandaid and it's still  vulnerable. And so as a result, he says, I think everybody needs to know about

Start time: 3522.60
End time: 3526.16

Start time: 3527.84
End time: 3560.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, it's nothing I think that you need to worry about.  Your machine has to be rooted. So that means probably either somebody has asked  access to your machine and the root password or more likely some malware,  other malware is used now to get people into it. But that's a good point.  If you had malware that could root it back in touch,  you can now turn off that thing that says, Hey,  a background task has just been installed. Uh, presumably block block.  Doesn't have this vulnerability. So maybe, uh,  maybe you should get block block from wardle.  He's been offering that for some time. Yeah.

Start time: 3561.18
End time: 3587.72
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And the other big deal is that every time there's a problem like this,  it's not just the, uh, it's not just the effect that's being mentioned here.  It's because there is a bug. It's not, it's not behaving as it's supposed to.  There's a problem in underlying code that needs to be fixed.  And this is just one expression of what can be done to exploit that bug in the  code. And so Apple certainly wants to not just simply, well,  every time this bug happens, we're going to stop this bad thing from happening.  No, his complaint is that, no, you didn't fix the underlying bug.

Start time: 3588.48
End time: 3608.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And, and as he points out, you're really no worse off than you were before  Mac OS. What is, what is, when did they put this on Monterey or, um, you're,  you know, it's, it's only this,  this background notification tools is, is relatively recent. So it's not like,  you know, it's a massive hole, but if you were counting on it,  notifying you of something installing in the background, maybe it's not.

Start time: 3610.02
End time: 3620.19
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It's, it's purpose is to say the, Hey, by the way,  there's something running in the background.  You might not know about in this have the ability to simply, if you,  if a bad person could make that, that those, those alerts go away and that's,  that's no good.

Transcript:  No, it's not. Uh,  five new features coming to air pod pro two,  probably in the next few weeks, right? Because let's assume September 12th is,  uh, accurate. Apple will release a new version of iOS iOS 17  by the 22nd, 10 days later. At the same time,  there should probably be firmware updates for the air pods pro. They have been,  I think there have been a developer updates. Have, have you turned those on? Uh,  Jason, I know you're a fan of those.  Oh yeah, I have. I have. I've tried them out.  So we talked about people not using it last week.

Start time: 3658.80
End time: 3744.24
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Right. And I think what he said was like, some of them have issues, right?  Like I had the conversational awareness feature and I had to turn it off because  I'm giving verbal feedback to my dog on walks, like wait and go.  And it's like, Oh, Oh, Oh no, you're talking.  I'm going to make everything really quiet. And I'm like,  I'm just talking to my dog, man. And so I had to turn that feature off. But the,  you know, there are some other features in there that, that are really clever.  And I think Apple is, they did that survey, right?  They're trying to find out like how people are using them and how they can  tweak them to be different creating that.  What's really interesting is creating something in between noise canceling and  transparency.  That's this adaptive mode that is trying to sort of like make  judgments about not cutting you off completely from the world,  but suppressing kind of background noise stuff. So like the,  like if there's a car coming up behind you, you'd hear that,  but you wouldn't necessarily hear the hum of the freeway from a couple blocks  away, right? Like that, that it would try to balance all that stuff out.  I think that's really clever stuff. And, and, you know, pause,  you're going to be able to mute your phone audio by just clicking.  When you're on a call, you'll be able to squeeze to click.  And instead of it hanging up the call, it will just mute your audio.  And then you click again to unmute, like just smart stuff.  And it shows you what they're capable of doing reprogramming those things,  like whatever little tiny computer is in those AirPods.  They can update that firmware and add features like this. It's pretty cool.

Start time: 3758.54
End time: 3800.64
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I have experienced that. And it's weird.  Like I put my AirPods in to go take my dog for a walk and it takes the volume  that it's playing at and it lowers it. And I'm like, why is it getting quieter?  And then I go outside and it raises it up.  And I think this must be the personal volume thing. I may turn that feature off.  I, I know I I'm a big boy. I know how to adjust the volume on my headphones.  Maybe I can just do that myself, but I can see in some scenarios, you know,  I think the idea is it's like in a car where like if the car's going really fast  and it's really loud, it raises the volume.  And then when you're stopped at a stop sign,  it lowers the volume a little bit. Like I can see it having some value,  but for me, I felt like, I don't know, I'm enough of a control freak.  I can probably just set my own volume and get with it.

Start time: 3800.88
End time: 3839.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And actually one of the quote features is really kind of a  fix.  One of the problems people always tell me about with AirPods and I've had it too  is it's switching in the middle of a call from one device to the other.  If you like me have a lot of Apple devices, that's a pain in the butt.  Automatic switching will now see the quote,  the connection time between a user's Apple devices is significantly faster and  more reliable. Okay. Well, we'll see. Fix on that would be very nice.  Anyway, those new features should be coming.  And you don't have to do anything for a firmware update.  I think it just happens, right?

Transcript:  Speaking of AirPods, Apple has one on appeal,  in a patent case on Bluetooth pairing.  One e-way was the name of the company.  They held two patents for a system of quote,  generating a unique user code sent to a hair headphone to enable it to  pair with the other, with other devices. Of course, that's,  I think that's how Bluetooth works anyway. And, but,  the company had already lost in district court, appealed to federal circuit.  The federal circuit judge has now said,  ruled in Apple's favor saying, well, that doesn't even,  that doesn't pass the common sense, the common sense test.  The judge decided it was appropriate to look at the ordinary meaning of  pairing. And on that basis,  a unique user code is not the same as a unique device code.  The language of the report is quite amusing says nine to five Mac.  There's a legal term known as construction,  which describes the process of interpreting words used in a legal document.  In this case,  there was no argument between the parties about the literal definition of a  unique user code. It's construction,  but they did disagree about the effective meaning of the term. Oh my God,  just hope you never get sued in a patent case. That's all I can say. Anyway,  one e-way has lost a district court. Now,  does this mean they will appeal to the Supreme court? God, I hope not.  I don't know.  Federal court. Yeah. I should say not this one. Yeah.

I do know that there's like an immense preparing to hear a case before the  Supreme court costs an immense amount of time and not just,  it's not just the first level of the lawsuit.  You can basically have one office doing this.  If you're hearing a case in front of the Supreme court,  you have to get people on board that can advise you on how to try, how to,  how to pitch a Supreme court case and basically how to, it's, it's, it's,  it's entirely new level of work.  As it was explained to me that you don't do it just for the fun of it or just  because you have, it's the only appeal that's left.

So you to, to get into the Supreme court, it's just the,  as Andy said, you know,  you're talking about people who are charging thousand dollars an hour kind of  thing. Those are top people. Yeah. Like, and, and they,  cause they're the only ones they're the gatekeepers of getting,  writing these things in because they know how to phrase this stuff to get it in.  And so, and how to build the case. And so, you know, you're talking probably,  you know, minimum 50,000 probably,  and probably more like a half a million to get,  to get something all the way into, into the, in the Supreme court.

Transcript:  Well, here's the good news. According to the Supreme court office of the clerk,  it's only $300 to get on the, to pay the docket fee.  And you can do that with personal check. Sure. But,  but there,  you do have to submit your petition on six and eight by nine and a quarter inch  paper, not less than 60 pounds in weight.

Start time: 4122.54
End time: 4132.68
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I guess you'd have to go to the weight.  The weight's important because of the, the, the, the scanner. Yeah.  So the scan, the heavier, if you give it really thin paper,  it'll the scanner will jam. That's fine.

Transcript:  You can produce it electronically. However, you don't have to type it.  But in fact, petitions produced on a typewriter are no longer acceptable.  So there don't type it. Okay. Presumably, if you,  if you hire an attorney who is admitted to the Supreme court,  he'll know all that stuff or she will. And you,  you don't have to worry about all this stuff.

There Amazon Fresh and some Panera restaurants,  a handful of retailers at airports, some stadiums and concert venues.  Oh, I could just see Ticketmaster jumping on this one and a handful of Starbucks  locations.  Those are all Amazon hand scanning sensors.  In the future says the journal,  you may be doing it to verify your age at a bar to get into your company's  offices, a parking garage, a gym, a hospital, a doctor's office.  The idea is for Amazon to compete with Google and especially Apple writes the  journal in the realm of digital wallets. Now I use my Apple pay all the time.

Transcript:  The weird factor. Like it's, they're not taking your,  they're not keeping your palm print. You know, they're building a hash like,  like everything else, but it's still weird, you know, and it's still like,  and it's also like you're touching something that everybody's touching.  Like anybody who just came out of COVID.  Do you have to touch it or can you float your hand above it?

Start time: 4296.32
End time: 4307.26
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to actually touch it. She's floating her hand,  but maybe she hasn't actually done it yet.  I would bet you could hold it over there because it's a camera, right?  How accurate is that though? I mean,

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Well, I was, I, I, I shopped at one of the, uh, uh,  like completely staffless, uh,  convenience stores that Amazon had in New York city like last year.  And it is kind of creepy if like,  if you have any knowledge of technology, cause you know that if they can,  if they know how much stuff, what I, what I've picked up and what I've,  and what I'm going out with and they can charge me,  they are learning so much about me every inch of step,  I every inch of movement that I take through this store. And there is,  I think that Amazon is probably a more creepy company than Google.  They're not, they're not up there with, uh, with Facebook yet,  but they are gaining ground. And the idea of, uh, of, uh,  of the largest retail store in the world, getting more information about, oh,  well actually he was at this store, this other store,  this other brick and mortar store that we don't actually own or control. Hey,  he went to this venue, uh, and with where these other people were, that's,  I don't like that.

Start time: 4368.60
End time: 4463.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean we sold, we talked a lot about Apple pay and how much better it was than  getting a credit card out of your wallet like this much,  but everybody was so excited about it.  This is even even better than having to tap your phone or watch to the device.  You just, you basically just wave to get an Amazon says, uh,  that it's been used more than 3 million times without ever,  not even once confusing a person for someone else.  Although occasionally Amazon admits it does. They wouldn't know, would they?  How would they know? Uh,  they do say it occasionally fails to recognize somebody who has enrolled,  but that's better than misidentifying them.  And you might be surprised the next time you go to the store or the market or  the airport to see a big sign that says attention customers,  biometric information collected at this store.  And there's the Amazon one logo and that's,  that's the sign that they're using those. That is something important though.  Uh, it does not send the hand print information back to Amazon.  According to Amazon, it scans, it creates a hash based on that,  a unique number that is not reversible.  And that hash is then matched in their database.  So all they have is a hash that is not convertible back into a hand print.  They don't have your hand print in other words. Uh, and this works fine. That's a,  that's a good system doing it. Uh,  is it a threat to Apple pay? Maybe. I mean, I guess if I had the choice,  the Red Rocks used it in 2021.  Did you use it for umphries McGee when you visited them in Red Rocks? No.

Start time: 4465.14

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Feels like this is more of a threat to, I mean, it's like a loyalty program.  I don't feel like it's a threat to, to Apple pay or anything like that.  As much as it is, this is a more convenient question mark, uh,  loyalty program kind of thing, right?  Like I go to whole foods and I have to scan my phone app in order to get the  discount. I have to put in my phone number at Safeway to get the discount,  right? Like, so this would be more convenient than that.  I wouldn't have to open up that the whole foods app and scan it.  I could just put my hand down, but like, I don't know, I,  it feels to me like it is an additional thing and it's a gimmick,  but really what it's doing is it's about tying your identity so that once again,  they can sort of look at everything you've bought and learn something from what

Start time: 4511.34
End time: 4521.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you bought. So then that's key. That is,  that is something the Apple pay does not do. Right.  There is no link back to you when you use Apple pay. Right. Well,

Start time: 4521.60
End time: 4532.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean there's a rotating thing and all that, but they're,  they're not building a profile. That's why most of these loyalty programs exist.  Right. As they want to build a profile of, they want you to be loyal.  They do want that, but they also want to build a profile of everything you've

Start time: 4532.30
End time: 4546.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  bought. When I go to my local bagel shop, I always pay with my watch  and it says, Oh good, you got another five points.  And it knows how many points I have.  So there must be some unique identifier that they're doing.

Start time: 4546.70
End time: 4559.82
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Identifier based on your watch. Maybe so. Maybe so based on your Apple pay.  I was under the impression that the Apple pay data rotated.  And yeah, so was I a real thing. Yeah.  So as I render something there too.

Start time: 4561.54
End time: 4572.00
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Well, that doesn't, that doesn't mean that it's not also that that box isn't  also trying to get a ping off of the IMA on your, on your phone or trying to get  off your Bluetooth. There's still some points.

Start time: 4572.02
End time: 4583.13
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're using square. So it's square up.  So I now have 85 points, but in every single case,  I've used it with my Apple watch. So it shouldn't know that it's me,  but somehow it does.

Start time: 4585.24
End time: 4608.14
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  That's square. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't know exactly how that works,  but that's the idea is that there's a limited amount of data collection that  they can do versus what you can build with a loyalty program where, you know,  my wife and I use different credit cards and I use different credit cards and  whatever phone number that's why they use the same way knows because of our  phone number and they do that to give us, give us discounts.

Start time: 4608.62
End time: 4722.12
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Safeway knows that, I mean,  it connects it to your credit card and then it connects it to your,  your credit card's address. Then it connects it to everyone on your address.  And that connects it to, I mean, it's,  that's so deep is you know that, you know,  and then they're then they're buying and selling this with Facebook and  everybody else.  And that's all the third party data that people are going back and forth over  is the third with third party data is,  is packaging this all up so that people can build a better view of you.  So they can send you ads that are you already bought. So anyway, so, but,  so the, but yeah,  I find that again because I had to admit I do make like, it's funny that the,  the, when you start getting conscious to that,  and I probably shouldn't have this value judgment, but like,  I don't have a problem telling Amazon, I don't know why,  but I don't have a problem at Whole Foods of scanning my little thing,  no matter how hard it is, their scanner for the QR code is like, I don't know,  in Novato, it's like all over the place.  Do you get a big discount that way?  No, but I'll tell you what it is, is if I order anything online,  it keeps track of everything I bought. So I can find it easier. Like I don't,  like I, you save, I mean, for whatever reason, I never buy,  I somehow have a talent for not buying anything on sale.  Cause I go there and I do it and I think I'm going to get some,  save some money. And it's like, you save 69 cents. And so the,  but,  but the thing is, is that for some reason I don't have a problem with it with,  with Whole Foods,  maybe because I was going to Whole Foods before Amazon or whatever,  but Safeway I'm super like, I don't want to give them my number and I don't  want to be part of it. And then I'm so frustrated by the fact that they charge,  Safeway, everything is on sale and they charge,  they charge you a lot if you don't give them a number.  And so the, so Safeway marks everything way up. If you're not, you know,  they really make it painful cause they really want that data.  And that makes me so frustrated that my wife will go to Safeway and I won't,  like I will not shop at Safeway. And it's not because of the bat, you know,  a value judgment of the food. I literally, it's over the phone number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's some insight by the way,  from a professor Panda bear about how the bagel shop knows it's me.  When using Apple pay a unique card number is generated per Apple pay device.  If you continue using the same device, it's the same number, but,  and this is important. I want my bagel mill points,  but if you turn on advanced fraud protection,  the CVV changes when using the card number in your wallet.  And Jason, you said maybe you can regenerate them as well.

Start time: 4751.68
End time: 4760.64
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think, I think Apple card has some more shiftyness about it,  but if it's your regular credit card, you know,  you're adding your regular credit card.

Start time: 4760.78
End time: 4771.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So when I'm using Apple pay with square, it's not really Apple pay. It's my,  mass it's the Apple pay master card, probably. Right. Yeah.  So blame Goldman Sachs.

Start time: 4772.96
End time: 4808.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So there's some, I mean, the fact is, unless you're living at all cash lifestyle,  this is going to be, you're going to be able to be tracked to a certain degree.  And that's why, again, I think, you know,  I would be reluctant to give Amazon my handprint, but as Andy put it, like,  this is a hash, right? So it's probably okay. But you know,  is it worth the convenience? Obviously like Alex is so repelled by same way,  that I don't think Alex is going to be putting his hand forward, but I,  I don't know. I could see doing it if I felt that it was like a super big burden  to scan my whole foods app, but it's not. So I'm not.

Start time: 4809.90
End time: 4861.46
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  See that's, that's, and that's, that's how they always do it. It's always like,  Oh no, no, people have people, the option of doing something else. Just like,  if you don't want to have a radio transponder on the dashboard of your car so  that it's so that in a pinch, the government could track your cars,  every movement, that's fine.  We will keep one lane of the, of the toll booth open. Uh,  that's going to have a line that's,  that's just for tractor trailers and people who don't have that transponder.  If you, if you're okay with waiting 10 minutes to go through every single toll  booth, you're perfectly fine. And no, it's free. We all, we all have our  principles, but it's like, you know, it's like, it's freemium.  I'm lucky that there's a, there's a, there's a local,  there's a small local chain of grocery stores that not only do they not have  like a rewards program, but they don't even have self checkout.  And it's,  and the prices are only slightly higher than stop and shop.  And oftentimes they're lower than like the big chain stop and shop.

End time: 4893.66
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And so like the self checkout with celery is not fun. Like it's just like,  so I'm just like, if I, if I, if I,  as soon as I pick something up at whole foods that is not in a package,  which is like 80% of what I pick up, but the first one I pick up, I go, well,  I'm now going to stand in line.

Transcript:  Oh, it's a monitor I got to put up. It's a, it's the old,  it's a monitor I'm just using for reference and I just haven't gotten it put  up yet. So, so it's a,  I needed a little HDR monitor cause we're doing a lot of HDR streaming to  YouTube. And, and so I needed to have a monitor that I could look at,  that I kind of tuned for for that viewing. So it's, um,  Gosh, I can't believe you streaming in HDR. That's amazing.  In five one, in five one. So we do it. Yeah. So you can do it.  It's five one to, um, the TV. So if you have an over,  if you have an Apple TV or Chromecast or whatever, you'll get five dot one.  And if you, um, it'll fold down to binaural for headphones,  the one that doesn't, isn't,  it's kind of in the middle is the use of regular computer or whatever, but we,  we're doing like the coverage that we did last week at Seagraph. Uh,  we were shooting, um, log on a, you know, um, so we had,  we were shooting log and ambisonic. So we had a four mic ambisonic rig,  and we passed that back to over a live view.  We passed that back to D to our office and then we convert it to, uh,  HD HDR 10 and a five dot one. Wow.  And it it's pretty awesome. I have to say, like,  we were kind of experimenting with it.  Now we're probably going to standardize on it for event coverage because we can,  because we're using two mics that are just handheld and they're SM 58s,  we put those in the center and then we can make,  we can attenuate like we can go up and down on the,  on how much of the environment that you hear in the surround speakers.  And so you really feel more like you're there than what we've done in the past,  but we still have total control over the center center channel. So

And they're mostly me and me and Nick,  Justin who is a, he is the head of the,  the head of immersive at Drexel university of that department.  And so the two of us are wandering around talking to people,  just grabbing onto people going, Hey, what about this? And it's very, uh,  loose compared to some of our other stuff in the past. So it's, it's,  we had a lot of fun with it.

If there is interest,  say something in the chat or the discord, or you could even email me,  leo at leoville.com and say, yes, I'll be there because we want to make sure  there's enough people to not be embarrassed when we go.  Like, hey, I'm here. Hello.  So email me if you're going to be in Green Bay,  September 28th, I think it is.  Stacey's Book Club is coming up at the end of August.

We pay you in love and respect.  In love and respect. Yes, in love and respect.  No, I say that only so that, you know,  your seven dollars goes to keeping everybody else employed,  keeping the lights on, generating new shows.  Does not go into my pocket.

But also I have not so much with me,  but I definitely have friends who are savers of Apple boxes.  And the number one reason is if they want to sell it,  if they want to upgrade and sell a used Apple product.  The fact is, nothing more in the box.  Those computers like the box they came in.  If you've got the room for that, which I often don't. Right.

Transcript:  That's exactly it.  We want that customer information.  Great article in the next web about a little Irish company called Alchemy.  They were there were four people working at Alchemy.  They had two and a half million dollars in pre seed funding  and three years ago when they pitched Apple  on being the one and only company to resell,  you know, the iPhones that Apple takes back in trade.  And I guess they grew past those four employees  because they now have 60 warehouses around the world.  And when you bring an iPhone to Apple to trade in for a new phone,  Alchemy is the one that gets it.  They get all the trade in business.  It's a really great piece.  They talk about the software they use that will wipe.  I'm sure Apple helped on this.  Wipe everything from the device and reset it to factory settings quickly  and securely.  They'd also talk about how most 98 percent of the phones they get  can be refurbished and resold.  Two percent, they'll go to Daisy.  They say Apple. Yeah.  One point two million phones a year can go through Daisy's ma  and get recycled. Remember that video,  which is great, which means less in the landfill.  Yeah. And they sell.  This was the stat that I thought was interesting.  Fifteen thousand iPhone eights every day.  Every day, he's the guy who gave the interview to the next website  because Apple phones keep their value.  Hmm. Yeah.

Transcript:  So the only the only problem I still have with this is that I like that  Apple's making their hardware more secure and trying to reduce  the market for theft by making sure that if something is not  that something can only be wiped by the original owner.  However, I still think that there needs to be a simpler route for one person  to sell a phone or a Mac to another person and make sure that there's  no slip ups and making sure that that thing is hardware reset, wiped  and that the new owner can re register as a brand new machine.  There's that that's kind of a monopolistic attitude.  If it's like if Apple saying that the only way that you can buy  an Apple device secondhand or modern Apple device secondhand  and make sure that when you get it, you won't be able to just  you won't be just buy a bump, just be buying a pilot junk  that is perfectly functional, but still locked to the original owner  is to go through us or go through one of our licensed and approved resellers.  That's kind of obnoxious.

Transcript:  I think as long as as long as you can prove that it's as long as you can  absolutely prove that it can't be used for for theft, I think that that's fine.  But I as a user, I far prefer it to be hard to transfer than to have.  I like the fact that it's hard to buy the phone.  It's not that hard to transfer.  You just have to remember to do it.  Right. But the thing is, is that I think that I'm I'm totally fine  with it being ruthlessly hard so that as a user, I don't have to think about my  you know, there's no reason to steal someone's iPhone.  People still steal them.

Oftentimes it's a company that's getting rid of two dozen Mac minis  and maybe eight of them were processed properly.  But the other 12 are now will now become kind of e-waste, even though, again,  they're perfectly functional.  They they post, they do everything.  But because there isn't a simple even though I could possibly show Apple,  here's a purchase order.  Here's someone to contact.  And here is like a note.  The person who who sold this to me is also going to be contacting you.  I wish that there were some way under those circumstances  so that even if it is difficult, it's like, well, here's the process  you have to follow, but there is a process you can follow. Yeah.

The but you're right with corporate because of MDM.  I see this on Reddit all the time.  There's a couple of things that happen.  One is somebody buys a refurbished Mac mini and it's still under MDM.  And when he tries to install the operating system, it says, OK,  do you do you want to enroll it with the Ford MDM program?  And that's problem number one.  And I also see it's interesting.  There's so most of these stolen or lost iPhones end up in China.  And I see this on Reddit all the time, too.

Transcript:  I'm kind of with you, Alex.  I think a little barrier to theft, even though it doesn't deter all theft,  it certainly has shown a big deterrent effect.  Alchemy says that  Apple has since 2022 become the fastest growing brand  in the used and refurbished sectors worldwide.  They make up almost half of the secondhand phones, smartphone market in 2022.  And it's interesting.  One of the reasons Apple is willing to do that, because, of course, that's  that's not a sale they're making.  But one of the reasons they're willing to do that is because of services  that even if they don't get you buy in the phone,  they're going to get you with Apple services.

So it's also getting them into the ecosystem.  Yeah. And so they're eventually going to buy a new one.  But it may not be at the beginning.  But, you know, a lot of times you want to get, you know,  my kids have old old iPhones of mine, you know.  And so so I think that you don't want to necessarily spend that much money  on on their iPhones at the beginning because they'll break them.  So, yeah.

Transcript:  In if you had one of those iPhones that slowed down  as it got old, you may be in luck.  You may get as much as sixty five dollars  in a class action lawsuit in 2020.  Apple agreed to pay up to half a billion dollars to resolve that lawsuit.  However, two iPhone owners who objected to the settlement  were holding it up.  They said, well, I want more than sixty five bucks.  They finally lost their appeal in the ninth U.S.  Circuit Court of Appeals,  removing the final obstacle to paying people back.  So now Apple can start paying out the five hundred million dollars.  Unfortunately, the claims deadline was October 6th, 2020.  So it's too late to complain now.  Yeah, they did get three million claims, and that's how we get the sixty five.

My brother's girlfriend's cousin and his family were caught in their vehicle in Maui  when the wildfires suddenly erupted around them.  No cell service.  Apple SOS was the only way they could get contact with first responders.  Literally saved their lives.  They were in a bank at a strip mall.  And he actually posted a screenshot.

Start time: 6467.56
End time: 6562.92
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  So what's the story here, Andy?  This was this was funny.  So a lot of I was so I've been watching like a lot of the videos from people who are at Defcon.  And a lot of them were saying, hey, I keep getting these pop ups saying, hey,  do you use your Apple ID on this Apple TV?  And I don't know. And so it's Defcon.  So, you know, that someone's pulling trying to trying out something.  And so somebody on on Mastodon, like basically fessed up  saying that it was he was testing out for two reasons, he said in his in his in his little report,  he basically said that he wanted to make sure that people knew that if you want to turn off Bluetooth  and secure your phone, don't go don't go through control center, go to settings,  because if you go through control center, you're only kind of turning it off only if you go through settings  or if you put it into lockdown mode, you are actually turning off.  But he was also trying to basically  he was he was working out the weaknesses in Apple's Bluetooth protocols about how it  auto connects to random devices.  And there's no there's no indication that anyone was owned owned by this.  But again, it was funny that there was a lot for a long time that was like every third video or every third  comment. I said, I was just walking through and I got this alert.  And that is kind of it is like a common annoyance.  We talked a little bit about that earlier, that the auto connect to to a nearby device.  It's great when it is actually something that you wanted to happen and it's a device that you actually want to connect to.  It's annoying when you're on like Amtrak and your phone keeps your iPad keeps asking if you want to pair with nearby  AirPods. And I have to say, no, no, no, no, I don't have 40 pairs of ears.  It's I'm good. Thank you.

And it's stopped by the control.  Yeah.  He says, hoping by next DEFCON to have it working with a new iOS 17's name drop feature.  Oh, dear.  And maybe do something similar for Android as well.  He also says, just for what it's worth, maybe something to think about next year.  There are about 15 possible pop ups.  He used one was kind of not kind of anodyne, but you could also say transfer your phone number.  Or your OS is too old for this accessory.  Click to update or adjust your color balance.  It won't do anything if you if you click it, you're you're you're OK.  But wow. And I think anybody at DEFCON sees that, I hope.  Not going to not going to do anything about it.

I don't want to use Bluetooth and I don't want Bluetooth to connect me.  So I'm just going to go into control center, this really nice, easy little tab  and click, click on the thing, Mark Bluetooth.  I'm going to watch that like go out.  Then I'm going to think that, oh, wow, my Bluetooth is off.  And no, it's just turned off things that things that it hasn't turned off,  things that Apple can do and therefore hasn't turned off things  that could be exploited by know how by knowing how Apple does things.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. Apple changed the way the control center for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi work,  where they used to be turn off the radio and now they mean disconnect from all devices.  So if you're on Wi-Fi and you're like you just landed,  but you were on the airplane Wi-Fi and now you want to actually use the Internet.  If you tap the Wi-Fi and control center, it drops you off of the airplane Wi-Fi  and won't reconnect to a Wi-Fi device unless you do it manually for 24 hours.  And Bluetooth, I believe, is the same way where it will disconnect you  from existing Bluetooth devices.  But that doesn't mean that a Bluetooth low energy  pairing request or something will be ignored because the radio is still on.  And so it will still be available.  And you could still go to the Bluetooth menu and settings and pair a device  because it's not off. It's just disconnected.  And I think on one level, the control center stuff  actually works more like how people want.  But if you're somebody who wants complete control,  you need to know that the control center one is not doing what it used to do.  It doesn't turn the radios off. It's just disconnecting you from devices.

I don't want to make noise.  I'll slip. I'll see.  I'll flip this little switch that basically silences my phones.  No, it doesn't silence the phone.  It simply changes to a different mode in which you will still be  the jerk at the concert,  whose phone makes whose phone is giving you alerts because Apple doesn't want.  Apple doesn't want to screw up and not give you that alert  that you sent three days ago about don't don't don't be late for the concert.  Or whatever. Yeah.

Transcript:  It's it's kind of like remember, like the second season of of of of of  of kind of just I'm sorry, my my mind is blanking, but  the soccer show that I just mentioned 10 minutes ago, Ted Lasso.  Tell us. Thank you. I don't know why.  Just say it again. We'll edit out the mind part.  Thank you very much.  You know, like in the second season of Ted Lasso,  they did an entire episode of Just Coach Beard, like being out and kind of drunk  in London with no.  I love that when they do stuff like that.  I love exactly.  Here's a here's a background character that maybe we've been taught to think of as  just the person who is just the friend of the main character,  who just basically gives the main character things to bounce off of.  Marcy is Marcy is one of the nicest characters like in penis.  She does call Peppermint Patty, sir, but that's because she was introduced  as a summer camp, someone who was going to the same summer camp  as Peppermint Patty or Peppermint Patty was like the resident advisor or something.  And there was actually one one background story that's really, really cool.  She has sort of like an androgynous look,  certainly androgynous for like 1972 or whenever she was introduced.  And it was going to be like a two.  It was a two week story.  And the payoff of the there's going to be a joke at the end  where Peppermint Patty has been assuming that this camper is a girl.  But but he says, oh, no, I'm a boy.  I don't know why you thought that.  But then he liked the way that those two characters were bouncing off each other  that he thought would be nice to have like two two girls be friends together.  And she didn't want to ruin that by having a crass joke that would only go  that wouldn't go any further.  So, yes, I'm actually I'm looking forward to the premieres on Friday.  I'm setting my I've got a brand new VHS cassette.  I'm setting the recording speed to SP.  I'm looking forward to it so much.

Transcript:  I I have two picks of the week.  So we think we should take a break  and then we will do our picks of the week in just a bit.  Andy and I go Jason Snell, Alex Lindsay, our show today brought to you by my sheets.  Well, every other week, my sheets, because I got to get a second set of Brooklyn's.  I love these so much, but I change the sheets every week.  And so I only get them one week at two.  And if I had a second pair, then I could just rotate them.  That would be great.  Brooklyn, who says you can't vacation in the comfort of your own home?  Brooklyn is here to keep you cozy all summer,  along with their award winning sheets and home essentials.  Brooklyn is the perfect way to build your own oasis to escape the heat.  The options are endless.  Do yourself a favor and simplify your shopping by bundling bed, bath and both.  That's what we did.  You could save time and up to 25 percent  when bundling your new favorite home essentials.  Brooklyn was founded by husband and wife to a rich and Vicky in Brooklyn.  Where else? Back in 2014, with one one idea in mind to provide customers  with hotel quality luxury bedding.  You know, when you go to a fancy hotel or a cruise ship and you get in bed  and they go, why can't my bed be like this at home? It's so nice.  Well, it is now with me for thank you, Brooklyn.  And you could choose the Brooklyn and sheets that fit your needs.  Brooklyn is their crisp classic percale weave,  which will breathe and give you a very cool night.  We went for the buttery smooth Luke's Satin sheets.  They are really, really smooth and soft.  You see they have washed and they have organic.  They've got a lot of varieties.  We also got the Brooklyn and towels. I love them.  They soak up water.  Brooklyn, I think it's because Brooklyn and only uses the highest quality  materials for all their products, such as long staple cotton,  everything they create, built to last and feel great.  We got the full set with the sheets, the pillowcases, the duvet,  the towels, the whole thing.  And I could not be happier.  Highly recommend Brooklyn and the Internet's favorite sheets.  How can I say that? Well, for a couple of reasons.  Wirecutter and good housekeeping both agree.  Brooklyn and has best in class bedding.  But there's also the 100000 five star customer reviews.  That tells you something, too.  People love Brooklyn and you will to shop in store.  Yes, there are Brooklyn and stores look for one near you or online  at Brooklyn and dot com today.

Scooter X has been mentioning this again and again,  and I did have it booked market as my pick of the week,  but it's actually not going to be my pick of the week.  But I I will mention the full movie.  Love Notes to Newton is now out and free on YouTube.  So if you think there's Harry Mcracken,  if you like me, have a whole bunch of Newtons,  if you still love your Newton  conversations with some of the people who created it,  some of the people who still love it,  some people who still have Newtons and use them every day.  It's an hour and a half and it's great and it's free.  So if you want to know more about the history of the Newton  Love Notes to Newton, Newton, the full movie is available.  The channel is called Love Notes to Newton.  So I think you'll know where to find that on on YouTube.  And now Jason Snell, your pick of the week.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to promote an app written by a friend of mine,  Casey Liss from the Accidental Tech podcast.  His app came out last week.  It's really good, though.  That's the thing.  You know, it kills me a little bit to say my friend wrote a great app.  He did. It's called Call Sheet.  And it is literally a reaction to how bad the IMDB app  and web experience have gotten.  So he wrote an app that uses not IMDB because that data is not as readily available.  It uses the movie database, which is almost as good, not quite as good.  But he wanted to build a clean, easy to use app  that accesses the hey, who's that guy moment in your life  where you're like watching a show and you're like, well, what that actor,  what has he been in and following it around like we do with IMDB,  but doing it without ads and a lot of garbage.  And it's really well done.  And I think my favorite part of it is the way.  Oh, yeah, it's got a quick access link.  That's really brilliant. That's got this idea of like you can set it to go to just watch  and see where is that movie or TV show available to stream or you can have it be IMDB trivia or whatever.  It's got spoiler controls, which are really nice.  So if you are worried about like being told Idris Elba isn't in all the episodes of this,  you're like, oh, no, what did they do to Idris Elba?  It's like, well, turn that off and you won't see that and you won't  get spoiled about it. If you know, you know.  So I really recommend it on that level.  I also really love how thoughtful his subscription model is.  So this is a subscription app.  If anybody learned anything in the last year, it's that if you're writing a Twitter  app or something like that and you rely on a subscription, you're at the mercy of the service  and it can be super dangerous.  And they're currently, I don't believe, are any or very many API fees for him to pay the movie database.  But what he's done is he set up a very thoughtful subscription plan.  It's a reasonable price. There's a monthly fee or an annual fee.  But what I really like about it is when you open the app, you are not prompted to create an account.  You are not prompted to buy a trial.  You just use the app. And after about 10 searches, it will start to subtly say, you know,  eventually you're going to need to pay for it.  And I believe 20 searches is the moment where you need to decide.  But the beauty of that is by the time you hit the paywall, you'll know if this app is worth it or not.  And I think it's really if you're somebody who's looking up who is that guy in that movie all the time,  this is so much better way to do it than something like IMDB stuff.  So you'll find out whether it's worth it or not.  But there's no risk in trying it because it is free to try for those 20 searches.  Call sheet app dot com.

Transcript:  I know that somebody is watching the after party the other day.  And I'm like, oh, it's that guy from from the thing.  And I had to look it up. It's like, oh, he's from that show where we're Carl.  Carl Urban is an android. It's that guy.  But I like I had to go through that process.  So, you know, it's it's yeah.  And I just I love how thoughtful it is.  So many apps when you open it for the first time, you're like, please create an account.  Please buy it now and then get the free trial and all that.  Like you will get a seven day free trial when you sign up for Call Sheet.  But you'll you'll do it even to get to that point.  You will have used the app enough to know whether you want it or not.  And I just I really like that as a philosophy to be able to really use the app  before you have to decide if it's worth paying for.

Transcript:  Really great free pick this week, but you got to get on get on board.  The Nib is a wonderful site that publishes  comics by creators from all around the world, all kinds of backgrounds.  And then we're not talking about like three panel comic strips.  We're talking about political comics, nonfiction memoir.  It's going out of business. That's right.  Actual journalism. Beautiful, beautiful stuff.  And they're going out of business, unfortunately, after pay after 10 years  and paying like two million dollars to independent cartoonist and comics.  Creators. But the good news is that through the month of August,  if you go to the nib.com, you can actually download PDFs of every issue  that they published. And so I suggest you get right on that.  They're also asking for donations because they would like to keep this archive alive.  Again, they can't keep publishing and they can't keep paying creators.  So that's why they're shutting down.  But they would like this stuff to still be available to people.  And you can help out by donating some money.  But until then, grab every single one of these PDFs while you can,  because every single issue is just there.  There's there's no top. There's no bottom.  There's no high point. There's no low point.  I can't think of any other publication where just every page is just rewarding  and positive and wonderful.

Transcript:  Yeah, there was so much sadness when they announced that they were going to shutter  after 10 years. Yeah.  Yeah, it's really it's really a shame.  But it's great that you can get them because a lot of these are out of print.  But do leave them some money so that we can keep these archives online,  because they really.  Yeah, and other people can discover them.

Transcript:  And when we were.  Yeah, it's it's it's terrible when creative work just is allowed to die  either because it was it was a movie that had its day 30 years ago,  but is not valuable enough to be repeated.  A live stage performance that was never recorded to begin with,  except for one one illegal copy.  And when that happens, it's like all this beautiful stuff,  all these beautiful creatures of the earth were killed before they could  they could flourish and they could establish their permanent foothold  in our society and our consciousness.  And so by keeping these things online, all these things can live another year,  five years, 10 years, hopefully 50 years, and they deserve it. Yep.

Transcript:  Yeah, so we went at Seagraph.  There was a lot of cool things.  I mean, people were talking about nerfs and we were talking about motion capture.  But the thing that seemed to stop everyone was this application called Feather.  So Feather is a free app right now.  And it won't be forever, but it's it's a free app.  And you can sketch in 3D.  And it is just magical to watch someone draw.  So basically, what happens is, is that you you define your first stroke  is to define the surface that you want to draw on.  And your second stroke is to draw on that surface.  That surface can be curved. That surface can be wavy.  It can be straight.  And you can build, you know, whole scenes and drawings and planes  and animals and everything else in 3D.  And you're really sketching in that 3D area.  You can cut and paste in 3D.  You can do a lot of other things there.  And it is just mesmerizing.  Like we're looking at someone who's I'm still learning how to use it.  But I downloaded it immediately onto my iPad.  But all the stuff you're seeing there is stuff that someone drew in that app.  And it can generate an OBJ so you can eventually get it into.  So you could literally draw this, save it out as an OBJ.  I haven't tested this yet, but I'm about this is the next thing I want to do is.  But it should work that you should be able to draw it, export an OBJ,  put it into USDZ and text it to somebody and they'll pop up on their desk,  you know, of a sketch.  You know, it was just they've been doing.  I guess I talked to the CTO and the designer of it,  and they've been working on this for three or four years.  And so this is just they're coming out of like, here's the product that we worked on.  So it feels much more mature than a version one.  And they're going to probably move into some kind of subscription model at some point.  But right now it's free.  And if you do any kind of sketching, even if you just want to see, I mean,  there's very few times where I look at something and it's just  kind of a magical tool on the iPad.  And this is one of those times, you know, and it's just it's just  all of us were just kind of stunned watching it.  And there's there was all these people, they have a huge LED wall there.  You'll see there's some live coverage of it in our that we're showing it.  But all there's all these people just staring at this giant wall of someone  drawing in 3D. And it's just it's unbelievable.  It's like that little that little pen that you drew with lines  you could draw in real world, except that it's digital.

It's not like squares and polygons.  It is ink drawing in 3D and watching them turn to add details to different  views of this is just like this is magic.  This is like a movie prop.

So it's got to be it's whatever the minimum  the minimum that uses a pen.  But but it's it's just magical.  And it's free. It's free right now.

Transcript:  It's not it's not CAD for people who aren't watching.  It's not like it's it's CAD for people who are designing things.  They intend to 3D print or put into like a modeling program later.  It looks like something like if you draw any sketchbook, now you can draw  and just be creative and have things out of your mind.  And I'm sorry, I'll stop blathering.  But good heavens, I can't wait to try this.  Yeah, look at the tutorial.

And then it leaves you in the model that it stepped you through.  So you can start to fiddle around with it.  And just sitting I there's very few times when I just go,  this is truly a new app.  Like, it's not like I can't, you know, just it's like something  that's just truly amazing.  And and this is one of those moments.  And so so I would highly recommend downloading it and play with it now.  Again, there's going to be some they said there's going to be some subscription  service at some point. I don't know what that's going to be.  But they said right now, we just want people to play with it

And I actually I I've already started playing with this one.  I actually found this one easier to draw on than than the Meta one,  just because it was a pen and I could see it and everything else.
