Transcript:  It's time for MacBreak Weekly. Andy, Alex, Jason, they're all here.  As we get ready for the Big Apple event next week, Apple's going kicking and screaming  into the world of Type-C according to Mark Gurman, but is it a real story or just a made-up one?  We'll also talk about big price hikes possible for the iPhone 15.  And Apple says, we're really not that big in Europe.  Really? It's all coming up next on MacBreak.

Transcript:  Mostly clearing the decks on for like two days beforehand to make sure that I don't have anything else to do on that day.  Yeah, it's always, it's always, it's always weird because I'm lucky that I'm not, I'm not working for like one of these new sites where it's like, you have to post 30 seconds after the, after something comes out in the stream.  But nonetheless, it's like, here's what I'm going to have.  There's what I'm going to be saying.  I'm going to be doing during the live stream.  Here's what I want to prepare to be ready to post like immediately after the live stream.  And then I need to start like lining up the people that I want to talk to, to maybe explain things that confused me about the live stream.  And then I'm on like GBH, fortunately I'm on GBH like two or three days after that so I can be three, three days smarter than I was on Tuesday.

No, it's not because it's broken in, shall we say.  How many years, John, have I been sitting in this?  This is from the Brickhouse, right?  So it's more than 10.  13 years.  And it's feeling it.  These chairs were not meant to be sat in for more than five.  All right. Enough foolishness.  September 12th is the day.  10 a.m. Pacific Time, 1 p.m. Eastern Time.  We will be streaming here live, as many will.  I know. Are you going to do your office hours thing that you do?  It's kind of fun.  So what we do is it'll be Micah and me sitting and, you know,  watching the keynote with you and talking about it.  But you guys, it's almost like a group activity.

Transcript:  Yes, it's like usually between 100 and 150 of us jumped into what we call after hours.  It's like the overflow room for the Apple event.  It is a big overflow room where you're allowed to talk.  So what happens is that you hear a couple of us talking about what we're seeing.  And it's so we're watching it. We don't watch it.  We don't stream it into Zoom.  We just listen to it on whatever device we all have.  So our sync is a little off.  But outside of that, we all just use the second year experience, quote unquote, is the Zoom.  And we all sit there and just talk about what is being released.  But we also talk about like, oh, I see that.  I think they're using green screen there and that you could never put do that in that building.  And this is, you know, like, did you see what they did with the camera shot?  And so it's a little bit more than just the products themselves.  It's usually how they do it.  Usually and whatever Craig's big move will be that has all the effects.

In my memory, there were seven arms.  Just a lot is the word.  You're thinking cheap trick.  Many. Yeah, I'm thinking cheap trick.  Yeah, so that we'll be looking forward to that.  Make a note. Put that on your bingo card.  Craig Federighi.  Crazy stuff.  Dad jokes.  Crack team.  We're going to see an iPhone 12.  A 15 rather.  Pretty sure of that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's probably at this point, I think it's safe to say type C.  Although Mark, Mark Gurman.  There he is.  He's got six arms with the hair.  He's a six billion dollar man.

Start time: 540.80
End time: 592.00
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I thought that was super interesting because I imagine that, okay,  they're going to have to, they're putting type C in everything.  It's going to come to the iPhone at some point.  His newsletter story is that they plan to simply wait out lightning for  the next two, three, four years until they're ready to release a completely  portless phone, which has been rumored for a long time.  And A, it would be a stupid idea if it weren't for Apple because they can  couch a stupid idea in terms of courage and because we were in where the  puck is going to be, not where the puck actually is.  But I still, I mean, I know I'm talking about something that hasn't been  announced and if it happens, won't happen for another three or four years.  But I, boy, I'm a hard sell on the idea of this being in any way a move that's  going to improve anything for users.

Start time: 592.70

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's like, it seems a little petulant of Apple to say.  In fact, German's phrasing is a little weird.  The company has an ironclad rule when it's introducing a new product or dealing  with the media, it always wants to operate from a position of strengths.

Start time: 609.77
End time: 720.38
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  No kidding. That's called marketing. That's PR. Good. Yeah.  I don't love this report. I'm deeply skeptical of it actually.  I'm sure there are people inside Apple who don't like the fact that this was  mandated and I know that Mark has reported before about this dream that  Apple has of the portless iPhone, which I've always thought was kind of BS or  at the very least a kind of fantasy that would be eventually down the road a  long time.  In fact, and I don't have, I mean, I don't have his sources.  I just am really skeptical that when he refers to Apple's strategy monolithically,  I don't believe it.  I'm sure people were against it or were arguing just to hold out for this magical  future where there was a portless iPhone, which I'm very skeptical of.  But I also, I mean, my feeling is if it hadn't gone so badly 11 years ago, this  would have happened way sooner.  Eleven years ago was when lightning came by the lightning transition.  Exactly.  That they're like, like, no, I don't want to go through that again.  I don't want to go through that again.  And the with this EU thing, they basically are forced to do it.  But, you know, I just, I don't know.  I think that Apple does have a dream of going quote unquote portless.  But even then, I think it's probably a magnetic connector like MagSafe with some  data pins on it that are actually like a smart connector on an iPad.  I'm really skeptical of a completely walled off phone that you can't plug a plug  into.  So when I hear a story like this that builds on that and then says they're very  offended that they had to do this, they were waiting for that, that promised land in  the future is like, I don't, I don't buy it.  I think it's more likely that they would have gone sooner if they didn't feel like  they know what's coming right, which is there's going to be all those stories about  Apple is ruined just once you can make money and they made me change all my cables  out. And like those stories are coming because they're inevitable.  But I think it's I think it's less about them.

Start time: 721.00
End time: 796.30
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I don't. Yeah, I guess I don't really believe that they're kicking streaming either.  I think that they just didn't want to spend any time on it because they know that  they're going to get rid of it.  So they were kind of like, you know, why go through a transition that's only going  to last three or four years if they think that they're going to go down that path.  And I do agree that most likely anything that had a, you know, got rid of the port  would probably have data pins or the ability to pass data over that.  I think the hard part for them is that going from lightning to transfer speeds that you  might get through a non port is probably pretty equal.  You could probably make that data work.  Going through USBC is harder, you know, because USBC has such a much, much, much  higher or even if they went to Thunderbolt.  Has just a much higher transfer rate.  So you get used to that.  And I still think that I think that the ultras, potentially maybe the only the ultras,  but the ultras and the pro maxes would be the ones that would probably always have USBC.  And I think they might have been always going that way because if you're going to start  recording pro res, you really need USBC.  But, you know, like you can't you can't keep on building up this idea of pro res or pro  res raw or any of those things and still use it.  So I think that there's I think it was kind of coming either way.  Yeah.  In that in that area.  I mean, I could I could I mean, I'm with you, Jason, in that I don't think that if if this

Start time: 797.12

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  was if this is a real thing that they were ever going to do something where there was  absolutely no way to send to send electrons from an outside source directly inside the  thing, there's always going to be something like like pogo pins.  But even that, I think, is something that's going to be a big part of the whole process.  I mean, the thing is, like, I don't know.  It's going to be fascinating.  It's the engineering underneath creating a an iPhone with no holes in it pales in comparison  with the three, four or five years that they're going to need to engineer the excuses that  they're going to present during the during the rollout event about why this is such a  great idea and why this is a consumer product.  And I think that's the thing.  When actually it's nothing but downside for the consumer.  It's like you could I think the only thing that's obvious is that things.  Oh, well, gosh, the dust and dust incursion and moisture incursion will increase the  longevity of the phone.  I said, well, you're already I.P. 68 resistant.  What are you going to be like I.P. 70 I.P. 73 I.P. 74 that those things don't exist?  I mean, I think that's the only thing that's obvious is that the only thing that's obvious  is that the only thing that's obvious is that the only thing that's obvious is that the only things that are  obvious if it is 24 that those things don't exist.  And it's not like you're saying, oh, well, because because because we're making this  thing so much more durable, congratulations.  We're going to make like if it's if it gets dunked in water and needs to be fixed, that's  covered in Applecare from now on.  No, they're not going to do that.  This is this is their this is going to be their case where they made a decision that  in which they're taking they're they're taking a means of connection that always works.  It's a you take a cable here, you plug it into their electrons go from there to there.  It always works to a system where it will work if the following set of conditions is met.  And that's that's such a huge downgrade for consumers that they I mean, people should be again,  I can't imagine them pulling this off in a way that I'm not going to be making fun of them for this.  And it's slow and inefficient.

Start time: 925.10
End time: 985.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, that's the other thing is even if you can just charge wirelessly via a puck,  it generates a lot of waste heat, right, which sometimes depending on your environment  might actually make the phone stop charging because it gets too hot.  It is slow compared to the cable.  I use MagSafe most of the time, but like I just have a hard time picturing that.  And Alex Point is a good one.  I could see a scenario where maybe they wanted to play out the string with lightning on,  you know, you could maybe do it on the low end phone.  But he's absolutely right.  It's already ridiculous that they've got this video capability and that just huge video files.  And then they're like, well, good luck with lightning.  And so to have the USB-C connector, which is it's everybody's familiar with it.  You know, I don't know.  I'm fascinated by the way Marcus reported this, but I'm not sure I buy that.  Again, the I'm sure there are people who felt this way inside Apple.  But is that like the monolithic Apple response here?  I'm dubious of that.

Start time: 985.06
End time: 1008.96
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know if there is a monolithic response.  No, it can't be.  I think that we think that there is and we think that Apple is Apple.  But, you know, I met a lot of folks that have and they all have pretty strong opinions and they're not necessarily monolithic, you know, about how it depends on who you're talking to with any of these things as to what the you know what we are going to do, you know, kind of thing.  Unless you are Tim Cook and a handful of other people, you really don't know.

Start time: 1009.42
End time: 1038.82
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  In fact, you could argue that the way Mark's story is written is that his sources are people who lost the argument.  Right.  Where there are people inside Apple are like, you know, no, USB-C is good.  And they were fighting back and forth.  No, let's just keep lightning until we get to portless.  Like, no, we should switch to USB-C.  And then at some point, they decided to switch to USB-C, whether it's prodded by the EU or not, doesn't really matter.  Those people could easily be the ones who are feeding Mark Gurman their story about how we weren't going to do this, even if some of them were.

Start time: 1039.18
End time: 1088.00
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And again, I think that the reality is it was always going to go to USB-C for the Ultra and the Pro Max, most likely.  Definitely the Ultra, maybe the Pro Max.  So that was always going to happen because you just can't do what you need to do with the if they keep on selling those phones.  Speed refresh.  And so the main thing is, is what we're going to do with the less expensive phones.  And the other thing that they will probably bring up that I think is so far valid just because it's the only way people are getting in.  The only way people are hacking phones is physical access to that port.  You know, the only way they can get into the iPhone is a physical access to that port.  Taking that port away makes it considerably harder to hack an iPhone.  Like as far as like closing gates and welding them shut, getting rid of that port is a big piece of Apple being able to make sure that it's impenetrable as they move forward.

Start time: 1088.46
End time: 1175.00
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. But now we're talking about like, from my understanding, a very small increase in the security and integrity of people exfiltrating information off the device they have physical possession of.  And is that going to be a better upside for most people than, oh, I'm totally screwed.  I don't have a cable with me.  I don't have a special Pogo cable with me to charge my phone with.  And I didn't bring, I didn't, woe is me, I didn't happen to bring in my laptop bag a wireless charging device.  Or I decided that I just think that the massive inconvenience that's going to happen, that there are going to be people who are going to be plenty of people who are going to be like, hey, no, it's great.  I needed to buy a new USB battery bank anyway.  My new battery bank just simply has a cheap charging in addition to all the other stuff.  Let's even ignore everything that Jason was saying about how it's inefficient, it's slow, it generates heat in your bag, all that kind of stuff.  It's like, yeah, but what if I don't want to, I like my battery bank.  I don't need to spend 50, 60, 70 dollars on a new battery bank.  I was really excited about the fact that I could now reuse all the USB-C stuff that I use for literally everything else I have that has a digital pulse.  I don't know.  I have a hard time coming away from the idea that this is just dogmatic arrogance if this is something that Apple actually wants.

Transcript:  I have to say he's gotten a little bit fast and loose.  I know Bloomberg has rules, but he doesn't seem to be following any of the rules here.

Start time: 1198.04
End time: 1251.59
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think when he's reporting, he's solid and he follows the rules, but I think that there is a, just as an observer of his work from the outside, I think Bloomberg also wants him to do some punditing, especially in the newsletter, which is where he breaks news, but he also is recapping old stories of his, which is sort of what he's doing this time as a way to set the table for the iPhone.  His punditry, I mean, look, I'm not going to judge somebody else's punditry.  It's fine, but it's not his reporting.  And I think his reporting is solid.  So that's the challenge there of him being in the Bloomberg environment, which is a different editorial environment than when he was at nine to five back back in the day.  And they have their own quirky rules and all of that.  But yeah, some of it when he is specific, I think you can see his diligence.  But there are other times where he is pulling back and telling a story and you that's when I start to say like, well, but who like who said that?  This feels like that story.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, I can't I can't I can't possibly imagine that that there's always going to be people that are going to be upset with any change that gets made.  However, I can't imagine this isn't where Apple is taking.  Hey, we decided the new story is we decided to do away with a completely proprietary standard that only we support.  And we're embracing the thing that we likely already have stuff that already works.  We're not telling you this is wasn't like the transition to lightning where you're saying all of your old stuff doesn't work.  You're going to need to buy absolutely brand new stuff and you can only buy it from us or from people who have gone through a special works with iPhone program with us.  This is basically making sure that all of your stuff is more democratic, more Catholic, more ecumenical, all that sort of stuff.  I do. And people are going to complain, but I don't think this is as valid a complaint as it would be like when people were saying that, hey, suddenly all my favorite headphones don't work with my iPhone.  I don't work with my iPhone anymore unless I buy a $30 adapter and remember to bring it with me whenever I go.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that it's I think that they also the fact that it took so long to go to USBC.  Most of us have I have probably 40 USBC of different lengths next to me.  Yeah, I have two sitting in my car that I forgot.  The biggest problem I have is that I have I have like all these wires from my car to plug into things and everything else.  And and I have a you know, I have a wireless charger in my car, wireless charger here, and I have to admit that I've gotten kind of used to that.  But but the main thing is, is that I think that if they had done it two or three years ago, I would have been frustrated because I wouldn't have a lot of USBC or as much as I do now.  Now it's the one outlier. Like it's the one thing that I have that is using something other than Thunderbolt or USBC.  As far as made for iPhone, it'll be interesting to see. I think it'll charge that way.  I think devices will be different because I have noticed that there's something about 17 that is kind of closing off access to video out of my phone.  So so I you know, it's like it's there. Something's afoot.  Like they're going, I don't identify what you're talking to, and I'm not sure if I'm going to do anything with that, you know, like, and so so it's an interesting something's changing in the way that they out they use that port, even though it's lightning there.  I feel like there's something they're working on something, but I don't know what it is.  Well, it's painful because I can't use it with my switchers sometimes. I can pop it up and it just doesn't work.

You think how high speed will it be? They might as well.  There's why it won't be on the probe. Thunderbolt's your thing. Exactly.  I'm on the really expensive. It costs. It costs money to do that port. Right.

Transcript:  They talk about creators who need to move a lot of data on and off that device who would say, wow, if I can get if I can get Thunderbolt speeds off of this thing, as well as unnamed Thunderbolt accessories that are already part of my workflow.  Yes, that's that this is pay.  This is why I spend the extra two or three hundred dollars for the top of the line one, not just so I can flex on everybody else at the TGI Fridays.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I do think that the ultra is going to be Apple.  We'll see how much more expensive it is.  I think that over time we're going to find that that's the one that they're kind of unrestrained like they can just do whatever they want with that price.

But I do think that I am getting closer to where, especially with the Mac, the Pro Max that I have now, that I do just use it almost all the time.  I mean, I still have I have specialty cameras for what I do.  But but on a day to day basis, I really don't miss taking a camera anywhere.  And I would love to see Apple put a larger chip in and be able to just put just add more performance.

I don't know why, but I feel like that's a different experience.  That's kind of anyway. We'll see.  According to Digitimes Research Senior Analyst Luke Lin, the iPhone 15 and 15 plus will be the same price as the 14 and 14 plus.  But the Pro Pro Max and I guess there might be an ultra will cost more.  Major price hike is the phrase he uses, partly because of the switch from stainless steel to titanium,  partly because of the new periscope lens system.  Maybe we can throw in Thunderbolt as well.

Start time: 1624.00

Transcript:  Some of the reports suggest that it's possible they won't raise the price in the US, but that they will definitely be doing it overseas.  I wouldn't be surprised if they raise it in the US, but I would also not be surprised.  Last year, I thought they would raise the price of the high end phone and they held off in the US.  They might still do that, especially depending on the marketing.  Mark Gurman has said that there are only two high end phones.  So there's not a Pro Max and an Ultra.  The question is just marketing.  Are they going to change the Pro Max and start calling it Ultra and differentiating it further that way?  Or is that for another year and not this year?  And I feel like that we don't know because that's a marketing decision.  That's something that they can hold really close to their chest.  But that, you know, there'll only be those two phones up there.  And, you know, it's so easy to say, yeah, of course it'll be more expensive.  That's what Apple does.  They make everything you want more expensive and then you buy it and they make all the money and they laugh all the way to the bank.  And that's true.  But they also have shown some restraint in a cooling, especially US smartphone market.  And they might say that it's close enough, it's good enough, especially since they have all these other tricks in terms of onboard storage and stuff to get you to pay more than the base price.

Start time: 1701.32
End time: 1726.96
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And they've also they can get away with that because they've also done a really good job in making sure that they cover pretty much almost every single price budget along the iPhone line between making sure that they have a diverse line of new phones every single year and also keeping older phones on the price list, but continuing to drop the prices of them.  So I think they're very competitive, competitive with mid range and even some low cost Android phones.  And that's that's saying something.

Transcript:  Chance Miller rating for nine to five Mac reminds us that Tim Cook during Apple's Q123 earnings call said, quote, iPhone contains their iPhone contains their I can't do his voice contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives, their payment vehicle and for many people.  So I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.  Maybe he was just justifying their thousand their existing thousand dollar price.  But maybe that is some thinking at Apple that, you know, because this becomes more and more your primary computing device.  Maybe people are willing to expand the amount they're willing to pay.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I don't know if I'm representative, but I spend more time on my iPhone than any other device I have like computers or anything else.  It's it's the and I and I think that again, I think the Apple's advantage is that I actually really think that Apple users are just less geeky.  Like they just want it to work.  They want to be in the background and there when they need it, they just don't want to fiddle with it.  They just wanted to work like I found that I someone wanted to send me money over Venmo and I opened it up and I was like, OK, this is super weird that I'm seeing everybody else's transactions totally just shut it off and took off my phone.  I was like, I don't I don't want to use that.  That was just last night.  And so I was like, I just wanted to work.  I just want to send my Apple pay to what you're doing.

Start time: 1806.10
End time: 1863.90
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  You know, so I also think that the lengthening of the cycle, while it hurts Apple in some ways because they're not selling people a new phone every two years anymore.  It might be three or four years.  It does for a certain portion of the user base mean if you're only buying it every third year or every fourth year, you want to spend a lot of money on the best one because then you're going to use it for a long time.  And if that's the case, that also makes it easier.  It's your number one device.  It's your most important thing in your life.  You're only going to buy it every three years.  So shelling out twelve hundred or thirteen hundred for a high end spiffed up iPhone Pro is not as hard a question for a certain portion of Apple's base.  And that's I mean, that's part of the game.  Apple's playing Apple is using old models and the SE and stuff to push down into lower price points for people who are more price sensitive in the US and around the world.  But they also want to take as much money as they can from people who literally will pay anything for the new iPhone.

The moment it showed up, I put a screen protector on it and I will take it out and there's a high probability I'm going to sell it.  Just like, you know, sell it off.  I'll get a big chunk of that back of what I put into it because it's in mint condition, you know.  And so I think that there's other people thinking about it that way as well.

Transcript:  I only save the silver and black ones, you know, the oddball ones, the wedding stickers.  Those are diamond doesn't I got a million of them.  Great conversation.  More to come in just a bit.  But first a word from our sponsor, Melissa, the contacts data quality experts.  The holiday season, of course, is probably the number one mailing season for your business.  It is for ours.  And that means it's more crucial for contact data quality than any other.  74 percent of retail purchases are going to be made through mobile platforms this year.  So be prepared for any unforeseen changes with Melissa's five step holiday preparedness plan.  Plan plan.  Number one, check your house lists twice.  Up to 40 percent of all address changes are never reported to the US Postal Service.  Meet USPS move update standards and get postal discounts with Melissa's global address verification.  And because Melissa is a and co-link full service provider licensee of the USPS, you can rest assured your data is automatically updated.  OK. OK.  So make sure you do that.  Step two, enrich your marketing list.  Start with address data you've already got.  Verify that.  And then let Melissa's premium data enrich your lists by adding addresses, phones, emails, social media and more.  Step three.  This is really important.  And I have to say, I'm impressed more and more merchants are using Melissa to do this.  Add address auto completion at checkout.  I just bought some nano lights on Alex's recommendation.  It knew my address because I just started entering it and said, oh, you mean this?  Improve your customer's experience.  You know, you've seen this by expediting the checkout process with here's the term of art.  Auto population, reduce address correction fees, which is important.  And overall cart abandonment.  Make it easy for customers to buy.  Make sure you have the correct address information.  Step four, distinguish between residential and business addresses.  This is much more important than you might think because of residential surcharges.  FedEx, for instance, charges roughly 65 percent more for residential delivery.  There's a big bump with UPS too.  And if you know which is residential, which is business, you will not be caught with your fees down.  With more people working from home, it's really important to identify if a shipment is going to a residence or a business.  Step five, digital identity verification.  Make sure your customer is who they say they are.  And this is key for eliminating fraud.  Melissa identity verification increases compliance, reduces fraud, improves onboarding.  And Melissa and Rich gives insight into who and where your customers are.  Do you get the sense? Melissa does a lot.  It does since 1985.  Melissa has specialized in global intelligence solutions and contact data quality.  And don't worry. Your data is safe with Melissa.  They undergo independent security audits continually to make sure they are SOC 2, HIPAA and GDPR compliant.  They always are. They are.  Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.  Get started today with 1000 records claimed for free. Great way to test it out.  Melissa, you'll be amazed. You'll be impressed.  You may be amazed by how much wrong data you have in your databases.

I don't think I bookmarked it because it was so dopey.  Apple will. Maybe it's not dopey.  Apple will launch low cost MacBooks next year to rival Chromebooks.  Apple. They're not making them yet.  Quana Computer and Foxconn, which makes those laptops,  seem not to be doing anything particular right now except making phones.  But Apple apparently, like every other PC manufacturer,  wants to get some of that lucrative Chromebook market.  It's growing all the time.  And I don't know where digitimes gets this,  but they say they're going to do a look.  What does low cost mean to Apple though?

Start time: 2213.91
End time: 2232.67
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, the only reason why this is even marginally interesting  is that it does come from digitimes and it's not Joe Blow on Twitter.  However, yeah, to compete with Chromebooks,  they're going to have to sell for less than 300 bucks.  No, that's not going to happen.  Exactly.

Start time: 2233.68
End time: 2236.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also, you've got an iPad at that price point, so you don't want to undercut that.

Start time: 2238.10
End time: 2299.98
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, but the problem that Apple is facing is that there are restrictions  on what kind of hardware school systems can buy for their kids.  And they include, well, you're going to have to have a trackpad,  you're going to have to have a keyboard.  And so even the $300 educational iPad doesn't meet those goals.  I just don't think that it's something that Apple is even capable of doing.  If they were to do it, they would want to do it in a way that's better  than Chromebooks are, which is a very, very big margin to do.  They're not great laptops. They weren't designed to be.  They were designed to be affordable so that instead of a school being able  to fill a 20C classroom with eight really, really good notebooks  that are going to have to double up between students,  they want to be able to buy 20 OK workable meets the prescription laptops  that everybody can have.  And I don't think that, again, I don't think Apple would be interested in doing that.  I don't think they have any special elf and magic that they could create  something like that that would be competitive.

Start time: 2300.02
End time: 2324.31
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The one thing that maybe would spur them to do that is if they had a bunch of,  let's say, M1s unsold.  Remember, they bought all of TSMC's capacity.  And they were able to make maybe a plastic M1 for a lot less.  And they had some parts.  Remember, that's why they made a studio display because they had extra iPhone parts  lying around.

Start time: 2325.24

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think that the thing is the iPad is so much more than the Chromebook  when it comes to actual being able to create things,  not just be a little machine that is typing little things.  And my kids have two Chromebooks and two iPads.  They use Chromebooks for school because they have to.  And then they never look at them again.  Notice, Alex, you and I know that, but the school buys Chromebooks.

Start time: 2347.00
End time: 2351.83
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 2353.20
End time: 2429.00
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  The schools run by administrators who don't have any vision.  That's right.  I understand, but that's still the market.  They are damaging their future by using Chromebooks.  The inability to create on the Chromebooks just destroys the only thing that matters.  The problem is that most of what kids are learning at school,  they're never going to use again.  Being able to create, being able to generate content is super important.  Being able to generate ideas is super important.  And it just gets so watered down and dumbed down by Chromebooks.  And I get what Google did really effectively is they got the receiver to stop  and they just threw it right where the receiver is, right where the teachers asked for it.  Like, this is what we need.  We just need it to be easy to do this thing.  But there was no forward motion of what that is actually going to need later.  And so it's really painful as a parent to watch.  And so I keep it with their iPads so they can actually do something useful with it.  But I feel like kids who don't have parents or that can afford to buy them real computers  are really at a huge disadvantage by administrators thinking that this is going to be enough  because it's just not in the future.

Start time: 2430.46
End time: 2494.90
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Well, I agree with the principles that you're saying.  However, I don't think that the slot that is being filled by Chromebooks  and that those same purchase agreements would be hypothetically filled with an iPad.  They're not there to help kids learn how to create and explore and create new experiences and whatever.  Sometimes some computers are just basic fundamental equipment.  This is the table stakes that you absolutely need to start from.  Just like a school needs a heating system, it needs air conditioning, it needs electricity,  it needs a lunch program, that kind of stuff.  They're not exciting.  I'm just saying that if you want to make sure that kids can do online research,  that they can use whatever software suite is being used to have a unified curriculum  so they can submit reports, they can submit homework,  teachers can also oversee and lead classes from the front of the room.

Start time: 2495.75

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So it feeds the machine.  It feeds the machine.  It's fine because the schools that we have today are not going to be the schools we have in 10 years.  They're going to be gone.  So it's not that big of a deal today because the ones that can't figure out how to be innovative aren't going to last.  We're past the whole people are just going to send their kids to public school.  That's not going to happen much longer.

Transcript:  All I want to say is that the teachers in the classrooms and even the administrators,  they have incredible problems that they're dealing with that go far beyond,  Are we giving kids the technology they can use to create and be part of the classroom of the future in 2033?  They're fighting wars on fronts where there is a book we've been using for 30, 40 years.  And now because of two activist parents somewhere inside the school system,  we have to fight to say that this education is important.  We have to fight to say that this part of our science curriculum is important.  That no, we don't have to tell you that it's possible that God created the universe because science doesn't say that.  On that basis, they've got a really full plate.  And sometimes, again, a good part of their job has to be spent on simply saying the lights are on.  The rooms are heated.  Everybody has a seat and a desk that's not going to dump them on their butts.  And they have a computer for which they can learn the basic skills of computing and the basic skills of document creation and expressing your ideas through words and pictures.  I think it's great if the school system can also have in that same classroom one or two Macs and a few iPads so that when it's time to create the multimedia part of the presentation,  they can now take all the work they've done collaboratively in Google Docs for education and then say, well, great, now we're going to put this into Keynote or we're going to create this animation with Keynote or with Motion and then add that to our presentation.  But at some point, I'm not going to you.  I don't I'm really have a problem with faulting educators for not having the vision to buy iPads that are not suitable for the task for which they are being approved funds to buy computers in England.

Transcript:  They're still having to worry about the ceilings falling in.  So there's that too.  Jason has a theory.  I have a theory.  I want to hear your theory.

Start time: 2649.14
End time: 2707.17
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  My friend has nothing to do with the education market because my theory is going to start with the fact that we're talking about a story from Digitimes,  which is reporting from the industry sources that are probably in the supply chain, which means they don't know what this computer is for.  They don't know who it's going to be mined for.  They're assuming that if Apple is making a low cost laptop that it's for schools.  But that feels to me a little bit like a veneer of angle to the story that Digitimes is putting on it.  I look at this and I think if this is true and we don't know, this is a kind of a shifty rumor.  But if Apple is looking at this, I think it's far more likely that Apple is looking at the fact that they've got the M1 MacBook Air, the M2 MacBook Air and the forthcoming M3 MacBook Air.  And they're like, what are we doing?  Because the M2 is coming down, but they really have a lot of customers, including in education, who want that low cost for Apple, a sub thousand dollar laptop price point.  But very performance still, which is kind of impressive.

Start time: 2708.22
End time: 2709.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the M1 is still amazing.

Start time: 2710.20
End time: 2773.66
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So what if Apple is investigating here is how do we use the work we did on the M1 Air and build something that's, I mean, for lack of a better word, a MacBook SE,  an older tech designed to be cheaper laptop that is not going to appeal to the people who are going to buy a MacBook Air M2 or M3,  but using possibly just to start the M1 and and some cheaper materials.  The Digitimes report says it's still metal, but not like the same.  And I just keep coming back to cut corner, cut costs, cut corners.  The Air is a little too nice.  So we're going to make a cheaper version of it.  That's just it's cheaper to make.  But it's still got the profile of an M1 Mac.  That's potentially still a pretty good product, especially if you could get it to six ninety nine or something like that.  Five ninety nine and still have the MacBook Air up at a thousand.  I think that is a more reasonable scenario in my mind for what this might be.

Start time: 2774.02
End time: 2855.00
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's I think there's room for creating a competition, not with Chromebooks,  but with this really great five, six, seven hundred dollar Windows notebooks that are out there where their own their biggest faults are all not due to the hardware,  but just due to the fact that they're running Windows.  So if they could get the if they could try to get back the people who are who are who need a new laptop, they have to run Windows.  I don't mean that. I don't mean that as snide as possible.  There are a whole bunch of there are a whole bunch of like really cheap Windows notebooks where if I could run Windows on the if I could run Mac OS on this,  it would be a good competition for like a MacBook for me because I love the design of it.  I love the choices they've made of it. The keyboard might be nicer.  It might have extra ports to it. All this other sort of stuff.  And again, most of the when you're talking about this time to buy the kid his his or her or their own notebook because they're going to high school or they're going to college.  We don't have a thousand dollars or twelve hundred dollars to spend on a MacBook.  So we're going to get them something that's Windows based.  We also are too smart to buy them a two hundred fifty dollar Chromebook that's designed pretty much for education.  It's like I would love to buy the kid as a MacBook, which is one of the best notebooks you can buy.  But I'm also not going to buy them with twelve or thirteen hundred or fifteen hundred dollar Windows machine either.  I've got six hundred or seven hundred dollars seems like a reasonable amount of money to spend on what is what is a laptop.

Start time: 2855.82

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Apple's competing against because they don't have anything at the eight hundred fifty dollar price point.  But Dell does with an XPS 13, which is quite a nice, very MacBook.  It is 12th generation Intel. It's a 16 gigs of RAM and it's running Windows.  That's his only handicap, which, by the way, not everybody in the world sees as a handicap.  I think that's a much more sensible place for Apple to aim.  And they also do they have this bumper where the iPad is going to keep them from going too low?  They don't want to cannibalize iPad sales.  Exactly. I think that I think you're exactly right, Andy.  The six they need something under a thousand.  What is the what is the educational price for the lowest cost MacBook?

Transcript:  And you get it. You get into the same thing that you saw with Apple has to be preparing for this wave that we've talked about in the past,  which is 90 percent of kids in school are using iPhones.  You know, there's a lot of demand as they go to college to to probably get something that's more Mac driven, you know, for that.  As we talked about earlier, I don't think they have any temptation like they're going to keep on using a Chromebook.  So so the so they're going to transition to that as they go into college.  So it does make a lot of sense. I mean, right now, if I was going to get something, I mean, unless they really thought they were going to use it all over the place,  I'd still look at a Mac mini because it's really inexpensive and really powerful.  It's got a lot more ports for school. I think they want laptops. I really do.

Transcript:  We got cottage cheese one day before expiration. We've got to move it out.  I'm not going to do the rumors about the digital crown for the MacBook or the clear laptop that they just patented in the UK.  I'm not going to do those. We're just going to skip right over those.  If you enter rumors, I'm sorry. We're going to disappoint you.  First though, before we do any more, a word from our sponsor, Delete Me.  I can say from personal experience, this is a thing that many of you will want to do, especially in business.  Especially if you're an executive in business. We've had our executives do this.  If you've ever searched for your name online, have you noticed how much not just your blog, but personal information is online?  That might make you feel a little exposed and unsafe.  And if you're in a business, the fact that executives personal information is available online is really a recipe for disaster with spearfishing and impersonation.  Since 2010, Delete Me has been on a mission to empower individuals and organizations by allowing them to reclaim their privacy and help them remove personal data from online sources.  This is their passion. A passion for privacy, a commitment to making it simple for customers to use.  By doing this, you reduce the risk from identity theft, credit card fraud, robocalls, spam, cybersecurity threats, harassment.  Just generally unwanted communications.  And the thing is, you could do some of this yourself. You can't really do all of it yourself.  The average person has more than 2000 pieces of data about them online.  Data that Delete Me can find and remove.  There are literally now hundreds of data brokers out there collecting that information about you and selling it to the highest bidder.  And every day, dozens more emerge. You can't keep up with it.  One customer said, I signed up with Delete Me. They took it from their awesome service already seeing results.  First, you sign up. You'll give them some basic information. They need to know what it is that they're searching for.  They'll remove it from search engines. But then, and this is really what you want, they will find and remove your personal information from all those data brokers.  Helping reduce your online footprint and keeping you and your family safe.  Thanks to GDPR, California's privacy regulations, these data brokers have to offer a way for you to remove the data, but they don't have to make it easy.  That's what Delete Me is so good. They know all the ins and outs for each and every one. They know how to get that stuff off.  Once the removal process starts, you're going to get a detailed Delete Me report within seven days.  But they don't stop there. They'll continue to and they have to because there's always new stuff coming online.  Scan and remove personal information every three months with an automated removal opt-out monitoring.  They'll ensure records don't get repopulated after being removed. That's a little trick the data brokers use.  I know I've experienced this. They're going to get things like names, addresses, but things like photos, emails, names of your relatives, phone numbers.  Just search. You'll find your phone number. I guarantee you online. Social media, home address, property value and more.  As the data broker industry grows and evolves, basically unregulated, Delete Me continues to add new sites and features to ensure their service is both simple to use and effective in removing personally identifiable information.  It's a shame we need this, but we do. I mean, honestly, I wish Congress would do something about this, but they're not.  So you got to take your own privacy, your own security in hand and use Delete Me.  Now, since privacy exposures and incidents will affect people differently, their privacy advisors, Delete Me, ensure that all their customers have the support they need when they need it.  They'll help you. They're there. They're almost like counselors.  Lisa's had been using this for a long time now. It's really, really important.  Protect yourself. Reclaim your privacy. I almost don't want to say who here has been using it because I don't want to invade their privacy.  Just trust me, a lot of people here use it. JoinDeleteMe.com slash twits, the website. JoinDeleteMe.com slash twit.  The promo code is twit. Lisa said I could say she's one of them. Otherwise, I wouldn't mention it.  JoinDeleteMe.com slash twit. The promo code TWIT at checkout will get you 20% off.  That's too bad we need this, but we do. JoinDeleteMe.com slash twit, offer code TWIT. Don't forget that.  And thank you, JoinDeleteMe, for your support.  From the Financial Times, not a big rumor site as far as I know.  Apple and Microsoft fight Brussels over, I'm not talking vegetables here. We're talking about the EU over gatekeeper label for iMessage and Bing.  Apple's questionable strategy is, oh, messages isn't that big. It's not big enough to be regulated under the Digital Markets Act.  Bing, well, I believe Bing's not that big.  So the key is platforms with an annual revenue of more than 7.5 billion euros, a market cap above 75 billion euros, and active EU users of 45 million fall under the rules.  Apple, I mean, you could argue Apple has all of the above, but Apple says iMessage doesn't meet the threshold of user numbers, not 45 million in the EU.

Transcript:  So here's the question. If they have sold 45 million iPhones in the EU, isn't it the case that every iPhone uses messages, whether you prefer WhatsApp or not?  But are you actively using it?

Start time: 3418.82
End time: 3430.98
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Well, that's the question which comes down to what metric is Apple using? Let's play the game. How do we get the numbers to be underneath the total?  It's sort of like the price is right. You don't want to go over.

Start time: 3431.12
End time: 3440.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, they have never revealed how many iPhones they've sold in Europe, so we don't know what that number is, but I think it's probably sufficient.

Start time: 3440.72
End time: 3489.84
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  My guess is what they're going to say is it's about active use of the platform.  My guess is what they're saying is essentially, yeah, Europeans don't send iMessages to each other.  They send WhatsApp messages or whatever, and therefore there aren't that many people actively using iMessage.  And remember, iMessage's app is not the same as iMessage, right?  The service and like a text message through your carrier is not an iMessage necessarily.  But it uses the messages app.  It does use the messages app, but does it use the iMessage protocol?  I think this is the question though is that I mean I talk to people I know in Europe who are like, yeah, it's irrelevant, right?  Like messages is irrelevant to them because all their group texts, all their text messages are using a third party app. They're not using Apple's app.

Start time: 3490.04
End time: 3496.00

Transcript:  And so this is Apple saying, please don't regulate us. We're unsuccessful.

Start time: 3508.98
End time: 3524.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, what's the upshot of them being regulated? Well, one thing, they'd have to open it up.  And let, for instance, which I think a lot of EU customers would like, let them use WhatsApp as their SMS messaging default.

Start time: 3525.74
End time: 3567.57
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. Also, this is weird because I don't, there's no way that Apple can win because the EU is not going to say, oh, oh, you're right. Sorry.  Sorry about, sorry about. They're going to say, wow, great. I bet you could, I bet you'll be able to provide us with hard numbers on all of the usage of these devices of this app, the service on your phone.  And Apple has never, ever, ever, ever, ever wanted to do that.  So it's like, congratulations. We're going to find out exactly how many people use it.  And it's like, like Jason says, it's like, how are they going to account it? They can use Hollywood.  They're going to use Hollywood bookkeeping says that our numbers say that it's 92 million a month and they can say, yeah, no, send this back to accounting.  Make sure you get this down to 44.7.

Start time: 3570.14

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  To be honest, I mean, from again, only from my experience, I'd be surprised if it was more than 45 million.  I mean, I would be surprised if it was more than 45 million regularly in Europe.  I very surprised. I would be surprised if it was more than 10 million.

Start time: 3581.00
End time: 3584.06

Start time: 3585.12
End time: 3625.15
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  No, it does.  Active users, monthly active users.  Oh, it does. Okay.  Yeah. So, so if you look at monthly active users, if it was above 10 million, I'd be a little surprised.  Above 20 million, I'd be very surprised.  I mean, I don't see anybody that I deal with in the pretty much in the rest of the world that uses anything other than WhatsApp.  Like it's just like a WhatsApp signal telegram.  And then, you know, everyone uses messages, Messenger and other things like that because they're in Facebook.  But but it's just a very, very tiny, you know, outside of the United States high schools.  It's a pretty small number.  And so I don't know if it if it needs to meet all those thresholds.

Start time: 3626.00
End time: 3646.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't see regular. I don't see monthly active users.  I see reaching at least 45 million users in the EU, which is 10 percent of the population.  You don't think 10 percent of the red.  Well, I'm looking this is the EU's own description of it.  You don't think 10 percent of the population of Europe uses iPhones and messages?

Start time: 3647.40
End time: 3658.00
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, again, from from my experience, none of them do.  Like I can't get a hold of them with messages.  Like they don't even it's like as if the app doesn't even exist.  Like that's I mean, I don't know anybody.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, but even so, this is going to be something where like we've been saying with all these lawsuits, like Apple's not going to help.  We're not just going to take your word for it, Apple.  You're going to have to actually prove it and prove it to to a very high standard.  I mean, if they don't qualify for it, then they should fight this.  But again, you're going to have to show you show enough data about the amount of traffic that you put across in the EU to make sure that you don't actually qualify for this.

Start time: 3712.50

And that's and to be and to be honest, that would that would be like there's so many the fight to regulate all of these huge, huge companies is turning into a lot of, oh, well, so you're Google.  Canada told Google that, oh, by the way, you're going to have to pay news creators for every link that you send to their sites.  They said, oh, OK, I guess we're not going to be providing any news in Canada anymore because that's stupid and we're not going to do that.  So, yeah, penalties are great.

Transcript:  Up to six percent of revenue for noncompliance.  The thing that I mean, honestly, it would be nice to see Apple support some of these measures, countermeasures against illegal activities are required in increased scrutiny.  You should be able to trace sellers in online marketplaces to to combat scammers, limits on targeted advertising.  Maybe Apple didn't like that so much.  The biggest thing, though, would be opening the platform algorithmic transparency.  The ability, for instance, I think they might require Apple to say, yeah, you can use WhatsApp for your text messaging.  You know, that would be OK.

End time: 3827.00

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So at least we'll get we'll get something out of Brussels is, according to the Financial Times, still deliberating.  And you know how Brussels can be over the inclusion of iMessage and Bing in the final list.  So that's why this is still open.  The commission may open a probe to determine if these services should face the new obligations set out in the DMA.  This is relevant because I think it's is it now active?  I think was September 1st the deadline or that was the DSA.  I think. Yeah, that was the DSA.  So January of next year.  All right. Well, we'll see.  Legal fights between tech giants and EU regulators come at a time of heightened scrutiny over their alleged anti-competitive behavior.  This year, Brussels threatened to break up Google, says the Financial Times over its alleged illegal practices in the ad tech space.  They certainly are saber rattling more than even here in the U.S.

It's just this one portion of their business where they're trying to I mean, literally is look guys, we're not that successful in Europe with iMessage.  Leave it out.  And I think that they've got a I mean, I think they've got a good chance of proving that because that's they're bad at that in Europe.  They just are. So they got I mean, there are also those reports we talked about a while ago, like where it's going to hit them is things like App Store policy where they may have to make enormous changes, at least in the EU to the App Store.  But, you know, iMessage, it feels like just small fry.  Like it's it's going to not be particularly important.  And I would also say, yeah, if in the end they have to make different default apps for messaging available, like they've already done that with so many different apps that I don't think would be a big deal.

Start time: 3955.66

Transcript:  They've already we've already heard really word here really good information about how like if if and when Apple does have to open up the App Store in the EU.  Congratulations, they will open up the App Store in the EU.  It's not they're going to have a special version of the US that only works.  That's geo locked to EU phone numbers.  And it's not as though that's going to be something that's going to be available to us in the US.  And it's also remains to be seen if they're going to if how they're going to actually comply with this.  If they're going to say, oh, congratulations, you can just simply download this from anywhere an external App Store.  We're perfectly happy with it.  We're not going to do anything to make that more difficult to install or use or trust.  And we're not going to have certain we're certainly not going to treat the apps that you install with those apps as second class citizens on this ecosystem.  No, they're going to make they're going to basically say, if you if you if you have if you have if you have fallen on glass and you severed an artery and the only way to stop the bleeding and save your life is to install an external app outside the App Store.  Then you will probably make the decision that what we put you through is going to be worth installing this external app.  However, if you're simply if it's if it's if you're simply bleeding a lot and you can make it to the emergency room, you'll say, you know what?  This is way too much trouble. I'll just be lightheaded until the ambulance comes.

Start time: 4034.02
End time: 4061.54
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And the reality is, is just working it for the EU is probably enough to kill it because it just means that you have this this you've subdivided the market.  So as a developer, you really have to make a good reason to build something that's outside of the App Store because you're now only targeting one part of the world and which is a much smaller minority.  I don't know if it would be I just don't think if they actually fork it.  I don't think that most developers would want to go down that path because it would fragment their market.

I think that's the thing Apple's the most concerned about is that's the real just Europe.  But it's that once it's like what we were talking about encryption in the UK thing.  If they say yes and break encryption, you can do that.  Everyone else will just pass their own laws to do the same thing.  Every time is true of the App Store.

Apple has said if you let side loading happen on the IOS instead of the App Store on IOS, oh bad actors, bad things are going to happen.  And the EU is really going to be like, well, let's see.  Right. Let's see what happens.  And it could be that they are able to say, see, I told you so.  This is very bad.  It could also be that their argument is exposed as being toothless because it's really not a big deal because they have all of the other security in place because they want their users on the in the EU to not be hacked.

A lot of these kind of campaigns happen over very many years of them pushing down on it before they become public.  And I think Apple was trying to head it off.  And then they ran into a wall of, hey, a bunch of us think that's a really, you know, like you're opening up again a Pandora's box of we're going to dig into your private information on your phone.  And while the vast majority are not going to be moving pornography or child pornography around, it's still like once you open that door, it's hard to close it again.  And I think that so I think everyone got upset.  I don't think Apple expected it to be such a hot topic for them.  And they dropped out of it.  And now they don't I don't they want to go back.

Oh, really? Is it Ashton Demi's thing?  I think that's what Thorne is.  Interesting.  And so this is a this is a pressure group.  And that's that's fair.  That's how the game is played.  And they're going to argue no, no, no.  You know, you make your slippery slope arguments.  We're going to make our other argument, which is why are you not protecting the children?

Transcript:  Here's some of the images that you'll see, you know, at protect children, not abuse.com.  Apple allows child sexual abuse images to be stored on iCloud and child sexual abuse is stored on iCloud.  Apple allows it.  I don't think Apple allows it is really the language I would use.  They have their own website now.  And so Apple, yeah, obviously attempting to quell this before it becomes yet another drumbeat.  But this is a tough one because nobody wants to be the one that says, oh, yeah, they don't want to be seen as somebody who encourages child abuse,  which is why this campaign is acting as if Apple is somehow encouraging it.

Transcript:  I mean, this is the this is it's interesting because the group reached out to Apple and said, oh, by the way, we're going to be launching this campaign in about a week.  We think it was fair to reach out to you and let you know that we're doing this.  Apple, Apple's VP of that department basically sent a very, very long, like seven paragraph long substantive email response to them, which they also shared with with with Wired,  which is why we're talking about it now, that basically outlined that, yeah, we thought that was a good idea.  We talked to a whole bunch of groups who convinced us it was actually not a good idea, that we thought that we would be able to implement this in a way that would that would that would protect the safety and security of the privacy of people's of people's data.  We became convinced that we were optimistic about that.  And so that's what we pulled back about it.  But nonetheless, here are a whole bunch of technologies that we did bake into the phone so that that make it more difficult and more challenging for kids to be exposed to content that their parents don't want them to be exposed to.

Start time: 4375.34
End time: 4431.93
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple's director of user privacy and child safety said in that response, Eric Newnshwander, child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to breaking the chain of coercion and influence that makes children susceptible to it.  However, scanning every user's privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit.  It would also inject the potential for and I think this is really the bigger one, a slippery slope of unintended consequences.  Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.  For instance, people brought this up, you know, homosexuality is illegal in some countries.  In some countries considered child abuse.  In those countries, they could say to Apple, well, we'd also like to use scan for gay content on your on your iCloud.  And so I understand Apple's nervousness about this.

Start time: 4433.50

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I mean, we're talking about the Kids on Social Media Act that's making its way through Congress right now.  Yeah, COSA.  And that's and that that's already being used as OK, the principles of this are very, very sound.  But already we're having long bankers who are supporting and saying and we're going to absolutely,  definitely going to use this to make sure that we find out if kids are accessing information about transgender resources because they need to be protected from that awful,  awful abusive stuff.  And so, yeah, it's this is I mean, this this was absolutely the right call.  And as we've said time and time before, and we've just said about half hour ago when talking about opening up the App Store and and opening up opening up messages like  if Apple has demonstrated that, OK, we have the infrastructure now to scan all content on somebody's device for X thing that we'd find objectionable or illegal.  Now, every single government will take a shot saying, well, look, why are you denying us the ability to enforce the laws that exist inside our really, really horrible totalitarian regime?  Just flip that switch and give us a version of the iPhone OS that allows us to find out which which which people are are posting really negative things about our regime using their devices.  And Apple is going to have a whole new problem in their problem.  Joe and I just simply say we don't have that.  We can't do that. They have a no.

Start time: 4514.04
End time: 4531.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Joe. Well, that's the problem.  Joe and our discord points out that Apple has in effect telegraphed that they have the ability to do this, even though they say, well, it'd be a bad idea.  They've admitted that they technologically can do it.  And at that point, they've already opened that Pandora's box.  It's a little late to say now.

Start time: 4532.48
End time: 4581.98
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It's a very limited crack in the box, though, because what they what they announced was scanning the data on your device before it is uploaded to the cloud.  Because in the cloud, you're talking about encrypted data to a certain depending on what the encryption levels are and the cloud service that you're using.  And so what they were doing is on device doing fingerprinting for known CSAM, right, which is not necessarily going to catch anything other than the known corpus of data.  And so that's that's a really limited thing.  And what they they there was a lot of pushback about that from a lot of areas as we've detailed.  And so they backed away from that.  So that's a yeah, they've proven that they could probably do that one thing.  But I'm not sure that's going to satisfy anybody who's asking for this stuff.

So I'm going to make sure that I use completely secure communications from end to end to to make this information get out.  Now imagine that the phone has ability to examine the data before it enters that pipeline to begin with.  That is a nuclear weapon in the hands of so many really bad people that we just don't want any part of it.  Apple is very, very smart to wash their hands of it.

But this camp, I mean, look, if you just ask people, should Apple be making sure there's no child sexual abuse material on iCloud?  Ninety nine percent of respondents are going to say, well, of course.

Transcript:  But the problem becomes like this is something another thing we've been we know this.  No, I understand. We know.  How does Apple respond to that?  That's that's not what I'm talking about.  Where that what do you what they're there?  They're out has always been we always we always obey the law.  We were forced to obey the local laws, laws, and regulations in which we operate.  At some point, they're going to have to draw a line and saying that you're asking us to do something that we find morally abhorrent and we're not going to do it.  And Apple has been I think Apple's doing an OK job so far.  Again, their response to this this PR campaign is on spot.  It was it was substantive. It was detailed.  They knew how to play the media games and we're going to be very, very open with this one outlet that we respect and trust and aren't run by bozos.  And we're actually going to give them our response to our and they're going to be happy enough to to spread that response for us.  They're not they're not concerned about this one group.  They're they're concerned when a grounds groundswell of people inside Congress start to clamor for this stuff.  And unfortunately, the people who are going to be empowering that stuff isn't necessarily a political party, but it's going to be like the FBI.  It's going to be like Interior Intelligence Agency is going to be law enforcement that continue to put pressure in every single country saying that we if the people have the ability to keep a secret from the government, then we don't have the ability to track down important crimes.  And therefore, people should not have the ability to keep secrets from us from the government.

You know, so anyway, but but I think it's it's good.  Anyway, I was going to say is that it is as I said, it's energized.  All of this stuff is being energized by the intelligence agencies.  We just we shouldn't understand they desperately want to keep the phone from getting closed off.  Like, you know, like it's and there's not really any good.  I mean, there's they'll say that there's good reasons, but they're you know,  they have more data than they've ever had in the history of the world about everybody around us.

Transcript:  If people understand where it's coming from, possibly if they if they take it,  that's why it's important for us to bring up the fact that this is not coming out of a vacuum.  Like, this is not just about this issue. This is about, you know, you know, you got to be very  people have to understand what the their threat vector is.  It's not like they'll go, well, I'm never going to use child pornography.  So it doesn't bother me. But but opening up that that hole is something that you see.

Use your own Linux based personal computer.  Or paper. Apple.  I think we talked about this last week was quick to tell one government regulator,  nobody uses our apps.  They're never the number one apps.  But at the same time, they've just put up a website, apple.com, apps, all about how great apps by Apple are.  I think maybe this was different divisions kind of  the one division said, what did you just say about our apps?

It's part of the story about when you did the best in class usually.  Right. Exactly. Yeah.  The Mac, when you spend the quote, extra unquote for a Mac or for an iPhone,  it's not necessarily spending extra just for that perfectly chamfered edge.  Sometimes it really is because, hey, look at all this.  This is not just something that we introduced this year.  We have just been consistently making sure that every single app that comes with these devices are important,  relevant, useful and competitive with whatever else goes out there.  Unless you're a regulator in which we say that, no, they're not competitive at all.  Actually, it's also fun because if you scroll down to the very, very bottom,  it says it's like the end of the the the introductions on Gilgamesh Island.  It's like and the rest.

Somebody at Apple responded saying that it I don't know what the quote is,  but the indication was that if we to the fact that these apps exist are part of the security signature of the package as a whole.  And if we were to remove some of these, we'd have to redo the security the security package of the signing of the entire package.  And that's one of that might be one of the reasons why, you know, there's still all of these apps.  You have to still remember, like actually do something.  Although DVD player, they can they can they can keep that in for free.  There's a reason why they don't have like a Blu Ray player, like even when Blu Rays were still like an actual popular thing, they would have to they would have to pay for that to actually use it.

They like to remember there's a one year where they did it like the next day and all the developers freaked out because their apps weren't ready.  Right.  And people were updating their phones and their apps were breaking.  So they've tried.  They try to give them a little bit of warning.  But it happens pretty fast.  And then Mac OS this year.  I've had it.  OS was delayed last year.  This year it sounds like it's going to come out simultaneously.  But Mac OS generally doesn't arrive until October.  And I haven't heard anything different about that yet.

In fact, I've seen articles now saying X wants to be the everything app.  Apple's already there.  Apple's done.  So one of the new features in iOS 17 will be Apple Pay cash payments.

You get ad free and tracker free versions of all the shows.  You also get a lot of special shows.  Thursday.  It's a sci fi lovers delight when we are joined in a fireside chat with Daniel Suarez, author of so many great books, Freedom and Demon.  And we've talked about a lot of his books.  We've interviewed him, I think, for every single book he's done.  And Hugh Howey, the author of The Wool series, which Silo is based on.  And Hugh, by the way, got married at Burning Man.  He had a kind of a muddy wedding at Burning Man's.  I think he'll be back.  And so that'll be interesting.  That's this Thursday.  If you are a sci fi fan, I don't ant good job scoring a interview with John Scalzi.  That will be amazing.  That's October 5th.  Lots of great stuff.  These are events exclusive.  Renee Richie is coming back in November.  Exclusive to our club.  We also have the Club Twitter feed with conversations before and after the show that don't make it in the podcast and other things.  Really the best part is your access to the Discord, which is a wonderful community.

It's a great place.  It's a great place to be.  And we would love to have you.  Plus, it really helps us keep the lights on here.  I don't know if you've noticed, but advertising sales have really dropped off.  I'm looking at Q4.  And our best show, I think, is this one.  It's 65% sold out.  But many shows are under 50% sold out.  And usually by this time, we've sold them out.  And that's a little concerning.  It hits the bottom line.  That's why the club is so important to us.  If you're not yet a member, please consider joining.  If you've got the seven bucks a month, twit.tv slash club twit.  We do have a wonderful sponsor for this segment of Mac Break Weekly, one I've used myself, Zoc Doc.  Oh, I love Zoc Doc.  It's funny because when you go on Amazon, you're going to buy something.  I'm going to buy the nanotubes.  I will look at the reviews.  I will read the reviews.  I will really make sure I understand the product before I buy it.  And that's just a silly little thing, you know, a light.  Why can't you do that for your physician, for your dentist, for your chiropractor?  You should be able to see verified reviews of them.  Well, that's what you've got with Zoc Doc.  You could finally do the research you do for even the silliest disco pants or dog hoodies or whatever,  for your much more important physicians, your dermatologists, your doctors, your dentists.  Zoc Doc is a place to find and book great doctors.  You can narrow them down to ones that take your insurance, that have appointments available,  many of them within 24 hours, and you can read verified reviews.  And they're very careful to make sure that those reviews are actual patients.  So you can see it's not just is a doctor good or bad.  It's much more than that.  What's the style?  How do they treat you?  How do they act?  Some people want a great bedside manner.  Some people just say, give me the facts, Jack.  Zoc Doc is a free app where you can find amazing doctors and book appointments online.  Yeah, in the app.  Booking appointments with thousands of top rated patient review doctors and specialists.  You could filter specifically for the ones that take your insurance,  who are located near you, who treat almost any condition you're searching for.  They all have verified reviews from real patients.  No bots allowed.  Now the average wait time to see a doctor booked on Zoc Doc, it's fast 24 to 48 hours.  Wow, you can even score same day appointments with many of these doctors.  Once you find the doc you want, book them immediately with just a few app taps.  No more waiting awkwardly on hold with the receptionist to explain your bunion problem.  You could get it done online.  I love it.  And it's a great app for iOS or Android.  In fact, you could go to the website, zocdoc.com slash macbreak,  and download the app for free right now.  I know you could also go to the app store and do it, but please go to the website so they know you saw it here.  Find and book a top rated doctor today.  It is the way doctors now use to reach new patients.  And you are a new patient.  Zocdoc.com slash macbreak.  It's about time, frankly, that we could get these reviews  and really see what we're going to get ahead of time.  Why should you be able to do it with dog baskets and not with your doctor?  Zoc Doc, Zoc Doc, Zoc Doc, Zoc Doc.  Zocdoc.com slash macbreak.  Zocdoc.com slash macbreak.  It's got a great name too.  Zocdoc.  Jason Snell, would you kindly honor us with a pick of the week?

Transcript:  I'm going to give you, this is actually, other than the price,  I would say quintessential Alex Lindsay pick.  Sorry, Alex, it's a two digit price.  But it is a utility that if you need, I guess, to use your iPhone anyway,  I use it as a camera holder.  I'm going to need this for moms.  I know.  So this is from a company called Shaw Way that's probably just a randomly  generated number of letters from Amazon.  What's that?  Oh, there it is.  So it's got a clamp on it.  You screw it to a table.  Yes.  And then it's got a very long bendy arm.  Goose neck, yes.  Very long.  It's like a two foot long, three foot long arm that bends in any direction you  want, which is very clever.  And then at the other end, it's a generic phone holder.  So it's just a clamp that you open up and put your phone into.  I use this every week because we record video for one of my podcasts and it's an  offset.  We don't want it to look like we're looking into a Zoom window like we are for  this show.  We'll sort of like for clips later for like TikTok and stuff like that.  And so I set it off set and just let it run during the show.  And this is how I do that.  And also it's if you're in a position where you need to put your camera  somewhere or your iPhone and use it as continuity camera, you can clamp this to  a table or a desk or whatever.  Look at this.  Clamp it to the headboard of your bed.  Clamp it.  I mean, a clamp.  It's a clamp.  It doesn't require its compatibility.  Is there a thin part that a clamp will fit on?  Then this will work.  And then you can bend it into whatever direction you need to bend it to get it  exactly where you need it to go so that it will.  30 inches of gooseneck.

It's just super convenient.  You know if you need it.  But if you've ever been in one of those situations where you're like, I just need  to put my iPhone right there or I need that camera right there, this will do it.  And so continuity camera is a great example.  If you want to have a camera kind of off a little bit and it's an awkward place,  if there's a place for clamping, you can do it.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Also the idea that you'd have an iPhone on a long arm clamped to your little tray.  Also not appetizing.  Yeah.  But again, it does point out the utility of it, which is if you can clamp somewhere,  you can get that phone in a position wherever you want.  So yeah, if you wanted to use this to like read or watch a video on your iPhone in bed  and you could clamp it to the headboard, you totally could do that too, because it's really flexible.

Transcript:  You just jolted me out of into awareness because I was looking at this pick of the week,  which is an amazing book that I got on Kickstarter.  Oh, Will Harris.  Yes.  Our buddy Will.  It's 42, The Wildly Improbable Ideas of Douglas Adams.  An amazing hardcover that is basically one of the most insightful looks into the minds  of one of the most incredible minds that have ever put pen to paper.  What they did was they had access to essentially all of his papers, all of his ephemera,  all of his notes, all of his notebooks covering pretty much from the start of it, from the  start of his school life to like the very last things that he was working on and writing  before he unfortunately was taken from us so young.  And every page of it is like you can't turn to a single page that doesn't like just draw  you in.  Like here is like, for instance, here is like you'll recognize the image writer printing.  This is some of his first draft from so long.  And thanks for all the fish.  A lot of this stuff, if you're a writer, is so ennobling and empowering because a lot  of this is like note cards he would write to himself.  Notebooks where there is a on a shelf over there is a box of like beautiful like and  different like spiral notebooks that I bought like when traveling.  Here's a Japanese, I'm in Japan, so hey, there's a stationery store.  Ooh, that's a beautiful like little notebook that would be perfect for me to write in.  And like I've got like a dozen of them where the first three pages are filled in, the rest  are blank.  And he showed, in the book shows us a lot of that stuff.  A lot of the stuff like the vomit drafts of some of his books are not just like where  you see the story taking shape as he's writing it, but he's also writing notes to himself  and like both encouraging himself and also sort of like scolding himself saying, and  then, oh God, I don't know what happens.  Like maybe they wind up at Lord's Cricket's Ground or something, maybe something better  than that.  But anyway, the whole thing, the only point of this is that we get them from here to there.  And it's like, oh my God, he suffered.  We know from his problems with deadlines, oh, he suffered not more than his editors  did, but he absolutely suffered.  But man, it is such an insight into not only the course that his life took, but also the  details of like how all of that went, what he was feeling and what he was thinking all  the time.  And there's a whole section of just like letters to Douglas Adams from like Neil Gaiman and  Margot Buchanan, Stephen Fry, Robbie Stam, people who knew him and like wish they could  like talk to him again.  And it's just such a, I mean, this isn't like a cheap sort of production.  The pages are nice and thick, you know, it's going to, it's as though they know that this  is going to like wind up like on sofas, in beds, anywhere but like safe on a bookshelf.

Transcript:  This is from the publisher Unbound.  Will Harris, who you've heard many times on our shows, this is his new project.  He's become a book publisher and they publish really interesting, unusual books like this,  42, The Wildly Improbable Ideas of Douglas Adams.  Will told us about this.  The editor, by the way, Kevin John Davies is being widely praised for his good sense  in the stuff that he picked, the stuff that he decided to not include in a treasure trove  of Douglas Adams content.  And people were very excited about this.  So how did you get it?  Because it says here it doesn't come out until September 19th.  How did you get a copy?

Transcript:  I backed the Kickstarter.  It's one of the great things about backing books on Kickstarter where I got an email  saying, oh God, a piece of spam saying, oh, your UPS package has been delivered.  Nice try.  I'm not going to click on that link.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's right.  I did order this like a year and a half ago.  But yeah, I mean, I could, I, I, there's, I just could not be happier with this.  And a lot of, a lot of this is a, I'm not going to go into it over and over again, but  like one, just one page is one of my favorite pieces he did was his last chance to see book,  which I think is one of the best things he wrote was when he undertook like an expedition  all over the world to, to find some of the most endangered species on the planet.  One page is, I mean, if you're a fan of Douglas Adams, you've already read the book, but  here is like his own, the typewritten page he made to himself of everything that he was  packing.  And here is the letter that he wrote to the BBC saying, hi, I've been given a $500,000  advance, but it's not enough to fund the expedition.  Do you want to send like maybe a sound record to send a photographer and we can make this  into a BBC series.  And they said, yes, we would very much like that.  It's just like, it really is just like saying, oh, by the way, here's a trunk full of papers  from both Douglas Adams.  Feel free to rummage through it.  And it's like, oh, I think I would like to do that.  Yeah.

These are nerdy volumes that you could go to a crowdfunding site and get people to support  the publishing of it.  And Will's done a great job.  They have, he sent me, I hope he'll send me this one.  He sent me a stack of them like F yeah, video games, the life and extra lives of a professional  nerd or taming gaming by Andy Robertson or shareware heroes.  But my favorite, I think is, is this things I learned from Mario's butt.  It's a pictures of buttocks from, from video games.  That's, that's the, that's so you could, you know, you could see going to Simon Schuster  and pitching this and them saying, uh, no, but no, to Will Harris credit.

Start time: 6507.27
End time: 6700.00
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So I, the book, the book that I'm going to recommend, I, I go to a bookstore probably  once or twice a month.  Um, there is a bookstore in Berkeley called builders builders bookstore.  Yeah.  That's famous.  Yeah.  It's my favorite bookstore.  Yeah.  And it's just design stuff.  So it's design architecture, some cooking, some, you know, garden design, but it has,  it has all these technical manuals on the back and it's still surviving.  Still, you know, there's still five or six people every time you walk into the tiny little  store and on fourth street and I go in and I take my kids.  So I go in with the kids and the rule is they can buy any book they want.  And I allow myself to buy a book when I'm there.  And that's the only time I buy physical books.  And, um, uh, and I keep on buying the same, the book, different books from the same person.  And I thought I should probably recommend it because I don't buy a lot of books.  Um, and it, it's a series.  The one that I'm, that I put in here was 101 things I learned in product design school.  Um, and it's kind of like really short.  Like it's not, this isn't like a big heavy.  So I, I have these books laying around and I open one of them every morning to think  about it.  So it's kind of like my little pattern of I get up in the morning and I read one that  might say, um, shapes are loaded or elegance is the opposite of extravagant extravagance.  And then there's a bunch of like, you know, there's a description, you know, so like one  of them might be design is a physical act.  Design requires deep reflection, but one cannot design.  Um, but one cannot design in purely cognitive thinking mode.  Active doing helps us figure out what it, what the thing is about.  Right.  Anyway, just it.  So what happened is this guy, Matt Matthew Frederick is all these 101 things I learned  about something, right.  And he's like 10 of these or 15 of these books and they're about architecture, psychology,  um, you know, all kinds of different culinary school.  And what I love is they've just distilled these ideas down into something that doesn't take  a lot of time, but I can open it up.  It's their independent thoughts that are, that I can open up and kind of, I wouldn't  say meditate on, but, but I, I usually read the one, whatever I read, I read right before  I make breakfast, which takes a little time because I like making breakfast.  So, um, uh, and I just love these books.  Um, and so they're about, you know, they're like 10 bucks on Kindle, but I don't, I wouldn't  recommend getting them on Kindle because I've realized I don't read them when they're on  my, on Kindle.  I read them when they're stacked on my desk.  So, so there's something about that, that I bought a couple of them on Kindle and I  ended up rebuying them on, uh, in there's something about them sitting here and me picking  one up and just opening it up while I'm, you know, when I'm just getting ready.  Can I get, I get up about four.  So I get up and I, and I open it up while I'm just getting things started to set up before  I go do other things.  And I just find there's something about them that are, it's really, really, it's really  inspiring, you know?  So I, I just, uh, I know that it's, it seems simple at first.  I thought they were kind of junk books, you know, like, oh, it's just kind of, you got  a bunch of cute, but what he's done is he partners with, you know, it's always like  he partners with people who are in that industry and then they try to figure out how to distill  things down as best I can tell.  It's not like I've ever talked to him or I don't know the guy.  Um, but I just, that's what it feels like.  He, he like works with some of the industry and tries to distill things to think about  and it doesn't just affect product design.  It just helps you think about those things.

Start time: 6700.16
End time: 6718.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, he's done this longer than we've been doing, uh, twit since 2007.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, architecture school, film school, engineering school, 101 things I learned in product design  school, Matthew Frederick.  What a great idea.  He's got culinary school.  School.  I mean, business.

Start time: 6718.12

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And it's all things that apply to life.  I wouldn't look at it like, oh, I'm going to architecture.  I should do this.  It's just, it's distilled thoughts, like individual thoughts into something.  There's always this, I wrote you a long letter because I didn't have time to write you a  short one.  Well, he took the time to write 101 short ones for each one of these things, um, and  distill like ideas.  And when I looked at the film, I can't remember what a specific one from film school and I  don't have that book right within arms.  Like, but I was like, yeah, these are all great.  I guess someone who, when he's in an area that I know, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's the reason I buy them from there specifically because I want them from Amazon.  The distinction is, is that it's curated in a way that I can browse great books.  Right.  There's, there's a 50% chance I'll like almost every book that's in that bookstore.  And I wouldn't just find it searching the web, you know, or searching Amazon or knowing,  like if I want to, I go there to, to explore books.  Um, and, uh, and so, and I take my kids there to explore books and I think it's important  that we keep on bookstore.  I don't think that every bookstore has to stay, stay in business, but I think bookstores  like that, um, that are very carefully curated, I think we need to support.  So if you're in the Bay area, you should go to the builder's bookstore and fourth streets  right next to the Apple store and, uh, and, uh, and buy a book.

But nothing, nothing.  We're going to go, Oh my God.  Can you believe it?  I think I'm looking, I mean, what I'm looking forward to is the details of, especially if  they do that periscope camera.  Like how do they brand that?  How do they describe that?  What is the interface?  What are the little apple touches that make that different from what we've seen elsewhere?
