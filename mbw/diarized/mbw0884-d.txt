End time: 289.03
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  First of all, I'm shocked.  Shocked, I tell you, that Apple used the word lust in a sentence.  Wonderlust is what the desire to travel.  It's wanderlust.

End time: 344.90
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, just another marketing tag to let us spin our wheels for another couple of weeks.  But yeah, the idea here is that we're going to get that iPhone event and it's going to  happen like Mark Gurman said, and iPhone and Apple watch.  And who knows if there'll be anything other than that.  I guess we'll get spoiled about all that in the next couple of weeks because this is when  the rumors really start flying.

Transcript:  Here's the movie that Apple will be playing on the stage.  Tim Cook's going to come out and say, good morning.  We'd like to show you a movie about a preacher in love with the sunshine schizophrenic.  That would be funny, but not for very long.  So they are going to announce what Jason?

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  iPhone Apple watch, maybe other things related to those.  If you think about it, the Apple watch is kind of the ultimate iPhone accessory, but  you know, they'll they'll have a new set of accessories and maybe maybe it'll be an AirPods  thing or not.  I don't know, but like it would not be a bad time for that.  Maybe they could do a reset on some of their services.  It is the thing I always think about the iPhone event is that it is Apple's most watched event  of the year.  It is it is the most popular product.  And so people pay attention, which not only means that they'll talk about the new iPhone,  but they're going to talk about other stuff that they want to get in front of people's  eyes.  So whatever that might be, this is your chance to get out in front of the biggest audience  you get in a year.  And all of us who work in media around Apple know that this is the one that has the biggest  audience.  Like people are interested in the iPhone.  So new new high end iPhone is the rumor, right?  We've been talking about it all summer.  Titanium instead of stainless steel, which is great because stainless steel is really  heavy.  And so these should be lighter phones, you know, change the colors.  A lot of rumors about camera upgrades, USB-C. There's a bunch of stuff that they're throwing  in here.  So this is potentially a the most appreciable iPhone change in the next or in the last like  two or three years.

Start time: 464.98
End time: 503.37
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, particularly for camera fans.  And also there's we're still hearing rumors left and right about maybe this we're going  to see a price increase, at least on the pros that some people aren't going to like.  Who knows?  But we'll find out in a couple of weeks anyway.  But I'm keen to say Apple is probably one of the few companies that can get get by with  saying, you know what, we have decided to jack up the price of our very, very tippity  most phones by another, let's say, one hundred dollars because, A, we know that people can  absorb it and B, if it puts some distance between the pros and the more affordable ones,  it will make the more affordable ones seem like budget phones.  And that's right up our alley, too.

Start time: 504.32
End time: 546.28
Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I'm also curious, the whole ecosystem of lightning devices that are still out there, like the  MagSafe Duo, Apple's MagSafe battery pack, all the AirPods cases and even AirPods Max.  How many of those will actually see switch to USB-C along with the phone?  I think AirPods, at least it might be a case update, even if they don't release new versions  of it, they might say now shipping with USB-C or you can buy a USB-C case.  But things like the MagSafe Duo, I think is long due for a refresh.  I use it still sometimes, but like even with the Apple Watch, it's a little janky.  You know, you can't really have the little Apple Watch charger all the way up in 90 degrees  because the Apple Watch is too big.  So curious how they're going to refresh those different devices to match USB-C alongside  the Apple 15.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 546.34
End time: 562.36
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I wonder if they're going to have a new...  They already have like a USB-C to lightning cable, but I wonder if they're going to do  like a dongle like when they've replaced the coin slot, the standard iPod connector with lightning.

Start time: 562.44
End time: 575.83
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do they need to though?  I mean, I think actually in some ways it's good Apple says, but don't worry, all those  lightning cables and accessories you bought will still be useful for charging your AirPods.  So there's that.  Yeah.

Start time: 576.56
End time: 594.69
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Congratulations.  We don't know that the Apple could come out and say, our customers love the lightning  cable and we're happy to announce that you can still carry one with you wherever you  go because the lightning...  Because your AirPods won't be able to charge with USB-C.  Is that the only thing left?

Start time: 595.36

Transcript:  All the Mac accessories, trackpad and mouse and keyboard are all lightning.

Start time: 604.24
End time: 610.57
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And aren't there some earlier, like cheaper iPads that are still lightning?  Sure.  Yeah.

Start time: 611.28
End time: 637.27
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  That haven't been updated.  I think there are...  Are there iPads?  The iPads...  Yeah, there's like the previous generation iPad, I think, that's still kicking out there.  But they've been turning over a lot of their products for a while now, but yeah, this is  why a lot of us say there are rumors that the iMac is going to finally get an M3 this  fall.  It seems like the right time for them to refresh their keyboard and mouse and trackpad so that  they don't charge on lightning and we can just clear lightning out of the entire product  line.

Start time: 637.96
End time: 650.81
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  But this even makes a good point that I wonder how many features this USB-C connector are  going to have.  It would be wonderful if it were Thunderbolt, like on the iPad Pros.  You might wonder...

Start time: 651.20
End time: 654.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's expensive though.  The licensing for Thunderbolt is expensive.  I don't see Apple doing that.

Start time: 655.06
End time: 701.71
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It's expensive.  I mean, they could put it on the Pros, especially if they say, hey, look how big the video files  that we're creating with our new wonderful high definition stuff are.  It would be incredible if they use that connector to also do things like, guess what?  You can also connect video directly to the bottom of the device.  Again, but this would be another reason to say here's why the iPhone...  The Pro line is a very, very special, rarefied sort of device.  It does things that are for people who just want the phone that has absolutely everything  in it, even if it doesn't necessarily make sense.  I don't think you're going to see a second screen capability on an iPhone ever, but it  would be interesting to see if they decide to put lightning on it, what they would allow  that port to do.

Start time: 703.46
End time: 741.57
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Or Thunderbolt.  Yeah, that's the...  I'm sorry, Thunderbolt.  That's the question.  I don't know.  I mean, I think that it's not a high percentage chance, but how do you define Pro?  They've already got Stage Manager on the iPad.  Would they ever think, yeah, it's Pro.  If you want to plug that Thunderbolt into a display, you get basically like Stage Manager,  like it's an iPad, and you can work on that if you want to.  I doubt they'll do that.  I think they want you to buy an iPad or a Mac to do that.  You do think that they've got to be running through all the ideas of how do we define  a Pro feature?  What are the things that we can put in this phone to justify its higher price and potentially  its higher, higher price?

Transcript:  I'm on the Apple website with the little dissolving Apple on my iPhone.  How do I do the VR with this?  Can I make the Apple appear dissolving in my...  I don't think there's an AR feature this year.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they've done that before.  I think that the idea is that they're streaming.  That's for the stream, right?  There are two invitations, right?  There's the invitation to come to Apple Park and there's the invitation to watch the stream

End time: 859.99
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't even watch the stream, Laporte.  Well, I don't care.  I'm going to do it anyway.  September 12th, which is a Tuesday, right?  10 a.m. Pacific time.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  He was invited for a little while, but then he wasn't.  You know, Apple's, I will say this about that event.  That event is at the Steve Jobs Theater and it's got a pretty decent capacity.  Again, the iPhone event is the biggest event and it's also the most international event.  They invite media from all over the world to come to that event.  There's a lot of broadcast media that comes to that event.  It is the toughest of all of the tickets when there's an event at Apple Park because of  the interest in the iPhone and they do make a real effort to get people there from all  over the world.  And so it's always the one where you see people getting, you know, some people get invited  and some people don't.  And then like people sneak in later when other people are dropping out.  And it is a it's a tough ticket.  It's like, you know, any any tough ticket for a concert or something like that.  It you can tell it they're not as free with the invitations as they are for something  like a Mac event, certainly, or even WBC where they've got a lot of.

Start time: 1005.10
End time: 1103.24
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  But but Jason raises a good point.  It's like there's there's been a shift like in the past five or 10 years  where it's like most of the seats in that theater are for specific purposes,  so to speak, where it's not that, hey, we're going to get the if we've got  500 invites to give to the press, we're going to get the 500  most influential members of the press, the 500 members of the press  with the largest audience.  There's going to be some seats that we want to fill because they are.  They have their YouTubers with really huge audiences.  They are somewhere going to fill because they work for newspapers  and journalistic outposts of record somewhere.  This is part of the this is part of the marketing that we're not really reaching.  And we want to make sure we reach out to this part of the market  or this part of the country  and people who just have a really good relationship with Apple.  And that's a very and that's a that's not meant as a sucky upy sort of thing.  It means that they just they're very, very good at, you know,  here's what I would like.  Here's what I need.  If this is available, this would be great.  And so if and if it turns out that there are seats available,  then this person who you may not have heard of and you don't think, goodness,  this person doesn't have much of an audience.  That's how they that's how they get in because they are very,  very good at doing their job, which is to if there's a seat there,  I want to try to get in there.  And so that's why they sort of keep tugging at the ear and that sort of thing.  So it's not so there.  I mean, what Jason could probably remember, there was like  who was it was that was tracking like they're they're  maintaining a chart of who got invited, who didn't get invited,  who got early hardware, who did not get early hardware.  And it's like, oh, jeez.  I mean, this is high school was a long time ago,  but I don't want to do that again.

Start time: 1103.50
End time: 1147.96
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And their ways are mysterious.  I mean, there are different PR groups and different marketing groups.  And they have they all have different reasons.  This has always been the case, dating back to the early days of Steve Jobs.  Sometimes people get invitations and you're like, why?  And other people don't. You're like, huh?  And that's just, you know, they have different,  different allotments for different things.  And so you'll have like print journalists and broadcast journalists  and YouTubers and podcasters and like everybody's in a different slot.  And then international PR, which is not domestic PR.  And then there's the VIPs and the analysts and anybody  who's mentioned in the keynote and like all of those things go into it.  It is it is complicated.  And like I said, this is the toughest ticket.

Start time: 1148.50
End time: 1163.96
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And they also include some seats, I think, still for engineers,  people who are working, who are working the crunch hours.  It's it's it's a sort of thank you very much for working so hard  to get this through the door.  We're getting you a seat at the at the at the event  so that you can be there when we show off all the Apple people

Start time: 1164.00
End time: 1202.06
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  sit in front, Jason, and then general VIPs and the Apple people sit in front.  Although now that they don't show that they're just showing a video.  I think maybe the rules are a little bit different.  Like, do you need to be in the theater  to show your product off when nobody's going to see it?  Because nobody's actually watching the theater.  They're just watching the video on the screen.  Maybe. But the rule.  So it's a little bit different because you're not part of the show  when you're there. But it used to be they would stack up  Apple employees and VIPs in down at the bottom by the stage.  And there were the ones who you could actually there was no applause sign.  You could tell when they were expected to applaud  in order to create that kind of like a momentary audience feel.

Start time: 1202.16

Start time: 1206.84
End time: 1218.84
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  No, by the end, the applause has happened before the applause line.  It was really like by the end of their live events,  they were really pumping that up to a point where I thought they went too far.

Start time: 1223.56
End time: 1250.01
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko

I often speculate about remember that the Steve Jobs Theater was purpose  built for like media events like these, just like the Coliseum was meant for  for Brits and Britain Circuses.  Like I do you does anybody think there's a zero percent chance  that part of the air conditioning system is the ability to put more oxygen  into the room when they feel the event should have as much oxygen  in the room as possible?

We know everything there is to know at this point about the iPhone 15,  although there was an interesting story from  Guomingji, as Renee Richie likes to call him, Ming-Chi Kuo,  that Apple is already shipping in vast quantities  the iPhone 15 Pro Max, like it's on the boat on its way here.

Transcript:  This is there was a rumor that Sony couldn't supply camera parts fast enough.  Right. And so that it was going to be one of those things where the  the main phone was going to be available in two weeks or next week.  But the other phone was going to be in October or something like that.  And it means you quote is super reliable supply chain guy.  And he's like, no, they're making lots of them.  So that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be limited supply  and that you might get backordered.  But it does sound like it's not going to be one of those.  We don't have them for a month kind of things.

Transcript:  It may be. Kuo writes the market.  And I'm reading a translation from Apple Insider, your publication, Stephen.  The market is concerned that iPhone 15 shipments will be further cut  due to supply chain issues.  My estimate of 80 million units versus conservative views  of 70 to 80 million units, especially the iPhone 15 Pro Max  shipments will be delayed.  However, the fact is the iPhone 15 Pro Max will start mass shipments this week.  And that is this week.  And Apple is also increasing shipments of legacy models simultaneously.  So no, there sounds like probably, you know,  there won't be a shortage on any of the 15s and even some of the older ones.

Transcript:  It does seem like, though, this is one of the years where the Pro Max  is going to be a different camera than the Pro model.  And I think the last time this happened was the iPhone 12.  It's been parity on the 13 and 14, but it seems like maybe that periscope  camera is going to be reserved just for the larger size because physics  and engineering.  And so even if it's available at the same time, I don't know.  I'm curious to see. I think it's going to be a different year  for the pro and pro max cameras.

Transcript:  Yeah, but it's it's OK because this is one.  It's I think we're always going to be debating.  What does the word pro mean?  What does the word Max mean?  I mean, what does it signify?  I think they've spent enough time establishing this as, no,  this is not necessarily like the phone for the masses.  This is designed to be the most expensive phone that we make.  And we're asked to compute other companies make super expensive phones  because they have folding screens.  We are putting, I don't know, Cupertino, Elfin Magic into ours,  Whiffledust on top of every pixel.  And so long as they can back it up, the Apple,  you know, the Apple market is such that there are people who that will  that will not think twice about spending an extra two hundred dollars  to have the very best version of the iPhone that they can get.  And I mean, I don't think Apple is a company  such a style driven company that they're not going to give you  exclusive features that are going to be highly desirable.  But I think that their focus is always going to be on the real iPhone  is just is the iPhone nothing.  And we're going to give the best experiences to the people  who are going to be buying the most quantities of this specific phone.  It's the it's the top level pro models that allow us to really flex  and try out things that we're not going to be able to put into mass market phones  for another couple of years yet. Yeah.

Transcript:  I don't believe I believe that.  I think they like the dynamic island and that it's a feature  and that they'll put it everywhere because it's a nice it's  it's not just a way to get around cutouts on your screen,  but it's also kind of the modern iPhone equivalent of the status bar,  the menu bar on the Mac.  It's a good, useful place to put information.  Every time I use I travel, I use flighty, which is a travel tracking app.  And it uses the dynamic island to put up like when your flight's leaving  and what what gate it's at.  And like it's really great.  So I think it's going to be everywhere.  I think I think they like it.  And it's a it's one of these like the notch was before.  But it's like an identifying feature of the iPhone that makes you go.  That's an iPhone.  So I think it'll be everywhere.

Well, now it actually gives you some of that progress as like a live activity,  which I thought was pretty cool.  So it's been a year, but I think we're going to see more apps  start using it to better effect.

Transcript:  Yeah, Google, there's a there's a rumor that Google is actually going to have  their live activities ready in time for the iPhone 15, which is good.  I mean, it really is one of the most in the history of Apple.  I think it's one of the most brilliant user interface elements they've ever done.  And it's and it's almost it's almost incidental that it solves a big problem,  which is, oh, gosh, we won't be we won't be able to get the bezels we want  unless we have we've mastered this sort of under display camera  and sensor technology, which is not really working great  as far as every parts manufacturer that I've heard of  that's trying to do like under display fingerprint sensors, under display cameras,  under display FLIR and that sort of stuff.  And they've taken it just basically made this entire thing  just an obsolete question because it's not just a  it's not just a workaround or a hack.  It really is just it's almost as if that's the way they designed that thing to be  from the very, very beginning.  It's it is it is exactly the sort of elegance  that and fascinating user face elements  that you kind of want to see from Apple.  You know, they're not being stagnant.  They they're proves that they're still thinking and they're still coming up with great ideas.

Transcript:  Is one of the issues Apple faces the  that people aren't really upgrading as much as they used to. Is it?  I mean, is it on is the burden on Apple to put something in every new phone  that makes even the previous year's phone owners say, oh, I really want that.

Start time: 1652.28
End time: 1732.06
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that's the burden.  I think the cycle is really widened. Right.  So it's going to be people, most people, maybe not people who watch the show,  but most people don't buy a new phone every year or every two years.  It's like three years or four years as the smartphone matures.  That gets wider and wider.  So it's incumbent on Apple to keep iterating and keep improving.  But they are, I think, selling for somebody who's got a three year old phone  and a four year old phone.  And, you know, there is some degree of like one or two year old phones  where they're doing a return and then they are reselling that phone on  because their goal is to keep expanding the install base.  But realistically, you know, when you're buying,  most people who buy the brand new phone are going to be people who are buying it  not just for this year's features, but also for that last year's features  and probably the years before features.  And it's always important to keep that in mind.  Like, it's really like so you've got an iPhone 11  and you want a new iPhone.  Here's all the things you're going to get.  And then you have to detail 12 and 13 and 14 and 15.  And what are all the features of all of those in order to to do it?  Because it's just yeah, it's very rare that somebody,  unless you're on an annual plan, in which case you're locked in,  you're buying one regardless of what's in it.  It's all about that cumulative effect because the cycle is way longer than it used to be.

Start time: 1732.52
End time: 1781.84
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't think it's terribly unlike the way that automakers  have to keep tweaking the design of an established car year after year after year.  They have to make sure that they know that they know that there are very few car  maker car buyers that are going to be trading in a car every single year.  But the thing is, if they if they get to 50, 60, 70 thousand miles,  they want to trade in for a new model and they're good enough customers.  They want the new version of this.  They you'd better not be giving them the exact same body style.  You'd better not be giving them the same interior because these things  actually matter when it comes to keeping people excited about your brand.  So it's not it's not as though Apple is going to do nothing.  But hey, look, our chamfered edges are a little bit rounder this year.  Isn't that exciting?  But the people who are coming in after another two or three years  have to absolutely think that this is a fresh brand new phone as opposed to, hey,  I'm just going to go to Best Buy and just get something used.

Start time: 1782.28
End time: 1809.75
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that comes down really to the camera for the most part, right?  I don't even think the fact that it's got a three nanometer processor in it,  which which the higher end ones will probably will be the kind of thing  that anybody will know in the real world except us.  Right. It's the camera and the periscope is the biggest.  That gives us what a super zoom like.  I mean, I have that on my Samsung is 23 Ultra.  That's a 200 X digital, a 10 X optical zoom.  That's the periscope.

Start time: 1810.76
End time: 1873.17
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a game changer.  When you can extend the range of the optical zoom, that's I mean,  that's that's when you start using this thing as a real camera  as opposed to a feature of your phone.  And so it's a long, long time coming up.  But I wouldn't necessarily necessarily say that Apple has been behind  Samsung and Google in terms of their phone hardware.  But, oh, you can really see the difference when you if you spend  if you spend a couple of weeks using the latest iPhone  and then spend the late a couple of weeks using the  the latest flagship phone from Samsung or Google.  Gee, why is it that like my phones are my phone?  This new phone's cameras are so much clearer and so much sharper.  And I don't have to use crappy like digital zoom effects.  It's actually shooting.  It's shooting better videos, it's shooting better everything  because clever computational tricks are wonderful.  And they're an important part of mobile photography.  But you start off with how good of an optical process are you getting?  And you can't really trump anybody who's got better optics  than a better sensor than you've got.

Transcript:  I actually can't wait.  There were some rumors about the iPhone 16 because why not talk about the iPhone  16 when the 15 is just now getting launched?  But the rumor was that the ultra wide lens would get 48 megapixels.  And that's going to be exciting for the macro photography,  which already is amazing, you know, on the 14 Pro.  But I think that'll be pretty cool next year when we talk about the iPhone 16.

Transcript:  Yeah, those are the cool things we're seeing, like astrophotography,  which was not possible a generation ago.  Really great macro photography, which was not possible like a generation ago.  That's the sort of stuff that keeps you like loyal to a phone maker.  If they give you everything, you can use all the same apps,  all the same user interface.  You've got the dynamic island you liked so much in the last phone.  But now, oh, my God, this does things that have that.  This does things for photography that I could not possibly even think about doing  for the past two and a half years since I've had this this older phone.  That's what keeps you into that ecosystem.

Note those two people in the middle at the distance.  I'm going to zoom in a little bit more on them.  At some point, it's going to go.  I think this is still optical.  At some point, it's going to go digital.  Maybe that that might be digital.  It's pretty good digital.  I'm getting closer and that's clearly digital because it's not the quality is  not very good, but boy, that you can that is a huge zoom and you can see how people  might get and by the way, the image quality is very, very good.  I mean, they also use the Sony  sensors, I believe.

That's not the purpose of the people who are designing the phone color itself.  But I would just love to see just one freak color and the color way, just one.

One of the dumbest things I bought  chronically is as an actual like Google Nexus Q,  which is that streaming their first streaming device.  Did that ever ship?  No. As a matter of fact, everybody who pre-ordered one,  like it was they who if their pre-order was accepted at some point, Google said,  you know what, we're refunding your money.  And when you receive it, you can keep it.  We just want to forget this ever happened.  And I can get these like if you're patient, like in the box for about thirty dollars.  And it's just an interesting object.  And when you when you plug it in, there's like a little there's like a ring of LEDs  that light up and yeah, this is this is this is why like I can't I can't get into  collecting like old Apple twos and like old Macs, because at some point it's like,  wow, those are really, really big.  And I've got not a whole lot of room and leaky capacitors and traces that die.  And then you have to figure out why they're not working.  Whereas when you buy like a really cool  iPod shuffle and it's just you put this in a line with all the other little iPods.  And someone is saying that thing that is not clear, that is clearly not an iPod.  Oh, yes. The thing that's the size of a stick, a dentine gum.  Oh, yes. That was back before Bluetooth streaming was a thing back before the  Apple Watch was a thing, Apple had to contend with fitness people by giving them  the tiniest and tiniest iPod that could ever exist.

Where are people going to be talking about the event live as it happens?  Because it feels like Threads is still not great for that live interaction as it happens.

Transcript:  So I so I've been looking for the invitation, right?  Found plenty of them on Twitter.  Went to Threads, not one image of the invitation, not even one mention of it.  So Threads, I don't think so.  Went to Blue Sky.  Nope.  I think it's going to have to stay at X because  for whatever reason, Jason, did you post your invitation anywhere?

Transcript:  I haven't. No.  And I don't know where I would put it at this point to Stephen's point.  Like, yeah, where would you put it?  It's everywhere, too.  I just sometimes I think all the breathless like, oh, Apple did an invitation  for an event thing is not it's just I'm not looking at threads.  I don't know that it's happening.

Transcript:  is made for that. Here's from Neelai Patel, Reckless, Joanna Stern.  Oh, you know, so Neelai got the RSVP, right?  Joanna has cut off the bottom, so we don't know.  She got invited, I think, right.  But why would she she cut off the bottom?  She didn't want anybody to know what invitation she got.  So those are the two.  And you said you posted to there's Carolina.  Carolina, by the way, Melanese, not only is going to the Steve Jobs Theater,  she gets invited. I don't know how she's also going to the surface event  two weeks later in New York City.  She got invited to that, too.  Please note invitations are not transferable.  On the analyst list.  Oh, she's an analyst.  I guess podcasters don't count.  Marquez Brownlee, join us in person.  This is a subtle little subtle little way of saying who you are in the world.  When you put the bottom part on, join us in person or see it online.  Hmm. Hmm.  So there are a few people. I guess I didn't go deep enough.  They had moved on by the time I checked threads.  This is threads.

I know Neil, Patel was talking about during that first Republican debate.  He went on threads and really saw nothing related to that event as it was happening.  And so, again, it seems like for live events, I mean, threads got to change

It was exciting for a couple of weeks.  And then everyone just kind of was like got bored with it.  I think the algorithm wasn't surfacing when people wanted to see fast enough.  And either they went back to X or just nothing.  And so but I still find engagement there on X.

And it's probably going to be the pro.  I don't like the big phone at all.  So it would probably be the pro, though,  depending on what the specs are with that camera and the screen.  And if I can get by with the fewer cameras but still have Dynamic Island,  maybe I would go to the cheaper model.  And it's also my wife's  phone buying cycle right now.  She's been holding on.  And so she's going to get a fresh new iPhone 15, I think, too.  So, yeah, it's going to be an expensive fall again.  What else is new? What else is new?

Transcript:  No, I know.  I've well not yet.  My my my Pixel 6 Pro is still a long nice.  I might be eligible for a new phone,  meaning like my my interior my interior  accountant might allow me to buy a new phone like next year, the year after that.  And as usual, as always,  switching to an iPhone is going to be absolutely in the cards  if they do something that is more exciting and more viable to me than whatever  the latest Pixel phone is.  But for now, I mean, I'm the most important feature.  The two most important features for me on a phone  happen to be storage so I can put whatever media I want on this and  whatever apps I want and not have to care and camera.  And now that Adobe Lightroom mobile is so freaking good,  it's like I still think the pixels, the pixels cameras are  at least as good as anything that Apple is doing.  But then when you throw in like on either platform, well,  however good the phone is, the phone's camera is the ability to drop it  into Lightroom and then 30 seconds later have it tweaked exactly the way you like  it and so good that you can then say, hey, I think I'll enter that in that photo  competition that I just read about last week.  Really, for me, it upended a lot of a lot of the thought process of buying a phone  used to be best camera wins. Now it's like, no, so long as all three Samsung  they're all pretty close.  Yeah. Although I will say Samsung is always out of the running because every time  that I test out a Samsung phone, it's like how many Samsung accounts do I have  to sign up for to just use this damn phone?  It's like, oh, well, you need a Samsung account.  OK, you need a Samsung account for going to get updates.  OK, then you know, the Samsung account, if you're going to use like the fitness  stuff, OK, you need Samsung music and Samsung like, OK, what if I just don't  ever deal with you ever again?  Google Google's already got its hooks into me, so I don't think I'm losing  anything with the pixel. I trust Apple's are not losing anything by going with Apple.  If I if I were to get Samsung out of my life,  I think I could proceed forward on a very, very even keel.  Yeah, I agree.  I wish I would make a good folding, though, a folding phone, though.  Love the flip.

Transcript:  I mean, I can't I can't afford it.  Eighteen hundred dollars for a phone of any kind.  Oh, I know. Much less, much less, much less a screen that  it's part part of the marketing for that is that it's not just for people who can  afford an eighteen hundred dollar phone.  It's for people who can like a year, a year and two months after they buy it,  see like a really bad scratch on it or see some sort of wrinkle in the hinge part  of it of the screen and not really care about it because, hey,  I'll just buy a new one or I'll just get the screen replaced.  It's like I'm a five year person when it comes to a phone,  ideally, that I can I can sit out for five years if necessary.  And if I if I possibly can, because I don't I don't have twelve hundred dollars a year  to spend on an iPhone subscription.  So I try to get as much use of these things as I can.

Transcript:  Sunday, we had the great Jason Kebler on.  He, of course, was editor in chief of Motherboard Advice for a long time.  Vice has had some financial difficulties.  He and three of his other superstar  reporters have formed their own little company called 404 Media at 404 Media.  Dot co. But Jason, we we'd actually talked to him some years ago.  It's always been a right to repair.  I don't know if advocates right because he's a reporter,  but he's always covered that right to repair story from 404 Media.  Co. We're winning in quotes.  Apple formally endorses the right to repair legislation after spending millions fighting it.  He got access to a letter  to lobbyists.  Actually, it was a letter to Senator Eggman, if that's his real name.  No, her name is Kukuku.  Kukuku.  So Susan Eggman, the sponsor of the bill,  Apple writes in support of SB 244 and urges members of the California  legislature to pass the bill as currently drafted.  Hmm.  We support SB 244.  Apple goes on to say because it includes  requirements that protect individual users safety and security.  This was one of Apple's concerns was, well, if you repair yourself, what happens  to the, you know, the locked enclave and so forth, as well as the product  manufacturers, intellectual property will continue to support the bill.  So long as it continues to provide protections for customers and innovators.  I guess Apple finally found is it that Apple finally found a bill they could  support or they finally saw the writing on the wall and said, all right,  can't be both.

Start time: 3432.95
End time: 3486.26
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's what's going on here.  I wonder if behind the scenes there was some talk of like people were either  hesitant to vote on it, who are very pro business and were like, I don't I'm not  going to be Apple's not going to like this.  And so I don't like it.  Who and then the authors of the bill are like, let's reassure you that Apple's OK  with it. Or if somebody was trying to amend it to do something that Apple  didn't like. And so Apple decided to have this moment to swoop in and say, no, no,  this is the law we like.  Do this. This is the one we like.  I think they know that this sort of thing is coming.  In fact, they've built a whole infrastructure with their repair  programs to support it.  I think the last thing they want is legislation that breaks some part of the  process they've already set in place.  So something probably prompted this letter to be put in the record.  Right. Like a threat from somewhere or somebody who needed to be reassured that  Apple was OK with it as it was.

Start time: 3486.48
End time: 3516.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they may have seen the writing on the wall.  It passed in the Senate, the California Senate, 38 to nothing.  So but the assembly still has to vote with Apple's support.  It probably will pass.  And as a number of people have pointed out, if as California goes, so goes the  nation, even though there was a bill in New York that was kind of stripped of most  of its guts last year, this is going to be it.  This means ultimately a total victory for right to repair.

Start time: 3517.46
End time: 3626.82
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. And also the the the writing is on the wall internationally in the EU and  elsewhere. So if they were going to have to keep iPhone parts in stock and  available for for people to repair for the EU anyway, it's it behooves them to  say, well, OK, if we're going to have to maintain that new part of our business,  that part of our organization, keeping track and inventorying and maintaining  stockpiles of repair parts for third parties, we may as well.  It kind of changes the calculus.  And the California law isn't that draconian.  It's basic. It basically just says that  Apple for their part, like for iPhones, they would they would have to maintain a  supply of spare parts for iPhones available to third parties for three years after  they stop making them, I think three years.  And that's not that hard.  They've also seen how well this these programs have worked for other  companies working through I fix it, that they don't even necessarily have to deal  with these third parties directly.  I think that it was it was, as you say, it was a combination of them having lots  of conversations to make sure that they feel as though they've been heard by  legislators, seeing that this is not something that they can fight so they can  at least maintain a presence, a seat at the table and dictate it.  Excuse me. And being consulted about how this works and also realizing that the  world is not going to end because we are going to make screens and other kind of  sensors available. It's the question is always going to is  always going to be, though, how are they going to control access to software that  if you still have to code each one of these components before they get installed  and before they'll be admitted into the secure enclave of the device,  that remains to be seen.  But that seems to be something that they're going to have to do underneath  this California law anyway. But yeah, this is this is they had to they had to do  this at some point. It's the USBC of legislation.  And they were kind of foolish to fight it so hard for so long as they did.

Transcript:  The law says manufacturers will, quote,  have to make available on fair and reasonable terms to product owners,  service and repair facilities and service dealers the means as described to affect  the diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the product.  They have to make the same diagnostics tools and parts available to the public  as they make available to authorized repair professionals.  Apple says  that some of the things that we really wanted,  you know, I think Apple did see the writing on the wall.  But at the same time, they could save a little face by saying, well,  we got the assurances we wanted that the bill would not threaten consumer safety  and data security by requiring manufacturers allow repair providers  to disable device security features, many of which have been requested  by law enforcement agencies and required by law to thwart theft,  that they also will  require the repair providers disclose the use of non-genuine or used parts.  I think that's good.  And, you know, I think it's a win all around as, you know, finally some good.

We we congratulations consumers.  We just want a great victory on your behalf.  We fought we were not going to support  this law until your security and privacy were being protected.  And thanks to us, your friends, your two wacky hippies in the garage  with two point three trillion dollars in valuation decided to make this all happen.  And also, when you read it out,  realize that this is also the kind of the kind of weasel words that any large  company likes to see if they if if they they can and they can comply with this law  in a way that they think will work for them.  And if the consumers and EFF and other  organizations say, well, actually, no, you're not complying with this law at all.  Then congratulations.  Now we're off to two, three, four years of litigation that will lead to a  settlement as opposed to no, here is a line that you fail to know.  We felt as though our solution was very, very reasonable and very, very practical  and did extend the right to repair to people.  You disagree. But we will simply argue this out in court until an agency says,  look, we're sick of fighting this.  Give us a couple of hundred thousand dollars and some some free iPads for

And and they're in the middle in the green  raincoat is Senator Eggman, Cuckoo Coochoo.  Thank you, Senator.  I just want to say Cuckoo Coochoo again.

We knew that they'd booked most of them.  Now, Apple's projected to take 100 percent of their capacity.  And that's partly because Intel  delays and Intel's wafer needs are part of the problem.  I guess Intel's lack of orders, they're really not there yet.  So Apple said, well, well, you know, OK, we'll take that 10 percent.  Intel doesn't want we'll take them all.  How many more can you give us?

Yeah. So, yeah, this is cool.  This is what Apple does so very, very well.  It's not it's like it's sensing what their need is going to be and making sure  that they will be able to fulfill that need.  That's why Apple's one of the few companies that weren't affected as hard  by part shortages in the past few years, as almost every other company was,  because they had already secured procurement for every component  they're going to need for the next five years.

Transcript:  Which I do wonder, Mark Gurman said there's going to be an October event  as well this year if we could see an M3 or three nanometer process,  maybe in an iMac, which is still running the M1.  You know, that thing's been around for a couple of years now.  So it's possible we see it a couple of months.

Transcript:  I would I would love to see that.  There was somebody put this article in.  Thank you from 512pixels.net.  The case for and against Apple shipping a larger iMac.  We've talked about this before.  The current 20, what is it, 21 inch or 24 inch?  24 inch.  It's so small that it's really for consumers, not for prosumers.  And I kind of miss the larger one.  And there have been strong rumors that Apple is going to do 30 inch plus probably  next year, not this year.  You think maybe what do you think they'll announce, Stephen, in October?  It is certainly new iPads.  But do you think they'll have an M3 something?

Transcript:  Well, I wonder if it'll be iPads.  They'll probably be the base model iPad,  the 11th generation, because Gurman also said next year they're  going to revamp the Pro models. Right.  So I think maybe base model iPad.  I would love to see an iPad Mini with ProMotion.  That's a wish list item, but I would just love a Mini with ProMotion.  But I do think the DiMac is one of the longest in the tooth.  And if we do see maybe  I don't know if they'll update the MacBook Pro.  We just have the M2 Pro and M2 Macs over the summer with the MacBook Pro.  So maybe it's just an iPad, iMac and possibly some accessories,  maybe updated AirPods then.  Although it'd be strange to wait for that if USB-C is coming in September.  So I think mostly iMac and then a base model iPad with something else,  which I'm not sure for October.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's in the thinking of the 25th anniversary of the iMac,  sort of where does it go now and what Dan and what Stephen Hackett,  you know, write in their pieces is very much like, you know,  desktops aren't what they were, but they're still important to have.  The question is, are they so important to have that you have two different iMac  models or not?  Mark Gurman has said that they're working, but it's not clearly not a high priority.  I wonder if it's going to be like that 15 inch MacBook Air where they will sort  of do one eventually, but it's not going to be on the same cycle as the  revision of the 24 inch model to the M3, which we probably will see this fall.  I wonder when  the way it's gone, the base model chip is what we see first.  So if you see an M3, then that's a thing that they could put in an iPad Air.  They can put it in an iPad Pro, but they're also it could go in a Mac Mini,  but they've got the Pro chip now.  So maybe not there.  What's another product they have that only has the base model chip?  It's the MacBook Air.  Could it be that the MacBook Air would get their its revision this fall as well?  Because they probably won't have an M3 Pro, right this fall.  So the only Macs that they would be releasing this fall would be  the ones that only come in the base model.  So that's the that's the 24.  And I love the 24 inch iMac to have a Pro chip option too.  But again, if it's coming this fall, I just don't see it.

Transcript:  I always I always thought I would get an iMac as a family computer.  I have three kids and it always in my mind was going to be the ideal machine.  But even to this point, I have not had a reason to get it.  My kids have iPads.  And actually, that suffices now that Logic Pro X is on the iPad.  Like that was the one thing I would have  gotten a Mac for and even my oldest son who is making music is just using Logic  Pro X on his iPad. And so as a family computer device,  I don't know if that age has maybe passed.  But I do think there is a place, especially like doctor's offices or like  administrative types use cases where I do see iMacs all the time.  Typically, they're older iMacs because they just stay around forever.  But I do think eventually, you know, if it dies or, you know, new offices open up,  there's still some use cases like point of sale systems, maybe.  Although that's gone iPad, too.  But for me as myself, I do not see a personal need for an iMac anymore,  which is kind of sad. I love that computer.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's so personable.  And we were talking earlier about wanting to have really, really cool colors.  The iMac is the most colorific line that Apple makes.  It really is quite joyful.  All the different the range of bright, wonderful colors that they have.  But it's yeah, it's hard to it's hard to see a need specifically that the iMac  fills really, really well, because at that doctor's office, they've probably got  some sort of a record system that is probably based on Windows.  And plus, they probably want to instead of spending whatever Apple taxes  for this really cool, pretty looking iMac, they'd much rather just get whatever Dell  screen they've already gotten in the store room and whatever like little mini  mini Windows 11 box can actually run it.  Ditto for anybody who's who's buying lots of multiples of these devices.  If you're buying multiples of them,  then you're not buying that the person is going to be using them day in and day out  is not making the purchasing decision.  It's the person who's doing the budgets.  And whoever has whoever shows up at the  office or at their school room and finds this thing on their desk.  Congratulations, you are now a Windows user or you're now a user of whatever that is.  But one of the things that I'm still kind of.  On the fence about is, I wonder if Apple's  going to try to phase out the M1 on desktops, if they're going to at some point say  that the the difference between the M1 and the M2 is such that we want to make sure  that now that we've put an M1 in every single every single portable Mac and  desktop Mac, now's the time to the next big upgrades for all of those are going to  be making sure that the least sophisticated Apple silicon is going to be M2 across the board.  What do you does anybody think that that's  something that Apple would like to do or is it the M1 is still plenty powerful as  it is and they can always increase the speed of that ship and keep the same  architecture. But it's there's something about saying, oh, by the way, we've  upgraded the new MacBook Air same price and we've upgraded everybody to the new M2 chip.

Transcript:  It's the cook doctrine, as they call it, right, which is does do they benefit from  having that moment of of old product on priceless that's cheap and profitable?  And the M1 Air does have to go away at some point, right.  But it's the it's the old body.  It's presumably a lot cheaper to make than the M2 Air body is.  So, yeah, I I don't know.  I feel like the M1 will be around for a little while longer than longer than old  Macs who have been replaced have ever been before.  If that makes any sense, right.  Just that it has been so long,  but it's still so good and it lets them sell that MacBook Air at such a low price  that, you know, it's worth it's worth doing.  I wonder if the M2 will go away and the M1 will stay when they do the M3 Air.  I really do wonder because they've they've done stuff like that in the past  where they've sort of kept the interim or kept the old model around just to hit a  price point and then they keep updating the interim model.  But I would be happy if the M1s went away.  The question is, can they make the M2s cheap enough  that they can hit their price points, right?  Yeah.

Transcript:  I mean, the only big roadblock of the M1, I mean, it's fast enough,  but it's a bummer that you're always going to be stuck with just two displays.  It's like because if you're trying to get five or ten years out of a out of a out  of a Mac mini or out of a MacBook, there's going to be at least a period  or a project where you're going to say, oh, God, I really wish I knew I want two  displays, but I don't want one of the displays to be the built in MacBook  display and you can't do that because M1 is stuck with that.  And it's also stuck with the high speed lanes for Thunderbolt.

They both had that limitation, which I hope that M3 finally addresses,  because it's surprising how many people buy a laptop and expect to connect two  monitors to it. I think Apple, I think Apple initially just decided,  oh, that's an Intel feature. Nobody actually uses it.  We don't need to build it into the into the M1.  And over the last couple of years,  I think maybe they've realized that there are more people  agitating for that than they accounted for.

And Apple doesn't feel they can say, get the 14.  That's really, really well.  But it's too grand. Yeah.  And instead, they've got this old computer that is not any more capable.  Really? It's got active cooling, but like,  it really is not any better than the MacBook Air.  But it's called a MacBook Pro.  And there are absolutely organizations that will not buy a MacBook Air.  They will buy a MacBook Pro.  We only buy professional laptops for our users.  And an Apple can't get that 14 inch model down to 1299.  Right. It's not even close.  So instead, this kind of joke of a pro laptop just kicks on.  And I don't think anybody should buy it, honestly, because you should.  You're going to buy that by the MacBook Air.  It's just it's a better, you know, designed computer,  more modern in so many different ways.  Unless you want the touch bar.

Transcript:  I wonder if there's a revision coming that is a specifically if they  if they decided that they can't keep making this,  what they might do is instead of build, instead of just eliminating it  and keeping the 14 and the 16 in the line.  I wonder if there's like a decontented  13 inch MacBook Pro that is like,  you know, not very interesting, but they have to do something  to keep the cost at that price point. Yeah. Yeah, exactly right.  It's sort of like a MacBook Air Pro almost.  And it's just enough that they can call it a pro.  Maybe the touch bar is out of there.  Maybe there are some more ports, but it's really not.  I have a hard time imagining it being like good,  but I think at some point they might need to just do a revision  in order to hit a price point, which is again, how exciting is that to be like,  we're making this computer to be 1299 or whatever it is, right?  Because we have to sell something.  So it's either that or they just keep running the touch bar model out there  again and again, which I mean, maybe they got extra touch bars.  They're trying to save.

It's almost something I can use for several days on a trip.  I just have to plan not to do the things that it can't do for me.

Is that a six colors article about  the not use about the not the iPad is still not a laptop.  Yeah, there's still there's there's still like I love it.  It is my go to device for like short trips.  But there's still when you hit that wall, you hit it so freaking hard.  It's like, no, there's absolutely no.  Not only is there no way to do it, but you feel as though you are in a really  badly done like Dungeons and Dragons game where the Dungeon Master  has basically set up this world to make sure you get as angry and frustrated  and feel as powerless as possible saying there you could.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And what Andy's saying there, I mean, yeah, we've always said  when you hit the wall, it's brutal with the iPad because there's no flexibility.  That's the thing.  I have some very unique things that I need for when I travel because I'm a podcaster.  But the fact is, and I heard from people who are like, well, you know,  other people don't do what you do.  And it's like, guys, read the read the next paragraph,  which is the problem is flexibility.  If it does what you need, you're good. Right.  It's great. It's it's so flexible for you that you can believe it.  But like if you don't want to do anything that Apple hasn't foreseen,  you hit the wall.  And that's the difference between the iPad and the Mac.  If if Apple hasn't foreseen it on the Mac, guess what?  A third party app utility, something has foreseen it.  And you can do it yourself or you can install a utility and you can make it happen.  But on the iPad, because of the way it's structured,  if Apple hasn't foreseen it, you just can't do it.  And so I I just decided I tried very hard to work around all of those issues  for a long time and only when I'm visiting my mom or I'm traveling to other places,  like only bring my iPad.  And I finally realized, you know what?  Apple Silicon, the MacBook Air, it's so good.  It's less than three pounds in my bag and I can stop fighting.  And so that's what I decided to do is I just stop fighting.  If I'm going somewhere and need to record a podcast,  I just bring the iPad and the MacBook Air and I use the MacBook Air.  Sometimes I went to Colorado a few weeks ago and I had to do a podcast when I was there.  And I pulled the laptop out, recorded one podcast  and then put it right back away.  Didn't touch it the rest of the trip.  But like I couldn't have done that with the iPad.  It would have been jumping through hoops.  And I just decided, like, if Apple's not going to do it.  I'm not going to I'm not going to push it.  I'm not I'm done pushing the envelope for now.  I'm just because Apple's pace of iPad innovation is very limited.  And I think that they they they want it to be.  It's growing, but it's growing really slowly.  And and the fact is, as we've talked about here many times,  Apple Silicon Macs are really good.  So maybe I should just you talk in your

Start time: 4914.40

Transcript:  article about the specialty stuff you use, like the audio hijackers or stream deck  that you carry with you.  But I think if we were to generalize it,  it's really that you cannot install arbitrary drivers on the iPad like you can on a computer

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  would call them all drivers.  And I understand the reason that doesn't allow drive third party drivers on that,  because that is also a notorious source of bugs, security issues and problems for users.  And so Apple probably in their head is saying the same thing you just did, Jason,  which is, well, if you need that, take a MacBook Air.  That's why we make it.  And and if you want kind of something that's simple, secure,  installing drivers is the number one hassle on Windows computers.  You know, it's just it's it's source of all sorts of trouble.  And I can see why they wouldn't want to do that.  Go ahead.

Transcript:  It's tough for me because like we went to the podcast movement last week.  You know, I sit here and have an existential crisis every time I'm  packing because I have an iPad Mini, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro.  Which of these devices do I take?  And for me, I actually edit multiple podcasts a week on my iPad Mini.  No, because it's it's so light.  I can sit out on the patio and I edit.  I edit.  Right.  People love it.  And it is just a me.  I can edit faster with the Apple pencil on iPad than any other.  And I have logic brought up at all.  But when I was at this conference, I had to record a podcast.  I did it with Micah Sargent.  And it was this moment where we were using like all this B&H photo equipment.  And we ended up using the Zoom track recorder that had an SD card.  And in that moment, if I didn't have my MacBook Pro 14 inch and I didn't bring  any dongles, like I would be up a creek.  And so even just for that, like a 14 inch MacBook Pro, I'll probably never run  into a situation where I'll be stuck as opposed to the iPad.  Like if I just had my iPad Pro, even with a dongle,  I don't know if I could have recorded I could record in Fairright.  But I don't know about Jason's experience.  Like I don't I don't trust multi-track recording into Fairright.  Not because of Fairright's limitations, but just it's with the iPad.  And I can't see, you know, I can't monitor enough of what's happening  in real time to really just trust the long recordings.

Transcript:  The Mini is the hidden superstar of the entire Apple lineup.  It is.  I really honestly think that as someone who already has an iPad Pro,  that he spent a lot of money on, he didn't get that.  I didn't get the cheap one.  I put I had money set aside so that I could get like as much storage as I wanted.  The M1 everything and the pencil.  I still every time every time that I get out my old iPad, the one that is  basically made out of animal skins and twigs at this point,  compared to what was available now, I guess that's going to be my next Apple  purchase, maybe even before like my new Mac Mini, because it is replaced.  It puts such a such a role in my life.  But that but but Stephen, like you,  we're talking about, you know,  why you not be able to install drivers and that is a big deal.  But for me, like the just the simplicity of I have a file.  I want to move.  I want I want to move the file from here to there.  Like, OK, oh, that's easy.  Just you just use clouds.  I'm in the middle of nowhere, but I have everything I need.  I just needed to move it from this place to this place.  Can't do it. OK, well, how about how about if I have like a JPEG file  that was created by one app and I wanted to be I wanted to be able to be used by  another app? That's great.  Just put up the sharing sheet.  Yeah. But for some reason, this graphic editor that works with JPEG is not showing  up in the sharing sheet. Well, then there must be a really good  reason why you shouldn't be able to do that.  Like and I compare that to this is I don't I don't I think at this point in 2023,  it's not a case of like Android being better than iOS or iOS being better than  Android, there are things that will attract some people and not attract the others.  So compared to like putting music files on this device,  I just simply drag files onto it or download that into whatever folder I want.  I have an open file system.  And then I've got three different music  players for three different kind of uses.  And for each one of them, I just simply say scan through this folder or scan  through the entire device for anything that's a flak file.  And within like 10 seconds, every single flak file that I pointed it to is now part  of that music library, it is the is the way the things should work.  And so it's I understand that there's a  dogmatic difference at Apple between the iPad line and the Mac OS line.  That I think it really is like we are  going to make it a pain in the butt for a lot of things.  But the payoff is going to be it's going  to be way more reliable than any Mac we've ever made ever was.

But but the third party driver is, you know,  a lot of times when I look at Windows, I say if you could just get rid of Win 32,  you wouldn't have nearly the security issues.  And Microsoft's answer is, but we can't because so many people need it.  And I think in a way, this is what Apple has done.  They said, well, what if we made a new device  that is absolutely simple and robust and reliable?  And  but you're going to have to give up some things like the ability to install these  third party, well, third party apps from anywhere.  For one thing, you got to go through the  app store and especially third party low level drivers.  Those are not those are problematic.

Transcript:  But my point is, like, when I record on my Mac with audio hijack,  I'm not afraid to click to another window and that recording is still going to happen.  It's still going.  Whereas if I'm recording on my iPad,  even in a pro app or even in ferrite, I'm not sure what's going to happen if I swipe  up to go home or what happens if I like tab over to a different app.  Like, yes, it should still be recording,  but I just don't trust it because I don't see iPad OS as being able to handle that.  I think a lot of times just I think from experience, people have experienced this  where you're recording or you're doing something, you go to another app and all  of a sudden a process stopped in the background and you just can't have that  when you're doing something like podcasting.  You want to make sure it's recording.  And on my Mac with audio hijack running,  I can look at my menu bar and see the little peak meter always going.  And I just know, like, I trust that it's happening.  And until iPad offers that kind of, I guess, security for not necessarily

Transcript:  I keep I keep coming back to something I read about about the creation of Disney  World and Disneyland, where someone who worked with Walt Disney  in building these parks said that Walt wanted to make sure that if you came  to one of his parks, you would have a fantastic time.  And he was he thought he was so adamant  that you have a fantastic time that he wanted to make you make it impossible  for you to have a bad time, even if you were trying to have a bad time.  And and that's what I think about.  I think that's about that.  That's that's that philosophy set on to the the the the the  two clicks on the knob on the on Mac OS and it's set to like eight out of ten  on iPad OS. And I and this is where I don't think that Apple is BSing like anybody.  I think that that really is their philosophy.  I mean, we're  there once or twice every couple of months, I wind up resetting the audio  drivers on my Mac and on the one hand, I can think of, well,  see, because the Mac is a lot more powerful and a lot more open.  If if suddenly I lose all audio, I can just simply go to the terminal,  enter a pseudo command and simply restart that audio driver and have things back.  The flip side of that is, yeah, but if you were using an iPad,  that audio would never have screwed up in the first place because nothing can  screw up at that low level.

Transcript:  And there's and there's a reason, Stephen,  you worry about background recording suspending when you change screens,  because Apple doesn't want initially because of the iPhone and battery.  They don't want stuff running in the background.  But also they don't want stuff running in the background because that's where  your troubles begin. Right.  You know what?  And so if you I think this makes perfect sense to me.  And yet I look at what Mark Gurman is is describing for the iPad Pro 2024.  The code names are J7, 17, 18, 20 and 21.  They'll be M3.  They'll have OLED displays, which is awesome.  They probably have the best displays out there until we get OLEDs on the MacBooks.  Eleven and 13 inches, which is a little bit bigger than twelve point nine, I guess.  Revamp Magic Keyboard.  And as you said, Andy, the new accessory, according to Gurman,  makes the iPad Pro look even more like a laptop than the current setup and has a  larger track pad, and that's that's actually a fix because the Magic Keyboard's  trackpad is not great.  So, you know, Apple is moving more towards something that you could say, well,  I could do that's my laptop, except I firmly believe they don't want to.  They really.

Transcript:  And they're using the chip, the same chip as the Mac.  Right. That kind of calls calls it into question because like the truth is,  my MacBook Air and my MacBook, my iPad Pro use the same chip and therefore.  But they are very different in terms of what their functionality is.  And, you know, that's fine.  That's a choice that they can make.  But it is something that you think of as a user.  Like, well, wait a second.  I what about like, why can't I?  Why aren't these things the same?  And they but they aren't.  That laptop report is interesting.  The idea that I wonder if it's going to be a heavier because weight is the concern  that the cantilever design is there because they're trying to push the center  of gravity forward so it doesn't tip over backward.  So, you know, either there's a kickstand,  which I'm really against because I think kickstands ergonomically are terrible.  And you can't put them in your lap or they're going to make a heavier keyboard  case, which I actually think is probably the right way to do it.  There are some other companies that made like clip in keyboard cases for the iPad.  And the key is just to have more weight in it.  And if you're Apple, Apple gets to design the iPad and the accessory together.  Right. Any other accessory maker just has to make do with whatever Apple provides  them, but Apple can design them together.  And I wonder if there's a keyboard trackpad case in the future.  That is heavier. It's going to make it more like a laptop.  But you could do stuff like have a supplemental battery in there that would  not only write like battery flow power can flow both directions.  So what if they're imagine the marketing, if they say, and then you snap this iPad  into this thing and it's got like more hours, things and it's 24 hour battery  life or something like that.  It's 24 hours to watch movies and they can also charge your AirPods.

But again, like use case, even like editing a website, you know, I manage a lot  of Squarespace websites and on the Mac and Safari, everything works great.  And even though Apple has said Safari on the iPad is supposedly desktop class  and is like parody with the Mac, like it's just not like if I try to manage  a Squarespace website on my iPad Safari, like it looks like it should do everything  the same, but just click wise functionality like mouse activity is just it's just not  the same.

Transcript:  Yeah, let's take a little break.  And then we come back.  I do want to talk about podcast movement and some final thoughts.  But first, a word from Zoc Doc.  You know that feeling when you finally get the thing you've been searching for  right your whole life after spending hours researching and reading thousands of  reviews, you finally get the perfect what is it?  Sparkly disco pants. Sure, that's it.  Or designer dog hoodies or whatever.  It's just it's the thing.  It's the right thing. Five stars rhymes tomorrow.  That's just a nice feeling.  How come we can do that with sparkly disco pants?  We can't do that with our physician.  If you want to see a good doctor,  if maybe you've maybe you got a recommendation from a friend, you call  me. We're not taking no patients or yeah, we can make an appointment in June of 2024.  Huh?  And really, is it enough just that your friend said this is a good doctor?  Wouldn't you like to know a little bit more?  That's why we love Zoc Doc.  There is a way to book and find great doctors who are available,  many with appointments in 24 hours and with verified patient reviews.  So you can see exactly what that doctor is like.  It's more than just this is a great doctor.  This isn't a great doctor.  It's how that doctor communicates.  Some people want a lot of information.  You know, I want all the options, doc.  Tell me everything I could do.  Some people, I'm one of them.  Just tell me what to do, doc.  I don't need the options.  You tell me. You're the expert.  Zoc Doc. But you get the choice, right?  You can see the reviews, verified reviews from actual patients.  Zoc Doc is a free app where you can  find amazing doctors and book appointments online.  We're talking about booking appointments  with thousands of top rated patient reviewed doctors.  And it's not just doctors, it's specialists, it's dentists, chiropractors.  You can filter specifically for the ones  who take your insurance, are located near you and treat almost any condition you're  searching for. They all have verified reviews from actual patients.  No bots. They're very good.  Zoc Doc does a really good job curating all that to make sure these are real  patients. The average wait time.  I just got this stuff.  This is so cool to see a doctor booked on Zoc Doc.  It's 24 to 48 hours. That's it.  You can even get same day appointments.  Now, this isn't for acute care, obviously.  This is for a physician you want to see  for a particular thing or maybe on a long term basis.  Once you find your doc you want, though, you can book them immediately.  And it's just a few app taps right in the app.  No more waiting awkwardly on hold to talk to a receptionist.  Go to Zocdoc.com  slash Mac break.  Download the Zoc Doc app for free.  Then find and book a top rated doctor today.  Zocdoc.com slash Mac break.  I've used this many times. It really works.  It's fantastic.  I just realized I need to find a new dentist.  I'm going to go to Zocdoc.com slash Mac break.  Now, I know you're smart enough.  You could just go to the app store and download Zoc Doc.  Please, would you do me a favor?  Go to the website so they know you saw it here.  And then, you know, it'll say here's a link and you can download it.  I know it's one extra step, but it helps us a lot.  Zocdoc.com slash Mac break.  Thank you, Zoc Doc, for supporting Mac break weekly.  I saw this tweet  with Micah Sargent and Stephen Robles at the podcast movement.  I just got the new Zoom F2 recorder.  It's only a two mic setup, but it's a 32 bit recorder.  I'm really excited about using it in the field.  It's cool that you were able to get all the latest equipment to try out.  That's really neat.

I don't know if it's concerned,  but I do wonder over the next few years where it comes to like ad agencies and  where sponsors go to actually book spots on podcasts.  Is it going to flow where you basically have to be doing dynamic ad insertion and  tracking and all of that? Yes.  And I remember the first time I actually experienced it.  I won't name the podcast,  but I press play on a podcast I've listened to for many years.  And the first ad that played was that in the Tampa Bay area.  And it was such a shock to me because it was the first time I experienced  a targeted ad in a podcast, you know, every other time before it was something  it was baked in, you know, I knew the sponsors like every time you hear,  you know, a sponsor on a podcast, it feels familiar.  And this was like, oh, this is the future  because someone can actually target my local area and actually like they do that.

And so that's where you download it. Yeah.  That's where I download it.  So it was a very visceral like, oh, right.  I was tracked for this ad.  And so I do wonder if that's how you're just going to have to do it,  especially if you're growing a new show and you want to get those sponsors.  Are you going to have to play that game long term?  And so that's kind of the feeling I walked away with.  And again, I don't know if it's concern  or if it's just kind of like nostalgia where, you know, the podcasting landscape  is not going to be like it was five, ten years from now.  I'm not sure. So I don't know how Lisa felt or it's funny.

Transcript:  She exactly echoed those exact same sentiments.  She said we're in deep trouble.  She says all ad tech all the time.  It's all tracking.  And, you know, we're big fans of RSS, which really can't track you.  It knows your IP address.  So direct ad insertion does work.  We use advertised cast, which is a Libsyn company.  In fact, some people, you know,  in not in this show, but some of our shows, you will hear ads  in the language of your country if you're listening outside the US or  for your local car dealership or whatever.  And just so you just to reassure you, tracking is not exactly right.  They're using IP address, IP geolocation to figure out where you are,  which is not, I mean, not the end of the world.  There is, though, a push towards much more draconian tracking with pixels and so forth.  And we push against that.  It's very hard to because advertisers are getting that kind of service from Google  and Spotify and others.  And, you know, when I see Apple announced, as they did at podcast movement,  more tracking information for podcasters, you'll know more.  I know that that's really not for podcasters, that they're collecting  that information for advertisers in the long run.

Start time: 6194.48

Transcript:  So what's what's tough is, you know,  the value proposition for a podcast ad in the past was the Tweet,  the Macbreak audience is a known audience.  And so it's a tech company.

Start time: 6204.96
End time: 6239.85
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's contextual advertising based on the context the ad is running in.  And we still prefer to do that way.  We also prefer to do host read ads, not inserts.  That's how we would prefer to do it.  And I think it frankly, for the advertisers  that have been with us for more than a decade, they know it works.  But I think more and more agencies who are not the advertisers,  where we like to direct business, because the agencies, it's too much trouble for them.  They're going to buy 20 different podcast networks.  They don't want to bother having a personal relationship with them.  So it's a great thing.

Start time: 6240.73
End time: 6295.74
Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  And that's difficult.  And again, for an advertiser, I don't like it.  But an advertiser could say, I want to reach one million of this age  demographic in this location, of this gender.  Then they'll just buy the ad space rather than buying the podcast.  And that is the shift that kind of stinks, honestly.  I agree. I think it was it was valuable for a sponsor to say, if it was Squarespace,  that they're going to buy an ad on the Twitter network and they know it's going  to go to a tech centric audience who is probably building websites themselves or  helping others. And it just makes sense.  And that can be a relationship, hopefully long term, where now it'll just be like,  well, like every other ad, like, just give me this demographic, this location,  this interest.  And that's what I'm just going to buy ads across this ad agency that has so many  shows and those dynamically will just be inserted.  And it's unfortunate.  I mean, for a long time, podcasters like you all, I'm sure I think that's where  it's going. And I don't know.  I don't feel great about it.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's just not what I I thought it would be ad driven.  I thought I'd make the bulk of my living from blog ads.  And in fact, I make the bulk of my living  from podcast ads and from memberships, which takes us back to some.  Yeah, yeah.  And that it's funny because in covid time and right before, a lot of us were like,  we got to get on the membership train here because who knows what the ad market  will do and the ad market did fine for a while, but it has changed.  And I will say being in a niche,  being a niche publisher, I have I have  advertisers who want to reach my audience still.  Exactly, because I'm not trying to I'm not trying to build this enormous reach.  And that's the challenge is you're either  in a volume game or you're in a niche game.  And while some of this tech ad tech stuff is going to push down and try to force  niche publishers to use that ad tech, there are also still  advertisers who value a very specific audience and will pay for it.  And that's why I'm skeptical that it's going to go all the way to everything is  self serve, you know, ad network on the fly kind of stuff.  I think that there's still a place in if you're playing the niche content game  for other stuff, but if you're playing the broad content game  where you're just some more impressions, volume, that's a different game.  That's volume. And that's going to be a lot harder.  But like with Relay, I mean, Relay has seen a slowdown for sure.  But they have built a lot of direct  relationships that have allowed them to extend and and do better than than some  other, you know, some other kind of podcast.

And exactly, I think at some point we're  going to have a hybrid model where we're going to be, you know, the club is very  important to us. It's about seven thousand members strong now,  which is still only one percent of the total audience.  But it's something that keeps us going.  And that plus advertising, I think we can survive at the level we're at.  We may not at some point we may have to shrink.  You know, we might have ironically, Stephen might have to stop doing video.  That's the most expensive thing we do.  And most people don't watch the video anyway.  So here's you mentioned Squarespace.  I was really pleased Squarespace celebrated  their 20th anniversary a couple of months ago.  Timeline Squarespace.com.  And we're in the timeline.  March 2009, Squarespace lands first podcast advertisement.  Anthony Casalena makes a big gamble paying  nearly twenty thousand dollars for a Squarespace ad to appear on the podcast.  This week in tech was more than twenty  thousand because he bought like a seven month contract.  But that's OK. A post purchase survey.  This is the part I like, proves the risk  to be worth it, revealing that a third of the company's new subscribers  heard of that heard of it through the plug.  So that's good.  That's good.  This was very we didn't expect this.  They didn't they didn't mention it.  And we were very pleased to see it.  They stopped buying ads on on our shows several years ago.  When they remember this, they bought a Super Bowl ad.  We said, you know, how much did that cost for 30 seconds?  And you could have bought five years of us for that.  So  it happens, it always happens.

Transcript:  Well, I do think, you know, direct membership is going to be a huge part  for independent and podcast networks, but I also wonder how much subscription  fatigue is also going to play a part for those people, because I support multiple  podcasts directly and some networks, but I also feel like I don't know how  sustainable that is, as more podcasts are going to be asking for direct support.  And networks like Relay, like Twitter can offer, you know, here, pay this monthly  and you get the benefit of ad free and bonus content across all these shows.  But if you're truly an independent show,  like you have one podcast and you're not a part of a network, I think it's going to  be a tough sell to ask people to pay you five dollars a month for a membership for  ad for your bonus content, as opposed to paying a network five dollars and get  multiple shows. And so that I think is a tug of war, not a tug of war,  but something that's going to have to be figured out.  Maybe it's like creator networks that  individuals can join to kind of be a part of.  And so their listeners might get more value for a certain amount of subscription  per month or I don't know.  I don't know if it's going to subscription fatigue is going to hurt them.

I mean, there I think at some point people are going to say, well,  yeah, because I know what you mean, though, because I subscribe to  for the shows, I have to subscribe to The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times  and Bloomberg and all sorts of stuff.  And it's thousands of dollars a year.  It does add up.  But that's, you know, if I think it's the way it is with streaming, too,  you want to consume content on the TV content.  Increasingly, it's going to be because you're going to pay a subscription for it.  Right.

Transcript:  Well, people are stopping paying for all those streaming services, too,  which I think, you know, as Disney is struggling with right now,  like what networks do we drop because they're not profitable enough.  And so I do think subscription fatigue is real.  And that's why, you know,  I don't know if there'll be another shift to something else.  But yeah, I don't know what the future is.  I guess that's why it's unsure. And I love podcasting.  You know, that's what's a struggle because the industry was small enough  or niche enough where you could have your audiences and have a show.  Oh, I love the community.  And the community is great.  And those people are still there.  And so just hopefully the future of monetization can still, you know,  handle or support that kind of relationship between the smaller shows and audiences.

Transcript:  I honestly  think that's what that's the thing advertisers and agencies are missing,  is you're buying not a show, you're buying a community,  you're buying access to a community.  And that's something we're really podcasters are really good at,  is building community, at least the successful ones, at building community.  And that has that has value, I think, to an advertiser.  When we told people about Squarespace,  that carried weight because we, you know, we were talking about something.  I don't know.  If you're not a member of the club, you can see why we keep plugging it.  Visit twit.tv slash club twit.  We keep the price low.  We give you a lot of value because we understand about this subscription fee.  Seven bucks a month or a lot of people said, well, can we buy a year?  I was reluctant at first because I didn't know how long we'd be doing the club.  But now, OK, yeah, you could buy a year.  You can also get family plans and corporate plans.  You get all the shows ad free, ad tech free as well.  You also get the access to the Discord, which is really a great place to hang.  I honestly that was an unexpected benefit of the club is the is the community in  the Discord is fantastic, plus shows we don't put out in public  because there's no ad support for it, but we know the club supports them.  And so that makes a big difference for us with Hands on Macintosh.  Micah does that and Hands on Windows with Paul Therodden.  We're not doing these to say, oh, see, you should join the club if you want to get  our content. We don't really want to put anything behind a paywall.  But it's also fair because club members, in effect, are paying for it.  These are shows that don't have advertisers yet.  And when a show gets big enough that we can sell ads like this week in space,  we do move them out of the club into the public.  We don't want to put stuff behind a paywall.  That's never been in our intention.  But we also make sure that people who give us their seven bucks a month get  something of value, lots of events.  We put our community manager, Ant Pruitt, does such a great job.  He just finished that that photo walk in Petaluma last weekend.  Stacy's Book Club is coming up.  We do. We're working on an untitled so far AI show with Jason Howland, Jeff Jarvis.  That's every Thursday afternoon.  You can participate in that.  Some good, if you're sci fi fans, the club is heaven.  Daniel Suarez, Hugh Howey, join us with a fireside chat in about a week.  And then John Scalzi in next month or October.  That's going to be incredible.  These are all things we do for the club.  Rene Richie will come back and do an Ask Me Anything November 16th.  He is, of course, now the creator liaison at YouTube, but a longtime host on this show.  So lots of stuff, lots of benefits.  We try to make it worth your seven bucks a month.  I think it is.  If you're not yet in the club, please go to twit.tv slash club twit and join us.  We would love to have you.  And as this discussion shows, that's more and more how podcast networks like ours  will survive. Both Stephen and Jason have had memberships.  And I think that's really important.  And I don't know what you do to support  yourself, Andy, but I wish you the best.

Transcript:  Apple in testimony before the Australian Competition Authority,  they're investigating the way Apple preloads iPhones with their own apps.  And of course, the app store is everybody else's.  Apple giving evidence before the ACC said they loaded iPhones with their own apps  and not those of competitors because, quote, when you take it out of the box,  we want it to work.  But furthermore, just to prove Apple's goodwill,  they actually artificially suppress their own apps and search rankings  just to avoid criticisms of self-preferencing.

They were just hauled before this tribunal  basically on a finding that they might be violating antitrust with their app store.  And this was it was very, very interesting  the way that this vice president was was couching it.  A I didn't know that they were  sandbagging their own search results for their own apps.  So this was something that in this guy's testimony, that was interesting.  And he was also saying he was also said, I don't know where the quote is,  but he was saying that actually, you know, our stuff ain't that great.  I mean, people prefer like Google Maps to ours.  People prefer Spotify to Apple Music.  Like if you know, we we we wish we were  abusing our market privilege with Apple Music.  My God, I mean, geez, we're just treading water here, dude.

He said, when we actually look at the evidence in the marketplace,  when we look at the relative popularity and downloads of different apps,  we see in almost every category consumers are picking an alternative,  even when the Apple version is preinstalled.

Transcript:  We're going to take a little break and then  gentlemen, if you'd prepare your picks of the week, we will do that next.  I do want to give you my pick of the week.  Our sponsor, Mylio.  This thing is so great.  When Google bought Picasso, I was like, oh, man.  And then they really kind of killed it.  So many people I've talked to used Picasso to organize their photos.  They had all these folders and collections and stuff.  And then it disappeared.  So when I decided I don't want to pay for Adobe's Creative Cloud,  but what am I going to use for my digital asset management?  I've been using Lightroom.  What am I going to keep track of all my photos with?  And I couldn't find anything appropriate.  Looked at a lot of different solutions.  I found the solution.  And here's the good news. It's not just for photos.  It's for documents, too.  It's called Mylio, M-Y-L-I-O, Mylio Photos.  It's a smart and powerful system  that helps you keep all of your digital assets organized and secure and private.  There's no cloud component to this.  Like, you know, Adobe really wants you to use the Adobe Cloud or Apple use iCloud.  If you want, you can be completely offline.  What I do actually is I have Mylio back up my photos to all my devices.  And you can choose thumbnails, optimized or originals.  So smaller devices like my iPhone, I use thumbnails.  But then if you want the full photo,  just you just click on it and you can edit the full photo, download it and edit it.  And then I have it all backing up to a Synology NAS, my own cloud.  So I've got all of my photos  and I don't have to worry about privacy.  Plus, and here's a huge advantage, you know, you may say, well, yeah,  but I like how Google Photos or Apple Photos picks faces and places.  No, Mylio Photos has AI built in and does it on device and does a really good job.  I now have over 200,000 photos in my library of Mylio Photos.  I've heard of people with literally with millions.  No problem at all.  It automatically I have to tell it, OK, that's Lisa, that's Michael, that's Andy.  And after I tell it a few, it then goes through all my photos.  It does a brilliant job of finding everybody's faces.  So they're all tagged.  It also does smart tagging with all kinds of variables,  you know, monuments and oceans and seashores.  And it's incredible.  Smart tags make all your photos searchable.  You don't have to spend time tagging, organizing the folders.  You don't have to.  Everything is organized automatically  for specific objects, activities, animals, plants.  You can say blue.  I want to see all my photos with a lot of blue.  Smart tags is brilliant.  And because it works with your existing filing system, Mac, iOS, Android, Windows,  you don't have to spend time importing.  I told it, keep a track of my Flickr, get all the Flickr photos.  Here was a huge one.  I knew I had stuff on my Google Photos that I didn't have locally.  I did a Google takeout.  It automatically imported and I've done this manually before.  And it's a pain.  This did it automatically imported all of my Google Photos.  And then it has an incredible deduplicator.  So I was able to remove those duplicates  and just find the stuff that was only on Google Photos.  It's incredible.  This is an app you want.  And you know what?  I just buried the link because it's free.  Yeah, don't wait.  Preserve your digital legacy today.  Go right now.  Mylio.com slash twit.  Try Mylio Photos free on your computer or mobile device.  I actually added my documents folder to it.  It imports PDFs. It does OCR.  So it's even tagging the documents.  It can read Microsoft Word documents.  It can read a whole host of document formats.  And on the images, it does OCR.  On the PDFs, it does OCR, optical character recognition.  So I have the contents and I can organize it via contents with smart tagging.  Now, you may say, well, how can it be free?  They do have a plus plan, of course.  But everything I just described, you can do in the free version.  Mylio.com slash twit.  Mylio.com slash twit.  At least try it for free.  Mylio Photos, Mylio.com slash twit.  If you have been saying I need a way to keep all this stuff organized,  I found it and it's incredible.  And it's completely this is maybe more important to me than others,  but it's completely cross platform.  So Android. Yep.  iOS. Yep.  Windows, Mac. Yep.  It's really incredible.  Mylio.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  There's an example of a company that wants to reach our community.  They know that you especially are going to have some interest in this.  And so they're not they didn't have to do all that.  Well, I want 24 year old men in Fresno.  They don't care about that.  They want Mac Break Weekly listeners.  Mylio.com slash twit.  Thank you, Mylio.  We appreciate your support for what we do here.  At Mac Break Weekly.  All right.  Let us talk about our picks of the week.  And Jason, you've got one I want to lead off with because it's really important.

Transcript:  Right. Yeah, we already mentioned the guys at Relay FM in other ways.  Stephen Hackett and Mike Hurley in this episode.  So I thought we might as well just jump right into it.  September is Child Cancer Awareness Month.  And every year the guys at Relay FM,  they they campaign to get donations to raise money for St.  Jude Research Hospital, which treats children with cancer for free and also  funds a lot of research into childhood cancer, trying to find cures for diseases.  Stephen's oldest son is a cancer survivor and was treated at St.  Jude and they have raised a couple of million bucks in the last few years for St.  Jude. They've got a goal here that they're  going to blow through and then they'll set a new goal.  But they have raised a lot of money for St.  Jude. It's a great cause.  And if you would like to join, you can get some stickers.  You can get a screen saver written by James Thompson.  There's all sorts of things that are in the package there.  But it's just it's going to be happening for the next month.  They do a telethon at one point for 12 hours.  That's happening. I'm going to actually fly to Memphis,  Tennessee and be on that telethon.  Lots of stuff going on. Relay.FM slash St.  Jude or if you prefer St. Jude dot org slash Relay.  Either one will get you there.  But please consider donating to St.  Jude and doing it under the banner of Relay FM is a great time to do it, too.  That's really awesome.

I think we raised seventy five thousand, something like that over a 24 hour period.  It's hard work.  And to raise two point two million dollars  over the years is very impressive for a very good cause.  So good. I'm glad we could give them a plug.  I was. Yeah.  In fact, it reminds me we should probably be doing something like that ourselves.  Relay FM for St.  Jude, just go to what's what's the easiest you are.

Transcript:  It depends on whether you have a positive  reaction to the crack Cohen of Corpse Revival Protocols.  If you're hip with it and you like it, then we don't have anything to talk about.  If you think it's a travesty, sit down.  Let's have a let's have a canish.  We'll talk about it.  But not but not everything that I read is on comicsology, like stuff you buy every  week on Marvel and DC and the major publishers.  A lot of times I back a Kickstarter and  they give you the reward in the form of a digital comic.  Or you go to all kinds of places like  archive.org where like published domain comics like the original like plastic man  comics, police comics, originals, the spirit or in many cases independent comics  from the 80s that I used to enjoy that just simply disappeared.  But someone has scanned them in and collected them and turned them into  standard CBR, CBC or PDF files.  So my my pick this week is an app called  Panels, which is a beautiful comic book reader for iOS, for both the iPhone and  for the iPad. It does the two most actually the three things it needs to do.  Well, it does extremely well.  The reading experience is really, really good.  It's because you can't there's even if even if it's a PDF, like you can't have  like open something in iBooks and have the same sort of experience.  You'll have a comic book is read in a  special way that is not going to be read, not be read like any other kind of book.  So you need to be able to go from panel to panel.  Sometimes the artwork is really detailed and nice and you want to kind of zoom in  and stuff like that. So the reading experience is exceptional.  The organization experience is also exceptional.  It's very, very easy to to group all of these individual comic book files into,  hey, here's a series of action girls, action girls.  Sarah Dyer is really amazing independent comic from from the 1980s and keep keep  track of the things that you've read, things that you're in the middle of.  You have widgets on the on the lock screen  to get right back into the thing that you're reading.  But the third part of it is really and we just we're just talking about this earlier,  the difficulty or non-difficulty of getting these files on the device to begin with.  And this if there's any way that  human humanity or God has and has created that you can put a comic book file on the  iPad, panels will support it.  So, for instance, the bulk of my digital comics, I just simply  plug it into my desktop via USB and then simply drag the files into there.  It just simply they populate.  You can watch them populating on the screen as you go and then you can simply  organize them there, it'll work with the files app.  So any any app that's compatible with files like Dropbox, Google Drive,  a an attached storage device that will work just fine or the  method that was very, very popular at the very, very beginning of life with iPad,  which is OK, Apple's made things so hard, we're going to include code that just  basically turns this app, your iPad into a web server.  So you can just hear it will just give you a web address on the local network  that if you open up, open this up in a web in a web browser on your desktop,  then you can use that to transfer files for one place to another.  I've never been in a position.  Yeah, I've never been in a position where I was not able to copy something over.  And it's very it's also it's not a stickler for format.  There there have been times where like I just it's not even a comic book.  It's just that there is a web comic that I like so much that I just sort of right  click and save to a folder.  And if I just simply zip that folder and copy it into into panels,  it will basically let me read those strips day by day.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  Really, really well done.  And there are two different ways to buy it.  You can buy it on subscription, by which means you get the latest version  as they come out. There's a right now they're on version number two.  Version three is imminent or you can buy it outright for 20 bucks.  But the thing is, I bought version two like a couple of years ago.  Now I'm going to have to buy version three for 20 bucks.  Your choice. But it really is exceptional.  And the this there is enough time to get into the second part of this,  which would be there are places on archive.org where again,  there are places where you can get either public domain or abandoned comics,  so to speak. And some of these are the most entertaining  things that have ever been done.  And when it's when it's when it's a comic like Action Girl, where it's  I'm sure that this wasn't done with it wasn't put on archive.org necessarily  with the permission of Sarah Dyer.  However, it's not in print.  It hasn't been in print in 20 or 30 years.  If she were to produce her own digital version of it, I would immediately  buy it and then also give her an extra 50 bucks in her tip jar for how good this  comic was. But this is a way for those abandoned comics,  out of print comics, to still have a life, to still have an audience,  to still have somebody on a podcast saying, hey, this is a comic called Action Girl.  That's all all women doing all the art, women doing all the writing,  women as the editor in chief and the publisher and the colorist.  And they're just interesting points of view and interesting stories with  interesting characters.

And but I don't have a CBR version, but I could get it from internet.org.  Don't do it unless you bought it, because then that's not

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  right. That's yeah.  I mean, again, that's another long conversation that we can't have,  like we don't have time for. But yeah, there are times where like there are  sometimes where there's something that's never been made digital.  However, I have bought it.  I purchased it as individual issues.  Then I purchased it the second time as like a hardcover collection.  And I don't feel so bad if I happen across that.  Oh, by the way, someone also scanned in that hardcover so that I can have it on my.  I don't necessarily feel as though I have to spend forty dollars to buy  to buy a digital version on Comixology, since I've already bought it.  Twice, for God's sake.

Transcript:  Did you read the profile of Bill Waterston in the American Conservative?  Fascinating.  He's like Waterston recently.  He's got a book coming out, which is not a Calvin and Hobbes book.  But he talks about why he retired.  And it sounds like he was literally killing himself making this comic strip.  He said, at one point, I lost my lead time and I was the night before it was due  writing these comic strips.  And he said my entire life was consumed by it.  And he just he had to stop.  This is really worth reading.  It's a weird place to find a profile of Bill Waterston.  Yeah, but it's a fascinating story.  I imagine we're going to see more of him because he is promoting this new book.  So maybe that's why it happened.  Why Bill Waterston vanished?

Start time: 7993.12

Start time: 7996.56
End time: 8040.93
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it almost killed him making it.  It almost kills me that I had to read it in a publication that has RFK Junior on  its front cover, but that's another story for another day.  It is worth reading the article.  And I'm still a huge Calvin and Hobbes fan.  So if you're curious what happened to Bill Waterston,  very interesting piece on him.  And I think that would be a good reason for me to get this panels just so I can  have the complete Calvin Hobbes on my iPad Mini.  Now I'm happy.  Mr. Stephen Robles, we don't normally make our our visitors  do all the hard, heavy lifting of a pick.  It looks like you got one.

Start time: 8042.50
End time: 8072.48
Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I do. I'm cheating a little bit.  I'm doing like kind of a trifecta of picks, but it's one workflow.  And, you know, every day someone's born who hasn't seen the Flintstones.  And so I want to share about a couple of apps.  What?  Maybe people know.  That's true.  And so the first app is Downey, which is an incredible app by Charlie  Monroe, must have.  You can download any Internet video app.  You know, I don't want to say specific  websites because sometimes you get in trouble.  But anyway, that's how I get all the audio off of those YouTube videos.

Start time: 8073.48
End time: 8074.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just saying. Right.

Start time: 8074.38
End time: 8147.52
Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to say it, but you said it.  So you can download.  But also, like if there's a news website  that you need to pull a video from for whatever you're using that video for Downey,  it even has an in-app web browser where you can actually like log into a website  and actually download videos behind a login.  So it's pretty amazing. So Downey is amazing.  But I use that in conjunction with an app called Transloader.  This is an app that you run on your iPhone or iPad.  And then there's a utility that runs on your Mac.  And what you can do is from your iPhone, share a link.  It's right in the share sheet.  And I can send a link to Transloader,  which transports it to Transloader on my Mac.  And Transloader on my Mac can then send that link to Downey.  So as you can see, the workflow might be you're looking at a video on your phone.  Maybe you're even in an app that plays video.  I hit the share button on my iPhone.  I hit Transloader and it sends that link  to my Mac, which automatically sends it to Downey.  And Downey automatically downloads it and saves that file wherever I choose.  And so if you choose, say, your desktop, which syncs with iCloud Drive,  I could literally have an Internet video available to me on my iPhone in my Files  app in iCloud Drive in just a few seconds.  How did you hook it up to Downey?

Start time: 8147.96
End time: 8151.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that built into Transloader or do you have to write a script?  It's built in. It's built in.

Start time: 8151.48
End time: 8204.22
Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  No, it's built in.  There's no scripting involved.  It's very easy to connect the two.  And so I do all of that.  And then one final piece of the trifecta, if you want to go this far,  I actually use an app called Hazel,  which is utility on the Mac, which Hazel is amazing and can automatically  move files based on rules and folders.  And so what I have to do is any MP4 video that hits my desktop or downloads  folder gets moved to a folder on my Plex server.  Oh, my God.  As you can see, the workflow might be I'm watching a video on my phone.  I tap Transloader, sends it to Transloader on my Mac, which sends it to Downey.  Downey downloads that video file, saves it to my Mac.  Then Hazel takes that video file and moves it over to a folder in my Plex server.  And now I can stream it on my Plex account in just a few seconds.  And that's the workflow from front to back.  That's so cool.

Start time: 8204.30
End time: 8211.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you're looking at something on your iPhone, press a button,  and now it's on your Plex server and you can watch it on the big screen sometime  at your leisure. Exactly.

Start time: 8211.90
End time: 8238.88
Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  And I do that.  Again, I have kids and they have varying  levels of abilities and restrictions on their devices.  And so maybe there's a YouTube video I want them to see,  but they don't have access to just browse YouTube at Wim.  And so I will use Transloader and Downey.  And now they can stream it in Plex on their iPad just a few seconds after I saw  it on my phone and it's not like they need any more access.  They're just watching it from our Plex server running in my closet.  So that's the workflow.

Start time: 8239.22
End time: 8250.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very nice. Very nice.  You know what?  This is how our picture should be from now on.  Not just a simple app, but a work share, a workflow.  I think that's really good.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And I have her just running on a Mac mini sitting in a closet, you know,  Transloader and Downey are just always open.  And, you know, sometimes one of my sons plays Rocket League, which is like a video  game or whatever, and there's very long tournaments that are like three hours long.  And like, I don't want to tie up my Mac studio doing it.  I don't want to sit around waiting for anything.  So I'll just send the link to this three  hour Rocket League video with Transloader to Downey.  And then it's going to download and move it as it does.  And then a couple of minutes later, you know,  I did this three hour video in Plex and I didn't really have to do much.

Transcript:  And the reason, by the way, you have to do that,  besides the bandwidth, is the iPhone and the iPad don't allow you to install stuff  like Downey, right? So so this is an exact perfect example of a workaround.  The share sheet is really maybe the most  single most powerful workaround on iOS is the share.

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I will. I'll head off a bunch of comments  you might get to because there supposedly are shortcuts that allow you to do things  like download a YouTube video, but I find that they break soon after they are useful.  I wonder, you know, obviously YouTube does not want you like doing this.  And so a lot of those shortcuts, I find  that just don't work for very long and they break.  And so Downey has been like just a rock solid tool for me.

Transcript:  Absolutely. Double underscore support for that.  It's Downey is bulletproof.  And any time you've got any content that you want to keep for whatever reason,  it's worth pasting the URL into the box, even like when people post art  on Instagram that I just want to save a copy of, it'll just simply pop that out there.  The list of the list of URLs, like domains that it can basically find media from and  remove it from are amazing.  And if you can't find it automatically,  it has a guided extraction mode where you say, OK, well, here's here's a Firefox  compatible like web browser window, just do what you got to do.  And in the sidebars, like here is like a list of all of the audio, all of the MP4  files that are being accessed and streamed.  I think that's it.  Then click it and then, oh, great.  It's one point eight gigabytes.  I think that's the movie that I wanted to get.  Yes. Yeah.

Start time: 8400.24
End time: 8422.76
Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  And you can force MP4 format in Downey so you know it's going to download a  compatible video format and Downey works with shortcuts.  And so I actually have if I ever need to  download a podcast episode from some RSS, from shows that I manage,  then I actually have a shortcut where a little menu comes up.  I click the show I'm talking about and  that shortcut sends the latest episode MP3 link to Downey and Downey downloads  that audio file as well.

Transcript:  So it's just really the number of times where  there's been like two and a half hours of Senate testimony or whatever or  a presentation that lasts an hour and a half.  It's like I just need a transcript of this.  The easiest thing is just why don't I just have Downey grab this audio and send  the audio to an app that will simply do do speech to text.  And then 10 minutes later, I've got the audio instead of having to listen to.  I'm reminded of a funny story about protein folding.  It seems as though an amino acid walked.  Oh, God.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My Mac Studio is a server in a lot of different respects and it's always running  because I don't shut it off.  And so it's always nice to have that.  And if it's running on an M2 or an M1, it's not using a lot of horsepower.  And and it's a great thing.  I use Air Message.  I don't know if you guys are familiar with that.  Air Message is a server I can run on my Mac  that attacks itself into Apple's messages and then serves it up to my Android  devices and other devices. So, in fact, it is Air Message now supports on Android  can be the SMS app on Android.  So my Android devices actually have Apple  messages and SMS is my full messaging.  What?

Start time: 8506.48
End time: 8523.08
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Again, again, the difference between like Android and iOS.  It's like, no, we don't support this ourselves.  But hey, if you want to come together,  if you want to create some sort of Rube Goldberg system to make it work,  third party developers, we're not going to stand in your way.  That seems a little Rube Goldberg, but it works pretty well.

Start time: 8524.04

Start time: 8529.82
End time: 8564.43
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No. Yeah.  I mean, you well, actually you would if you said so.  Yeah, I guess you would because Apple's encrypting it on their end.  So, yeah, all it is all it is is  sitting on the studio where it's unlocked on the studio because I'm reading it and  it just it sucks that into the transit. Is it encrypted?  Probably not. No, no.  Through the Air Message is probably not. But I don't know.  That's a good question.  I have a password and it uses your Google account as as the login.  So you don't have to do it does not translate a translation.  Have you used it, Andy? Do you use it?

Start time: 8565.32
End time: 8596.62
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I tried I tried it because I don't have a real use for it day to day.  But I set it up and tried it.  I know you're an Android user. I thought.  Yeah, exactly.  And I I it's easier to have like a one less layer.  One less thing to go wrong.  It did work for the week and week or two that I tried it and was working.  OK, I was just worried about, you know,  what happens when the transport changes a little bit.  And suddenly I don't know why I'm sending things, but not getting replies back.  And it's because, oh, because I decided to do something clever.  Yeah, it is.  It is an open source project.

Start time: 8596.92
End time: 8612.21
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's free. Yeah.  AirMessage.org.  So I know it's not doing anything itself.  Nefarious. And my messages aren't going through it.  It's server. They're going directly from my Mac to the Android device.  So I think it's OK.

Start time: 8612.98
End time: 8616.06
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko

Start time: 8616.46
End time: 8639.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it works really well, much better than Beeper, because, you know, Beeper,  you have they actually are running a Mac in in their iPhone, in their server room.  And you have to you have to let Beeper get your messages this way.  It just it just goes through the Internet to my phone.  Little robot arm with a problem, though,  if you want to use an Android device and you're in an Apple ecosystem.

Start time: 8640.42
End time: 8656.34
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Really, I it's because I mean, really,  it's it's really too much to ask for Apple to support an international standard  that's run on the majority of all the phones out there that offers secure  transportation messaging for one way or another.  It makes more sense that we put ourselves through this, that you're absolutely right.

Transcript:  Apple actually called your ground.  Kolfur, who is the creator of AirMessage, actually has an open letter to Apple  saying, please free iMessage, please.  It deserves to be open.  But meanwhile, we got this kind of weird hacky work around.  But if but again, now I don't mind  installing Transloader because I've got this Mac just running in the background  all the time, you know, and now I can use Transloader as an additional thing  on that. So thank you, Stephen.  Thank you for being here.  Now, I didn't mention the reason Stephen's here is Alex took the day off.  He's he's busy working.  He will be as I understand it, he'll be back next week.  But Stephen, thank you so much for filling in.  You have a hurricane coming your way with some crazy name, I know or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And you'll really enjoy it.  It's a great podcast to listen to anyway.  He has some of the best people on because for years he was the host of  a forum on KQED, our public radio station in San Francisco.  So he has a really good Rolodex.  I'm glad that they got to the eyes so that we can get Andy and Anak  to Grey Matter on any podcast client that you like.  Good. Well, I'll listen to that. I can't wait.  Yeah. I don't think they do it live, but you can certainly hear it after the fact.  Thank you, Andrew.  Mr. Jason Snell has a few podcasts himself.

I've never actually been on the Telethon in person before, but we get a lot of  people come in over Zoom or there are pre-recorded things.  So you'll end up seeing and hearing from most of the hosts during the event.  They got 12 hours to fill.  I mean, yeah, anybody you want to turn up, anybody who turns up will probably be able  to be on at some point during the 12 hours that they're podcasting.  Isn't Mike in the UK?  Stephen's in Memphis and St.  Jude is in Memphis.  And St.  Jude actually has its own the fundraising arm of St.  Jude has its own studio for stuff like this.

Transcript:  Perfect. That's great.  Again, sixcolors.com Jason.  It's great to see you. Thank you, Jason.  At least one of us got an invite to the Apple event.  We do a Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, 1800 UTC.  You can watch us do it live at live.twit.tv.  There's actually audio and video so you can watch or listen live.  If you're watching or listening, chat at irc.twit.tv.  The IRC only makes sense if you're doing it live.  That's why we do it live.  So you can join us.  irc.twit.tv. You don't need an IRC client.  You can use your browser to do that.  Of course, Club Twit members can use our Club Twit Discord to chat about the show  as it goes on. After the fact, we have edited versions of the show, not lightly,  very lightly edited versions of the show, at our website, twit.tv slash mbw.  There's a YouTube channel dedicated to Mac break weekly.  And of course, the best way to get it, subscribe.  You can subscribe to the audio or the video feed in your favorite podcast player.  You'll get it automatically that way.  We will be back next week.  And again, we will be doing a live stream of the event on Tuesday,  which I guess means we'll have a slightly  delayed Mac break weekly.  We'll do one right after September 12th, two weeks from today.  The Apple iPhone 15 event.  That should be fun.  Thanks for joining us.  But now it is my sad and solemn duty to tell you it's time to get back to work  because break time is over.  See you next week. Bye bye.
