Transcript:  It's time for MechBreak Weekly. Our annual silly season has begun.  August is here and there's not much to talk about. Fortunately, I've got Jason Snell, Andy Inako, and Alex Lindsay  who are going to find so many things to talk about, like the Congressional Subcommittee  that wants to know why Apple doesn't like Web 3, or the new iPad OLED that may or may not appear in October,  or the French, they're mad again, Zut alors! MechBreak Weekly is next.

Transcript:  Oh, and a good article from Anze Tomic on switching to Mac and doing automation.

Start time: 159.34
End time: 206.79
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  That was fun. You know, again, you make do with what you can.  So yeah, Anze Tomic did a piece about switching after decades using Windows.  He bought his first Mac like this year.  And I thought that was again, you know, you can make that like, oh, is it like PR for Apple or whatever?  No, I actually think he brought because he's a professional computer journalist in Slovenia.  He had some real insights about what Apple does well and doesn't do well and what Microsoft Windows does well and doesn't do well.  And I when he mentioned he was doing this, I said, write me something.  And I don't think he'd ever written anything professionally in English before.  So it was fun. And it's a fun little project.  He made some really great points about how different the Mac is in some ways,  and especially how trackpad focused the Mac interface is.  I know that. Yeah.

Transcript:  You know, I do like these like low, like low-key, like news times,  because that's when I go to Six Callers for their annual roundup of  five different ways to zest up your summer salads.  I would never have thought about pairing watermelon with a wild pepper, but it's...  Lemon zest.  Lemon zest is a good...  Very, very small amounts.  You don't know what's adding the magic, but the magic is there.  She's absolutely right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually would read that article.  Okay.  What is, by the way, the camera of the day, Alex Lenzi, and the microphone?

Start time: 306.90
End time: 336.38
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  The camera of the day is a, I'm using a Sony FX 30 with their G series 35 millimeter.  So I am looking at getting a, I'm looking at the 60, I'm going to test the 6400 soon,  which is a much less expensive camera, but should, I think it's going to look the same.  Like it's the, it's an APS, you know, it's a super 35 sensor.  It doesn't have, it doesn't, you know, it's got to, you know, it's, it's,  I'm trying to find more affordable ways to do what I'm doing, but...

Start time: 336.60
End time: 340.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why?  I mean, you already own it.  You might as well just turn it on.  It doesn't cost you anything to use it, does it?

Start time: 340.64
End time: 403.02
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, like for instance, I'm going to go down to Seagraph next week and I want to cover  it, so I'm going to take my rig apart and put it there.  So what I want to do is have one that stays here that is, looks like this.  I think it looks great.  The big reason that I moved to the Sony's was this, of course, you know, just the focus.  Instant, yeah.  And what lens are you using on that FX 30 there?  I have a G series, which is a super painful way to, it costs as much as the camera.  I know, I know.  It's more expensive.  So I've got a G series 35 millimeter, 1.4.  I just got a 14 millimeter, 1.4 for Seagraph.  So that I can...  Because your nose isn't big enough?  What?  So you can...  The 35 is too close.  And so the, so you wander around, the problem is, weird, weird problems is that you're at  a booth, you know, you have a booth here and you want to interview someone.  And this is the aisle.  And when you have a 35 millimeter and you're standing here, you got to be standing back  here to get the booth with a 14 millimeter.  I can get to the inside of that, you know?  And so, so getting the...  Do people get weird though?

Start time: 403.10
End time: 413.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I know sometimes they shoot films with a very wide angle cameras in there.  It's, you don't know when you're watching the film, but the actor is cameras right in  his face or her face.

Start time: 413.82
End time: 439.42
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, it can be, it can be a little odd.  I mean, this one looks pretty good.  I mean, it's a really high quality glass.  Again, very expensive lens.  But the main thing is, is that the big problem is that we can get closer because no matter  what you do, no matter how hard you work, people will walk through your camera and you're  like, like I was at NAB and people are like, oh, I have to, I have to, I have to push through  this even though there's plenty of room behind them.  I, as the person walking has to walk through this shot.

Start time: 439.62
End time: 446.55
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I make it a virtue out of a necessity.  It's like, oh, this is fun because you're in, you're in a crowded...  Yeah, I know you want a good shot.

Start time: 448.26
End time: 455.02
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  We usually have people standing on either side of the interview that literally just  tell people to go that way.  Like we're not even, you know, we just put our arms out.

Start time: 455.04
End time: 468.46
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like the cinema verite of people, you know, walking by while you're talking.  I think that's fun.  I do not like that part.  All right.  And the microphone, I think we've already established that.  This is a Stellar X2.  It's not really expensive.  Oh, it is a new microphone.

Start time: 468.46
End time: 506.26
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Oh, this has been around.  I've had it for a couple of years.  This is a, we had a Neumann, I have a Neumann 102.  Yeah, I thought you were using a Neumann.  This looks just like a Neumann.  It was a Neumann 102.  This one is one third the cost.  So this is a, this Stellar X2 is...  It's 200 bucks.  200 bucks.  We tested it head to head and folks on office hours said that they liked it better.  So yeah, I have that.  And then I have this, this is a OC white Ultima arm, which is very nice.  You can swing things around and things.  That cost is more than the mic.  So anyways, anyway, but you know, when you're on air for, you know, as you know...  Somebody asked me...

Start time: 506.62
End time: 509.87
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What was the name of those arms Alex likes?  And I said, you don't want it.

Start time: 512.58
End time: 536.99
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  The reality is, is the hundred, the hundred dollar one that Elgato makes, the low P, the  LP is that's it's 90% as good as the one that I have.  Like there is a flexibility in this arm to do this that I never use, but, but it, but  I can do that in a way that would be hard to do on the, on the Elgato arm.  But we, when we send things out, we send the Elgato arm out.  So it's a good...  You're not going to say $300 mic arm.

Start time: 538.54
End time: 538.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.

Start time: 539.98
End time: 544.71
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I use, I use the Elgato arm and it's a, it's, it's good.  And it's nice to have a low profile.  It's not that one.

Start time: 545.12
End time: 560.30
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That's the, it's the LP from Elgato.  There's a, there's one, it's low profile because you don't want that big thing hanging.  It's between me and my monitors.  I have monitors all the way.  Well, I have monitors going all around me.  So if it hangs over, I don't know where to put it where I have, don't have to look around  it.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So there really is nothing going on if we're talking about our microphone setup.  Let's just keep going.  I'm enjoying this.  This is your SM7B.

Start time: 567.50
End time: 573.35
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I got the...  SM7B is very nice.  It's a little brighter than Alex's.  It's not so rich.  Yeah.

Start time: 574.34
End time: 589.30
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  The SM7B is very...  The real secret is the MixPre.  MixPre with Noise Assist.  Like, I have fans, you know, all kinds of, oftentimes I have fans going on all around  me and you don't hear any of it because of the Noise Assist.  It's true.  I can't hear anything.  The most attached to.

Start time: 589.95
End time: 613.82
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nice.  It's hard to like, what, be it's hard to like turn off the fans and turn off the air  conditioners in your studio when you realize that like five years ago, like, okay, that's  going to cause such a problem for the person editing this that I'm not going to do that.  When you realize that, but he has probably like a switch that says remove the, remove  the air conditioning noise.  Exactly.  You definitely can.  It's a lovely gesture, but maybe I could like be not be sweating while I'm doing this.

Start time: 613.88
End time: 652.27
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Because I'm doing a live show, I'm more sensitive to it.  You know, like when I'm doing office hours or here when we're live, but when we're doing  hours, it's just done.  Like it goes up to YouTube.  There's no posts.  Like it's just, it's, it's, it's the way we streamed it.  So that's when you get sensitive to having real time noise reduction.  But you're right.  The noise reduction that's out there, whether it's through isotope or a synaptic unveil,  those are the two that like if isotope will do 90% of them.  And when isotope can't do it, you pull out synaptic unveil and you're like, I will remove  like, and especially if you have reverb, synaptic unveil is like this.  It just, it magically takes the reverb out in a way that I've never seen anything else  do.

Start time: 653.45
End time: 669.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice.  Is this the OC White Pro Boom Ultima Gen 2 ultra low profile adjustable mic boom without  mount?  Yeah, that's it.  That's it.  It's only three to twenty.  Really nice.  Andy and I are using Fisher Price microphones.  It's my first microphone from Sony.  No, no, no.

Start time: 671.58
End time: 680.76
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Given how hot that movie is, I'm kind of regretting spray painting the pink of this Barbie mic  that I got the yard sale three years ago.  That would have been very, very on point right now.

Start time: 680.78
End time: 716.53
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, you know, the funny thing is, is that the the Hile is the I have to like, I'm.  It's actually more expensive than the Stella, the stellar that you're using.  It is.  And it has much better off axis rejection.  Like in this, I'm literally dynamic.  Yours is a condenser.  You don't understand, like I have a tent around me that is my, that I'm looking into because  otherwise this this mic will not work like you.  I have a heart.  It's all hard surfaces.  And it is like this is for those watching.  This is the.  That's what I'm looking at.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So when you when you sound like it's all over, I look totally doesn't it get sweaty in there?  No, I have an air conditioner right on the far corner.  This is what they used to do to me.

Start time: 728.10
End time: 734.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we know.  Holy cow.  Yeah.  So this is so I have all my monitors and my switcher and my color straighters right on

Start time: 734.72

Transcript:  The most hysterically funny thing about like the way that streaming is done is when you  realize exactly how much money and effort goes into making it look as though I just  put up a webcam in my regular office.

Start time: 765.51
End time: 806.63
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  Well, the funny thing is I do I do these present.  I do a presentation and that I have to do fairly often.  And I have it takes up five computers.  I have four Mac minis and one of them is a telestrator.  The other one is a presentation machine.  So it just runs keynote.  Another one runs the applications that I want to show you if I'm showing a Web page or whatever.  And the other one's zoom.  And then I have my work computer.  So it takes a little it takes me like a half an hour to get ready for the presentation.  Like I have to get everything wired and routed and ready to go.  But it's and it looks like nothing's happening until you there was one person that I did  it for.  And someone was like, what?  How do you do that on one computer?  I'm like, or four computers.  You don't know how many computers.

Transcript:  You know, I oftentimes in the office, I do have a  deuterium for nitrogen.  Oh, yeah, that's fun. Yeah, that's always fun.  So I have got like a two liter.  You can go up to up to Santa Rosa or get the and get liquid nitrogen.  They'll just pour the liquid nitrogen in there for you.  And then it's the best way to make ice cream.

Start time: 856.96
End time: 875.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will tell you besides, I mean, there are several clues.  This is a slow news month. August is really slow.  We're talking about the fact that we're talking about Alex's setup.  The top story is Amsterdam builds massive bike garage resembling an Apple store.  So that's the closest I could come to an Apple.

Start time: 875.14
End time: 901.16
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That is the most Amsterdam thing to do.  Isn't that great? I wish we had it.  So Amsterdam is so much fun.  You get there. It's so flat that you feel like every time I go.  I usually get there every year or two.  And for for IBC, it's the Rye.  And the Rye is like a 45 or maybe an hour walk out of downtown.  And I do it all the time.  I'll just walk to the Rye from from the center area.  But because of that, also, there's just everybody's got bikes.

Start time: 901.50
End time: 906.43
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think somebody told me there's two or three bicycles per capita.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 908.22
End time: 910.00
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  This, by the way, in the bike in Amsterdam.

Start time: 910.48
End time: 948.21
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, man, there's like a highway.  There's like these bicycle highways.  It's like almost scary because there's so many people.  Yeah. This is free for the first 24 hours.  Can you believe that?  And the pictures, by the way, there is another Mac.  Tie in or by Sebastian DeWitt,  of course, of Halide fame.  So they're particularly good images.  OK. Well, thank you for joining us for this week.  No, we have other stories.  The teamsters have reached a contract.  So your next MacBook may still come from UPS.  That deal there was a strike pending looming.  But that's not going to happen.

Start time: 951.07
End time: 980.96
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I will say that Apple's Apple store delivery is the best.  I get a lot of stuff delivered. You get Amazon.  You get couriered over, though, right?  It's not it gets to me faster than I can go over.  This guy in a bicycle drop it off.  It's someone I don't know.  They drop it off in a nice little camera, a nice little bag,  like a little white bag.  And and it's and they they ring them and they're very cheery.  And they're like, hey, I need to sign this.  Then we're good. And that's awesome.  It is faster.  It is faster to get it than for me to drive there.

Start time: 981.00

Transcript:  It's I should do.  So I guess they because you're near you're near Cordova.

Start time: 984.56
End time: 997.33
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Your ears would come from Santa Rosa.  And that's a little farther.  It should be fast, but it's still be fast.  I mean, I should try that.  It's it's not worth it.  How could I buy?  I got another mini.  Did you? Yes.

Start time: 999.18
End time: 1011.14
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's nothing new to buy yet,  although we are only about a month and a half away from a new iPhone.  Lots of rumors about the iPhone 15.  Any of them credible, Jason?  Anything that we should be paying?

Start time: 1011.16
End time: 1115.34
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Mark, Mark Gurman at Bloomberg did his in his annual  like roundup where he sweeps up all his reporting for the last year  about the new iPhone last year.  Plus, sometimes it's more than a year out.  And along with supply chain sources and all of that.  And we're getting a better idea now.  Obviously, it's going to have last year's pro processor on it.  On the low end, there will be a new three nanometer  process processor on the high end.  Lots of talk about camera upgrades across the board.  My guess is that they may do something with that 48 megapixel sensor  in the lower end phones this year, although probably still only have  a couple of lenses on it.  And there's this unclear kind of hovering out there thought  that there is a major upgrade happening somewhere in the pro line  in terms of the camera.  There have been lots of rumors about periscope lens style thing,  although nobody seems to have nailed it down.  And it's getting all of us who track this, I think, to start  wondering if it's not quite a periscope lens.  Right. Like it's a I don't know.  I tell you, right. They did.  They did something a little different.  They're going to give it a brand name.  And they'll be like, oh, no, no, no, no.  It's not like Samsung at all.  It's slightly different and has a different brand name.  But that would be the thing that I keep thinking might happen  is that the pro max might kind of graduate to be like an iPhone Ultra.  And the reason you do that is if it's camera, you know,  if it was so differentiated from the regular pro that it didn't make sense  to sell it as just a big version of the pro.  And if that's true, that would be very interesting if it was like by far  the best iPhone camera ever made.  That would be an interesting selling point.  Might be worth a rename and might at that point also be worth a price hike,  probably, because that's we live in that world, too.

Start time: 1119.98
End time: 1136.10
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So the thing I mean, I'm sure Alex could talk about it, too.  The idea is your phone is thin, right?  And the fact is your optics, optics, just light into cameras  get better when you have a longer lens, right?  If you think about a camera with a long lens, you have the ability to zoom.  There's just a lot of the optics become simpler if you have more room to work.

Transcript:  Telephoto is.  And that's right.

Start time: 1138.32
End time: 1171.04
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  That's why we have a camera bump, right?  Is that they need more room in there?  Well, if you put in a mirror and so you can use the depth,  you know, the the length, I guess, of your phone instead of the thickness of your phone.  You've got way more room to play with in there  other than that now you're cannibalizing, like you're eating battery  and other things inside the phone.  But it's probably worth the trade if you want a really great camera experience.  So that may be what they're doing.  And that's lots of other phone makers have done the same thing  because it's just physics, right?  I mean, you can't argue with how light works.

Transcript:  Yeah, this is a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.  That has a periscope lens, which gives it 200 millimeter optical, I think.  Is it optical? Maybe not.  But it gives it a very, very long lens in a very thin package.  And the telephoto, I mean, the New York Times.  I'm looking for some pictures.  New York Times Review says the Samsung S23 Ultra is a great camera you don't need.  But let me I'll find you some.  I have some pictures I took.  I'll show you example.  Can you go off my? Yeah, thank you.  I'm going to show you example that I have some.

Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead. And the the the Pixel six and seven also have like  most Android cameras on the top and have like a periscope camera.  That's how they compete with Apple, right?  Yeah, I mean, for well, I mean, that's it's always a competition across all across  the board to make the best pictures.  And I am just shocked at what like just this this model.  My model has just a 4x zoom.  The new models have like have an actual 10x optical zoom.  And then when you add like algorithmic trickery on top of that, the ability to say,  oh, there have been times where like I've been at the beach and I've seen like a dot  or two dots sort of like on the horizon.  And I want to get a closer look at it.  And I will actually take out my phone now and actually see that it's actually like a fireboat  chasing a sailboat that's kind of in trouble.  It's we're really changing from the times when  the phone used to be like the cardinal example of do not use the digital.  I know that it says that digital zoom do not use the digital zoom under any circumstances.

I mean, we can put a lot of other features into it, but the number one cameras  and their phone is taking pictures.  Yeah. So, yeah, that's why they're AI chips and cameras and phones now because I took  a I took a night picture of the Raffel the other day and I was just like, I couldn't believe  I took that phone. You know, it was just like, what is, you know, it's just really, really.  Did you use the standard camera app or did you use?  Yeah, I just opened it up and just took a picture.  I was like, I'm going to do a little post about I watched this movie and I was like,  I'm doing a little post about it.

Transcript:  And I. Yeah, it's not just about like telephoto sort of effects.  It's also about the ability to like when I'm using like a modern phone, it really I really  am using it like a regular camera where I'm thinking, gee, I really wish that the subject  in the foreground was larger compared with like the background.  So, oh, well, I have an actual like real telephoto lens in here.  If I just back up, I'm sending a foot away if I stand four or five feet away and then  engage the telephoto, just like when I'm with my thousand dollar camera with the two  thousand dollar lens, I will have the exact same optical effect because like Jason said,  like optical physics of light is always the physics of light, whether it's on a phone  or whether it's on like a ten thousand dollar camera.

This was when I first got it, we went out to the beach to test it out.  This is the widest angle.  Keep your eye on those people and the little dots in the distance because I'm because I'm  zooming in on them. And by the time I don't know if he was taking a picture of me or not.  But by the time I zoomed in all the way now, you see, it does get a little soft.  That's probably the 200 X.  I think he sees me taking a picture of him, but we are quite a ways away.

So there's, you know, if they can get a longer optical zoom and then also have that very  sensitive sensor or maybe even an even better sensor than that.  I don't know. Everything's really hazy about this one.  But it is unusual.  And we are now.

And they don't really step into full production to later this month in August.  Here's Mark's power on newsletter.  You were talking about from this week, the iPhone 15 will have thinner bezels in step  toward Apple's dream.

Start time: 1433.84
End time: 1496.10
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a there's a new process.  It's funny when you talk about the bezels, because like I believe bezels actually do  matter, but nobody notices them.  And then you look back at your previous phones and you think, oh, no, that was huge.  So going from whatever it is, going from two point two millimeters to one point seven  millimeters, that's a very small amount.  And yet, percentage wise, it's actually substantial and you probably will notice.  And that's always one of their goals.  So they've gone through a whole process there that seems to have survived the production  process. There were some stories about like how that was a technical difficulty.  He also says that that rumor about them replacing all the buttons with fake buttons,  basically that vibrate when you press on them, but they don't actually move.  And they basically didn't work and they pulled them out.  But it does sound like the ring, the mute switch, the ring silent switch is getting  replaced with an action button.  Oh, that's disappointing.  Which basically means so you can program it to do something else.  You could program it to silence, I guess.  If you are like you can.  But if you're like me and you always leave your phone muted, I can use that button for  something better. It's just like the watch.

They're going to make these screens according to German with lipo technology.  So it's thinner because they take the fat out.  No, it stands for low injection pressure over molding, which would give it a much  thinner bezel. One point five millimeters.  The standard iPhone 15 will have a dynamic island instead of a notch.  But at the pro and the pro max will be made with lipo.  Does that mean it's not it's still have a notch?  It's not his the way he works.  I think clear. Yeah, I think so.

And then the next year they push it all down into the other phone.  So very rapidly.  You know, this year's phone will be this year's cheaper phone will be last year's  pro phone in a lot of ways.  Right. And they just keep on that doing that cycle where there's  always something new coming at the high end.

Transcript:  Exactly. I think that's a classic example of Apple taking a disadvantage  and turning it into an advantage.  I think it's a really wonderful innovation.  There's there's always rumors that they want to do everything under display  so that there will be no notch, there'll be no pill, there'll be nothing.  And there'll be a camera underneath the display that's not affected  by the display above it.  There was a story a couple of weeks ago about how Apple's reached  from from the some display balls, some display analysts blog  saying that their Apple has been reaching out to display manufacturers  saying that here's what we want our display to be by 2017  and that they they're asking for true edge to edge display.  Like without the cheat that that a lot of Android phones use, which is  it's technically a curved display, but they hide the curve  so that you don't actually see it.  They say, no, we want to build a build us a display technology  so that the entire front surface will be an active display.  And with Apple, there's some there's so much really brilliant engineering  that is never visible.  And one of them is to simply edge rejection.  With other manufacturers like if Samsung were doing something like this,  you would wonder, oh, my God, how many updates are people going to have to go  through before it's impossible to hold the phone without act  without actioning something on the screen, because you've got your fingers  are going to wrap around somewhere.  Apple, I'm certainly I'm certain is putting lots and lots of work  into figuring out just technology to figure out what is an actual touch,  which is what is simply incidental via just holding the thing. So.

Transcript:  We don't I think because we are  tech nerds and we're also consumers of these products.  One of the things that doesn't get enough press that I think, Leo,  you mentioned that lipo technology, right?  But it's like there's so much high end hardware engineering going on here  where or even the button thing where you have to you can't just make it.  You have to make it and then have the factory make it  and have them not break.  And if they break, you got to pull them out because that's not good enough  because Apple is going to make millions of these.  This is the iPhone, right?  It can't fail one because it's more than half of Apple's business.  And two, they make it in such extreme volumes that,  you know, the stakes are so high and that this is serious,  like hardware nitty gritty engineering.  And, you know, I admire any company, not just Apple, but any company that says,  you know what, two millimeters bezel, it's pretty good.  Not good enough, right?  We're going to and we're going to do a whole new process.  And then they spend years doing this.  And now we're at the moment where they're it must be quite an accomplishment  for the people who work on this stuff to get to the moment  where it actually rolls out on the factory and it works and they function.  And you're like, oh, we can ramp it up now and we can make a million of these things.  And like, it's just it's really amazing.  Some of the the remarkable technology that has to go into these things  for them to do what they do.

But there's not that many people that can play this game anymore.  You know, like it's just the refinement and the level of which they're playing is,  you know, truly everybody else is playing high school ball.  And there's a handful that are playing pro ball.  And it's just really hard to compete because the costs of building this up  at scale are so difficult.  And you pick up a lot of these other phones and you just you can,  as an Apple user, you feel it really fast, you know, that of the drop off,  you know, and but, you know, Samsung does great ones and Pixel.  You know, it's not just Apple.  But the point is, is that it was this huge market.  And now there's this there's a there's a group of cell phone makers  that are making these really high end.  Everyone else kind of fell away.

Transcript:  I read a story the other week and I wish I could remember what it was,  but it was somebody talking about how a lot of the people in the press  were quibbling about some companies.  It was like a fine or it was a purchase or it was a write down.  And the point of the article was you don't.  None of us have really grappled a lot with the scale of big tech companies  and just how huge they are and just how things that to us seem like,  oh, they might buy this company and they might spend a billion dollars on it.  And and yet in for a business the size of Apple's,  it's essentially irrelevant because they're so huge.  And I think that goes to your point, Alex, that this is not a game  that can be played unless you have the ability to essentially move markets  and build factories by ordering.  Because like any time Apple orders a part for an iPhone,  it is millions and millions and millions of units.  They can't not have all of those units because that's how many they ship in volume.  And like so that's where the game is being played now.  And it is it's troubling in the sense that, you know, you can't be in the game  unless you are a gigantic company.

I was talking to a manufacturer and complaining about the fact  that they had they had they had announced something that they had shipped for six months.  Like they hadn't shipped it.  And they said, we share one component with the iPhone,  like that we didn't know that we were sharing with the iPhone until Apple bought all of them.  You know, like, you know, like now we have to redesign the entire architecture  of the piece of our piece of hardware because you can't get that.  You can't get that. You know, like Apple buys them years in advance, all the capacity  years in advance to supply the iPhone and there's not, you know, nowhere to go.

So but the good news is that not everybody is going to appreciate that two millimeter bezel  and not a lot of people are not willing to pay extra money for that two millimeter bezel.  So there's a there's there's a lot of room for people who for companies  that want to just manufacture commodity phones, like people who buy new phones,  not because they're enticed by, hey, the new periscope camera.  Oh, my goodness. Look, look at this.  Four layer acronym for this new manufacturing technique, which is very, very significant  to people who are very, very into that stuff.  But people who drop their phone in the toilet or they or they they broke their screen  one time too many and they're back in the Verizon store with like, what can I get  without having on a two year plan for free?  And those and now those phones are amazing. They're awesome. Awesome.  I keep reflecting back on the fact that smartphones are now so the manufacturing  and design process and the procurement process for each component is now so on lock  that people who are economically disadvantaged in this country, you can  they can get a free smartphone that is certainly not an iPhone 15 or 14,  but it's an iPhone seven, eight or nine.  And that is pretty damn good.

And now they're, according to German, going to put titanium or looking at  they've always wanted to have titanium edges on the outside of the iPhone.  And they've been doing that in the watches.  And that, according to German, was a test for bringing titanium to the  higher volume device.  So they're going to replace these shiny fingerprint prone steel

Transcript:  stainless steel edges. Heavy, heavy stainless steel.  Titanium is so much lighter.  And anybody who's a longtime Apple person will remember back when Apple didn't  have a team of metal or just on staff and it painted,  put white paint on titanium and the titanium power book.  Well, they don't do that stuff anymore.  Titanium is anodizable just like aluminum is so they can impart color onto it  as part of the anodization process.  And I mean, I've got a titanium Apple watch. It is so light.  It is such a light material.  And I think the worst thing about the pro phones the last few years.  Well, the not colorful right is part of it.  And that is a Apple philosophy thing.  But also part of it is they're just so heavy.  They're really heavy and the stainless steel does not help.  So going to titanium, they can call it, you know, I'm sure they'll invent  some magical like let me tell you about the alloy that we built.  It's off the periodic table. It's so great.  But in the end, that benefits the user because you made a lighter phone.  Right. Like that's that's a win.

I still think that there's a difference between the expectations of people  who are spending five, six, seven hundred dollars on a watch  and people are spending a thousand, eleven hundred, twelve hundred dollars  on a phone like do people.  And I'm asking this as a question.  I'm not saying that saying this is a statement that are there parts of the market  that says, I don't want if this is a light, if you if you congratulations,  you just made this eight hundred dollar watch a lot, lot lighter.  I wasn't I didn't mind the weight of the original watch.  And now it feels chintzy.  It doesn't feel like I've got this big, meaty chunk of metal on my pack  with gears and technology on my wrist.  It's not a statement anymore.  It's a it's a rational.  It's a rational solution to a pressing engineering problem that affects real people.  And that's not that's not what I want as a watch consumer.  I want a big chunk of unobtainium.

So if you were looking forward to bongo,  this is the code name.  Those are those buttons, right?  Bongo buttons. Yeah.  Oh, I get it. Like a bongo drum.  Apple planned another major feature.  Mark Gurman writes in his power on newsletter on Bloomberg.  Only four hundred dollars a year.  Apple planned another major feature.  I spend the money so you don't have to.  Apple planned another major feature for this year's pro models.  Touch sensitive buttons with haptic feedback for the volume controls,  the mute ring switch and the power button like track pads on the Mac.  The buttons would not actually move,  allowing new software tricks and reducing the number of breakable components  on the device. The enhancement code named bongo was canceled.

Turn the mute ring switch to these into a so-called action button  like on the Apple Watch. OK.  What else should we what else can we say based on this power on newsletter?  There's code in iOS 17 that hints at options for the action button.  You'll be able to choose, according to Steve Moser at Mac Rumors,  from several possibilities.  Mute, of course, will still stay there for people like a physical mute button.  The focus mode like do not disturb.  That's better than mute, right?  Because I could say, you know, I could have a little more control over what it is.  Launching the camera, turning on the flashlight.  If you use the flashlight a lot, I use it a surprisingly lot.

Not that I've ever felt like my iPhone slow, but.

The possibility there, especially if if they have a periscope camera  and some of them that carves out some battery space.  You're right. You would you would potentially benefit from that.  Sounds like the chips are going up.  The Apple Watch is going to get a substantial chip update  for the first time in like four years.  That's because they need Alex to buy a new one.  Yeah, that processor processor.  So so yeah, it sounds like there's a lot of kind of like chip updates.  But yeah, I always Mark Gurman is running into the same thing.  All of us who write about computers run into, which is how do you describe  the benefit of the new three nanometer chip that's going to be in the iPhone Pro?  And I think he says he literally says so it'll be snappier,  which is the sound of giving up. Right.  That is like, I don't know, faster, whatever,  because they're all so fast now.  And it's like, yeah, yeah, it'll be faster.  It's got the snappy. Great. Excellent.

Transcript:  That's that's pretty is it is it going to be I mean, is it though?  Is it really are you going to pick up a brand new pro iPhone and be like, oh,  it's so snappy compared to the one last year, which is slightly less snappy than this.  It's like, I mean, but it will be.  And obviously, I mean, because these days, all the basic tasks are so fast that,  you know, the human eye can't even notice it.  It's going to be like enabling new features and lots of background computations  that would never have been possible before.  And like, there's a lot there.  But I just thought it was kind of funny because at some point, your editor says,  you got it, Mark, you got to say why this is relevant, right?  You can't just say it's a new chip. You got to say why.  And he's like, oh, let's just say it's snappier. All right.  OK, it's snappier.  That's a good word is on the three nanometer process.  So, yeah, there could be a lot of interesting quirks about that,  including better power consumption issues and things like that.

God, I just hate that website so freaking much.  The last time I tried it, I was screenshotting like every step of the way  and noticing that, OK, I don't want to spend more than more than I'm spending  right now. Great.

And it's like somehow seventy five dollars more than it was in the screen before.  And I'm going to have to unwind all of this to figure out how you decided  that you've tacked on seventy dollars worth of extra stuff between A and B.  And then I just simply realize that, OK, what I've got right now is fine for now.  I'm going to get to this.  But I'm I'm just I'm just out of energy to solve this.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, the flip phones are really where the action is right now, because right now  it's the only place where you can walk in with the same amount of budget  you would for a premium smartphone and walk out with a folding phone.  You still get for a thousand bucks.  You can get a phone that's pretty much exactly like what you would get  in an eight hundred dollar feature for eight hundred dollar smartphone  on any platform. Only not only does it fold in half,  which makes it like a chunky, a chunky folded phone,  but at least something you can stick in more pockets and more purses.  But also the form factor of having like a separate external display  that can act sort of like an Apple watch, you know, that can basically be  be showing you a widget when really all you need on your desk  at this moment during a meeting is I just want a widget that's keeping  me track of keeping track of the time or that will very, very quickly flash  that, oh, by the way, here's the next thing that you need to address in 15 minutes.  Or here's your next appointment.  There's a lot of room for design innovation that I'm a goodness.  You just you just want to see what Apple would do with that.  And I think that the prices are now coming down where it's actually a practical thing.  I would love I would absolutely love to see a traditional folding iPhone  where I can get either I can either have an iPad Mini or a conventional iPhone,  but not at like eighteen hundred dollars.  Right. And or Andy, you could have an actual iPad Mini and an actual iPhone.  And because right now, folding large, large scale folding phones,  they're almost as good as a tablet and they're almost as good as a regular  smartphone, but there are compromises on both.  And that's not worth eighteen hundred dollars to me.  But realize that now Samsung has to be applauded after absolutely  just falling into a canal with the first release of their of their folding phone.  Now they're on generation five.  And I wouldn't say they've got every single problem worked out.  But now you don't you no longer have to be a technology forward person  in order to in order to invest in one of these phones.  You have just have to be a person who can make a really good case for.  I occasionally need a bigger screen just for five or ten minutes  several times during the day.  It doesn't merit me having a separate mini tablet with me.  It doesn't merit having having a laptop with me.  But this ability to really rock it through some spreadsheets  or rock it through some documents I need to process.  Those several times a day that I need them.  That to me is worth a six hundred seven hundred dollar premium.  And they will sell you a very good working phone that is.  And I was it's it's it's an actually IP68 resistant or no.

Like you should you should get it and enjoy it rather than waiting around  until next spring sometime. Right.  I mean, if you're fine.  But if you're asking the question, it says to me that maybe it's time for an upgrade  and that you don't it's not going to make a difference if it's if it's an eight  month old iPad. Right.  Like it's still going to be way more than what you have.  It'll be snappier.  It will be so much.  It'll be like eight snaps snappier now with more.

But but because I'm I know that I'm going to get not going to do anything near  what they're capable of.  And so that they're they're so overbuilt now.  They went from being really underbuilt to being completely overbuilt  for what 99 percent people are going to use them for.  But I just feel like I can buy a Mac mini at any point in time  when I need another computer.  But for everything else, I kind of wait until the release happens.  And then I if it's a brand new build, I will not buy it first.  OK, I will.  I'll let some I'll let the front line of people buying and I'll let them  I'll give them a couple of months and wait for a point one release.  And then but outside of that, like with phones, with any computer  that's been out for a while, that they haven't really changed a major  major design change, I just wait until the update.  And that's the time to buy because it's going to be the newest thing  unless you really need it.

Transcript:  And that's that's an interesting idea about what Apple would go for.  Would they go for like a 12.9 inch iPad that folds for storage  in your in your bag to the size of an iPad mini?  Or would they actually be looking for something that's more like the  like the convertible stuff we've been seeing from from Windows manufacturers  where, yes, it's a tablet, but if you fold it into tent mode  and have sort of like a half sized easel sort of thing or even have a one  surface for controls and user interface, the other surface for actual content.  And I don't know exactly how Apple would want to go about that.

Transcript:  And they've been experimenting with, according to Gurman's reports,  with laptops using folding technology and laptops already fold,  but foldable displays to do something.  And I don't know whether that's just to have a much larger external display  that is a computer that you could then just attach a peripheral to  or whether that's more like they wanted to be sort of a tablet  when it's not a laptop is unclear as well.  I mean, going back, going back to the iPad, that buying question for a moment.  I just wanted to point out  the the 10th generation iPad was a major hardware update  from the ninth generation.  They lost those big bezels at the top and the bottom.  So like, you know, the next one, when it does come,  is not going to be very different, right, because they just refreshed it.  So I think that they still sell the old one for three twenty nine.  That maybe I wouldn't buy unless you absolutely want to spend  the least on an iPad right now.  But that new 10th generation one is pretty great.  And it's not going to get even if it was coming out this fall.  Like, it's not going to be much.  They might update the chip a little bit, but that's about it.

No, they're mad because Apple  shockingly uses advertising data to sell ads.  What? Shocking.  What is wrong with you, Apple?  This is not the only complaint out of the EU.  Google got in trouble, too.  I don't you know, this is.  I'm not I it's kind of how everything works.  You don't just sell you just throw an ad at somebody.  You try to throw an ad at somebody who might be interested in your product.  I mean, we can't we we can't track who's watching this show.  So our ads.  Well, actually, that is different because we're starting to use  and you'll see in the third ad spot on this show, direct ad insertion.  And they at least know what geographic location you're from.  I've had people tell me they've listened to our shows in Spain  and receive Spanish language adverts, which to me is working.  Right. That's what you want.  With and when that happens, you still they don't still don't know a lot about you.  They just know what IP address you have, which and and Geo locate you based on that.  The statement of objection, it targets  a plus pro practices in the sector of app distribution.  This came out today.  Apple's accused of abusing its dominant position  by implementing discriminatory, non objective and non transparent conditions  for the use of user data for advertising purposes.  The issue is that Apple has first party information.  So they they of course they have a T.T.  By the way, Apple also got in trouble for a T.T.  I can't remember which country that was in the EU.  But Apple, the reason they got in trouble for a T.T. was, oh, yeah,  you block tracking for other people, but not yourself.

Transcript:  I know. So that was in Germany last year.  Germany's antitrust watchdog opened a promo to Apple's advertising technology,  claiming the firm's terms of use unfairly favor Apple's own services.  That's just crazy.  EU antitrust officials are looking into whether the firm has restricted access  to the NFC, to their own Apple Pay and other payment systems.  There's also a long running probe into how Apple may have hampered music streaming  companies like Spotify from telling users about deals outside of the app store.  This is that you can't have a link to your own store in the app.

Transcript:  Right. I mean, some of these are ridiculous, but some of these are not  entirely unreasonable, right?  Like some of these are investigating the idea that Apple has defined  fairness and privacy and all of these things as being a bond  between the user of a phone and Apple because Apple makes the phone.  And it leads down a lot of that's not unreasonable on one level,  but it leads down a lot of paths sort of like this means that Apple  can close the door on competition and then and then do it itself.  And so you see that app tracking transparency.  The knock is not that it isn't a good feature.  The knock is that Apple as the first party has defined itself out of that  and can still do targeting, right, because it's a first party relationship  instead of a third party relationship with Facebook.  Do we think that's OK?

Transcript:  No, they're and and the big thing is what I think  my understanding of AT&T, maybe it's off, is that they can't sell that data again.  Like, that's the thing that, you know, Facebook wants to do is take that data  and then they want to sell it to Safeway and then they want to buy  or, you know, put it on the market.  And that's what the whole like, can we sell your data  is a different thing than can we use your data?  That's a very different, different.  These are two different things, which, you know, most.  Yeah, I do think that a lot of their competition is is using it internally

Start time: 3974.62

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  because it's about just seeing their own products, right?  They don't want to give away the store.  They want to want people to come to Facebook or Google and sell.  And they don't want to give away their data.  They just want to sell ads and place the ads.  And the argument is that it is Apple acting like,  you know, a protector, but also doing something that's anti-competitive.  It's similar to saying you can't, you know, we need to take the percentage away  from sales in app purchases.  But what that effectively does when they launch their own bookstore  is mean that only the Apple bookstore can ever possibly exist on the device  because they're they're their own middleman there.  So that I mean, they have good.  I feel like they have good reasons for doing it, but it does sometimes  lead them down to the path where like, oh, but also this benefits us.  Facebook sells specifically.

Instead, based on the information we have, advertisers and other partners pay us  to show you personalized ads and because and they don't want to sell it  because that's the that's the the gold that Facebook has.  I'm sure Google is similar.  However, we know people like your ISPs and and Verizon  are selling data to data brokers.  In fact, Congress is kind of finally.  I hope they act on this trying to shut down these data brokers,  because that's really there's the real privacy problem,  which is aggregating data and then selling it on to to.  By the way, not just advertisers, but to the NSA.  The NSA is buying this information.

And so the the Peter Teals  spy company. Yeah. Yeah.  Someone I was talking to someone about, like, you know, the whole idea  that you are you're talking to someone about something.  And then the next thing you know, you're getting ads about it.  And I was talking to someone who knew something about that.  And they're like, no, we don't need to listen to you talk about it.  We just need the two of you are sitting next to each other.  They did a search 10 minutes later or while you were talking.  And we just know that the two of you are talking like and not from your audio,  just because you're you have a behavior that looks like standing  from the accelerometer and you're standing right next to them.  And there's like and that was scarier to me than  than the listening to my audio is that that's the level of which  and then they can look at the entire branch of both of you and how you relate.  And that's the data level of data that's kind of floating around there.  But I will say that I just think that advertise Apple's making so much money  in so many places that the advertising market is an unforced error.  Like, I just feel like they they should not be doing this.  Like they they should just stay out.  Like, this would be a lot simpler if Apple didn't didn't do this.  I feel like it's a dirty place for them to be  and that they shouldn't they just shouldn't go there.  Like that there's so many other places where it's a clean kill.  Like they they have a clean way of doing this.  And this is there. This is really messy.  Like, it's just really it's a it's a foggy place for them to be in.  And I think that they they they'd be smart to pull out.

Transcript:  This is a paper from the University of California.  Berkeley came out a couple of years ago, Chris Hoofnagle.  They claim not to sell data, but Facebook and Google have paid developers with data.  This is before ATT came out.  The selling of your personal data is central to platform economics.  Basically, by providing developers with APIs that can investigate users,  they're not exactly selling it.  There's no coinage being exchanged, but they are.  This is how you get developers on your platform.  Developers, he writes, privileged access to user data is a sale.  Well, no money trades hands.  A sale only requires a transfer of value.  Sales include barters, promises to pay in a way.  It's a it's a barter and platforms need it.  Now, I don't know if ATT changed that equation  or not, maybe it did.  But but but Facebook and Google do not have ATT.

Start time: 4207.88
End time: 4299.12
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So, I mean, the argument is that Apple, it's ATT is about tracking, right?  It's not about selling your personal data.  It's about tracking you and building a profile.  And what Apple wants to say is on our platform, apps are not going to be able to  do that level of tracking.  So therefore, they're not watching you.  So therefore, you should feel better. Right.  At the same time.  And we've talked about these stories here over the last year and beyond.  Apple knows a lot about you itself.  And Apple doesn't consider that a problem.  Apple says, well, no, you already have a relationship with us and you understand.  And we know what apps you buy and all of those things.  And we'll feed you ads in the app store based on your behavior in the app store  and all of that. And that's just, you know, that's your relationship with Apple.  That's not a random relationship.  And while I think there is some accuracy in that philosophy  by by banning one company or one set of companies business  and then ramping up its own advertising machinery.  Like Alex said, it's a bit of an own goal, because now it doesn't sound like you're  doing it just to protect the user.  You're also then filling the vacuum with your own profit making apparatus,  which is why I mentioned something like the Kindle store not being able to be  on Apple's platforms or, you know, you name it.  There are lots of places where Apple does something that is right, I think,  and is a good idea.  And then they say, oh, and you know, now there's nobody there except us.  So we can make more money that way.  And that's when it starts to get weird.  And that's when I see some of these European regulators step in and I say,  yeah, maybe so. Fair enough.

Start time: 4299.68

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, there are a lot of areas like this.  This is one of the few real vulnerabilities that Apple has that they really have to be  held to account to say that, OK, you're to your answer to the question.  You're only allowing your own products to have this access to this piece of hardware  inside the iPhone. You're not allowing anybody else to have it.  And even even music services and other services that you are directly competing with.  And your explanation for why you should do that, why you can do that shouldn't be,  oh, well, you can trust us like, no, you're going to have to prove.  In a court that you're what you're doing is OK.  And then you have to prove to people who are very, very skeptical and people who in  principle don't want to have you do that.  So as usual, Apple might be right.  Apple might be wrong. The only thing that I know for sure is that they should be  forced to explain themselves and not to simply say, oh, we're just two hippies in a  garage where we want to improve the world for everybody.  It's like, OK, but you're also too drawing a company and we trust us is not it's not  going to be legally binding in the EU.

Transcript:  Right. But but but the difference is, is what what Apple's saying is that that if you  as a user approve that that's fine.  But if you don't approve it, it basically says they can't take your data and then give  it to somebody else that you don't know.  Like that's the big thing is that you're allowed.  You know, Apple's allowing you to have give data to companies that you approve to have  your you know, that you said, I'll give you my data, my tracking data, my whatever,  whatever the data is.  But you have to approve then as well as a user that they can take that data and run  with it and give it to somebody else.  That's the thing that Apple's cut off is that you can't you can't.  So the reality is, is that they're not they truly aren't doing anything different than  what they're giving other companies of the ability to do.  You know, that first party data, if you're using Facebook, that first party data is still  something that Facebook can do.  It's the repackaging of your data that Apple has turned off.  So that's what's and that's what everybody's, you know, upset about is that they, you know,  and Apple saying if and the user just has to approve it like they prove it has to approve  that you can sell my data to other people and 75 percent or 80 percent of the users  say no. And I think I think that that what I will say is that I think that it's good  for, you know, from a user perspective, I want to be able to I want Apple to say, do  you want to use this or do you want them to do this or not?  And if I say yes, then more power to them.  But most people are going to say no.  And but I still think that even though I think that Apple's right in that area, in the ATT  area, I think it'd be a lot cleaner for them and there'd be a lot less trouble.  I mean, I think Apple's biggest concern over the next decade, and I've said this over and  over again, is antitrust.  It's the government's it's no longer they're not competing with they're not competing  with their peers anymore. They're just it's their peers trying to slow them down.  You know, and the problem with the EU is they have nothing to lose.  They don't have any major they don't have any of these companies that hold any of these  platforms. And so they're kind of free run to make whatever laws they want, because it's  not going to affect any of their companies.

Apple's not even close to that.  No, I know. And they're saying, no, but you can be dominant enough in a market that you  that you need to be reigned in a little bit.  I mean, they're literally looking at breaking up companies at this point.  What was it? Was it Google? Who would they want to break up?

Transcript:  Yeah. One of the things Apple was a story I don't have in front of me was that Apple  was going to demand developers ask for permission before they start using.  Oh, I do have in front of me APIs.  Apple store App Store required developers to describe why their apps use certain APIs.  I think this is a good thing, right?  This is the next step after intense because didn't you have to don't you have to as a  developer say we're going to use this, this and this.  This is these attempts.  Apple says to prevent the misuse of certain APIs that can be used to collect data about  users devices through fingerprinting.  You'll need to declare the reasons for using these APIs in your apps privacy manifest.  This will assure the apps only use these APIs for their intended purpose.  And that's, by the way, in the face of Google looking like they're moving towards a  replacement for cookies that is a really kind of a dire fingerprinting technology.

We're going to do it by disguising it inside a proposal for a way to keep the Internet  more private and secure.  And one of those offshoots should is going to be that any code that runs inside that  browser can say, oh, well, I'm sorry, but I have to I'm not I'm not going to I'm not  going to execute the code on this site unless you have this ad blocker turned off, which  I am now available.

Google's nightmare web integrity API wants a DRM gatekeeper for the web.  It's just a proposal, but it's coming to Chrome.  So in a way, this is this web and they call it the Web Environment Integrity API.  And in a way, it's sort of like ask Apple asking developers, well, why do you want to  know this? The difference is Google's saying you should use this.

Start time: 4692.50

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple. Apple is always in a great position because they they never have to defend  the idea that what we're doing is we're we make 80 percent of our money off of advertising.  And what we're trying to do is make sure that that nest egg never goes away.  And so this is what when you look at one of the things that you have to you have to look  at with Metta's Threads app is, goodness gracious, what a great tool Apple has given  the entire community by saying, by the way, here is the here is the nutritional value  of all the privacy stuff going on with this app.  And Threads is a Christmas tree of every single thing they want your health information.  Yeah. And it really is all about, well, either a the principle on Facebook that if this  information we want it, but also because as you as you as you mentioned, it's  fingerprinting, the more data it has, the more the more it can identify your device  despite whatever is going on. So if Apple is now saying, OK, we understand why you need  the ability to write information to the screen and to access to the camera, everything  else, we're going to have to have a long lunch about this and you're going to have to  you're going to have to explain to us why you need health information.

The usage went way down.  I just want to I just want to grab my my my make sure that I don't lose my handle.  And then I, you know, so you just go up there, claim your handle and then leave.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So there's there's a nuance to this issue with with Apple asking for, you know,  disclosures is, you know, are people reading the warning labels?  Maybe not. But what they are doing is app developers are making a basically a legal  claim under the rules of the developer agreement that what they are submitting is true.  And what that does is it puts a little added pressure on them because Apple can reject  their apps, pull their apps from the store, kick them off the store.  And so it is a way it is it is an honor system, but it's also this like we caught you in  a lie. And so you better tell the truth, because if we catch you, we are all powerful and  we can destroy you. Right. Like that's sort of what the dynamic is there.  So it's not the labels are there, but the labels also serve as a, you know, you claimed  this, did this. And so the new thing about having the reason why you use these new APIs  that is coming where you're going to say, like, why do you want to know about the creation  date of a particular file or how long the system uptime has been on, which is very much  the same idea as browsers used to or websites used to look at what fonts were in your  browser and use it to fingerprint you.  And so now Safari lies about what fonts you have because they're trying to protect you  from that. It's a little like that, where you could say, no, no, no, no, no, we're using  that for good. But you have to know that if you're using it for evil and somebody notices  Apple is going to say you are in violation of your developer agreement.  The problem with this story is that one of the APIs that they listed is literally how you  say preferences. And that means that unless they change that rule, every single app in the  app store is going to have to submit one of these and say, I use it to save preferences,  which is dumb. So I hope that they make some tweaks there because nobody wants to do that.  And it will serve nobody if everybody is filing a generic boilerplate statement that just  says, I use the preference saving API to save preferences.  So we'll have to see about that.  But I do think that that is part of it here is it's like you're in a legal agreement with us.  Don't don't lie to Mr. Apple.  Right. Like, don't do it.  Don't do it.

And I think that I think that the GDPR as well, like when you when you do  the like I'm not going because I never agree to any of the GDPR stuff, I always turn it off and I  always get frustrated with sites that like try to hide it behind something or whatever.  And that's gotten to be easier. But when you open it up and you like open up PG&E and it's like we  can't can we sell your data?  I'm like, really? Like really PG&E is selling my data like you.

So it's trying to do like Zoom would like access to data from other applications on your system.  I'm like, no, what are you talking about?  Right. And I love that disclosure because they're giving you the action of being able to say no,  like, no, you can't have it.

Right.  Exactly. Exactly. And so the thing is, is that it is a and what we're seeing is a multi-year,  very slow cinching of privacy.  Apple is not doing this all at one time.  And every year they're just going to keep on turning that screw to close it off because they've  got nothing to lose.  You know, they're not you know, and they know that they can.  This is a key competitive thing because Google can't do that.  Google is based on your data.  So you know, so Apple knows that it can just keep on turning the screw and there's the Android  platform can't do what they're doing.

Do you check every app as it comes in for for whether it follows app policies or do  you only do it when there's a complaint about it?  And so you've also sneaking in some stuff about, hey, you fast, you gave Baidu like a  fast track to approval process, which a need I remind you, Baidu is a Chinese communist  company, a country.  Do you do you why do you explain exactly why you did that?

But if again, imagine a future world in which there is actually legitimate use of  blockchains.  Should Apple base basically say that anytime there's a gas fees are not just profit  taking there.  Here is the expense of actually doing this work on a block chain.  Does Apple simply is Apple going to say that, oh, well, you've since you transferred  like five thousand dollars from one account in your bank to another account in one of  your other banks using your banking app, we're entitled to 30 percent of whatever fees  had to be charged in order to make that happen.  It's not a one to one analogy, but it's it's the letter was a signed by two bipartisan  bipartisan members.  So it's not it's if there's silliness, it's still it's not bipartisan silliness.

Speaking of tracking, Android and Apple have made a deal to warn you about  Bluetooth trackers traveling with you.  Google made a big deal about announcing it at Google I.O.  and they are working with Apple.  They announced their intention to draft an industry wide standard focused on how  users could be alerted to unwanted tracking.  There's a problem with Android because you have to actually run an app to see an  air tag.  So I'm reading this great article.  I'm thinking, yeah, right on.  Good.  Good.  And then get to the last paragraph.  Today, however, Google says this update is on hold.  The decision was made to roll out these updates because Google is now working in  partnership with Apple to finalize the joint unwanted tracker alert  specification by year end.  So they had something they were going to roll out and find my device on Android.

Start time: 5803.10
End time: 5805.09
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't know we had it.  So you'd have to have iOS 17.

Start time: 5806.94
End time: 5840.34
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Right, and a lot of people have been turning off that feature  and they've been reporting directly from people who have been using it  in 9to5Mac and other sites, and also just regular users saying,  I've got a survey asking why I turned this feature off.  Does it have to do with it was more complicated?  It wasn't working for me.  It's not relevant to me.  And that just shows what goes through like a public beta.  They really want to know.  They've got this whole thing wired up and they are watching every touch,  every usage of every feature to figure out,  we thought this would go gangbusters, but people are actually disabling it.

Start time: 5840.46
End time: 5861.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why they do betas.  So this conversation awareness, the way it works,  you've got to have an updated firmware on your AirPods Pro.  You've got to have iOS 17 on your iPhone.  If somebody's talking to you, it lowers the music volume,  it turns on transparency, and it kind of aims the microphones  of the person talking to you.  So they're almost like hearing aids, right?  You can have a conversation without doing anything.

Start time: 5862.06
End time: 5942.97
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, in theory, although I believe conversational awareness,  you need to talk.  I don't think that somebody else talking keys it.  It has to be conversation.  I got the form.  I filled it out too, and I also disabled that feature.  Why?  So I used it on an airplane that worked great because  you want to hear the flight attendant.  And I would say what's going on and it would drop and all of that.  And that was pretty cool.  That was a good idea.  And then after a little while, when the talking stops, it goes back up.  But for me, it was like I was walking the dog and I would tell her to stop or wait.  And it would be like, oh, oh, conversation's happening.  And I had to turn it off because like it was hearing my voice just blurred out a word  and decided that I was about to have a conversation.  So that's why I turned it off.  It's an interesting idea.  I don't know.  I mean, I wonder how many I wonder how much data they're looking at in these betas because  it's clear that this is a like machine learning model  trying to interpret when there's a conversation going on.  It's a really good idea.  I actually would use it when I'm out of a dog walking context more.  But it's got some issues and it looks like what I love is that they rolled it out.  And then they're like, oh, can we can we push a form to everybody asking them why they don't  use this feature?  And they did.  And they collected data.  I've never seen that before.  That's the way it should be done.

Start time: 5943.56
End time: 5954.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One of the choices in the survey, if you've turned it off, is how would you like us to  make it better?  Disallow conversational awareness from activating when I speak to myself or sing.

Transcript:  Actually, if you sing along to music and it turns the music down, that is not what you  want.  I have to say most of the time, I don't want to hear what people around me are saying.  I turn on.  That's why I turn on noise cancellation and turn up the music.  And so I can see that's why I would turn it off is like, well, I'm trying to listen.

Start time: 5987.56
End time: 5995.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can't you just you just press the stem once to stop the music and press and hold the turn  on transparency and now you have a conversation.  It's not that harsh.

Start time: 5996.35
End time: 6030.30
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Sure.  But I mean, it is that's two steps, right?  And if you have the ability to do, although they also have that other feature now where  they're trying to like split the difference between noise canceling and transparency to  make it a little more suppressed, but also some stuff leads through.  That's an interesting feature that I'm not quite sure entirely works either.  Yeah, you're listening to your music on the airplane and then the flight attendant wants  to know if you want any snacks, right?  And it's kind of nice to be able to say, oh, what do you have?  Oh, I'll have a Diet Coke or whatever.  It's kind of having to be like, oh, hold on, let me take them out.  Yeah, I just go, hey, what?

Transcript:  So, I mean, this gets back into something we've discussed in the past is that whatever  you control, whatever you're making money on, you want to control, whatever is going  to cost you money or make it hard for you, you want to commoditize.  Yeah.  So when you see a bunch of big corporations wanting to get an open platform, what they  want to do is make this easy for all of them to pass stuff between themselves and not have  it be expensive or painful and not have a lot of roadblocks.  USDZ is the universal scene description.  This was created by Pixar to move whole scenes.  So it doesn't just move the models.  It moves models, lighting, animation, textures, surfaces, all of those things from one place  to another.  It was made it very portable internally.  Apple then moved it forward a little bit and USDZ has been slowly rolling out to replace  things like FBX and other things that have been used in these formats.  But Apple then created USDZ, which was just zipping that file up so that you could move  things around.  But now they're kind of, I think that I feel like they're backing away from USDZ and really  just going towards you because it's hard to get that support.  And so I think that they're going, we'll just go back to USD, but we're getting, they're  gaining support from basically all the major manufacturers that are doing it.  Let's just all use the same format to move things between each other.  And this is going to make it much easier to do things in the, that's Nvidia and Apple  have a really vested interest because this means that it's easy for them for their omniverse  and for the new headset and all the AR stuff to be able to get stuff in there and not have  to like right now there's like a, there's a reality converter and that takes many other  formats and converts it to USDZ for Apple.  What Apple would like is people just to generate that content.  It's been a real challenge for Apple to get proper generation of USDZ data for the AR  stuff coming out natively.  Usually you're still going through something or it's not quite, it's like weird.  I don't know if it's still this way, but for a while in Adobe Substance, you would export  out something that used USDZ as a quote unquote texture map.  And you'd think it would all come in pieces, but it came out with one model.  But it was like almost a side product.  It was just a very odd way to get it out.  And so in a lot of ways, this is just an alliance for them to start really building up a centralized  way.  You know, it's like, let's just use QuickTime or not QuickTime.  Let's use Apache or something like that.  Or we just want to make this easy for everybody because that's not where we're making money.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  They just zipped it because the problem is USDZ is really a package and it can get, it  can blow apart.  So the problem, like if you take a, if you, if you save out a logic file and it looks  like a file, but if you push it up onto Frame.io, it just blows up into all the folders that  were inside that package.  So by zipping it and treating that zip like a file, a true file, it makes it more, Apple  realized it would make it more transportable and easier to go through things without getting,  without the folders being ripped apart.  So I don't know if they're, I don't know where the USDZ part of this is going because  Apple at the last WWDC talked very little about USDZ and a lot about USD.  And this is open USD.  So I think that part of it is other folks don't necessarily want to work with that  platform, that format.  I think it's a little slower.  And, and so, so anyway, so I think that that's the, that's my understanding of it anyway.  So, but I think it's a really good move.  I think it's great that they're, everybody's agreeing on this.  USD was invented at Pixar.

But then MPEG has all these, you know, copy, you know, these  Patent and compliments.  And encumberments and all these patents.  And so what they're saying is let's not do that.  Let's just make it.  Let's just let everybody use it.  So like, let's not because because you have all these other things growing up, you know,  AV1 is the next generation and it's designed to not use any of the MPEG stuff, you know?  And so, so the, so I think a lot of people don't want to have things that are specifically  encumbered by patents.

He feels as though on the apps music is animized into bits,  stripped of biography, history and iconography.  Even from a predatory capitalist standpoint, streaming makes little sense.  Spotify is yet to turn a profit.  Despite generating more than $12 billion of revenue, all the same,  the magical ability to summon millions of songs and symphony in the palm of one's hand has  proved irresistible.  The seduction of convenience wears down ethical resistance.

Transcript:  We, we like Apple.  Well, we loved prime phonic, which Apple bought, put out of business.  And then 18 months later came up with Apple classical.  Is it as good as a prime phonic Andy?

Start time: 6796.25
End time: 7006.90
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I'd say so.  It's hard to remember because remember they should,  they shut down prime phonic soon after they bought it.  I mean, it's, it's definitely, it's definitely an improvement,  a needed improvement for a type of music that isn't well served by a conventional streaming app.  It's not so much the service so much as the app that expects everything to be  really categorized very neatly and very cleanly with a very small number of,  of tags associated with it.  Whereas with classical music, you start off with the problem that if you,  if you try to stick a track from a classical recording into the same display user interface  that was designed for pop music, congratulations, you, a lot of this,  a lot of the track information is organized as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,  Le Nozze De Figaro, directed by blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then you get to the name of the actual song.  And so the, the, the Aria is pretty much over with by the time the actual  name of the piece of music you're actually seeing actually scrolls into view to say nothing of the  fact that there are lots of different entry points that people are looking for.  So if I mean, my, my particular knowledge is, is operand using these apps.  And sometimes I, sometimes I want to hear specifically Joyce DiDonato,  but the problem is that if I ask for everything by Joyce DiDonato,  I only get like the handful of albums that she's recorded strictly as a solo artist,  even when she's done a program with Il Pomodoro d'Oro, it's like, okay, well, no, that's,  you asked me for Joyce DiDonato. You can't blame me for not finding Joyce DiDonato with Il Pomodoro d'Oro.  Is it listed as the creator of, is the creator listed as the direct,  excuse me, as the conductor? Is it listed as the symphony orchestra?  It's kind of a mess. And so just simply having a different app that acknowledges that, okay,  the queries for people trying to find things is, are going to be different.  The interface is going to have to be a little bit different. And also for people who are not into  classical, it takes a long, long time to find that entry points like jazz in that sense, where like,  I, hey, I heard a piece of jazz music just like, you know, on the radio or whatever.  I don't listen to much jazz. Where's my entry point here? You need people who can write essays  and can write a playlist that will figure out, hey, here's what, if you're interested in opera,  if this, if the winner of America's Got Talent singing a slightly ropey version of  Naysan Dhorma got you interested in opera, here is like 10 tracks that will get you kind of  interested in exactly what this stuff can do. So I think it's very, very good. I just, I flag this  because I just thought the attitude of someone who, if most of the people who are writing essays,  not even reviews about streaming music services, get into very, very practical and tactile sort  of things with it. Like, oh, well, unfortunately it makes it really hard to find this album.  It automatically, I can add things to my queue, but as soon as I switch to a new album, I lose  that queue. His, he just seemed to have a philosophical, I can't put myself in the unisex  crocs of a young person exploring classical music for the first time, but gobble classical  strikes me as an oddly clumsy point of entry. He actually wrote that. I can't put myself in  the unisex crocs of a young person. Alex, please.

Transcript:  there's an opportunity there for people who are interested in like live streaming or getting  access to past live streams of like really great performances. That's, I mean, I used to subscribe  to a metropolitan opera has their own streaming service where almost everything that's ever been  like live at Lincoln center on the old PBS show or recorded for their modern like live in HD  theater productions is now streamable. So if you've like, if you've heard me like saying,  interesting, nice things about again, Joyce DiDonato and Renee Fleming in, oh God, was it?  They did. They were in a, I'm sorry. I can never find, I can never locate a word when I absolutely  needed. I'm sorry. But yeah, they had a premiere opera last year. That was really the highlight,  the season for me. And if you're interested in that, then you can go to their streaming service  and actually rent it or actually use it. That's nice. But I'm never, you'd have to be really,  really particular, I think to note, to know that I want specifically this two hour concert program  from the opera festival in Beirut from three years ago, say, okay, we can do that for you. It'll  cost $200 a year and fine. If that's what you want, that's fine. But I think that, I think that  Apple classical does a really, really good job for what it needs to do. Yeah. And I think it's

Is Apple music, Spotify is still number one  and Spotify has no classic, it has classical tracks, but it really has no real support for  classical.

Transcript:  Hmm. And then finally the, the information piece on  Apple and Goldman Sachs, how the partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs  soured. We know Goldman's been trying to sell off their, all of their consumer finance products,  including the Apple card to the Apple card to American Express. This is a story from  Lauren Tara La Capra and Wayne Ma. You wrote Andy, I think that the, that the,  the piece in nine to five Mac is perhaps a little.

Start time: 7239.66

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It's the, the information piece is really good, well-sourced. That's a very good long read on  exactly how complicated this relationship was and how difficult this product was to roll out.  For people who don't want to, or at least want to want to amuse,  like a little appetizer before reading it. 95 Mac summarizes it nicely saying pulling out from the  very, very top. The fact that engineers from the Silicon Valley giant and the wall street  Titan were pulling it all night or a few months before launch scrambling to find a solution to a  problem that had cropped up. Tim Cook couldn't get approved for an Apple car. Goldman Sachs had to  do some work behind the scenes to get the Apple CEO approved for an Apple card. But it was reasonable.

Start time: 7280.22
End time: 7360.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The information says the problem stemmed from the fact that he's such a high profile figure,  he's regularly impersonated. And so if you're famous, there's a flag on your account with  credit bureaus saying, make sure it's really the person. As a result, Goldman's underwriting  system rejected him. This is according to four people familiar with the matter from the information.  Goldman was eventually able to make a one-off exception. Tim got his card. Yeah. But I got,  I got a warning, George Clooney, it's going to be hard for you. The information does point out that  it's going to be tough for Goldman to get out of this. It can't, the information writes,  offload the business without Apple's approval, which puts it in a bind because few, if any other  partners would agree to Apple's terms. American Express runs its own payment network, but the  Apple card is a deal in place to run on the MasterCard network until at least 2026. So yeah,  that might rule out American Express. Apple could even wind up partnering with a less visible bank  and handling the bulk of the work itself. I guess the issue is to be a bank requires a lot of hoops  to jump through. I know this from watching billions. You can't, you have to go through a lot  and maybe Apple is just not in the position to become a bank. Yeah. And this is the, the initial

Start time: 7360.20
End time: 7450.52
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  deal when it was first announced reminded me of the deal that Apple struck with AT&T  to launch the first iPhone where I, where AT&T correctly saw this as a huge opportunity  to, whereas they were a very, they were number two behind Verizon, but a very distinct number two.  And they needed, after another rebranding from AT&T to Singular, then right back to AT&T,  they needed a huge hit to put themselves on the map and get their subscriber based up. And that's  why they agree to all kinds of demands that Apple was making that no other phone maker could make  any movement with any existing network, such as simply, okay, we will allow you to put a real  web browser on here. Yes, we will allow you to make, to design the device yourself, as opposed to  making the device that we have designed for you and that we've decided that we can support.  And so it seemed as though Goldman Sachs was making the same kind of play where at the time,  a few years ago, they did want to really branch out into consumer finance, consumer finance products,  and they thought that a partnership with Apple was going to be the way to do it. And so perhaps  they agreed to a whole bunch of terms that taking, they were taking on a lot of responsibilities  that Apple never didn't really have to deal with. They just, they were dealing with the interface,  they were dealing with bringing customers there, but Goldman Sachs was left with all of the money  problems and all of the infrastructure problems and they are living to regret it. It wasn't just  the relationship with Apple that's going south. Remember that this was part of a full court press  towards consumer finance and they are getting out of it entirely. They're not just simply,  oh, we don't want to deal with Apple anymore. It's like, no, this was a bad play for us.

Transcript:  We lost a billion dollars in one year, according to Goldman. Part of the problem is  the deal wasn't great for Goldman. Goldman, unlike other credit card companies, does not take a cut  of the interchange fee that merchants pay to accept the Apple card. And of course, as you know,  the Apple card doesn't have fees, so they can't make money from annual fees, late fees, overseas  fees. In exchange, Apple pays for the daily cash rewards. The expectation was on Goldman's side,  the costs and revenue would essentially even out, but no, Goldman has lost a lot of money.  Goldman does earn a fee. This is all from the information. Great piece. It does earn a fee  from Apple in the high single digit percentage range of every loan issued to card holders who  opt to split the cost of Apple products over monthly installments. Maybe this is why the buy  now pay later came along. High single digit percentage, 8-9%. It's not credit card money.

He says no commercial bank that's experienced in the credit card business  is going to give Apple the same terms as Goldman did, which makes it just like AT&T with the iPhone.

Start time: 7542.80
End time: 7605.44
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, but the other difference is that they're not gaining Goldman Sachs customers. People who are  using the Apple card may not even be terribly aware that they're clients and customers of Goldman  Sachs. Whereas AT&T, they are getting new customers. The people who are buying the iPhone knew that  they're AT&T customers. They're getting billed directly from AT&T. So when AT&T decides to stack  more fees upon them or give them new offers, they have the ability to do that. So there's a lot about  this that, I mean, obviously we quickly hit the glass ceiling of understanding how finance operations  and finance corporations works. But it did seem super, super unusual for Goldman Sachs to say,  yes, we are going to enter into an agreement with Apple that no bank, no financial institution  traditionally would get into when they're trying to make a play like this. It wasn't a conservative  play by any means whatsoever. It was, again, we think that this is going to be our breakthrough.  This is going to be our icebreaker that gets us through that pack ice into this brand new market  that we desperately at that time wanted to be in. The piece is that Apple really wanted the card

Start time: 7606.10

Transcript:  just so people would buy more iPhones and would allow them to pay off their iPhones. But some  employees with an Apple question whether the company should get into the business, they brought  in a banking consultant to brief at EQ the head of Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, about how credit  cards worked. The consultant, a single down at a card lender that was under fire for targeting  people with poor credit and extending them large limits, one person attended the meeting said  afterward Apple executives weren't sure whether they wanted to green light the project given the  predatory nature of the credit card business. They wanted to make a credit card business that  was better than that. That's what ended up getting them into it. Yeah, that's why I always found that

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  even at the very beginning, I found that odd because as soon as people start saying, hey,  I'm way over my head in debt with my Apple credit card. There's a complex  season of reasons why people will get into credit card debt, but that's not a great look for Apple.  It's kind of like what we were talking about earlier that you wonder how much opportunity  Apple thought was in this business to want to do it despite all the baggage and all the problems  that were going to come into play. I have the same feeling about AirTags where how much money  they're making off of AirTags that it was worth two or three years of it being synonymous with,  hey, AirTag, congratulations, you got the, just like people do Google searches,  people used to tweet, people use Band-Aids and now people do AirTags talking. No, that's not the  free promotion we wanted. They knew there was going to be an unsolvable problem that they could  only mitigate it slightly and it makes me wonder what kind of presentation that someone made to  convince someone else that this is a big enough opportunity for us that despite unsolvable  problems we're going to take that hit because it's too much of a plus for us.

Transcript:  Yeah, there were a lot of negatives from Apple's point of view and Apple did its usual thing.  I mean, this is a new business for them. They did their usual thing. For instance,  most credit card bills come on the date you started the credit card.  Apple said, no, no, we want it to be calendar months. And Coleman said, what are you crazy?  They, Apple wanted cash back rewards to be credited instantly. But Goldman said,  we can't do that. Credit card purchases are processed in batches and not in real time.  And this is probably the most telling sentence. There wasn't much financial incentive for the

And they're like,  no, no, no, you don't understand. We do it this way for a reason. And the modernizer who's coming  in saying, you guys are doing stupid things. You should not do them. It's bad for consumers.  Let's do them a new way. And I feel like if you're Apple and you're one of the world's biggest  companies and you got all the money in the world and you have a very wealthy customer base,  you look at the financial industry, I feel like Apple does this in a lot of industries.  Like, you know, why don't we do that? Because you start to think, let's do partnerships and let's  make traditional deals. And then you look at the details of what that product would be. And you  realize it's not a product you want to be associated with. Right? It's like, we can make a crappy Apple  credit card, but it's going to be just like all the other credit cards. And why are we bothering?  Here's another example. Why don't we just do it ourselves? And they've got the money, right?  Let's just do it and see if we can make a change for the better.

Transcript:  But they still have to deal with these middlemen and all of that. Apple's, this is another example,  Apple's obsession with design also meant Goldman's legal team had to determine whether certain ideas  would fly with regulators. For example, card agreements typically need a two column box  that clearly displays a car's interest rates and fees. Apple, the designer is one of the box in a  single column, since a two column box wouldn't display well on the iPhone's narrow screen.  So it is a single column on the iPhone, although the downloadable card agreement is two columns.

Transcript:  Stuff like that is how people with like $80,000 left on their mortgage can simply like hire a  $300 lawyer to say that while you were required in this state to process this paperwork this way,  when you sold my loan to somebody else, you failed to do that. And therefore this $80,000 is now null  and void. Mistakes like that are why you have two column boxes or why you have people who have been  in this industry for 30 years and been working with people who have been in the industry for

Transcript:  50 years. It's tough. And the only way if Apple does want to find in the long run, be in financial  services, they got to learn. I guess this is how they learn and it can't hurt, it essentially can't  hurt them, right? Because first off, they got a partner to take the billion dollar loss and second,  they've got the money to do it. And I love it. It may not work, right? But I appreciate the moxie to  sort of say, wow, all these credit cards are stupid. Why? Can we make one better? And I don't

Transcript:  know if they can, but they tried. And now they have all the data. This is the thing is that they  have a ton of data. They have someone that they could throw under the bus. Goldman Sachs is  basically the red shirt, right? So they went down to the planet with a red shirt and just said,  you do this. And so then, but they set the rules so tight that Goldman Sachs can't renegotiate that.  And so I think that the issue is that they've got Goldman Sachs in this mind, but they're learning  very, very quickly how to make this all kind of work. And I think that again, when you look at  what's coming, whether the headset works or not, if they actually produce a car with all the  phones and the computers and everything else, they are still the only company in the world that may  get to a point where they, most of your loans are given to them and then redistributed to other  people in their network. It is a closed system. And that, that is a crazy thing. That's crazy  concept that Apple is the only company in the world that's ever been big enough in, since credit  cards have been out to be able to actually build something where when you borrow money from them,  they're using your money to loan it to other people to buy their products. And that's going  to be a regulatory nightmare. So like, it's going to scare a lot of people because they're suddenly  not going to need anything on the outside. So, so it's going to be really interesting to see,  but that's, I think that's where they're, that's where they're capable of getting. I don't know if

Transcript:  Wayne Ma and Lauren Tara LaCopra write that Apple could ultimately decide not to have a big name  partner and go it almost, almost alone. People familiar with the company's thinking and potential  options said the tech giant could choose a bank that is large enough to take on the Apple cards  portion of Goldman's $17 billion credit card portfolio as well as related savings accounts.  And that partner could do everything necessary for regulatory reasons, but otherwise remain  invisible to the customer. Apple could become more involved with the aspects of the business  that Goldman now manages. It sounds like because of, you know, banking regulations,  getting a bank charter isn't just about how big you are, how much money you have,  how big a brand is. Why would Apple do this before 2026? I mean, that's the hard part

Transcript:  it's going to take time for the sites to find a new solution and dissolve their marriage,  perhaps as long as 18 months. Among more than a dozen people, the information spoke to about  the potential outcomes of an exit few envision a scenario where Apple and Goldman work things out  given how much pressure Solomon, the CEO has been under still in an earnings call last week, Solomon  said the card partnership with Apple, as well as the one it has with General Motors are long term  commitments that can't be changed unilaterally. They definitely can operate better. We're working  with Apple and also GM to do that. So as much as Goldman would like to get out of the consumer  business, it can't just pull the plug. It's going to take a while. So it's a really good story,  a fascinating story. I think your best analogy, Andy is absolutely right. This is just like the  iPhones launch with AT&T. You know, Apple got huge benefit. AT&T got the exclusive Randall,  Randall, what was his name, Stevens, the CEO of AT&T said giving Apple users unlimited free data  or unlimited data forever was a huge mistake. And they deeply regret it. It really hurt the  AT&T network for a long, long time. And eventually they lost the exclusive. This wouldn't be like  that. Apple's not going to have multiple banks supporting the Apple card. But but but in the end,

Transcript:  and they were failing. And finally, a kind of nice story I remember back in 1994,  when my daughter was just two and Henry wasn't even born yet. Jennifer was pregnant. We spent  some time with Steve Jobs and his young family. And I remember Jennifer reading a kid's book to  read jobs who was roughly Abby's age was a little little around two years old.  Reed's now all grown up, of course. And he has a new venture fund, Yosemite. He's got a little  money. I think Reed inherited a little bit of money. So he's launched Yosemite, a $200 million  venture capital firm. But with a good idea. It's aimed at cancer treatments. Of course,  his dad died of pancreatic cancer. Yosemite is named after the National Park, where Steve and  Laureen got married. They've raised $200 million from a wide range of investors and institutions,  according to Apple Insider, including Sloan Memorial Kettering Cancer Center,  Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Rockefeller University and MIT.  They're looking to create new cancer treatments. My dad succumbed to cancer when I was in college  at Stanford, said Reed. He's now 31. I was pre-med because I really wanted to be a doctor and cure  people myself. But just completely candidly, it was really difficult after he passed away.  So spin off of the Emerson Collective, which is the philanthropic arm  created by Laureen Powell Jobs after Steve's passing.

Transcript:  It's my understanding that he's been doing the due diligence and talking to a bunch of people  who are involved in cancer research. I heard through the grapevine that he talked to Mike  Milken, who's really involved in the prostate cancer foundation. I kind of love that idea that  Mike Milken, who is sort of elder statesman of cancer research, is talking to Reed Jobs,  who is so young, about it's not necessarily a passing of the torch yet, but it's sort of like  going down a few generations to talk about how they're going to continue funding cancer research.

Transcript:  I think that's pretty cool. Yeah, it's a bit of a hybrid. It will operate as a for-profit business  for investments, but it's also going to kind of be a nonprofit that will offer donor-advised  funds that can provide grants to scientists and researchers. Emerson Collective, of course,  is a nonprofit. The donor fund will provide no-strings-attached grants, and then the hope  is that if you've got the grant and you come up with something, that you'll return to Yosemite  for venture funding. It's actually a really clever idea. Reed Jobs says he wasn't initially keen on  creating a VC fund, saying, quote, he'd never wanted to be a venture capitalist, but I realize  that when you're actually incubating something and putting it together, you can make a tremendous  difference in what assets are part of that, what direction it's going to take, and what the scientific  focus is going to be. Reed did get a little education in business because during the iPhone  4 fiasco, you're holding it wrong fiasco, Steve was vacationing at Kona Village in Hawaii and was  forced to come back to manage the PR hit, and he took Reed with him. I think Reed was probably  13, something like that, and he said, come on, Reed, I'm going to show you how business works.

Start time: 8464.48
End time: 8680.56
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  my pick is a really cool app that solved a big problem for me and created opportunities for me,  which is all I can ask for software and technology. It's actually just as much as I've  been joking about early 1980s home computerized and mom will use it to organize her recipes.  I started using the app Recipe Keeper, which is cross-platform. It's a recipe keeping app  for Android, iOS, iPad, Mac, Windows. And boy, does it work really, really well. Over the past  year or two, I've been trying to up my kitchen game because you know how you get. You might cook  something special on weekends, but then you get into the rut of three days a week, the same  like weekday, weeknight meals, and then take out like one or two nights a week. So I've been  acquiring new recipes and trying to inspire myself to try new things. And this is really a  very slick solution that is aware of how many different sources you get recipes from and what  you need to do with them. I just have tons and tons of bookmarks when I'm on Reddit or elsewhere  about, oh, that looks like it might be simple enough to be like a good Wednesday meal. And now  all you do is use the standard sharing sheet and whatever app and software, excuse me,  platform using to simply share it to Recipe Keeper. It understands the formatting of recipes. It also  understands specifically how Epicurious and other sites specifically format them. So you wind up not  just bookmarking this site, but with this very, very nicely standard formatted recipe sheet with  pictures taken from the recipe page and everything. And if you need to like, oh, this is serve six,  I really want it for serving three, easily do the math for that. When you're doing shopping,  if you're doing meal planning, you say, oh, I want to cook that on Thursday. And then suddenly,  if you, when you're doing your shopping on whatever day of the week you do it, like, oh, that's right,  I do need like garlic paste because I'm making that thing on Wednesday or Thursday night. And  makes it really, really easy to tag these things and organize them and find them. Again, it's not  as though it's using the power of chat GPT on the blockchain to improve productivity and connectivity.  It's a very, very simple task that it does extremely well. The free version is really robust.  And if you give them 13 bucks, I think for a lifetime purchase, suddenly you get the ability  to sync between devices and between platforms. And yeah, and I really, this, this came about because  things got complicated enough that I started like keeping a notebook like in the kitchen  with just, oh, here's Suvi, here's Suvi times or, and things like, oh, well, here's how to use,  I can't believe that I had actually had a page on here's how to use paprika. Because sometimes,  sometimes some spices you're like, I just throw it in by the fistful, but that doesn't always work.  Yeah. Well, yeah, well, because like, I was wondering why things weren't working. And then  I learned that, oh, well, there's, there's some spices you put into the pot, like at the beginning  of a cook, there's some spices that you put like near the end, because otherwise you cook, they cook  out and you sort of burn them out. And, and so after like two weeks of that, I started looking at  thinking that, oh, well, this is good. This is a good excuse. So someone who's occasionally does  pixel week and stuff like that, thinking that, okay, I'd find two or three, one of them would be  kind of nice enough to recommend, but I'd be just back to the notebook. But now, yeah, that's  completely supplanted it. And once again, mostly it's because I find recipes without looking for  them. It's just, I find it's, and now those things don't just disappear into my bookmarks folder.  It's like, if I'm bored on a bus or something, I can be scrolling through it. Oh, that's right.  That was that chicken stew recipe that looks crazy, stupid, simple, that can't possibly work.  I'm going to try that this week. And so it keeps it back at the front of your mind. And it's, and  it's again, helps, it's helped me to up my game and go from, okay, I guess it's Wednesday night,  I guess it's another pork cutlet with rice and maybe some black beans mixed with corn.

Transcript:  Smoked paprika at the end. If you're using the other kind, it's saying that basically using  as part of a spice blend, you can put it down at the earliest. But if you really want like the  heat of smoked paprika, if it's like an hour long, like cook that you're putting like chicken and  chicken and stuff, like in a pot, you don't put it at the very, very end, but maybe like 15 minutes  to the end of cook time. So it doesn't completely disintegrate. It's kind of funny because I didn't

Start time: 8813.38
End time: 8825.26
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. I was talking before the show a couple of weeks ago with Alex about this. I recently did a  get together of a bunch of the incomparable podcasters and we did a bunch of podcasts.  Big surprise. Did a bunch of podcasts.

Start time: 8825.40

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Micah was there and he said he had a great time.

Start time: 8827.92
End time: 9197.50
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  We had, we did. We had a great time. A whole bunch of people who never see each other in person.  Cause we're all just on, you know, far away on zoom. And so my thought was I want to capture  some video of this. And so I got a 360 video camera, not going to mention its name, but I'll  just say that it was an instant instant hit. Yes. 360. Anyway, what I found out is that you  couldn't set that up to case. The idea is it's too, okay. My pick is a GoPro max, which is what I  bought and I returned the other one. And I have the other one and you, you  know, so, so I prefer this one. And this is why, um, you, other people with different priorities  might have a different opinion of it, but it's two 180 degree lenses on either side of the camera.  So you are going to get a full 360 video out of it. And so I put it on a little tripod in,  you know, basically on the floor or on the table. And while we recorded a podcast sort of just around  the table and after the fact you export out a 360 video file, pop it into final cut pro.  It has all of the controls to pan and zoom and tilt around that 360 degree space. And you can  actually like say presets and basically make it look like you brought multiple cameras to that  thing. When there was in fact a little teeny tiny portable camera sitting in the center. Now, the  reason I ended up with a GoPro is that the other model stopped recording video after 30 minutes  and then started again 10 seconds later. Oh yeah. We talked about that. Yeah. Yeah. Before the show,  the other week we talked about that, uh, GoPro, uh, every eight minutes or so, it makes a new file  on the SD card, but there's no drop frames. It just keeps going. And if you pull them, if you,  if you just plug it into USB power, it will go cause the battery otherwise will die after a while,  but it will go until the SD card is full. If you have it plugged into power. And I can't be happier  with the output. Like the fact that I'm getting, cause I'm, I'm never in my hobbyist podcasting,  especially going to set up a full on like a bunch of different cameras and maybe with camera  operators and like, that's never going to happen, but this 360 grabs everything. And then you can  not only lock off those shots that you want, but you can do stuff like you can set a couple of,  of, uh, transition points and do a pan and a zoom and a tilt and make it look like somebody's  operating that camera, but it's all happening after the effect because it, it has captured  everything. The people around the table, the stuff that's on the table, the ceiling,  if you want to show that if there's like a bug on the ceiling, you want to cut to that it's up there.  You can see it just the technology is amazing. It really is like a taking smartphone tech and  smartphone camera tech and boiling it down to this. And yeah, this is also a GoPro. It has  lots of other uses as an action camera and as a waterproof camera and all of that, but there are  probably better choices. This is a little bit long in the tooth, but as a 360 camera to capture an  event and maybe who knows, we'll have headsets and stuff where that 360 video will also someday,  but just to produce on the fly, some relatively decent, uh, video of different angles of people  around a table. You plop this in the center, maybe on a tripod, and then you export it right  out of the awful software. All the universal thing of all these apps is they come with little  or all these cameras as they come with bad apps, bad Mac apps, bad windows apps, but you know,  you export the file and then you drop it in your video editor of choice and final cut.  I used final cut for it. I saved presets for each of the different camera angles. I'm going to write  about this on six colors because there's a bunch of things I discovered about like stupid things.  Final cut doesn't let you do like save presets and then bind them to a keystroke. It's like,  I don't know. I don't know how to do that, but I did do that. And what it affords me is first off,  it's a lot smaller file to have one file. That's a 360 file. It's big, but it's not three or four,  five or six. You can kind of an arbitrary number of camera angles. And then you can also do  animations where you can actually pan and zoom. And there's a moment where people are being  introduced around the table. And in my final cut project, literally the camera just keeps  rotating around as they're introduced. It's so great. So, and it's all just in that single file.  Can we watch this final show? Where is that? Oh, that's, that's a good point. I should get you the,  I should get you the link for that. Do I have to be a subscriber? I probably do to the income.  No, you don't. There's a, there's actually, I will put the, I'll put the YouTube,  link of the first one of these up for, for people to check out in our discord and you can put it in  the show notes. But yeah, it's, I mean, the first one we did was in a poorly lit basement that looked  like somebody had been using it as their murder dungeon. That's okay. You're doing D and D. I  think it's appropriate. It's pretty close, right? Like it's not that far off. But you know, they,  they ended up looking, looking pretty great. So that's the part that amazes me is that I was very  happy with, with how it all turned out. I'm interested. I'm surprised that Final Cut understood  the output. Yeah. Well, so what worried me was that when I bought the Insta 360 there, I said it,  when I bought that, it said, well, we've got a premier plugin. And I thought, but nothing for  Final Cut. And I thought, oh geez, it turns out, yeah, Final Cut just reads the 360 file. It knows  it's a 360 video file automatically gives you the set of controls that are uniquely for the 360  file. So in the end it actually worked out. It worked out great. So I, if you're, I know it's  a really niche kind of thing, but like, if you've ever been like, I want to capture this group of  people just hanging out together, I want to capture, you know, anything that like is not something that  you can capture with a single camera. This is a way that you can do it. The GoPro Max, which I wonder  if they have a new one coming. It is, it's not, it is, it's a bit old, although I don't know. I mean,

Transcript:  yeah, I don't think they're going to go down that path. It's, it didn't, I don't think it was a real  success for GoPro, but it is a really cool, I mean, it's the best camera in that little area.  It's been mostly the post and that niche. How long did it take to render it?

Start time: 9211.66
End time: 9229.10
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It's more, actually exporting from the GoPro is a lot faster than exporting from Insta360. And I  don't know why. But the, the, and the beauty of it is I, I first, the first set I did, I was rendering  the individual shots and that took forever, but rendering just exporting out the 360, it stitches

Start time: 9229.50
End time: 9257.02
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  it all together. That didn't take too long. And then I think I was trying to, when I have one,  but I have, I barely use it. I used to open it up and it was, I tried to do it inside of their app  because it does stabilization and it does all these other things. And I was like, oh, and it  was so painful. Their app is quick. Q U I K. They acquired quick, right? Yeah. I, yeah, I don't  remember what the app was. It was many years ago now. I was just like, I don't want to play anymore.  Well, there's, there is an advantage to using the app that comes with the camera because they have,

Start time: 9257.22

Transcript:  they understand better than Final Cut or Premiere. Right. But what exactly is going on?

Start time: 9260.66
End time: 9274.67
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But what I didn't do is what Jason's doing, which is really interesting is exporting the raw version  because when I did it, there was not the tools and Final Cut were very crude. I think it was  probably 2017. I think it was when I was, when it came out, it was new in 2017. So that was,

Start time: 9276.34
End time: 9317.34
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  yeah. So if whatever happened, Final Cut was like, no, we get 360 video as a thing and we want to  support it. And so you can set up a project and, you know, and this is a, an enormous video file,  right? Like it's like a five point something K video file, which is good because you have to  chop it up into little bits in order to get your shots, but it still ends up being pretty decent.  And if my stuff was actually well lit, it would have looked great. It was not well lit. We were  just in an Airbnb at a table, but it's still pretty decent. So I was, I was amazed by it. So  I think that there are places where people will have that moment of like, oh, for 500 bucks and  you can usually find it a little cheaper than that. Totally worth doing.

But in the new ones that  I did, I learned my lesson from that first one. And I've, I've built in the pans and it's eerie.  Like it literally looks like there's a camera operator there, but it's just me setting,  setting animation points and final cut after the fact. And you've got eight people. So,

Transcript:  things up with your pick of the week. Yeah. I, I, I, I went to a, a movie, 32 sounds. It is a very  small art house movie. And if it's going through your town, you should go. Oh, like you should go.  I like, you know, it's so a friend of mine, Tualaq was like, you have to go, you have to go see this  movie. And so I was like, okay. And I didn't know anything about the movie. Like it just Tualaq told  me to go see it and I will go see it. So I showed up. I went with a friend and, and, and we went and,  and checked it out. You get there and they give you headsets. So the whole thing is in binaural.  So that they give you headsets, FM headsets. And, and you're exploring 32 different sounds.  And we have to go see how sound, unfortunately for you is that he just did six over the weekend  and that now he's on a tour. So the great thing is Sam Green, who's the director,  he comes with the movie. So he's going to all these locations and at the end, there's a Q and A with  him. And so he talks a little bit about it and answers questions. So I'm into westerly,

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  There you go. There's your reason to go to the, I would highly recommend it. It is,  it's, it's a, you know, it's, it's not a action packed film. It's just like you should kind of,  and at the beginning, I think I was a little restless for the first 30 minutes. And then I  found myself just sinking into the experience of just of experiencing sound. They showed a,  there's a woman who has been spending the last 50 years, she's been recording sound  underwater. They have a sound, an audio artist who is deaf. So she's, she's actually talking  about how the sound makes her feel. There are, you know, there's lots of different how binaural  works versus ambisonic. There's all these, it's not really technical as much as experiential.  And I just, I just really enjoyed it. And I'm really glad that movies like this get made,  you know, so, so I'm hoping that people go out and see it. So we get more movies like that,  but it's, it was a really just an exploration of sound. And it got me thinking about binaural a  lot more. I, I deal with a lot of surround. So I mostly think about ambisonic and Atmos and,  and 5.1 and all these other things. And, you know, I, I've kind of skipped binaural because  it's just with headphones, but when you put the headphones on, it was kind of fun. So hopefully  it'll come out, it'll get distribution somehow. And we get to put headphones on and watch it at  home, but it's a pretty, pretty, pretty great, yeah. Cause I don't know if I'm going to make

So you're doing this, the camera's recording everything.  You're doing this in the software panning from person to person. Set little tween points,

Start time: 9566.76
End time: 9626.62
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  right? You set little, little key frames and you can go around and yeah, so this video pans  literally all the way around the table. And then in the end sort of drops down and shows the  map and shows everybody's like soda and dice, cause it's a D and D game. So you gotta,  for Verity's sake, you've got to do that. But yeah, it's just, it's a fun, it's a fun idea.  Literally somebody said to me the other week when I was talking about this, they said, it's kind of  like that 70s show, right? Where there were all those scenes where on that 70s show where they're  sitting there talking to each other. And the joke is that the one you don't see is the one who's  smoking pot at that moment, but it keeps turning around. And, and they said, so it's kind of like  that. And I said, that's yes, that is literally my inspiration for this idea was what if you could  put a camera in the center and then cover all of the different angles around the table. Wouldn't  that make like with Micah and Dan, wouldn't that make a great episode of clockwise? The whole  premise of it is that you're sitting around a table. They're never actually around a table,  but what if they were? So yeah, it's, it's worth, it's worth checking out if you're that person.
