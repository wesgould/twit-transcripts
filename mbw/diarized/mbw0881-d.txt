Transcript:  It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Jason Snell is here with his colorful charts.  Andy Iannacco with his fabulous dad jokes. And Alex Lindsay with his many ways to spend all  your money. This week we'll be talking of course about Jason's colorful charts. The Apple results  are in big winners, big losers. I think everybody's a winner when it comes to Apple's stock price.  We'll also talk about how Apple saves money in its deals with TSMC. Where that money might be going  in a deal with ARM and rumors about the iPhone 15 and the M3 MacBook Pro. That and a whole lot  more coming up next on Mac Break Weekly. Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is Twit.  This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 881. Recorded Tuesday August 8th, 2023.

Alex really  gets out of the house. Where are you today? I'm in Los Angeles. I'm right across from the LA  Convention Center. We have a Seagraph, which is the big graphics conference going on this week.  And so we were at, I was at the production summit last Friday and then Seagraph over the next couple  of days and we're looking at lots of things. A lot of excitement around nerfs. So there's a lot of  nerfing nerfs going on here. These are neural radiance fields. Holy moly. So everyone's talking  about that. That's the big talk of the show. But there's a big race between Unity and Unreal and

Transcript:  it's very exciting. Seagraph's been around forever. I remember going down in 1992 with Halsey Miner,  who was the founder of CNET and he wanted to see what was going on at Seagraph. And so we flew down,  I remember we flew down, I think probably from Oakland on a turboprop. And I think Halsey never  forgave, he had me book the flight. I guess I was his executive assistant and he never forgave me  for that. So my relationship with CNET was short-lived thereafter. But I did fly the VR  Dragon. They had, you wore a headset. It was so big and it had a big cable. This was in 1982 you were flying a VR Dragon?  1992. It was hooked up to an SGI, probably an Onyx or something like that. And you would get on a saddle  and then you'd hold handlebars like you're on a motorcycle and then put the thing on and it was

There's, you know,  they're talking about nearly 100 core processors and stuff like that. It's pretty cool.

Yeah, you know, Apple releases its earnings and what do I  do? I immediately tip back the head of William Shakespeare, flip the button, slide down the pole  into the chart cave. Into the bat cave. Where the charts are made. I more imagine you like

Start time: 332.10
End time: 340.56
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It depends. I'd say that this was a boring quarter for various degrees of boring. Some people have  said it was a bad quarter. Some said it was a good quarter. Stock market said it was a bad quarter

Start time: 340.68
End time: 346.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because as usual the analysts made predictions Apple didn't live up to. And so, oh. And it's all

Start time: 347.42
End time: 436.70
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  priced into the stock. Although the Wall Street consensus was that it would be down 1.5% revenue  year over year and it was down 1%. So they actually beat the consensus. But I think as with everything  Wall Street, stock prices are influenced by changes in expectation. And so you get a run up  when people expect more than you get. I'm not sure how making $20 billion in profit in a quarter is  boring, but that's where we are now. They were actually up in profit because interesting little  detail. How do you go down in revenue and up in profit? And the answer is they cut their expenses.  This is where you see them not hiring and letting people go via attrition and reducing expenses in  a bunch of areas. And therefore they actually went up year over year in profit, even though they were  down a little bit in revenue. They ran a little more efficiently. And this is also one of the more  boring Apple quarters in general because they didn't release any major products and the iPhone  is not yet and they're a very seasonal company. So in the end it was more services. The services  continue to bubble over. Everything else was kind of flat. iPad and Mac were down because  I think that we're seeing the effects of people buying iPads and Macs during an immediate aftermath  of pandemic lockdowns. And those people have bought them now and they don't need to buy a new one this  year. So again, for various, if you're an investor, maybe you have an opinion about the 1%  down year over year. It's very hard not to look at $20 billion in profit and say,

Start time: 436.84
End time: 471.44
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  man, I guess they're doing okay. Yeah. And also most of the analysts on all the different quarter  results are basically agreeing that people are just buying fewer smartphones. People are buying  fewer laptops. And so it's not necessarily a failure of Apple that they're suffering from the  same effects as everybody else. And Tim Cook even acknowledged that it's one of the other reasons  is that we had a lot of people still buying M1 Apple Silicon Macs. And so therefore that was like  the starting gate for a new upgrade cycle that now they're kind of in the middle of as people are  waiting for M3 and for waiting for their original M1s to age out of the system. And if you see where

Start time: 472.44
End time: 493.26
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Apple succeeded versus sort of like having losses, they even called it out. United States and the  Americas in general, but the United States smartphone market is pretty sluggish right now.  They are seeing success and growth in lots of other markets, but in the U.S., you know, it's not.  It's their most important market in a lot of ways and it's sluggish in the U.S.

Start time: 493.92

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that saturation? Is that what's going on? You think?

Start time: 497.70
End time: 559.36
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. And people may be buying during the last couple of years, pulling ahead tech purchases,  but yeah, it's saturated and the phones are so good now that they last a lot longer. That's why  Apple starts to do things like have their replacement program. That's why they will pay  you. Like my daughter, we bought her a phone when she went to college. She just graduated.  We got her a new phone and we sold back her old phone to Apple for like $200, like a substantial  amount of money for a four-year-old phone. So obviously Apple is trying to grease the  skids as much as possible for you to upgrade and then taking those phones and refurbing them and  using them for parts or recycling them or selling them in another country that doesn't want to buy  a full-price iPhone, depending on how you want to view that. But yeah, I think that's the truth is  that they are trying everything they can, but I think we all have smartphones and are all pretty  happy with them in the U.S. And that is, you know, there's still a cycle, right? But it's not an  expanding cycle anymore. You're just selling new phones to people who already use your phone.

Start time: 576.18
End time: 627.12
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  challenges that's going to keep on coming up for Apple is that they're making, and other companies  as well, the hardware is outpacing the software. So for most people, do they really need a new  computer? Do they really need a new iPhone? Do they really need an iPad? At some point you go,  my kids are still using the first iPad 12.9 Pro and they still use it every day, like when they're  at home. And that's the problem is that the apps themselves, and this is where Apple has to kind of  help developers, but the bottom line is that the apps themselves are working very well. When I look  at buying the Mac minis that I've bought, I expect to be using those for five or 10 years. And now,  maybe I'll ratchet it down, but they're so powerful that I can do an awful lot with them for an awful  long time. And that's a real problem when it comes to cycling. Yeah, they don't break either. You can

Start time: 627.28

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  drop these things a few times. They don't put that in the end. I mean, the number of times I've had  to buy something that's not an Apple because, hey, I need to test this out. And the thing overheats  and it pops after a year or two, or I dropped this phone and that was just it. That makes you  appreciate the quality of Apple construction. Forget about innovation, forget about the  technology, forget about Apple silicon. It's all about the damn thing is okay to survive life.

And  I was fairly confident it was going to work. But I set my phone down, of course, dried it all off,  shook it a little bit, hoped it would. And within a couple of minutes, I was back to like nothing

Start time: 693.62
End time: 716.08
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Europe, it's funny when you think about the iPhone, any place where the iPhone is not majority  market share, like Europe is a really big opportunity for Apple. And that's, you know,  the US it's majority market share, right? So it's a lot less of an opportunity there to convert  people than it is in Europe, but certainly India and China and other parts of the world that are  places where they think they've got a lot of growth potential. Yeah, he mentioned he didn't

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  mention this in his major in his main comments, but there was a Q&A question about it. And he  of course mentioned he was asked about Indian emerging markets and gave a long, long answer  about how well and how much optimism they have for India. But they also called out Indonesia,  Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Emirates, Brazil, India, Malaysia. So  clearly the fact that he was, he had this on his, on his mind means that it's like, like most  companies who are making phones, they are concerned about the places where they have not managed to  sell a phone to literally everybody in the country yet. And there's still a lot of globe left to

Transcript:  cover. Is it, is it, is he trying, is it important to him? Is it that he reassure  investors? Is he trying to, it sounds a little bit like, Hey, don't worry because we've got all these  other markets, it's going to be okay. Or does he care? Does it, I mean, is it his job to reassure

Start time: 766.04
End time: 849.98
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  them the street? Well, yeah, that's, that's obvious. That's the whole point of these earnings  calls. I mean, he's required, the company is required to do that, but it's also a place where  they are not, it's spin, right. It's spin. That's, I say this every quarter that this is why I love  reading the transcripts because when you see an Apple event for the press and for the consumers,  they can, they can maybe leave the Y axis, Y axis on a chart unlabeled and hope that you think that  that curve means what you think it is. But on a, on an earnings call, like there are major  consequences if they like misdirect or if they lie. And so it is a, it is a place for them to say,  frankly, to people who are going to have a material effect on Apple in the future. So yeah,  you see, and it's, and it's also, it's also often a time for them to really express, here's what we  believe in a company going forward. They're one of the few companies this quarter that  spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks, talking about just things like diversity,  talking about the environment, a lot of that, that seemed to have been in vogue a year or two ago  across all tech, but now Apple seems to be the only people who are going to spend an entire  paragraph of that transcript talking about their, their carbon, their carbon initiatives. So yeah,  it's, it is a place to raise the flag, but it is also a place to convince people that we're,  we're not dopes. We're not going to buy a social media app and then make you wonder why you're

Start time: 850.16
End time: 932.16
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  putting any money into us, that kind of stuff. I think that the nature of an Apple investor and,  you know, I'm not one, I've never been one, kind of can't be one. I think though they have trained  most of their investors into thinking that Apple is a long hold, I guess they would call it a hold  stock. It is a long game they're playing. Tim Cook literally, I believe used the phrase long game,  that the idea that they are looking for the long view in terms of their investment in R&D,  which they talked about the one place that they didn't cut resources is that when they talk and  this is the thing that I think they're heading off criticism by talking about why they think  their commitment to green tech and green energy and, and carbon being carbon neutral and recycling  all of their materials, you know, they are tying that in with the idea that this is a long game.  And those are the investors that they want, right? They're not, I don't think the bulk of  Apple investors are people just popping in and out because they think there's a good quarter.  I think that they look at the position of the iPhone and how profitable it is and say,  this is a company that is playing a very long game and it's going to be around and successful  for a long time so that they're not as worried about the vagaries of sort of like month to month.  But they certainly, when they do that call, they like to call that stuff out. I think they're  trying to sort of define the terms of the argument and say, big picture here, everybody, don't sweat  it too much because you can get overwhelmed by the little details and lose the big picture.

Start time: 932.38
End time: 963.24
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, one of my favorite Tim Cook moments was when some, I forget whether it was an analyst  or an investor who got a little bit shirty with him at a meeting about how, well, you're putting  all this money into environmental stuff and blah, blah, blah stuff and that money should be going  to blah, blah, blah. And he said almost as flatly as he possibly could that we think that we're a  really good investment. If you are concerned about that, we invite you to sell your stock.  I assure you that people will buy it from you. Yeah. I mean, another way they blunt the criticism

Start time: 963.32
End time: 1012.16
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  is with, they have been embarking on a policy that, oh my God, I think it's been like 10 years  now at least where they are aggressively buying back stock, which raises stock prices. They are,  they returned their dividend, which they didn't use to do. And they officially have made it a policy  that they will become, I forget what Luca Meissner, the CFO says, something like a cash  neutral position over time, which is hilarious because it's been that way for years now and they  can't get there because they make money too fast. They can't get to cash neutral. They cannot spend  as fast as they're bringing it in. I think they have 40 some billion in net cash right now,  just in the mattresses because they've got, you know, they do some stuff with hedging and they've  got debt, but they've also got cash, but the net out is I think in the 40 billion range in cash.  So they want to get to neutral, but it's hard to get to neutral when you've made a machine that

Start time: 1012.28
End time: 1020.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  throws off $20 billion in profit. Yeah. You're making more than a billion a week. You really  got to find hard to spend start buying amusement parks or something. It's a real Brewster's Billions

Start time: 1020.96
End time: 1025.68
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  kind of situation there, right? How do I spend it? I don't know. And that very much, I mean,

Start time: 1025.92
End time: 1053.84
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  we have to also remember that that very much, it stabilizes the stock a lot when you're doing  dividends, when you're doing buybacks, you know, it not just pushes up the stock, but it just  stabilizes. So every time up and down, people are like, yeah, well, but I'm still getting all these  dividends. And, you know, their stock position, I mean, their cash position used to be much higher.  So they were in the hundreds of millions of dollars. They got to almost 200 billion. Yeah.  And that becomes that could create its own problems at some point. And so,

Start time: 1054.56
End time: 1066.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  so that was because a lot of that was offshored and they couldn't, they couldn't spend it in the US.  So once Trump allowed them to reinstate it, I think now they've been able to spend it a little

Start time: 1066.96
End time: 1076.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  bit more vigorous. But the buyback thing helps their critics insulate them from criticism from  investors too. Right. That's like we're, we're using a lot of our profits to buy back stock.

Start time: 1076.12
End time: 1079.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They borrow for that, right? They don't spend their own cash for that. And we have to remember,

Start time: 1080.26
End time: 1088.48
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, they have so much that there, there's a lot of, they've got a lot of debt, but they've  also got the cash for it. So it nets out to 40 billion. When it was free money, they may not be

Start time: 1088.54
End time: 1135.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  borrowing now because they, right. They may not be borrowing as much now with the kind of interest  rates they're getting now, but the, the, you know, they're just doing the math, like, which is the  best one. And so, but, but the, the other thing to remember is, is that a lot of the benefactors of  this slow push of stock value and so on and so forth, when we talk about stockholders, a very  large number of stockholders are their employees, you know, so their employees are getting these  stock options all the time. And, and so this is something that it's important for most of  these companies. When, when you see companies lose stock value by 50%, there's a lot of employees  that are like, well, that was my retirement. And now I don't, you know, you know, they look at their,  the value of their retirement went down by 50%. So, so it is really important to employees that  that stock remains stable or continues to move north. That was the reason Steve Jobs gave for

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I'm sorry. The stock buybacks just quickly are becoming a little bit controversial because when  you see pushback against like paying your employees better, resistance to unionization,  things like that, it's, it, it, it makes a company look not great. When you, when they,  you have to point to here's how much money you spent buying yourself back. You're saying that  you can't afford to, you can't afford like 16 bucks. So you can't afford 18 bucks an hour.  You can't afford 20 bucks an hour. You can't afford to allow a collective organ collective bargaining,  that sort of stuff. It's not like that's a huge problem, but that is it's, it's becoming more of  a fly on the windshield than, than it has in the past. Yeah.

Transcript:  Cookster should have some better ways to spend his billions. I think Lucas, Lucas,  Luca Maestri said Apple was taking a, does he have an Italian accent? I feel like anybody.  Yes, he does. He says deliberate approach in the managing our spend, according to this guy, Jason

Start time: 1211.02

Transcript:  Stone in Macworld. He's not, he's not quite, uh, quite that Italian guy. This is the Pope,  but he is. I'll just say the whisper AI, uh, speech to text does a great job of transcribing  Luca Maestri. So his English is spot on approach in the managing our spend.  Yeah. That it's, it's like, yeah. How do you say we're trying to spend less money costs? Yeah.  But we're not, but we made 20 billion. So like, because they famously, as we've talked about on  this show, like they're not doing big layoffs or anything like that, but they want to send the  message that they're being fiscally responsible, which is why they do the deliberate slowdown of  their expenses, but not, he will point out, uh, on several occasions, not R and D. The R and D  expenses are actually still pretty high. And they basically say, look, that's what we are as a

Start time: 1258.74
End time: 1268.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  company is R and D. We have to do that. Which is funny. Cause for years, Apple was not a big R and  D spender. That's a, that's something relatively new. Right. Am I right? Yeah. But it's also,

Start time: 1269.04
End time: 1287.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  you know, getting 20 billion in profit every quarter is also relatively new for them. It's  only been in the last 10 years that they've been so huge. And I think they decided like one place  to spend that is just like creating this whole cycle of like, put it back into the R and D.  So we stay ahead in areas that allow us to keep making money. And what is, what Apple's really,

Start time: 1288.26
End time: 1322.00
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  yeah. And what Apple's really doing and potentially the car, um, but the, uh, but what Apple  needs to keep doing, doing and what they're doing pretty well is not really looking for how do we  make easy profits, but how do we do things? How do we build products in a way that are hard?  Like how do we make everybody else play a game that they can't afford to play? So the R and D,  so the R and D helps keep pushing that, that, and making it much harder for everyone else  in comparison, um, because they're just playing a game. If you, if you, if you don't have $20 billion  to get into this poker game, uh, then you need to move somewhere else. Right. Apple silicon's a great

Transcript:  example of that, where they put in the time and the money they bought PA semi, but they also did  a multi-year process where it's not cheap to design your own chips year after year after year,  and then also pay TSMC to build factories in order to build them and to put you on their new three  nanometer process. Like it costs a fortune, but it's another one of those places that's a bulwark  against the competition. Right. Like fundamentally that's a huge advantage for them that they didn't  have when they were relying on other people's chips. And it was worth them spending that money

Start time: 1351.02
End time: 1363.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  for that. In fact, that's one of the stories of the week that TSMC has basically allocated every,  every chip they've got, uh, to, uh, Apple for the next year. And remember when they did that with

Transcript:  flash memory, it's the same thing when the iPod, um, was all flash based and everybody wanted to  compete with the iPod. One of the huge problems, it wasn't just competing with Apple. You had on  a product level with consumers, you had to compete with Apple to get the flash memory to put in your  players because Apple did these like four or five year contracts where they just bought it all.  And everybody else got it to the back of the line. And according to such a historic, that's such a

Transcript:  all. According to Wayne Ma in the information, one of the deals Apple has made with TSMC is that TSMC  pays for the defects. Uh, they eat the cost of defects that crop up in the new manufacturing  process. Uh, and, and so, uh, this is, this is the story is how Apple will save billions of dollars  on chips for the new iPhone. So it really, you know, it, it, TSMC needs Apple as much as Apple  needs TSMC. Clearly they're making a, a, a sweetheart deal, uh, to Apple. According to TSMC.

Transcript:  Apple has a, has a real track record with get making good deals with chip makers. I don't know.  Uh, next week we'll probably save this for next week because next week is the 25th anniversary  of the iMac, I think. Um, but famously, uh, or at least semi-famously, one of the reasons the iMac  worked at all is that they strong armed, no pun intended, Motorola to give them a super sweet deal  on the G3 for the iMac because they were, it was not feasible with the list price of the G3.  And a bunch of people, including, I think Greg Joswiak, who's now Apple's head of marketing,  went to Motorola and basically talked them into a deal that I think Motorola instantly regretted  in order to get that chip for a, for a low price. So it's, it's fascinating when you're Apple,  I mean, they've never made their own chips. They designed them, but they've never made them.  So you gotta, right. You gotta get the Silicon price right or your product falls apart. So

Transcript:  they're still doing it. Mop points out that whenever you have a new node, like the three  nanometer node, you're going to have huge defects. He says the yield on the three nanometer wafers is  70, 80%, which means that 20 to 30% of them are no good. And that TSMC is basically eating it.  Normal customers will buy the wafer, including the bad, you know, dies on it, but Apple doesn't  have to pay for them. They only pay for known good dies. Maybe a short term deal, maybe, you know,

Start time: 1550.74

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  over time it'll be different. Also, I'll point out, I hadn't really thought of that this before,  but a lot of the variation that we see in Apple's chips is binning, right? It's, it's a chip that  does not qualify for everything. And that's why it's got fewer GPUs or fewer CPUs. And that's how  they have different variations of the, the pro and the max and the regular chip and all of that.  I wonder if we'll see more of that in this generation and the M three generation. I, I don't  know how, you know, when, when a chip goes bad in this process, is it just sort of dead or are they  going to end up with a certain number that are just, you know, iffy, but that they can be used at  a lower level? Because we may see a lot more of that if that's the case.

Start time: 1591.14

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  We, when we think about that also, that, you know, the, the, they usually just aren't performing at  the level that they were spec'd at. So oftentimes with the chips, you have chips that are faster are  the ones that, you know, and then the other ones, they just don't, they start to not work as well at  a certain speed. And so they pull it back into a safe speed. But those chips are, you know,  we just have to remember that those chips could be used for other things. They're just not as fast  as the M one and the spec, you know, you have, you have hardware, you know, other Apple hardware  that's using M one, uh, Silicon that potentially could be using those chips as well. So, so it's,

Transcript:  there's a lot of interesting opportunities. The only other people buying three nanometer chips  from TSMCR is Intel and that will happen at the earliest next year. Intel is paying for the three  out of 10 dyes that don't work. Sorry Intel. Well, because, well, that's, that's okay for Intel

Start time: 1644.18
End time: 1658.00
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  because they have multiple channels so that they can basically take, they can basically downgrade,  they can down, downgrade a CPU and sell it as something else. But basically, by basically  saying that the stuff that's defective and doesn't work well, that's not part of it. So you're not

Start time: 1658.00
End time: 1686.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  going to be able to use that. Well, I'm really curious what known good chips means that if they're  not good, they're not working at all, or if they're merely going to have to be binned. So we don't know  that from Wayne's story and the information. We see that all across the supply chain. There are  panels that you buy that. Yeah, exactly. So, um, but whether that binning is the 30% that have failed  or is it the 70% that they bought, but just up to snuff. Another, another way that Apple always eats

Start time: 1686.20
End time: 1710.46
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  first, right? That's the Andy, you made the point that so often it's like, well, we've made all  these panels and Apple, we made a thousand panels and Apple comes in and says, we'll take these 600  and where do the 400 others go? They go everywhere else, right? They go to that LG panel or that,  my LG also eats first because they made them, but like that's what you see in a Dell panel or  something else. And that's been the case for a long time too, that Apple likes to be at the front of

Start time: 1710.58
End time: 1731.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the line for that stuff. So we have two choices. The first show titles can be Apple eats first or  suck it Intel. We'll decide at the end of the show, at the end of the show, the big, the big  story according to the press was the increase in services. Uh, it was a very smart move for Apple  to start focusing on service revenue and it has been steadily climbing. And it takes a long,

Start time: 1732.72
End time: 1761.44
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  and it takes a long time to do that. Like it's, it is, this isn't something like, oh, we need to make  more money. Let's go do that right now. I mean, this is, if you look at this, this takes years  and years and years to slowly build up all of these services, um, make sure that each one's  working before you are mostly working before you open to the next one. So you could tell that they,  they knew that this was going to come where they needed to keep buffering. They need to keep pushing  that iPhone, you know, part of the pie down, you know, and I think you're going to keep on seeing  them look for all the opportunities they can to get that thing down to less than 30%.

Start time: 1762.40
End time: 1814.42
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's, that's what, that's something that a company that's worth that much money,  they've got the financial punching power to hold on like that. Even Google, like the, the, the joke  every single quarter with Google's call was okay, how many hundreds that we've got great news about  Google cloud services. We had our best quarter ever. We only lost $400 million because this has  been years and years and years of not only developing technology and finding clients,  but actually buying real estate, building out facilities. And this quarter was the first time  it was actually good news. We actually made hundreds of millions of dollars on cloud.  And so once you clear that hurdle, you start to get to the point where now most of what we do is,  it's like, it's like the joke about the first pill when you develop a pharmaceutical company costs  like a billion dollars, but every, every other pill after that is nothing but profit. And this is,  Apple's going to be making more money per dollar. They put in now after this for other cloud services.

Transcript:  You talk about the long game. This is one of those cases where 10 years ago, I think they started  talking about services and saying that our goal is to reach some financial goal that they blew  past in a very short amount of time. But you see this here where it just keeps going up. They  talked about the number of subscriptions they've got, and that includes like subscriptions in app  as well as theirs. It's not just Apple TV subscriptions, but this quarter they passed  a billion subscriptions. And if that doesn't impress you, it's up 15% year over year. And it's  doubled in the last three years, the number of subscriptions that they take. And that includes,  again, includes app in app subscriptions. It's not just Apple. Apple views that as its entire  ecosystem. Right. But still you get the sense like, this is why the services growth is so huge. They  have laid this foundation. And as they also point out, they see a lot of growth in the install base  when we talk about reselling that old iPhone. If the old iPhone stays in service and somebody  buys a new iPhone, that's one more person using an Apple device. And so their total number of  devices is increasing, which allows them to sell more services to every single one of those devices.

Start time: 1882.72
End time: 1891.60
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And it just keeps on rolling. Yeah. And in the Q&A, Luca pointed out that one of the advantages  of services that is consistent, it doesn't keep fluctuating up and down. Once they got them,

Start time: 1892.10
End time: 1933.04
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  they stay up. So much of the hardware business is seasonal, but services is not because once  you subscribe, you're on that subscription and that's where it is. Also very profitable. Apple  set a third quarter record for its profit margin this quarter. Luca Meister, very proud of that.  An analyst was like, Luca, I noticed that the profit margin is pretty high, maybe the highest  we've seen. And he said, it was one of those moments of like, oh, I'm so glad you noticed.  Yes, it was 45%. It's just enormous. And the reason is the hardware profit margins are less.  They're good. They're about as good as you get in the industry, but they're not services profit  margins, which are huge. And so the more services are in the mix, the more profitable you are as a

Transcript:  company. There's one service that has a hundred percent profit and that's the money that Google  pays them every year for the default search on Safari. It's estimated now that it's 15 billion  Apple made about 83 billion last year in services. 15 billion is a big significant portion of that.  Not that that's in jeopardy, although every once in a while Google kind of complaints about it,  but Google is not going to stop paying that money. Well, I mean, they're making money on that,

Start time: 1967.06

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, for sure. I guess there is always though, the risk with services that they could get their  percentage cut as you were referring to, or is it the EU could say you can't, you have to stop,  you know, letting Google be the default, something like that. There's always threats to this,  all regulatory though, not commercial, all regulatory threats.

And really Apple's, I mean, I think that we're going to keep on seeing the situation that  regulatory issues and antitrust issues are Apple's number one problem in the next decade.  Those are the headwinds.  It's not going to be competing with anybody else. It's the fact that they're starting to pull away.

Start time: 2006.72

Transcript:  Yeah. iPhone still is the lion's share of revenue, although services is number two,  which is interesting. Then wearables. It's kind of sad for me that Apple,  which was the Mac company for so long, a computer company, that Mac is a small percentage,  not much more than the iPad actually of their overall revenue, but they're not getting out of

Start time: 2029.44
End time: 2054.40
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  either business, I presume. Well, but you look at it, I mean, you got to keep in mind how huge the  iPhone businesses and how huge the services business is becoming. Cause if you look at the Mac,  it's still doing, I mean, it's still like a 30 or $40 billion a year revenue business.  I'll take it then. It's huge. It's just not huge compared to the iPhone. This is the challenge for  the Mac and the iPad is that they're never going to match the iPhone. They're just not,

Start time: 2054.64
End time: 2080.22
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  they're never going to match it. Yeah. And also, anything running a desktop OS,  that's the most, I think that's one of the most volatile categories of all,  because how, when does somebody decide that they need to replace their laptop or their desktop?  They're not dropping these things in toilets, unless it's quite deliberately. And the most,  and so much of the job of that device is being taken up by the new tablet they buy,  buy the new phone they buy. So that's just life on planet earth in 2023.

So that's the  yellow line. The red line is China. The green line is America's. And while it went up a little bit,  it's been trending down for some time. So, and China really is growing rapidly. Is that all phone?

Start time: 2104.86
End time: 2167.42
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I guess it must be. No, it's not. I mean, the phone is their way in, but Apple has said repeatedly  that in China, one of the things that they consider the most encouraging is that the phone becomes a  gateway and like two or three quarters of all the, all the, uh, Apple watch buyers this year,  or this quarter were brand new to Apple watch. It's an iPhone accessory, right? So that's,  that's one way you get them to buy that second Apple device. But they have said in past quarters  too, that, um, China keeps setting records for Mac sales, uh, all time records for Mac sales and all  time records for iPad sales. And so the, the narrative at least, and there's some data to back  this up is that people like we saw here with the iPod and then later the iPhone, you get that one  Apple device and that is a crack that they can like push into and get you a whole bunch of other  Apple devices. Once you're sort of like in their ecosystem a little bit. So it sounds like  they're doing, I mean, again, it's never going to be the iPhone, but that there's a real opportunity  for them in China with their other products too. Anything else that we learned, whether from the

Transcript:  move on? Not necessarily insights, but there's, I think there's only one question about vision pro.  I was surprised that it didn't appear in part of Apple's opening comments that oftentimes the  opening comments of a tech company's quarterly call are about waving the flag on projects that  they think they think are high profile and a source of like company pride wasn't there.  An analyst asked about it. So, oh yeah, no, I'm using it every single day. Tim Cook said he uses  it every day. Uh, again, they won't say what, uh, what Apple TV program that he's watching, uh, on  the, on the vision pro every single day, because that would probably be the reason why, but.

Start time: 2209.06

Yeah. They've shot that powder. There's nothing to, there's nothing,  I think, new to talk about until they have something to show. Yeah. Not that they would

Start time: 2226.18
End time: 2272.08
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  be nice, but just, just that it was, it was, it's interesting since, since we spend like all of like  the past two or three weeks reading every single analyst call, uh, it's usually, it's, it's oftentimes  a way to see, well, why, why did they decide to use some of that time for the CEO to have open  comments? What it really is, like when you, when you are watching to see, uh, in the old, uh, uh,  and then May day parades, who is, who is sitting, standing right next to the Soviet premier,  who has been moved to the outside, we get an idea of where the power is. So it was just, it was just  kind of odd given that again, their, uh, their environmental initiatives, their social initiatives  were enough to, uh, spend several sentences on that, at least not, oh, we're very proud of our  new innovations that are coming in the future, such as blah, blah, blah. That's, yeah. I just

Start time: 2272.20
End time: 2306.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  thought it was notable. I will read the quote. Tim Cook said there's enormous excitement around  the vision pro. We're excited internally. Everybody that's been through the demos are blown away,  whether you're talking about press or analysts or developers, we're now shipping units to the  developer community for them to begin working on their apps. And we're looking forward to shipping  early next year. We could not be more excited with that. Here's the, here's the funny sentence,  though. The interesting one. I'm using the product daily.  You think he straps on the vision pro every day? Like Andy said, he's, why is he watching just the

It's time for your vision  pro briefing strap in. Yeah, I mean, it's not, not, not real. I mean, like they can say like,  this is what numbers is going to look like in vision or, or, you know, this is what,  Hey, we've got something for you. And for him to just constantly see that progress.

Start time: 2340.50
End time: 2436.90
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  probably probably does. But yeah, to Andy's point, I mean, I think they did having listened to a lot  of these calls over the years. I think they did what they needed to do for a brand new product.  That's been announced and isn't shipping, which is it got a paragraph in that opening prepared  remark that the CEO says, and they don't really have, they could have mentioned the developer  stuff, but they, you know, they did the thing about we announced this thing and it's amazing  and it's going to blow you away. And it's the most advanced thing ever made. And that's all,  and then they just moved on to the rest of the stuff. The one, the one, I don't know if it  qualifies as an insight. You can be the judge that I had of this is that they always talk about how  proud they are of the fact that, like I mentioned, three quarters of Apple watches were sold to new  Apple watch users. Slightly more than half of new iPads sold were to people who'd never bought an  iPad before. Slightly less than half of new Macs sold were to people who never bought a Mac before.  Something to boast about, they're growing their market. That's nice, but it struck me that when  you have a situation when your existing install base doesn't need to upgrade, that's when those  numbers go up, right? That's when the numbers are of switchers, of people who are new to the platform  go up because the people who are not buying are people who already bought your product last year  and don't need to buy a new one because it's an Apple Silicon and it's great. Now, why would I  update? I'll see you in four years. So it's a nice thing to boast about, but it's also kind of a  proxy for how many people are buying a new Mac who already have a Mac and are upgrading. And if that  number of new to Mac goes up too much, that means nobody's upgrading, which is not great either.

Start time: 2437.24
End time: 2469.36
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That's a very, that's an excellent point. Yeah. And again, I think again, it comes back to the  fact that a lot of people don't feel like they need to, they don't feel like they need the newest  version because the software, the tools are vastly outstripped by the hardware. There's just not a  lot of reasons to upgrade right now with a phone. The primary reason to upgrade, everyone looks at  what is the camera going to do? Like, you know, what's the new thing with the camera? And then  they make a decision about whether they upgrade. I don't think there's very little on the phone  that gets people excited more than just looking at the camera update. Well, Mark Gurman says he

Transcript:  knows the date the iPhone 15 will be announced. We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  You're watching Mac Break Weekly, Andy Anacco, Alex Lindsay, Jason Snell. I want to tell you about  a brand new sponsor and a brand new product that I just started using that I'm blown away with.  People, we talk to people all the time about photos. It's very important to everybody  keeping track of your photos. And we talk about maybe the third party services that you can keep  your photos on. I've started using Myleo and I am blown away. M-Y-L-I-O. It is now where I store all  my photos. I've been looking for a digital asset management tool. You know, this is,  I used to use Lightroom and I put all my photos in there, but I don't really want Adobe to have  all my photos. They're really pushing me to keep them under the Adobe cloud. You know,  I back up to Google Photos, but again, Google's getting all my stuff. iCloud, same thing.  I didn't have a really good way of managing all my photos until Myleo came along. And this thing  is amazing. First of all, completely offline. You decide where you want to back up, how you back up.  I have it backing up to my Synology NAS. You can back it up to iCloud or you could back it up to  Google Drive or you could back it up to OneDrive, but you can encrypt before you back it up. So they  don't get access to it. It's yours, right? Or you could just use it on every device. And that's the  other way I use it. I use it on my iPhone, my Android phone, on my Mac, on my PC, everywhere.  It's the solution to optimizing and preserving your digital legacy absolutely free and has all  the features you want of these cloud services without being in the cloud. For instance,  it automatically recognizes all the different things. You know, I can say, I want to see all  my pictures of bridges. Boom, it's done. It automatically recognizes all the people. Now,  I did go in and tag the people that I want to keep track of and now it's going through my photos.  I have more than a hundred thousand photos there now because I did Google Takeout and I was able  to bring in all my photos from Google Photos, all my photos from Flickr, from Instagram,  everywhere my photos have been spread out all over the years, all in one place, my Myleo Photos app.  It makes it easy to organize, edit, and manage. By the way, not just photos, it has OCR built in.  So you can do documents too. I have it import my documents as well. And the OCR means it's very  quick to find any document you want. You could put videos, yes, of course, and you're not paying  for storage unless you want to. So don't hold back. With the power of AI, it's analyzing everything  and giving them smart tags. So instead of you going through and creating folders and manually,  laboriously tagging everything, it does it all for you. I don't know if you were watching Ask  the Tech guy, somebody had mentioned the screensavers and I wanted a picture from the  screensavers. I just typed in Yoshi and boom, it showed up instantly. Thanks to Myleo. I love it.  I didn't have to fumble through libraries, look at different places. This is my new, in fact,  I just went and bought an external hard drive because I want to have everything in there.  I want to have everything. Older documents you thought were lost, update them right through the  Myleo Photos app while keeping the original intact. OCR is built in. And by the way,  everything I just described is free. You can also go with a subscription plan, the Myleo Photos Plus,  which I did immediately and now all my devices connect in one library, no cloud storage required.  So on my phone, I have all my Myleo Photos and you have complete control of it. You can say,  I want it to be just thumbnails. I want it to be just optimized images. No, I want to store the  originals. You have complete control. It'll even tell you ahead of time how much space that's going  to take. And with offline storage, I don't need to rely on the cloud to keep files accessible  through devices. I can also create new backup systems. No, they're secure. Myleo even has its  own solution. But I have to say, I have, I am, this is Nirvana. I finally found it. Don't wait,  preserve your digital legacy today. Get Myleo Photos for free today on your computer or mobile  device by going to our special URL, myleo.com slash twit.

Mark Gurman says it will, now I don't know how,  accurate he is. I think he's probably projecting rather than from an informant,  but it's a reasonable projection, the kind we make every year, that Apple will have an event  probably on the 12th or 11th and ship the phone on the 22nd. iPhone 15. Hey, that's coming up.  That's about a month off. Woohoo. The 11th is a Monday, the week after Labor Day. This is why  I think he's coming up with this date. It's the first opportunity Apple could do it. The 12th  is a Tuesday. Labor Day is on the 4th this year, so you're not going to do it on that week.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Apple has done it in the past that week. That's true. But it's probably unlikely that they have,  but they have done it right after Labor Day. It's a really expensive thing to do because,  you have, it's probably less expensive now because you're playing a movie.  So they could probably put it, it's a lot more portable. In the past, when it's been something  that was a live event, anytime you do a live event anywhere, you end up with a lot of crews.  Oftentimes a lot of those crews are union and there's all kinds of rules about what they're  getting paid over the weekend on Sunday and definitely on Monday. So usually when you see  people do a day after Labor Day, you're like, wow, they're big spenders. Alex speaks as if he knows

So there's a second report from 9to5Mac that also said the same thing,  which is, I think they said the 13th, Mark says the 12th of the 13th, which,  okay, not the 11th. In the past, they've done the Wednesday events only when the Monday is a holiday.  So if they're doing it the week after Labor Day, I would think they'd do it on the Tuesday,

They  got to get people there and yeah, yeah. So he's got to give people time to do it. And so then they  look at also the travel against those weekends as well of press has to come in.

It  will be a bigger update than the last two years for sure. The question is always, will that be  enough to motivate people? Cause that is, that is how Apple always takes their results to the next  level. Right? We talk about, they almost did, you know, whatever it is 90 or 80 ish billion dollars  when it's not the holiday quarter, but you know, three years ago they were in the 60 ish range and  then they do a new iPhone that's substantially new and everything just kind of goes up and then  plateaus again. So this might be that phone that they're hoping will drive lots of new sales,  lots of new customers. It's starting to shape up that way though. I mean, the rumors are not that  there's a couple of minor changes. I think that pro phone is going to, is going to be substantially  different than the last couple of years of pro phones. Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah. Everybody's saying that's this year too. Yeah. There's some leaked images online that  supposedly shows here's a component that has the USB-C charger in it with what looks like an  updated bottom frame. This is the point which looking at pictures like these gets tricky  because it is close enough to a launch date that you would expect that the chain of secrecy  has to sort of be broken in order to just get hardware into people's hands that people need  to see at this point. But it could still just be, hey, you're someone who's trying to get clicks.  But yeah, I mean, this Apple seems to have thrown in the towel on USB-C charging. So

Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know if they, I was thinking about that last night. I was looking through all  the cables that I have laying around now and I'm almost all USB-C. I have a couple odd,  I have even my, even my like watch charger is going to a USB-C outlet. I mean, the USB-A  feels really old. I have two lightning cables that I travel with. I, because when I'm traveling,  I really am clear, like what do I bring that I need? And so I've got a couple lightning cables.  And so I really, you know, I think Apple has hung out for quite some time, but my entire  infrastructure now is USB-C, not, not a lightning. So I don't know if it would impact as many people  as it would have two, three, four years ago, it would have definitely impacted a lot of people  because they were a lot of devices that were still on that. But I think that as it drags out,  a lot of us have, have already put USB-C into everything else. It's just super weird for them

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  absolutely must have lightning. That's. I feel like the fact that the adapters are all USB  A or C already, and that really this is a cable swap makes this potentially a lot less painful.  And so many people have collected USB-C devices over the years that I just think,  you know, there will be people who will complain, complain, and there'll be people who bought hotel  chains that bought, you know, like they did with the dock connector, all these plastic things that  have a lightning thing in the center that's perfectly set. That's like, well, you can't use  those anymore, but I think this is going to go down a lot easier than the last one. I still go

Transcript:  also, I think going to a non-proprietary connector, right? Cause the dock connector  went to the, to the lightning. And so it was not something you had around. You had to buy it  when you went to lightning USB-C, not everybody, but like lots of people have USB-C devices already.  Of various kinds. And so they're, and they've got those cables laying around. So it's not quite,  I just don't think it's going to be as big a thing, but yeah, certainly some  mid-list standup comedian is going to have a tight five about how annoying it is that they lost their  lightning connector. It's fine. Like what's next? USB-E and you know, whatever. Well,

Well, work or like, yeah, it's at these kinds of events, you know,  I'm here with a friend of mine, Fred, who's a, who's one of the top surveyors in the world.  And we went down to the bar and we're sitting there talking to this guy next to us, just kind  of hanging out and having it, having his drink. And I asked him what he does, you know, he just,  and he just looks, he looks like he, you know, you know, was a trucker or something, you know,  just said, and he goes, Oh, I do. I'm a Heather at this conference called Seagraph. And I'm like,  what do you do? And he's like, I do the virtual, I do the, the virtual simulations for the,  the lunar lander for the, for the, for our, it was so cool. And what happened was, is then my,  you know, my, my friend, Fred, he's, you know, he's got the, he's talking, he's a surveyor.  And so the two of them go into this discussion about ellipsoids and well, you know, the moon is  normally spherical and then, and Fred goes, well, how do you handle the coordinate systems? And  we're talking about, you know, there's all these coordinate system discussions and it's much harder  to land on the, on the, on the South pole. And because you have to do a long, this long ellipsoid  to stay in that orbit. And it was just like this incredible, but that's, so when you're here,  I could do that, or I could be up here watching TV. So that's how I usually, usually look at it.

Also, according to Mark Gurman, you start seeing these tests as  Apple builds these devices, they go on geek bench and stuff, and it's kind of a leak really,  model code name J514, a MacBook Pro high end, the central processing unit of the M3 Max,  according to Gurman has 16 main processing cores and stand back 40 GPUs. This is according to test  logs from a third party Mac app developer that was seen by Bloomberg News. There's the disclaimer,  is, and for, Oh, I should mention 48 gigs of memory. All of this is your MacBook Pro. This is,

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. The M3 may not even be this year, but if it is, it'll be end of the year and it'll be  the base model again. Right. It'll be a MacBook Air, but probably, I think Gurman's report suggests  it's probably something that's not going to be here till early next year. Four more high

Start time: 3569.72
End time: 3596.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  performance CPU cores, 12 in total, and at least two additional graphic cores, four efficiency cores.  So, you know, that gives us some insight into what's coming and not surprising. I think the real  unknown is what kind of performance jump the M3 will be from the M2. The M2 was an  incremental jump from the M1, but because we're going to a new node, I think maybe this will be

Start time: 3596.42
End time: 3624.16
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  a bigger jump. Yes. Yeah. I just think it's harder. It's getting harder for Apple to explain. Here's  why you would, here's what will entice you about this new family of processors over the previous  one. Cause it's not as though, it's not like the iPhone 14 is going to be one less as good as the  iPhone 15. It's like, okay, but this is going to be a real, it's not as, there was a version of the  M3 that's not going to be relevant for you. If you already have an M2 Pro, it's going to be really,

Start time: 3624.32
End time: 3686.08
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  really hard for the messaging on this. But I think it's also not just an upgrade from,  you know, the previous M1s or M2s, you know, there's, you know, there's hundreds of millions of  Intel Macs out there. And the question is, is when does the pressure point, you know, build to a point  where, wow, it's time for me to move on to a new, to a new computer. Same thing with the iPhone.  You know, you're not looking at trying to just get people to upgrade from a year or two ago.  You have all these hundreds of millions of iPhones that are five, six, seven versions deep  that you have to market to. And I think that they, you know, as you keep on making these,  these, you know, upgrades, you keep on adding that pressure to, you know, this might be my time to,  to do it. Because I think also a lot of people have learned to wait until the, like I, I,  other than Mac minis, which I just kind of consider like, they're just going to be what  they're going to be. I, I don't, I buy every computer the week after it was announced.  Like that's, you know, like I just wait almost always unless we absolutely need something.  We just wait. So those release cycles and showing that there's some improvement is also the big push

Start time: 3686.24
End time: 3700.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  for that quarter to keep people moving forward. Oh, interesting. Yeah. But you, so I think normal  consumers spread it out. That's why probably the laptops, there's not so much urgency  because normal computers, normal users aren't buying desktops so much as laptops. Right.

Start time: 3701.62
End time: 3735.20
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And I think we still keep on going back to the fact that, you know, these computers are so much  faster than the last ones. I think that the getting people to upgrade from M1s and M2s to M3s and M4s  are going to be really hard because, you know, what are you doing with that computer that makes  it worth it? You know, and, and, you know, I think people aspirationally wanted to move there and  they saw a huge jump and you see, you do see a huge jump from Intel to M1, but once you're in the M  series, that gets a lot more complicated just because there's not a lot of software. If you're  not doing graphics, if you're not doing video, if you're not doing some, you know, a hard  number crunching, there's not many things that are going to go any faster with a new machine.

Start time: 3737.24
End time: 3747.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm actually pretty darn happy with, with my, I think it's an M1 studio. I don't,  I don't feel any urgency, but for some reason I do always buy the new laptop.

Start time: 3747.60

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I don't know. The things that get you aren't, and this is so true, like Alex says now that  it's not the new processor, usually the new processor is great and it will come with you.  And for maybe if you're a Macbook pro buyer, it means more, but like the MacBook Air is their top  laptop. What's going to, you know, the new design drove it, new colors can drive it a better upgrade  to the display or the webcam, reduce the size of the bezels add a different, you know, I don't,  I like it ends up being more about the gestalt of the computer and not the power, but some other  collection of features that pushes you over into buying a new one. I think more likely than back  in the day when it used to be like, Oh, this computer is so slow. I need a faster computer.  It's not really like that now it's about like all the accoutrements that make up the product.

Start time: 3792.82
End time: 3822.80
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And, and I think also as much as Apple would like to get rid of every plug that we could  possibly put into that computer for me, peripherals are a big deal. Like, you know, the, the Mac mini  pro is got a lot more lanes and a lot more, you know, USB connections. And there's a lot of us  that are filling those up and they still do a good job at connecting everything. And so I think that  that's the other thing that you look at as you start to, as, as those ratchet up. And I think that,  I think that Apple could do better in that area to be honest.

Transcript:  Okay. We'll see.  Alex, I wanted to ask you something after reading some stuff like Nvidia announcements from SIGGRAPH  today. Like how much pressure is Apple going to get from a company like Nvidia that can  basically bring all the graphics horsepower that a lot of professionals need, professional,  but particularly for like for AI and for VR and also allowing people to say, well, here's take  $8,000, build whatever version of them, whatever feature rich Mac pro you want to build. It won't  run Mac, but at least you'll be able to access it with Nvidia and this other ecosystem. Is that

Start time: 3857.84
End time: 3980.08
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  really significant for Apple? I don't think Apple has any pressure because they can't compete with  those boards, those desktops. So like the app, the Mac pro is not going to do what does Nvidia  desktops are going to do. AMD is talking, I mean, there's, there's rumors that AMD has got 96 cores  coming for some of their CPUs. These are big machines and these machines are, and I think  this is where Apple, I think did a pretty smart move in the sense of the new Mac pro tops out,  I think at $12,500 or $13,000. They're not trying to build a $60,000 machine because if you start  penny for penny starting to compare them with these big Nvidia, the cards, the computers,  the same thing with the, the AMD solutions and the, and the next thread rippers and the, and the HPS,  those are playing a different game. And the reality is that game is really small. Like it's a really  small number of people. It's growing. It's a really profitable business for Nvidia. It's a profitable  business for AMD, but it is a very vertical business. So it's really not Apple's. I think that's  just not where Apple goes anymore. I think that the, the Mac pro does a great job of,  you know, really handling 95 to 99% of the market that they're, that they're aiming at.  But there's definitely, there's definitely things that I would use a PC for, you know,  these really heavy photogrammetry, nerfs, you know, those types of things are going to be,  you know, really hard rent, a lot of big rendering, you know, those, those kinds of  number, crunchy things are really belong. I mean, right now I think they really belong on a PC,  you know, for the really, really big solutions, not I think that Apple is not going to be,  not going to be competitive in that area. I think that they can, they can do a good job for again,  95, 99%. I think it's the 1% at the top. I think they've just decided when I looked at the Mac pro,  which I think is the right way to go for Apple is they just decided to seed all of that,  all those really heavy, all that heavy lifting to someone else for a market that I think is  too small for them to really pay attention to. Sure. Yeah. I was reading about the grace hopper

Transcript:  super chip that they announced and I'm like, just going on, not as someone who uses this as a  practical way, but someone who just looks at specs and looks at like the, the, the ram that they're  using, the way that they've architected this. It's like, wow. Another, another reason for me to  become confused as to why people spend more than X thousand dollars on a Mac. Cause it just seems  like a very, like you're saying, it seems like it's a very, very esoteric world in which above a  certain level of performance, it's not building one computer that is this, that this is this  performance, but having a need for no, I don't care about this aspect. I need the fastest ram or I  need the most amount of ram I can possibly get in here to run these models. So it's, it's just why  I keep being confused about above. I'm good up to about $4,000, $5,000. Once we get above that,  I'm like, I have lost the ability to know who's buying a Mac pro at this level.

Start time: 4029.52
End time: 4132.08
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, but I think that Mac pro, there's a lot of things. I mean, number one is it runs this, this,  this operating system called Mac. So, so that there's a big number of people that want a lot  of power and these people are going to be doing a medium to high end, not the ultra high end,  but medium to high end graphics work. They're going to be doing high, very high end video work.  I mean, there's nothing that you really can't do with a, I mean, up to 8k video. And we start  talking about 16k video or something more maybe, but really up to 8k video, the, the, this is tuned  for that. You know, and I think for some, you know, general scientific work, I think it's tuned for  that. So I think that it is, I mean, it's the same thing with final cut. If you look at that process  is when you start talking to the avid editors about what they want and what they, you know,  what they need to have to switch over, it's so fiddly, like all these little things that nobody's  no, none of the op, no one's going to use. And when you give them all those features,  they're still going to use an avid. So the thing is, is that so there's no, there's no upside for  apple to go into that market in the same way that I don't think there's an upside. The specialty that  the specialty approach that Nvidia is taking, that AMD is taking that a lot of other ones are taking  in these really high end solutions. And we're seeing a lot of that here on the floor. I mean,  Nvidia and, and HP and everything else, that's a world that I just don't, I just don't, I think  Apple's got a lot of engineering to do for the rest of the 95% or 99% that's out there.  And I just think they've, I think they've let that go. And I think that the last Mac pro was  not letting that go. It was going to, to 60,000. It's just not, it's, you know, but now I think  it's stopping at 12,000. And I do think that all those cards, you know, all the lanes that you have  with them with the USB-C's, all of those things are, are huge advantages, you know, to, so why

Transcript:  Oh yeah. No, no, it's, it's, it's, it's a great market for Nvidia. I just think that, you know,  Apple has not proven to do really, really well in really vertical markets, you know? And so,  and I think that this one, this is, it's also just a really hard clientele, you know, that also has  a lot invested in Nvidia, you know, like that's another like real challenge there is that Nvidia  has a lot of processes that a lot of these, the software, a variety of these software tools  are dependent on the RTX or they're dependent on these things. They wrote to that code base.  So it's not just, it's not competing apples to apples. They have something different that  everyone's written to already. So they're really serving that, that built up market.

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Maybe I, you know, they, they do in some cases because all everyone's buying these Nvidia and  AMD video cards. And so it does trickle down. The fact that it has that has already got a trickle  down effect that goes through that. I think in the same way that Apple isn't necessarily going to go  after Nvidia's market. I don't know if Nvidia really wants to go after Apple's market. Like,  you know, consumers are, are fiddly people too, you know, in different ways, you know,  and they're like, I don't understand why doesn't it just work? Why can't I just hit the button?  You know, and, and the engineers, I mean, the people who were doing, who were doing Bitcoin  for a long time had figured out how to take their, their, their graphics card and hang it from a wire  and plug everything into it so that they could, so that it could cool better. This is not the average  Apple user, you know, like pull a piece of the piece of it out. I'm going to hang them all through  there so I can blow fans through it in China, you know, like that's a, so, you know, so the, and,  and, you know, the fact that, that the, the interesting thing here is that in what Nvidia  is doing really well, and we're seeing this here at Seagraph is they are making the jump because,  you know, there was, I was in some discussion, we're talking about how great it was that, that  Bitcoin had, had cooled off because now we can all finally buy graphics cards again, you know, like,  you know, an AI, AI would have a really hard time. Chat, GPT, Mid Journey would all have a really hard  time scaling right now. If, if Bitcoin was at 60,000, you know, a coin or a hundred thousand a  coin, all the AI we see right now may not exist, you know, like, because they're, you just couldn't

It's sad.  The story of ARM is almost sad in a way. Apple started ARM back in the Newton days.  They were looking for a risk processor that they could use with good battery life and a portable  device. They sold off their stakes some time ago. Softbank owns it now. Softbank's been trying to  divest forever. First, they tried to sell it. That didn't work. Then they tried an IPO, I think,  and now they're selling stakes to their customers. Apple, Samsung, Nvidia, and did I say Nvidia?  Nvidia and Intel all buying stakes in ARM. I don't know how big Apple's stake will be,  but Nvidia tried to buy it for $40 billion. So imagine it's worth a little something.  And it is in Apple's interest because they have an architecture license for the ARM processor.

They're looking to sell single digit percentages to stabilize  what the company's about. And you're absolutely right. This is all about,  if it's not about these companies trying to get together and bond together to save and celebrate  this, it's no, they would like to eat. Any one of them would pay for it individually, but if they  don't go in together, then no one can own it. When the Nvidia deal was scrapped February of last

Transcript:  Right. Another investment from Apple that's interesting,  Lucca Maestri is trying to spend a little bit of its cash holdings. They're buying servers  for AI from Foxconn. What I did not know, this is an Apple insider story, is that Foxconn sells a  significant percentage, 43% of all AI servers worldwide to open AI, the chat GPT creators,  to Amazon Web Services, to Nvidia. Foxconn is obviously building these servers to somebody's  spec. What does that catalog look like? I want that. Yeah, let's get that catalog. I'd like to  buy an AI server, please. Tim Cook has said that Apple's working on AI and has been for years  and that machine learning pervades everything it does. But of course it doesn't have a public  facing AI solution, unless you count Siri, which no one would use the word intelligence in Siri  in the same sentence. I'd rather that be less public.  According to the South China Morning Post, Apple has ordered an unknown number of servers  for the training and testing of AI services. They'll be made by a Foxconn division called  Industrial Internet built in Vietnam. Foxconn already Apple's biggest supplier of servers  for their data centers. And according to the South China Morning Post, Foxconn accounts for 43% of  the server market globally. I had no idea. So they're making them. That is interesting,

Start time: 5054.10
End time: 5109.84
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  because it kind of points to either the privacy that they're seeking to be able to say that we are  taking this completely in-house, both for their own industrial IP reasons, but also if they were  to launch any service or any feature enhancement that relies on a server-based AI product, they  want to be able to say that, no, we're not using Google Cloud. No, we're not using any others.  We're not outsourcing any of this. This all stays within our purview and within your original  privacy agreement. But it also means, I wonder how much this is just knowledge that they can't  continue to grow their model without having this kind of resource versus they actually want to  launch this as a real thing. Because remember that a lot of this is the bakery for an AI model. Once  the model is cooked, they won't necessarily need computing hardware of this scale and magnitude  to have it working on either their own local servers or to have this running even on a

Transcript:  future Apple products and devices. We don't know how many servers or how much it will cost.  Although Pixel Bud says that Apple's investment in ARM was an arm and a leg.  So maybe this is equally expensive. More ways to spend the Apple dollar.  You have the story, Jason. If you look at Apple TV, if you use Apple TV,  apparently Lionel Messi is the second coming. There's sports in it.  Holy cow. There is more Lionel Messi on my Apple TV than anything else. This is their major league  soccer investment. Did they have a hand in bringing Messi to, where did he go, Jersey?

Start time: 5152.04
End time: 5218.49
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  They did, no, Miami. Miami. And they did, which he likes because there's an Argentinian community  there and it's pretty, it's easier for him to get back home as well. But part of the deal was the  league, it's not just the clubs, right? It's the league and Apple all reportedly made a deal where  Messi actually will get paid, at least in part, based on how well MLS subscriptions do. That he's  going to get a little piece. He's got a little piece of the upside of MLS, the MLS season pass  that Apple sells. And that was one of the sweeteners in the deal. Just like they made the  deal for Beckham where they basically said, we'll give you an expansion team, which is the Miami  team, which Beckham is a part owner in now. So they're motivated to sweeten the deal for Messi.  And now they're promoting the half cat of it. And which leads us to the story you're going to talk  about, which is Apple trying to buy into American college football and actually sort of sweetening  the deal to the point where it almost worked, but instead it didn't.

Transcript:  Apple offered the nine remaining members of the PAC 12 conference.  So they are called PAC 9, a five year deal. Wait for it, PAC 4 now.  A five year deal with an annual base rate of $23 million per school. That seems like a good amount  of money. I'm reading from Jason's article at Six Colors with incentives based on projected subscribers  to a PAC 12 streaming product like their MLS league pass. However, it didn't work out that way.

Start time: 5253.76
End time: 5459.12
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  So they sweeten the deal, but what they want, and this seems to be Apple. So what can we learn from  this? Apple's model with sports rights seems to be different. Most sports rights, you literally just  write a check and say, we will give you money to the NFL or whatever. They don't want to have an  upside downside relationship with you. They want you to pay them. And Apple doesn't want to play  that game. So Apple with MLS, there's obviously, it's a partnership and this PAC 12 offer they made  was, and they sweeten the deal, but they wanted there to be upside that they were participating  in with the conference. The conference would need to support this. And if the conference was  successful in driving subscriptions to a season pass product, Apple and the conference would  benefit and the schools in the conference, which is so unconventional. But there were three teams  in the conference that were talking about leaving to go to a conference that already had basically  given them guaranteed money if they switched. And Apple sweetened the deal enough that they said,  okay, we'll take this deal. We'll take this deal. However, there were a couple other teams in the  conference who didn't love the idea of Apple basically saying, we're not guaranteeing you this  extra money. You're going to have to work for it. And so they at the last minute basically went to  the Big Ten conference and said, we'll take less money. Please make us an offer. All you have to do  is beat this Apple deal. And the Big Ten went to Fox, the TV network and said, do you have an extra  extra money for Washington and Oregon? And they said, yes. And at that point, everybody left. And  all that's left in the PAC four right now is Cal and Stanford and Washington state and Oregon state.  And the question is, so will they try to rebuild and bring in some new schools and sell something  to Apple? Well, maybe, but it won't be for this. But in the end, from an Apple perspective, look,  as a Cal person, I am devastated because this is the end of my entire life of being a sports fan.  It's all gone now. It just evaporated on Friday. It's gone. It's over. This will be the last year.  And then whatever it is, it won't be this anymore. The thing that I grew up with. But from the Apple  perspective, I will say we learned something here, which is Apple's got all the money in the world.  We said it. Apple's got 40 billion in the bank. They can do whatever they want, but they're not  willing to write the big check because they seem to believe philosophically they want partners who  are going to benefit with them in the success of the product they're trying to build. And with MLS,  they have a partner. With the PAC 12, that's what they wanted. They could have said, well,  just give you 30 million a school and walk away. And they refuse to do that, I think,  philosophically. And I think the question is, is that the future of sports rights negotiations?  With all of these now direct-to-consumer products that are out there, streaming services,  I wonder if what we just saw is the first example of groups with sports rights being told, I'm not  going to write you a blank check. You need to participate in the success or failure of this.  And I would not be surprised if we see this repeat itself over the next decade  as the economics of sports TV work themselves out. But regardless, I think Apple basically  got the ones that were sitting on the fence to come back in. And then the two that said they  were solid are like, we're not actually solid. And then they were out and the whole thing was

Start time: 5459.18

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 5466.38
End time: 5498.74
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I mean, you could say that, but they're not a charity, right? They could have saved the PAC  12 if they had offered more, but they didn't think it was worth more. And there are plenty of villains  here. Fox is a villain. The Big Ten is a villain. Oregon and Washington are villains. USC is a villain  because they started this. But the truth is money talks. And right now in college sports,  the only thing that matters is football TV money. Apple wants to play in that game for  people outside the U S people who don't follow sports. American football is number one. And  college football is one a behind the NFL in terms of money and huge ratings and huge money.

Start time: 5499.10
End time: 5551.16
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And college games are the ramp to professional games. So if Apple's able to show here are all  the features that we could add, and these are all the things that we can make it cool and  everything else. Then the next time the NFL comes around with a contract, Apple's not going,  Hey, we haven't done like, I mean, Amazon came kind of came in from nowhere to get Thursday night  football. And the first year wasn't perfect. Like it wasn't, you know, like it was, it needed a  little work to, you know, to kind of work out some of the kinks on the streaming side, mostly just,  just on, I mean, not so much the production, but just on getting the infrastructure ready to go.  So I think that this is, you know, I think NFL doesn't want to do too much of that either.  So having a team, you know, being able to show what those features are, especially as you have  the vision pro, you have a lot of devices, you know, you can start to show why it would make  sense to do that. And I think that's part of it. And the original deal be a relatively bargain

There were a lot of  things as a test for them that this would have been a good fit, but clearly they were not willing.  Like I said, they sweetened their deal by 2 million guaranteed per school. And that got  the Arizona schools and Utah off the fence and saying, we will stay. And they came on Friday  morning to the meeting and basically said, okay, we're here. And then everybody looked around and  said, wait a second, where are Oregon and Washington? And that was the end of the whole story. But so  they kind of closed the deal in some ways, but what they would not do is just say, forget about  being our partner. We're just going to write you all checks for 30 million a year. They were not  willing to do that. And, and that's interesting, right? Cause they could, but I don't think they  want to. I don't think they like doing business that way. Also understand that the original

Transcript:  to help us a little bit. And it sounds from the reports that I saw the sports business journal  report about this, that they obviously the universities are very concerned. They want  high profile games on TV, right? Because those are how you recruit and how people discover  your university. And if it's all locked behind a paywall or behind a streaming app, that's not as  good. And so it sounds like Apple basically said, we will try to do what we did with MLS, which is  license some of our games back to ESPN or something like that. But we're not giving you any guarantees  about that. We're going to have to negotiate that and see what it's like. And that gave them pause.

Start time: 5677.02

Start time: 5689.68

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  SEC. Traditionally, although that that has basically fallen apart in the last couple of years,  because everybody there's a huge land rush right now, because the conferences, they're too big.  I mean, the short version is there are two big conferences, the SEC and the big 10.  And they are basically powered by Fox and ESPN. And they are headed for in the 2030s,  the creation of essentially two semi pro conferences that take all the money and will and they will pick  out all the schools that don't really matter. And they'll be left with like 32 schools that  and you'll say to yourself, well, what does this has to do with school? And the answer is nothing  other than that some of that money goes back to those athletic departments to fund other sports.  But it's a it's a huge business that's worth a lot of money. And so all the kind of traditions  are breaking apart and you end up with university presidents who on one level are very stuffy  academic types, but have somebody in their athletic department basically saying, look,  this is we can't turn down 30 or 40 or $50 million a year. Can you imagine what that will do?  Ironically, most of that money will just go back into the football team and not to the  students or the even the other programs. I mean, the big sports tragedy here is that  so much of the US Olympic team and many other countries, Olympic teams actually come out of  the Cal and Stanford programs that have full Olympic programs. They're the most successful  college athletic programs for non revenue sports. And where did that revenue come from?  A conference that no longer exists. So that's not going to be good in the long run for America's  Olympic sports. But it doesn't matter because again, football is is the TV money and the money  talks. Apple tried to play in that game and didn't and didn't make it. Joe Reedy's headline in the AP

Start time: 5799.92

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  That's taken kind of the Apple point of view. Yeah, they also took well, no, the other part of it is  they turned down an offer from ESPN last year and they anticipated a better offer. And we all know  what happened, which is Netflix had that bad quarter. Everybody freaked out. It suddenly  became a place streaming no longer was a place where you invested money. Instead, you were trying  to save money. And that put a chilling effect over the entire sort of TV industry. And so they  turned down ESPN and ESPN did not come back to them essentially, or came back to them for almost  nothing. So they made a they made a huge miscalculation. If they had known then what we  know now they wouldn't have done it obviously. But I think there's truth in the fact that  pure streaming sports rights are going to be terrifying for leagues and conferences.  And everybody's watching what MLS is doing with Apple, right? Because that is the MLS just took  the plunge and they're going to show everybody what the issues are with taking your product

Start time: 5859.68
End time: 5871.86
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  and putting it on a streaming service. And they had the least to lose and the most to gain.  Like they're there. So so there's a lot of upside for MLS and very little downside.  Yeah, they seem real happy.  Well, I think they're doing okay.

Start time: 5872.44

Transcript:  MLS does cover production costs. So this is this is the new this is where Apple was emboldened by  the new deal. So Apple did a deal with MLS with escalators based on subscriptions. MLS covers most  of the production costs. They tried to do they tried to do the same thing with college football

Start time: 5893.24

Transcript:  and it didn't work out. And 12 has their own production system to all the leagues do though.  That's the we made the future of of these sports leagues may end up being a streamer  buys the rights and say NFL you you produce the games for us. And that's it. And the NFL does

Transcript:  it instead of CBS or NBC. Pac 12 had one of a state of the art. Like when we say they have,  you know, they were cut their coverage, especially for the non revenue generating sports,  they had to get those the cost down. And so Pac 12 has, you know, they were they used to have a  downtown facility in San Francisco. And all of those schools would send the raw cameras back.  So they even had, you know, they didn't have all the production there. They were just they had a  little these little trucks that were designed for it. Take out you throw out six six cameras  on triacs, you send them all back over internet to they all come back. Sometimes the the announcers  were there. Sometimes they were in San Francisco. Sometimes they were at home. They're doing all the  replays and everything else out of San Francisco. And it was very, very efficient.  You know, it's really I was surprised when I saw that things were coming apart. But it was those  things don't what they became efficient at is not what makes money. It's interesting to watch how

Start time: 6030.40
End time: 6086.42
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll be really hard to get broadcasters. There's a handful of places where you see kind of  unlimited money being spent on figuring this out. Not unlimited, but very close to it. F1 is one of  them. NFL. Sometimes the NFL is working on things for years before before you see it like those  the pylon cameras that you see all the time. Now they were they were sitting there. They were  like, oh, that isn't good enough or we're tearing or something else is going on for years.  Really? Trying to figure that out. Yeah. And so and I mean, if you look at the project, you know,  the how the just the first down lines that pop up and all the data that looks like it's sitting on  the field. If you look at any replays of like old games only 10 years ago, it's kind of a mess.  You know, like it was just, you know, it wasn't it wasn't very good. And now they're doing them  with like moving cameras. It used to be it was all these cameras. Only a certain number of cameras  were able to do that. And so but but that's the NFL doing that. That's not the broadcasters.  Right. The NFL is investing that money and you need people to be. I think you're right.

Start time: 6086.82
End time: 6143.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think Jason's right. That's the future is that these companies, these these sports leagues are  going to produce their own video and sell rights to a streamer. But they're going to be. So it  looked like the college presidents or the negotiators were just a little chicken.  Yeah, this is what AP says. A person familiar with the Apple deal told AP  the guaranteed yearly payouts were twenty three to twenty five million per school.  And then there were escalators based on subscribers, as you mentioned, two and a  half million subscribers. The payout would go to 30 million, which is pretty close to what the big  12 payouts are. If they reached more three point seven million, it would jump to 50 million per  school, which is very close to the SEC and the Big Ten. It would put these Pac-12 teams in the same  arena as the biggest college football teams. Was that an unreasonable number? Three point seven  million. Maybe they thought they could do it. I don't think so. But I think the I think the

Start time: 6144.32
End time: 6225.68
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  university look, university presidents are so weird and I think they're super risk averse.  They're not immediate negotiators. I think this was probably a pretty great deal.  Also, there's a larger issue in the end. Apple did close the deal. I mean,  Apple closed the deal with the ones that were doubting. And the reason that it all fell apart  is an extraneous reason, which is Oregon and Washington are looking at the big picture of  where college football is going and they want to be on the bus that gets them to survival into the  2030s and that NFL to essentially that the college conferences are making. And the way you get on  that bus, the Big Ten is the bus, right? The Pac-12, even if it survived another five years,  is not the direct line to ultimate, you know, super college football money. And I think that  was the reason that they fell off. So in the end, I think that this is they were skeptical of Apple  not giving them guaranteed money, but I think it's an excuse. I think the truth is Apple sweetened  the deal enough that they got everybody else to sign on, but the two biggest names realized they  could cut themselves a better side deal. And you know what? If I were them, I probably would have  done the same, but that was the net result is that Apple sort of gets blamed. But I don't think Apple,  I think Apple came through with the people that were the most skeptical, which was the Arizona  schools in Utah. They were there on Friday morning ready to vote for it. Yeah. The other issue is

Start time: 6226.00
End time: 6248.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  one that Apple can't solve by itself, which is linear TV, broadcast television. And a lot of  the presidents, a lot of the schools said it's important to our athletes. It's important for  our teams that they're on TV, that if they're not on TV, they're not going to have a national  exposure. They may not get the NFL contract. And Apple couldn't offer that. Apple didn't insist on

Start time: 6248.52
End time: 6289.34
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  an exclusive deal, but what Apple, because this all happened so quickly, Apple said we will try  to sell games to a partner on broadcast, but we can't guarantee it. That was not in the deal,  right? They didn't say, Oh, we've got ESPN lined up. They're going to do all these games on Saturday  nights. It's going to be great winner. They did not do that. And, and so I, cause I do, I agree.  I think you have to have both. I think the future of sports on TV is a combination of big marquee  matchups that can go out to huge audiences and generate lots of commercial revenue and then niche  stuff that's on a streamer. I think you got to be able to do both. Everybody wants to watch Jason

Start time: 6319.76

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  fell apart. And I also think that Apple wanted to show that that model works. That's a great model  for them to prove that it works. Like, Hey, you know, you have to work at it a little bit. We need

Start time: 6328.08
End time: 6337.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  some help. And by the way, it was, it was only a two year deal. It wasn't the 10 year deal that  they made with MLS. They were, they said you can walk away after two years. Right. It was a five

Start time: 6337.32
End time: 6341.22
Speaker: Jason Snell

Start time: 6341.30
End time: 6359.40
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  commitment. Well, the thing for Apple though is that's a, that's a pretty sweet deal. You get a  whole bunch of people to subscribe and now you've got a whole bunch of people in the, in the, in the  mix. And you know, that, that helped. There's a lot of tangential stuff. So when they leave,  they'd go find something else, but Apple keeps, you know, maybe not subscribers in that specific  vertical, but they've now brought potentially brought more people into the ecosystem.

And the, the issue is, is that, you know, Apple  and Amazon are playing a different game than everybody else. Everybody else is trying to  figure out how they make money with this. And Apple and Amazon are, there's a lot of ways they make  money at it, you know? And so, and it's, it's going to be really interesting to see specifically how  those two, um, compete in these markets because you know, Amazon got a little bit of the NFL,  Apple's got MLS and is obviously trying to get more, but they can play that game. And it's not  clear that the other streamers can afford, you know, that rich of a, uh, uh, of a game.

It's interesting when you compare it to just quickly, when you look at what we've been  talking about for weeks and weeks and weeks about, uh, about like Goldman Sachs and,  and not, and other makers where they did a deal with Apple in which Apple gets to get all most  of the benefits and they negotiated away most of the risks. And it's interesting to see them,  how the, how Apple has to negotiate when no, actually you can't dictate to us exactly how  we're going to deliver yours, the service, you're going to convince us that you're a good partner  for us and you're going to do it in a very, very demonstrative way.

Transcript:  I don't know if you saw the Tetris movie on Apple TV. It was quite a good movie. Turns out,  maybe its provenance wasn't so good. Dan Ackerman, who's editor in chief of Gizmodo,  wrote the book in 2016 called the Tetris Effect, the game that hypnotized the world.  He is now suing Apple, the Tetris company and others saying, you adapted my book without paying  me. He said he sent his book to the Tetris company in 2016. He alleges they copied it for the movie  and threatened to sue him if he pursued his own film or television spinoffs. Ackerman is asking  the court for 6% of the film's $80 million production budget. And it sounds like he's  got a pretty good case. We'll see. Let's see what happens. I did, I did read the book and I did,

Start time: 6484.20
End time: 6569.82
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I kind of assumed that they licensed it. Yeah. He's hired him on for some reason.  There are scenes that are specifically from the book.  Yeah. And the entire approach was, the reason why that book was so good was because it didn't just  say, Hey, nostalgia nerds, remember Tetris, here's the wacky story. No, it's like, we're going to,  I'm going to write a Cold War thriller. It just happens to center around Tetris. And that's,  and there's a, there's a reason why, like when, when Sweeney Todd got adapted as a musical by  Sondheim, like the central conceit was inspired by a stage production that came out three years ago.  And it was important to say, yeah, we're going to have, even though like this is really the only  thing we're taking from this, we're going to have to license this or else we're going to be in big  trouble. So yeah, that, that's, that's pretty weird. Oh, but another thing I noticed is that  remember that in streaming, if this had been released as a real movie, there would be like  box office numbers. So they could say, Hey, this movie generated X dollars for the box office  income. We want a percentage of that income. But with streaming, because they don't say what the  audience numbers are, they can't possibly detail like how much money they made. The only metric  they can use to say, here's how much, here's how much this, this, here's how much the value of your  theft has to, has to contribute. It has to be, well, we know that you spent this much money on,  we're going to ask for a percentage of your actual production budget. So you can't get out of it that

Finally, Google has  announced a new way to write apps for the iPhone and Android and everything else. Project IDX,  an experiment to improve full stack, multi-platform app development, says Google launched August 8th  and it allows you to do cross platform. In fact, the browser is actually the host of the IDE,  which is really interesting and they're offering AI. So it'll, it'll write some of the code for you.

Start time: 6613.02
End time: 6692.32
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, this is, this is a really interesting development because one of the things that we've  been talking about for a long, long time is when will you be able to build and deploy apps directly  from the iPad? Because the iPad seems to be muscular enough now that you can actually do that.  Why can't we use this as a development environment? So this is right now, this, the platform is  designed for building a, for building web-based apps. But they are saying that the future direction  of this is to build an emulate, build an emulators for iOS, build an emulators for Android,  and essentially be able to use this, this cloud-based environment, meaning anything with a web  browser, you'll be able to run it to create, to create binary runnables for basically any platform.  So you build it once, you don't even have to build it locally and now you can deploy this on  multiple platforms. It won't be built on, it won't be like the Xcode environment by any means.  And there's a, I'm certainly willing to wonder how much of the, can you, can you write an equivalent  app in Xcode versus an equivalent app in this thing? But when it comes to simple apps or service  app, writing it one place, not having to have your entire team have Mac, like Mac Pro-grade hardware  and be able to contribute to this code base, generate with AI, and basically build this one  thing that could be deployed anywhere. That's super interesting, particularly for students, I think.

But  I do know that it's invite only right now. I do believe that in the future they're trying to use  this to promote their own like ad deployment platform. So I'm sure that it's a way to tie  that in. Also, they're making sure that they're saying that yes, we have AI, but please don't use  any of the AI as a cut and paste sort of solution.

Start time: 6820.60

We don't, we're not going to limit like a web-based app. I think based on the idea  that, well, of course something that's running inside a web container will never be as sophisticated  and powerful and as useful as something that's written with our own code development tools.  But as we've seen, like in 2023, oftentimes you kind of have to ask yourself, given that this app,  even if it were an iOS app, would require an active connection to the internet, why are we  bothering going through Apple at all? Why don't we just have, why don't we write our Kindle app  so that it is in fact a web app. It can store things directly on the device. We'll be able to  allow people to make purchases through the site and install them without having to leave. We won't  have to pay a dime to anybody. Facebook could say, well, actually if we did it, if we did this as a  web app, again, it would look people, as soon as people hit the app, they can say, oh, by the way,  put an icon for this right on your desktop and use it just like any other, other app. And all of a  sudden, like Apple is not quite so, is not getting all the, all the, all the jazz they're getting  from having these, these native apps. It's there. I think the benefit is that I think people,  I think these developers, they do want a lower level access to all the sensors and lower level  access to everything that's going on on the device. But there could be a day when they're there. I do  write the apps for myself on occasion. And most of the apps that I write could be simply written  as web apps without having to like put something provisioned on my iPad or anything like that.  Cause they are, I'm not writing the next greatest word processor. I'm writing a gadget so that every  time that there's a cough or a pause or something in a podcast recording, I can touch a button  and it's automatically creating like an edit log for me. That's not really sophisticated.

Google has now published an ad to,  to reassure you it's all good, man.  And just to make sure that they're agnostic, they show some other companies.  Yeah. I'll say those, those, those alerts are coming from the video. Oh yeah. By the way. Yeah.  That's not you. It's, it's me. It's not you. It's all good with Google on Android. Even if you have

I'm also, I'm also wondering how much of this was oftentimes when a company like  Apple or Google makes deals with device manufacturers is that, Oh, by the way, and we will also, as part  of this contract, commit X dollars to promoting, promoting this issue, promoting, doing something  that will help you to sell more of your devices, even though it's not ours. So I'm sure that there  was some sort of collusion saying, Oh, by the way, as they're talking to Samsung, we will make sure  that we're spending money to make sure that Apple people know that yes, you can make a lateral move  like that without like having to torch your entire social media profile, all your contacts,  all your calendars, all your photos.

Transcript:  gentlemen and ladies. No, there's no ladies here. Your picks of the week coming up in just a second.  I would like to put in a little bit of a plug for our club twit. Maybe you watch our shows and you're  tired of advertising. Maybe you would like to see us develop new shows. Maybe you'd just like to get  a little bit of Ant Pruitt's time critiquing your latest photography. That's all part of club  twit. We announced club two years ago. Happy to say 8,000 of you have joined. Thank you.  $7 a month. It's very affordable. There's a year plan, $84. There's a family plan. There's corporate  plans. You get ad free versions of everything we do. You get special content. We only offer in the  club, including shows like the Untitled Linux show, Hands on Macintosh with Micah Sargent, Hands on  Windows with Paul Thurrott. We have the Giz Fizz with Dick DiBartolo. We just launched Home Theater  Geeks with Scott Wilkinson. Brought that back thanks to club members who subsidized that.  Some of those shows will become part of the twit family of public shows at some point,  as This Week in Space did, if enough interest is shown. But what's the beauty of having the  club is that we can try this kind of stuff. It helps us keep the lights on. The money does not  go into my pocket. I can assure you it goes to support twit. Twit.tv slash club twit. Please  become a twit by joining and thank you in advance. We really appreciate it. I would  love to have every one of you be a member of the club. There's a lot of great stuff going on in  there. Let me just see. Ant is always adding new events. Oh, we got a photo walk coming up at the  end of the month. I'll be at that. Stacey's book club also. Her new book is the book we're talking  about is Anne Leckie's Translation State. That fireside chat with Daniel Suarez and Hugh Howey,  that'll be something. And again, these are club only. We'll probably put it on the stream  so you could watch it live. But if you want to watch it after the fact, September 7th,  2 p.m. Pacific, you'll be wanting to join the club. Lou Maresca, our host at this week in  Enterprise Tech, is doing an Ask Me Anything, another fireside chat coming up with our AI guy,  Anthony Nielsen. He's our creative and he is incredible. Just some of the many things going  on. It's like a country club on the internet. You provide the swimsuit and towel.  Twitter.tv slash club. Twitter, thanks in advance.  All right. Let's get start the picks of the week off with Jason Snell, Mr. Six Colors.

Transcript:  Well, I had to do a bunch of transcriptions on the road last week for this Apple analyst call.  And I have a whole bunch of things that I built up to. I downloaded things from GitHub that did the  AI open AI whisper model. And I wrote a shortcut and all of that. I'm on the road with my laptop  and I'm like, oh, God, can I get it all over here? Can I translate it? And the answer was no. I just  bought a piece of software because there are two Mac utilities that actually have integrated the  whisper C plus plus framework thing that is great that you can download for free. If you pay a little  more money, you don't have to use the command line and then they'll let you export to whatever  format you want. So there are two. The one that I have used is Mac whisper. And then the other  one is called Ico. There are Icos in the Mac app store and it's actually in the iOS app store  as well. Mac whisper is at gumroad and you can get both of these basically are using the same  open AI whisper model. It's a very high quality. You can reduce the quality for speed. The medium  quality is still very, very good, but the high quality is kind of mind blowing and the medium  quality is good enough as well. So if you ever are in a position where you need to transcribe some  audio, if you're comfortable doing the GitHub and command line thing, go ahead by all means,  do that. You can do it and it's free, but you might want to pay a little tiny bit of money  to go the extra mile. Cause I know I, I recommended whisper as a model last year.  This year I'm saying, well, you may not want all of that trouble. You don't need to somebody. In  fact, more than one, somebody have written a nice app shell around all of that. So all you have to  do is pick an audio file, press the button and it'll generate a very good transcript.  And this technology is only going to get better, but I used to type the Apple analyst call,

Transcript:  which is an hour long by hand. Yeah. So did Mike. Mike used to have to do that. I think Serenity

Start time: 7363.68
End time: 7450.22
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  used to have to do it. Serenity and I, Serenity and I, in fact, our big innovation was we had a  shared Google doc and we would time shift. So, so I'd be doing the first 15 minutes while she was  doing the next 15 minutes. And then I would jump to 30 and she jumped to 45 and we would kind of  interleave it. But all that's out the window. I mean, it's been, I've been using AI transcription  for a while now, but this whisper model is so good. It is the best I've seen. And so you can't edit  the transcript in these apps. You just export the text and then you can edit it somewhere else.  I think the ultimate is going to be when you get a text editor that's got the transcript in it. And  you can, there are web apps that do this now, but they don't do it with, with whisper. So I want that  one to come together and have the great model and let me sort of click anywhere and hear the audio  that underlies it. That's, that's coming. If it hasn't already been added to some of these other  web services, but this keeps it all on your Mac, nothing leaves your Mac. And so you can just do  it anywhere. Even if you're traveling somewhere on the road and don't even have a good internet  connection, this will work. Do you have one you prefer? Mac whisper is the one that I use. ICO,  I just discovered, I had a friend who uses it. It, it seems to only have the large model,  which is the way they put that is they prioritize quality over speed, which is fair enough. The large  model is very good. The media model though is so close that if you, if, if time is slightly of the  essence, the media model and Mac whisper lets you choose any of the models. So interesting.

Transcript:  the big challenge with these models is speaker detection there. I've yet to see a good  thing that unites speaker detection with this transcription. Cause that's what you want is  you want it to say, Leo said this, then Andy said that. And those were, that's the next frontier.  I imagine by this time next year, they will have that solved. And then I won't have to say,  this is Tim, this is Luca, Tim. I won't have to do that anymore. Does it say speaker one, speaker

Says Leo who knows nothing about how hard this would be to do good pick Mac whisper or I ECO AI  KO you take your pick. Speaking of AI, I gotta, I gotta give a little credit to Anthony Nielsen.  I mentioned he's our AI guru and I think you might be interested in this in Alex. I know you're all  over mid journey. Did you know there's a new thing called full journey?  Also, also a discord group. I'll put the links in the, in the show notes. It generates music,  it generates speech and a variety of people's voices, sound effects. Yeah, of course it does  image gen as well. It's a, I guess an extension of, of mid journey. It's called full journey.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So I'm here in LA and I realized that there's a, you know, a bit of a, there's a store  I like to go to almost every time in LA. And I thought, oh, this view, I was just there over  the weekend. And if you're in LA film tools is the geekiest place that you can find about film making.  You know, and, and I just went in and I went in again with my friend who had never seen any,  anything like film tools. And we, and I was walking around like, well, this is what this does. And  there's, you cannot believe how many little weird things you can use to attach to a car or to a thing.  And these are the pro tools that you see in the movies. You know, this is just a place like when  you don't, when you're like, oh, I need some, you know, Gaffer's tape or some C 38, there's a whole,  there's a whole wall of Gaffer's tape. There's, there's, there's the different thicknesses and  different widths and different, all of these things, the entire, there's an entire wall of  Gaffer's tapes. Yeah. You're in the right place. And, and there's like a whole section just for  weird audio tools and there's cameras in the back. And, and then you've got some lights and you've  got, you got a whole section for Pelican cases and, and, and they, and they have all this. And  it's just one of those places that I just, when I, especially when I'm in Burbank, I was in Burbank  for this, this event. And so I was only about a mile away. And so I spent about an hour in there  and wandering around spending too much money and, and just, you know, finding little bits and bobs  of things that I needed to add to my camera for the shoot that we're doing. You're in Mecca for  filmmaking. I mean, this is the company town. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's a really great little,  it's, it's a great space. And so there's not, there's other places that do it. And I definitely  go to different, you know, this kind of thing in most major cities and somewhere, but film tools is  still my favorite. And so if you're in LA, it's just, even if you don't do filmmaking,  it's worth just looking at all the crazy stuff that is built just to get your camera into just

Transcript:  and said, I'm sorry. I had, I had, I did the same thing with the theta. I put it on the front,  right in the middle to get like a 360 of me driving and the, the suction cup handled it just  fine. But the, but it turns out the theta can only go about 55 miles an hour before the quarter 20  on the bottom fails and it bounces off your windshield. And then the, the big tanker truck  behind it crushes it. The giveaway was all happening like, you know, two seconds going like  this on the front of the car. It was, it was, it was wobbling a little bit. And I thought to myself,  I can stabilize that. That's okay. I can stabilize that. I'll let it go.

Transcript:  and I go pick of the week. I'm really excited about this one. A few weeks ago, I talked about  how like, I'm Evernote is not necessarily, it's not going away. I don't want people. Some people  on Twitter thought that I was, I was saying that, oh, well, because Twitter has been bought by a  Twitter, sorry. Evernote has been bought by a, a, a bought up by a new company. They're moving the  entire company's operations to Europe where they, where the new buyer is. Yeah. Yes. It's, it's not,  I'm not saying, I'm not saying that they're going out, they're going out of business,  but it was a good excuse for me to say, well, what thing, what feature of Evernote would I  absolutely be despondent over if I didn't have it anymore, either because they did go out of  business or they started charging so much money that can't afford it. And it's so much of my work  is saving web pages so that I have them offline. I can take them with me when I, when I travel.  And also so that in case a post gets taken down, I will still have the original. And that was what  I was using Evernote for. So I've been looking for a replacement for that, that wouldn't require  Evernote specifically. And I finally found the one that is, oh my goodness, so much better  at this job. It's called single file. It's free. It's a plugin for pretty much any web browser.  You can imagine it's available on GitHub and at its very, very surface, it does exactly  the simple thing. It is a plugin that appears in your, in your address bar. You click on it,  and then it will save all the content of the web page that you're, you're, you're looking at  and save it as a file. And it does the thing that I was really most looking for. It's not a, it's,  it's not a proprietary Apple format. That was the problem of saving things from, from Safari,  because I'd have to switch to Safari. It's not a format used by Chrome, which Safari browsers  don't support, which would mean that I couldn't use this in Safari. It's saved as HTML and meaning  and saved as one simple, single HTML file. Even all the images are converted to base 64. So they're  actually embedded inside the HTML file. So it's just one HTML file. Any, any browser made within  the past like 10 years or whatever, should be able to open this and display this on any sort of device.  And it's very, very accurate and very, very fair. But in addition to that, it also has, if you hit  the, hold down the option key while you click on that icon, it has a million options to it. Yes,  you can annotate so I can add notes to it, or I can say, or I can highlight stuff in it or say,  oh, just save this part of it. Don't save these parts of it. You can have it,  save every single tab that's in a window. You can even set it up so that every time you bookmark  something, that bookmark is automatically downloaded and saved. And then I'm just  scratching the surface of what you can do with this. Again, it's super simple just for its one  purpose. But as soon as you click on the option key or look at the, look at the, the readme file  on the GitHub, you start to see that, oh my goodness, this is a complete solution to everything  that I would ever need to do. Not only does it replace, it doesn't just replace and enhance  what I'm doing in Evernote, it creates new opportunities and new workflows that let me  do things I wasn't able to do at all. So yeah, huge, huge. I mean, that's a, it's free. There is  a PayPal page for Gildas Lormo, who's the head of the project. And yeah, I have, I've PayPaled him  a pile of money, excuse me, for within a freelance journalist, journalist to scale a pile of money.  I could have had a lot of, I could have protein for a couple of days based on what I've given him.  But yeah, it is, I'm so happy with this. It is like, oh, there's no need to look any further  than beyond this for me, because anything that requires, I need to save something off the web.  It's there for me and I can adapt it and use it exactly how I want it. Great stuff.

Start time: 8038.56
End time: 8061.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's very cool. Yeah. I actually downloaded the last extension you mentioned that would save it as  markup files, which is kind of a web clipper. Can you open, I guess it's an HTML file, so you  could open it in anything that can understand HTML. And it looks like you can also take the  subsidiary images and turn them into a single file. Again, it does, it does that automatically.

Start time: 8061.72
End time: 8149.56
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  When you install it, you click it and there's a little box that simply appears in the lower  corner, give you the progress. It has to do some crunching because again, every single image on  there gets converted to base 64. You can, I've just, you can open the HTML file in BB edit and  look at the entire thing. It is just plain HTML and plain text file. So again, you don't have to  worry about, oh, is this a bundle? Is it, or is there a folder of images and other code that I  need to include in this in order to save this? It's no click one button. You've got one file that  even like we have to find a browser that I use in my daily life, mobile desktop tablet.  So it works on Safari and iOS? No. Yeah. It's an HTML file. Oh,  I can. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. I've got them. I've got them. I've got my  workflow set up so that it saves to a folder on my Mac book that will be synced to Google drive.  And so I can simply open these up in Google drive. I can share them to any of the PD,  any of the library file, any of the library or reader apps I've got on my iPad that will convert  a web address or HTML file to PDF or whatever. Again, I've yet to see unlike the, when I was  saving it directly under Chrome or saving it directly under Safari as save a complete web page  there, I've yet to come across any application or any service or whatever that couldn't simply  take this HTML file and do what I want to do with it, whether it's read it, save it,  cut, copy, place of it, include it into an archive. So yeah, I've yet to find a problem with this at  all. And again, it's just something on GitHub. Just go get it and it's yours. Single file on

Transcript:  It will. I don't, you know, like if I took a moment to look at it.  You wouldn't want it to, because that would be ridiculous.  Yeah. But it's amazing all the different features that it has. Again, when I came across a feature  that anytime you book, anytime I book something, mark something into, I've got for every week,  I've got a folder of here's things I actively want to track because these are stories I might  want to write or talk about. Now that I don't have to think about it, if it's that easy and if these  HTML files are so small and they are, it's like, well, why aren't I just simply saving every file  that I think is important enough to save in this one special place? And so there you go.
