Transcript:  Well, there are those whose Jeff Jarvis is just on an airplane flying out.  He's doing an event tonight at by the way, last chance if you want to go to the Commonwealth Club and see Jeff Jarvis talk about the history of printing in the Internet.  Commonwealth Club tonight.  And he's talking about printing and the Internet or or well, his new book, The Gutenberg Parenthesis is the premise of which is we've seen it all before.  Right. And and so what we have to learn from the advent of the printing press in today's Internet age.  Let me just see what the name of his title of his lecture is the age of print and the Internet.  What is Jeff based? He's he's in New Jersey. Just outside.  OK, that's what I thought. Bedminster. He's out here.  Well, that's the reason it came up in my mind is because he wore a mask.  He says that was the only one on the plane on the man with a mask on.  But you can be sure Jeff will be healthy as he speaks.  It says tomorrow at 1 a.m. at the Commonwealth Club. I think it's just confused.  I do believe that's a 7 p.m. appearance.  But if you go to the Commonwealth's website, it's today.  Yes, it is definitely today. The beautiful Commonwealth Club.  Thank you, Google, for saying it's at 1 a.m. Jeff will be happy, happy to do a second speech.  6 p.m. 6 p.m. OK.  Yeah, Lisa's going. There it is.  Thank you for getting that.  So I did find some news.  I looked hard.  First of all, we should say there are updates going out.  IOS 16.6 came out yesterday.  Ventura 13.5.  These are updates to patch.  Apple says actively exploited vulnerabilities.  So these are not things to wait upon.  Also, if you're on an older version of iOS 1578, iPadOS 15708, moderate 1268, Big Sur 1179 for older devices,  basically check your system updates.  This is this is feels like the third fix.  Didn't we have how many rapid security responses do we have for this WebKit vulnerability?  There was, you know, several of them, I think.  But now this is a full version, which will affect Apple's security support website lists a large,  large number of security things that are being patched today or yesterday.

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  What do you think the protocol is inside Apple to decide whether or not something merits one of these push outs?  Because I know I myself like I'm getting a little bit confused because I'll I saw the last one.  I thought, did I forget to install the one that came last week or is this a new one?

Start time: 522.34
End time: 543.73
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there was a this month there's been security response a there was B, but they pulled that back and C.  And then that came out July 12th.  And now here we are on the 25th, 24th, 12 days later.  And they're doing the big updates, which apparently include some of those fixes, too.  So I don't I'm not sure.  Jason, do you have any insight?

Start time: 545.22
End time: 566.90
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't.  I'm with Andy.  I tried to I tried to get the words out and no is about the best.  There are lots of them.  Don't forget.  Am I on a beta?  What's on the beta?  Oh, yeah.  Is the beta getting these?  No, it isn't.  Is it like there's a lot going on?  I think the answer is Apple tells you to install something.  You should install it and just go ahead and install.

Start time: 567.06
End time: 581.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this is the alert that there is something for many of us and you should check.  Yeah.  It doesn't you know, I have to say it does not happen automatically right away.  Eventually, I think they'll they'll force you to do it right.  I've never gotten to that point.  I always see a little reminder.

Start time: 582.30
End time: 596.48
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  They'll never force you to do it, but they send you, you know, they'll alert you that there's an update.  And what they want you to do is put in your password and update it overnight, which then doesn't work.  And it yells at you again the next day to put in your password and update it overnight, which, et cetera, et cetera.

Start time: 597.24
End time: 637.80
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Have you guys experienced this thing where like you defer it, you defer it, you defer it, and then like your Mac just starts acting real screwy as if it did a partial install waiting for you to pull the rip cord on the full install and it broke something?  That's happened to me many, many times where I can't afford to do a restart that's that's required.  So I'm putting it off, putting off, putting off saying, OK, do it tonight.  No, do it tomorrow. No, do it tomorrow.  And then at some point, I'll get a massive problem that will kind of force me to do it.  I'm not I'm not saying that that's part of Apple's update strategy, which is to basically make sure that, hey, he can't use the uppercase E or punctuation until he actually restarts.  That's more of a Microsoft deal.

Start time: 638.83
End time: 665.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Frankly, true.  It only half works.  I don't know. I've never experienced that.  Anybody else?  But see, I'm pretty aggressive about just going, oh, there's an update.  You know, that's why, you know, as you can tell, here we are day after the updates came out and I'm telling everybody update.  So, yeah, and I think that's reasonable when there's there's a zero day when there's something actively being exploited.  That's probably a good time.  Although, as you pointed out before, Andy, we're not the target for these zero days.

Start time: 667.68
End time: 695.94
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's it's yeah, I mean, it's it's usually when the zero day hits, it's because it's a very specific set of circumstances for a very specific set of targeted users.  And if they've seen it in the wild, it's not that they've seen everybody be taken down because we would have learned that through through CNN, not through software update.  Right. But still, as a as a matter of principle, it's these little things that will get you in the boat if you keep if you keep sitting on them.

Start time: 696.44
End time: 735.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And it gets back to, you know, if everybody kind of keeps up with this, it makes it not a target either.  Right.  It's not, you know, it it it it dulls off the effect.  I mean, if you look at the hacking deals, yeah, the the the community.  Yeah, it's it's community immunity.  So, you know, a herd herd immunity because it just doesn't going to it's not going to go anywhere.  And so it's not worth developing for.  You see these huge hacks that are happening.  Generally, these are large, you know, corporate networks that that are very old and no one's updated for a long time.  And so it's not something that you can get from a company that provides it's worth spending the time to figure out how to hack them.

Start time: 736.00
End time: 773.30
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then as a result, they're very expensive.  And, you know, you go to places like Pegasus, you know, the the Israeli company, which is no has a different name, but it's the same company.  And and you buy those for a million dollars because you're a nation state and you really want to get James Bond into your evil lair.  Update Unity, Apple Vision Pro and Apple Apple Vision Pro developer kits have arrived.  I saw James Thompson's post about the Apple Vision Pro developer kit.

Start time: 775.16
End time: 777.62
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Everybody I know who's a developer has filled out that form.

Start time: 778.00
End time: 795.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's free. Right.  You have to be a 90. You have to be a developer, which is what?  Ninety nine bucks. But the kit itself is free.  But you have to return. It needs to be returned upon request.  But that's not all. No, no, there is.  There are quite a quite a few security and secrecy arrangements.

Start time: 796.32
End time: 830.98
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  You must you must keep it. It must only be kept in the place where we ship it.  You must keep it in a place that is not a transparent cube that people can look into.  It must be lockable. If you're going to leave it for more than 10 days, you need to contact Apple and say, do you have any tips for me to keep this thing in its locked Pelican case, which is what you're going to be provided.  You do not show it to your friends or family. And most importantly, do not taunt.  Happy fun ball. Those are the rules. I don't make the rules. I just report them.  Basically, they're serious. They don't want this thing getting out.  And and oh, and the other one is on request, you will return it to Apple immediately.  Yes. Part of the deal, too. Yeah.

Start time: 831.52

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You agree that all access to usage of and storage use of the D.K.  development will be a private secure workspace accessible only by you and your authorized developers unaccountably capitalized.  What is that some sort of is that a lawyer thing? You and your authorized developers, e.g.  fully enclosed with solid doors, floors, walls and ceiling and locks that can be engaged when the D.K.  is in use, nobody walking in on you.  You must ensure that unauthorized persons, including any family, friends, roommates or household employees, no evil maids allowed.  Do not access, view, handle or use the D.K.  And definitely don't let Leo Laporte see it when in use.

Start time: 894.40
End time: 897.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see a D.K. You must control.

Start time: 897.52
End time: 946.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You must ensure the D.K. is passcode protected.  Never leave the D.K. unattended when not in use.  Turn off the D.K. and store it in its locked Pelican case.  That's isn't that spelled with a K. Maybe I'm wrong.  In a locked space that only you, capital Y, have access to, e.g. a locked room or closet, a safe or a locked drawer,  the D.K. may not be moved from or taken away from a chip to address by you or your authorized developers without Apple's prior written consent.  If you will be away from your workspace for more than 10 days, consult with your Apple point of contact about how to keep the D.K. safe while you are away.  You must agree to restrict access to the D.K. to you and your authorized developers and take all reasonable precautions to safeguard the D.K. from loss or theft.  But that's normal, right? If you got an iPhone 15, you'd be signing that too.

Start time: 948.00
End time: 957.98
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Pretty much. Sure. Also, we don't know. It could be Donkey Kong. We don't know.  D.K. could be Donkey Kong. Yeah. That'd be quite a surprise, right? You gotta keep that a secret.

Start time: 958.40

End time: 970.78
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, it could be a test. They send you Donkey Kong first and then you tweet out, I filled out all those forms and all I got was a Donkey Kong game and then the Donald sent him the headset.

Transcript:  Why did you make me dodge flaming barrels for like 10 minutes? We just want to make sure you were very, very serious about wanting to develop VR apps.

Start time: 980.28
End time: 994.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly. And then, of course, you had, I saw Matthew Casanelli say, do shortcut developers count? Are they developers? You have to be a developer, right?

Start time: 995.34
End time: 1041.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. And how many of them, I mean, like even somebody like David Smith or James Thompson is an indie developer who's just a single developer. Are they, how many of these do they have, right?  Do you really need to be at a very high kind of like level of revenue in order to get this?  Then again, I mean, this is, I know we're going to talk about in a little bit Mark Gurman's story about, you know, what's the developer market for Vision Pro apps and who's going to be interested in developing for it.  But the fact is Apple does benefit from people like any developers like James and David Smith to do showcase apps, even if they are just these indie apps, they make the platform cooler.  So I just, I'm going to be, it'll be interesting. Can they even admit that they have it? It'll be interesting to find out in the end when they write their memoirs, who actually got one.

Start time: 1042.00
End time: 1052.92
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, and also I, you know, this is why some developers are pretty careful about what they say in public, because of course this is all subjective as well. Like I don't think that sending a bunch of headsets, a headset is probably not going to epic.

Start time: 1053.18
End time: 1084.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It's amazing that James Thompson gets any promotion from Apple at all, given that he talks about this stuff and complains and gets rejected and stuff like that.  But he does, he also does good work and and embraces Apple's new technologies. And that's, that's part of the secret sauce with any any of those indie developers.  You may say, oh, indie developers are small and they don't matter, but they do, they bring a cache to the platform that Apple really likes. So they're definitely a part of the, of the gestalt of any new platform.

Start time: 1087.00
End time: 1092.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're just kind of as a side thing. Unity has also shipped its beta version of its development tools.

Start time: 1094.18
End time: 1138.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Super smart by Unity. I think that they, so that development, I believe that they've built, they put out a sample, you know, a sample app that you can kind of tear apart as a developer.  And Unity should be doubling down on this. This is their moment, you know, to take advantage of this. And so I, you know, if they're smart, there's going to be tons of education.  There's going to be tons of of outreach. There's going to be tons of example files. They're going to build all these things out because, you know, Apple right now, I think, is kind of filling a gap with Unity.  And the key is to take advantage of that gap and really make sure that a lot of developers are considering their platform to use it because you can't do everything you need to do in the core Apple development tools just yet.  And so I think that that's it. It really behooves Unity to jump on this. We'll see how hard they push.

Start time: 1139.00
End time: 1155.47
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like they've been working on this for years, right? Like, but they're out there now and they're the one. If you want to make these kind of kind of apps for Vision Pro, Unity is the way you're going to do it.  Well, you can build. I mean, there's definitely apps that you can build using, you know, the tools and the and Reality Composer Pro.

Start time: 1158.34
End time: 1165.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And, you know, there's definitely things you can build out there. But as soon as you start getting into real games or really exactly your own percent, this class of app, right? Because this is the one that's there.

Start time: 1167.02
End time: 1174.66
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And the other one is in a series of lawsuits with Apple and is not going to be there. Yeah, my guess is they've been working with Apple on this for since about six months after that lawsuit.

Start time: 1175.00
End time: 1190.06
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, because because because Unreal was in all those all those meetings before that. I mean, Unreal was in all the before before they did the lawsuit.  Unity announced at the at WWDC. Apple announced Poly Spatial, which is Unity's new technology and Vision OS kit.

Start time: 1197.81
End time: 1250.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's the get started with spatial creation. Your apps will get access to benefits such as pass through and dynamic foveated rendering in addition to popular Unity features like AR Foundation and AR Interaction Toolkit by combining Unity's authoring and simulation capabilities with the  Reality kit, which is Apple's technologies, managed app rendering content created with Unity will look and feel at home.  So it sounds like your existing content created with Unity will look and feel at home on the Vision Pro. Yes, that's part of the pitch is it's a port. It's for porting as well. Right.  And yeah, but in fact, these are the choices. What are your goals during the beta? Create a new fully immersive gamer app.  Create a new immersive gamer app. Port an existing immersive gamer app. Port a mobile gamer app to be immersive on this platform. So that's that's obviously part of it.  You know, I think that Apple will probably mix the marketing as they move forward with when they start rolling out the headset of between big companies that are porting an iPad app or porting something over.

Start time: 1252.06
End time: 1269.94
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But a lot of the focus is going to be on stuff that's really built for the headset. You know, so I think that's going to be a big part of the focus.  So I think that the focus is going to be on stuff that's really built for the headset. You know, so I think that porting over if you're if you're doing something really important, you might be able to get away with it.  But if you're not, you probably want to build something for it.

Start time: 1271.30
End time: 1275.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So as you said, Jason, we should probably mention Mark Bloomberg.

Start time: 1277.04
End time: 1283.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might as well be Mark Bloomberg. I call him that too. Mark Germans. Reporting once again on Tim Apple.

Start time: 1286.14
End time: 1342.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  His power on newsletter title Apple's headset hinges on apps, but don't expect developers to flock to it.  His contention is what that a it's an expensive device. B Apple's already said we're not or as implied we're not going to be able to make a million of them.  In fact, the supply chain says it may just be in the few hundred thousands.  You know, compared to 130 million iPhone, iPads and and Macs.  So that poses the question says Mr. Tim Bloomberg, will the vision pro app store be a success like the one on the iPhone on the iPad or will it flop like the Apple Watch and TV?  Oh, I forgot there are app stores for the watch and TV. Aren't there?  But I message. Don't forget the eye message stickers.  Don't forget the eye message stickers. Everybody get your vision pro stickers.

End time: 1426.40
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  They'll float in space. Safari plugins too. Yeah. Yeah.  It's hard to say. I mean, I don't I don't think that any developer is going to be wisely deciding that, hey, we're going to divert a whole bunch of our budget and our personnel into developing an app for this platform that, as you said, might only have about 200,000 seats in the entire audience.  And it probably doesn't probably doesn't represent the full spectrum of users that you would normally target an app launch at.  You're talking about a really small wedge of the pie no matter how you slice it.  And I do think that nonetheless, the smaller developers either because they're going to be excited to develop this stuff, be because this is their side hustle.  This is their side gig, believe it or not.  They are considered very, very successful consultants on the side and they do actually maintain one or two very successful apps in the time that they want to use their brain for other things.  I think those people are going to be the people who do the weird stuff that will at least give Apple something interesting to sell off and might make them, I don't know, 10, 20,000 bucks a year.  Maybe it's I just I agree with the idea that I that you're not going to you're not going to see large developers investing huge amounts of money in this platform.  Microsoft is already on board, but they kind of have to be because they want to put they want to put office everywhere.  This is it. Go ahead.

Transcript:  I felt like reading reading the article.  I felt like it came from an analyst, but not from someone who actually feels like an analyst.  Yeah, because because the thing is, is that there are so many opportunities when the when some when a new platform comes out, there's an enormous number of opportunities because you have a bunch of people with no nothing else to put on the device.  You know, and they just spent three thousand dollars or four thousand dollars or five thousand dollars on this device.  They spending another thousand dollars over the next couple months buying apps for it is not probably going to be a big deal to most of the ones that are buying the buying the headset in the first place.  So they're going to be buying because they're going to be excited about it.  They're going to want to show their friends.  They're going to want to figure out what works, what doesn't work for the people who are buying these.  If they're ten dollars, they're going to buy a lot of ten dollar apps.  You know, if they're more than that, I mean, he talks about them becoming more expensive because smaller market that gets away from the just, oh, I'll just buy it to see how it turns out.  That's a couple couple coffees worth of cost.  If it got up, I know for me at twenty dollars, I'd be like, well, we'll see at ten dollars.  I'd probably buy anything that looks remotely interesting, you know, for the for it to just see how it works.  I think people are going to want to explore and a lot of companies.  I mean, a lot of developers in the past have put out things that are OK, but interesting and made a lot of money.  So I think that people will do fat.  They'll do a lot of work to try to have something on the day it starts to ship so that when people download it, they go to the app store and they see, oh, this is a really cool tour of something or other app.  You know, and there will be some of those out there because of all these developer kits that are going out.  So there's going to be 50 or 100 or 200 apps to play with day one.  And I think that a lot of people are going to buy them.

Transcript:  Here's a graph of Apple App Store quarterly apps and games from 2009 to 2022.  And you can see it builds. Of course, it probably builds with the number of units sold as well.  Right. Yeah.  But I think your point, Alex, is well taken that that there is going to be even if it's only two hundred fifty thousand people in the first year with these Vision Pro headsets, there's going to be a if each of them spells a thousand dollars as a quarter of a billion dollars out there.  And here's what German writes specifically.  He says the addressable market for the Vision Pro is one five hundredth that of other Apple devices as potentially a major roadblock to developers investing in the product.  I've spoken to a slew. I don't know what that technically is.  Is that a thousand of high profile developers in the virtual reality space?  And that reason alone, the lack of units has them wary of building an app for the Vision Pro.  They also say this is interesting.  And this this this may be relevant to the lack of a VR controller means that content games on other VR platforms like the MetaQuest won't easily be able to make the jump.  One well known developer told Power On if you're making something for it, either Apple has to pay you to develop it or you're building the app just to create some buzz.  I don't think Apple is going to pay anybody to help.

Transcript:  That's kind of religious there.  But but I do think that there is a I think that the one place you could see Apple you know, paying for is like Apple Arcade.  They haven't talked about games at all, but Apple Arcade hires people to build apps for them all the time.  So having a solid stable of apps coming out, you know, of games coming out is something that they'll probably they will design and they're probably going to look for games that really stretch the envelope of what the what the headset can do.  I do think that there are it's a real opportunity for the folks that do take that chance.  There's a real there's the chance of drinking a lot of people's milkshakes pretty pretty early on by getting by getting in and getting you know, getting ahead of some of these things.

You know, I think that that's you know Metta is I mean, I've developed stuff for the for the quest or not for the quest but Rockulis and hard.  It's hard.  It's unity as well, is it not?  We use unity to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's just it was just it was quirky, you know, and so it was it wasn't as nearly as simple as putting stuff out there that this will be.  So nor that I think it'll be.  So he also says he wouldn't be surprised and I think he's right on this.

Transcript:  It's kind of what you were saying, Alex.  If $20 is the new $1 for most vision pro apps, we can see many of them costing between $50 at $250 especially in the graphic designer productivity categories.  Games may be priced closer to their console equivalents somewhere in the range of $40 to $60.  I'd love to see if he's right on that because I just don't think coming out of the gate.

End time: 1789.92
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That's what's going to happen.  What you're going to do because the thing is, is that at $10 or $15, a lot of people who bought this headset will just knee jerk by the app to see how it works.  And if you start making it higher than that, people are going to start thinking about it.  And I think that that's you know, at the beginning, like I could definitely see more expensive apps coming out, but I have a hard time seeing a much higher price point than that.

Microsoft and Zoom have committed to the platform.  So that would be Teams and Zoom.  But the biggest streamer of all, writes Tim Bloomberg.  No, I'm sorry, Mark Gurman.  Netflix will take a pass.  I'm told the company has no current plans to develop a native app for the Vision Pro.  Not that a native app, as he points out, for Netflix would be anything different than, oh, I'm in a theater now looking at a screen.  You could still run the Netflix app on it and be looking at video, right?  I don't know how this works.  Yeah.  And they don't have a lot of 3D content.  I think that Disney's wanting to be there.

Start time: 1836.18

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Disney's got a lot of movies with 3D content.  I think that Apple's probably going to put all that 3D content in their store as well.  So you can buy or rent.  3D video.  Netflix may just not prioritize it.  And that's fair.  I'm sure you'll be able to watch it on your iPad.  But I just don't.  Yeah, I think it comes down to, do you have a lot of 3D content?  Because I think this thing will actually be a pretty great 3D content viewing device.  And so there is an opportunity there.  But it may just be that Netflix looks at it and goes, eh, not enough for us to do that.  Yeah, I mean, that's the low hanging fruit.  I think that a lot of what we're going to see in the first year that's commercially released is the low hanging fruit.  Like video player.  Great.  Wonderful.

Start time: 1878.10

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  We have that already.  But now we have it on this.  Great.  We'll see a lot of simple apps that probably will occur to most developers.  And one or two of those developers will be out there fast.  And I think that's going to be a great opportunity for us to see that.  And I think that's going to be a great opportunity for us to see that.  I think that a lot of makers of really good and successful and well-known iPad apps will want to be able to say that we've updated this for for vision.  It's not just simply the iPad app.  You're using the new vision version of Omni Outliner or whatever.  But it's just, hey, it's the same interface.  But we've added some charms to make it a little bit easier to use.  This is I think this is one of the most important things that we've done.  I think the first year you're going to see a lot of low hanging fruit.  It's going to take a long time before we see the sort of apps that justify I'm not talking about the expense, but justify the existence of a platform like this to say there's here's an app and here's an experience that could not have been done possibly on any non immersive platform whatsoever.  This is why there was a gaping hole.  There was a gaping hole in the landscape of what we call the  And this fills that exactly.  I don't think we're going to see that the first year.  And that's what I mean when I say that I'm not sure that a lot of developers are going to be putting like a million dollars, half a million dollars, hundred and fifty thousand dollars into developing a brand new productivity app that they can then charge that kind of money for and make a success out of it.  I just don't see it.  What is the fart app for the vision pro?  What is the lowest productivity app that you can get?  Well viewers, I mean, I don't want to fart app.

You know, if they can get the right now, the the the new HBC streaming platform is not really, you know, it's not fully cooked yet.  So how we deliver that is going to be something people are interested in to be able to deliver 3D content to it.  Just basic video viewers is probably see a lot of those, you know, for for that kind of thing.  And but I think that games will be something games and some base educational stuff about how to take something to look at it like a molecule or something like that.  They're going to want to show those kinds of things.  I think the cool thing is that it can respond to I mean, it is really magical the way that when the phone works, it just responds to your space and you don't think about it very much.  I just used it.  I was getting a fan for my house and every fan I ran into an Amazon says, would you like to see this fan in your space?  And I definitely clicked on it, looked at something, looked at it sitting there going, oh, that fan's a lot smaller than I expected.  And then went to another one that fans a lot bigger than I expected.  And I finally figured out which ones I wanted.  But what was amazing was it just it just did what it needed to do and sat down on top of what I needed to figure out.  And I think that there's going to be some interesting opportunities there as far as it just responding to those things.

Transcript:  Yeah, this is the difficulty that I still have with with the Vision Pro.  I understand that it is an upscale version and it's a very Apple version, meaning that we're going to do the best we can.  We're not going to we're not going to make a cheap version of this, especially if we're going for if we only do limited quantities.  We're going to make sure that the two hundred three thousand people who see this see that this is the best we can do in twenty twenty four.  However, I'm still not seeing.  Well, why do you need a thirty five hundred dollar Vision Pro versus it's it's a 3D molecule in front of you.  That's fine. How is that not better than three or four or five of those kids in that classroom with phones or iPads?  And they are physically in a space together and they can turn to each other and make comments on, hey, did you see that?  Hey, look over here at this again, 3D movies.  That's something that we've had for quite a while.  3D shopping. This has been I when I hear that, I'm sure that there's going to be money behind that.  But I keep thinking of every single ad for every single like home computer in like in the early 80s saying, and dad can balance the checkbook while mom looks up the recipes for tonight's.  It's like, OK, you're you're you're you're imagining as a marketing person what you could use this thing for and you're imagining that that's what people are going to use it for.  But that's not going to be what people actually use it for.  This is Apple hasn't pushed. I wish that some company I'm not just throwing out.  I wish some company would say something more than 3D gaming, augmented reality, and it won't be that much better than looking at this on an iPad and it will be affordable for lots and lots of people.  I think I have one of those 80s or 90s computer ads.  It's me, Martin, the kid from next door.

Transcript:  You're getting a Dell, dude.  The what Andy said about the about like what's the what's the killer app?  Why do we want this?  Why do people want this?  Honestly, like not only is Apple's like not Apple doesn't get enough credit.  One of its greatest assets and one that it sometimes takes advantage of and exploits is the fact that it has an enormous.  Developer community and they're familiar with Apple's developer tools and their frameworks and building apps on Apple's platforms.  And it's a huge, huge benefit that Apple has.  And when we remember, we start talking about this, it's the decay, right?  The developer kit and Apple wanting to get developers into this platform and Mark Gurman saying, you know, well, are they going to be there?  But like this is why it's so important for Apple to get those developer kits out there and to get them in the hands of developers that are to Andy's point, not just.  Any random developer, but developers who do interesting things and know Apple's platforms because it's entirely possible that the best reason to get a Vision Pro is going to be an app that Apple hasn't thought of.  But that one of its developers is going to have a you know, they're going to have a little moment and the light bulbs going to go off.  And on day one, they're going to have an app that Apple heavily promotes and says, look at this amazing app that a third party developer wrote.  And, you know, they don't because Apple doesn't know the whole picture here.  And the developers can be a huge resource for for the company if they if they let them be.  And that's why I think that having that developer kit out there is what is super important for the future of that platform potentially.

Transcript:  That was that was the one that those developers, the developers don't always ship lots of units.  I mean, the good news is they can often make a living without that because it's one or two people.  But they often are the trailblazers, right?  Like there's there's a dichotomy in the app store today, too, right?  Which is like Apple makes most of its money on in-app purchases and games, right?  Like, it's not very exciting. It's kind of gruddy at times.  Right. But it's it's where they make their money.  But what they're proud of and sometimes it's like the thing that makes them feel good about their platform is often these things that are coming from the indie developers and the very clever.  And they embrace Apple's technologies with their new OS versions in a way that the moneymakers don't.  And like both of those are important to Apple.  And when you're trying to figure out what a platform is for, they're I think especially important.

Transcript:  Well, and I think that one of the things that the irony, of course, is that when Elements 3D came out, which comes back to science,  it made me think this is what the next the next generation of books are going to be like.  But the irony, of course, is it wasn't built with iBooks.  It was built with raw code because iBooks couldn't do what it was what it was out there to do.  But it was something that you really felt like, oh, this could we could step forward.  One unfortunate thing there was that Apple partnered with Pearson and got a bunch of junk, you know, like that was that was not inspiring at all.  So I do think it's important to find things that get people excited.  You know, I think about, you know, building tours of really interesting places that you can roam around and see things that you probably won't travel to anytime soon.  And I think that that those kinds of things, I think you're going to see.  I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, there's already stereo cameras on the space station.  There are apples putting stereo cameras in their film productions.  I don't think they're shooting the film, the shots with those stereo cameras.  I think what they're doing is shooting behind the scenes with them.  You know, so imagine being able to sit at a certain, you know, go to certain parts and feel like you were there when it was getting shot or MLS, I think is going to be a big piece of that as well.  So I think there's going to be a couple of interesting things that are there.  And I think I think there's going to be a lot of developers and think of things that we're not thinking of right now that are going to be pretty interesting.  Yeah, absolutely.

Transcript:  And just just to quickly tie a bow on it.  This is the sort of stuff that kind of worries me that again, three experiences are going to be wonderful, but you can do that already on much cheaper hardware that that actually exists for everybody.  I'm sure the experience will be much better.  I mean, I'm sure yours is going to be much, much better on Apple's Apple's hardware.  But we're still talking in terms of here is a viewport through which you observe things in 3D.  And so the only thing that was really missing from Apple's presentation was here is something we figured out that no other developer of 3D hardware has figured out yet.  And this is how we've cracked it.  The iPhone had to look we were doing away with all almost all tactile interface, give you a full glass interface that can reconfigure itself.  So that when you don't need that keyboard, it's a huge widescreen iPod.  This is this is and I realize that this isn't a failing of Vision Pro.  This is something that has just simply been deferred until again, developers, cool developers get their hands on it and find the awesome inside it.  But this is this is the part this is the largest thing that concerns me that that Apple and nobody else really has yet to basically say here is something that is you need a very, very specific, very, very involved platform in order to deliver this sort of content.  It could be and these are just problems that haven't been solved yet.  It might be a display problem.  Can you still can you can you develop this sort of hardware so you can work for three or four hours and not want to just simply scratch at your eyes and throw this like a like a bat has landed in your hair and throw it across the room.

Transcript:  So the you know, I think that while it does many of the same things, it's kind of like saying, well, I don't I don't need to buy a sports car because my my car will get there right to the grocery store.  It's the right.  That's a good different.  Yeah, it's a different experience.  You know, and and I and I'm not like again, I'm not a car guy.  I don't have a sports car.  I don't have a car that goes very fast.  I have a car that I hope works every day because I spend all my money on hardware.  I don't spend my money on cars, you know, and so so so to me, probably like I wouldn't spend if I had if I had another, you know, eighty thousand dollars, I would not go out and go, oh, now I'm going to buy a nice car.  I'd be like, I'm going to buy a nice camera, you know, like, you know, like that wouldn't that would be easy for me.  So I think for some people, it's not going to make any difference.  But I do think that when you put it on, I mean, it's hard to say when you when you've if you ever gotten into a really nice car and you drive it, you suddenly realize there's a whole different level of all the things that are made and how they work.  And then you go back to your car and you're like, OK, like, and so it's so I think that that is the level of interactivity.  So the see-through experience where you're actually seeing what's going on, the interactivity with with the scenes around you, it's not just the fact that it can do B.R.  But that it does this A.R. process and the ability to pick up your hands, you know, from everybody that I mean, I think Jason is the only one here that's actually used it.  But it seems like it's a pretty seamless experience when you when you have that on.  That's not what's being produced by the other ones right now.  Like, it's not like that's not the experience that you get with the quest.  It's a it's a pretty immersive experience.  And it's not really like you're not really seeing through it and not really having those experiences.  So I think it's going to be it'll be interesting to see how it you know how it moves forward.

Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by a company I'm actually a customer of and love and have for some time when we wanted to create our own Twitter forums at Twitter community.  I looked at all the different things.  And and actually it was John O'Bacon, who is an expert on communities, written the book on community said, don't even think about it.  Just get discourse.  Discourse is awesome.  The online home for your committee, for our community, for over a decade.  Discourse.  They don't confuse it with this cord.  I often do because we also have a discord.  Discourse is the forums like software.  They've made it their mission to make the Internet a better place for online communities.  They've got all the tools to make your online community home by harnessing the power of discussion.  They've got real time chat.  They've even got AI built in discourse makes it easy to have meaningful conversations, to collaborate with your community anytime, anywhere.  Would you like to create a community?  You really need to go to discourse.org slash twit.  We'll get you one month free on any self-service plan.  In fact, you know, once I started using discourse and I kind of went, oh, yeah, I recognize discourse everywhere.  Everybody uses discourse.  Now I'm using a particular theme.  One of the nice things about discourse is they have a whole bunch of different themes you can use.  But it is just E and I can speak as a moderator.  It's incredibly easy to moderate.  This is where our fans go to comment on our shows.  When we set up discourse, I was blown away by how easy it was.  And of course, I let them manage it.  Discourse is open source.  That was important to me.  Powers more than 20,000 online communities, including twit.community.  Whether you're just starting out or want to take your community to the next level, there's a plan for you.  There's a basic plan, which would be great for families.  It's a private invite only community.  Or just any community, you know, a business group, a nonprofit.  There's a standard plan if you want unlimited members and a public presence.  And then, of course, we have the business plan, which is for active customer support communities.  You can ask anybody who ask ask Jonathan Bulava.  He's a developer advocate at Twitch.  He said, this is great quote, and I agree with it.  Discourse is the most amazing thing we've ever used.  We have never experienced software so reliable ever.  I have run many, many forums in my time, and there has never been one that's easier to use, easier to configure, more powerful, more engaging for your audience to me than discourse.  One of the biggest advantages to creating your own community with discourse is you own your own data.  You always have access to all your conversation history.  Discourse will never sell your data to advertisers.  Discourse, it gives you everything you need in one place for a great discourse.  Make discourse the online home for your community.  Discourse.org slash twit to get one month free and all self-serve plans.  That's discourse.org slash twit.  We are very, very happy discourse customers.  It's a lot less expensive than I than I thought.  It actually costs us less than our massive instance.  But we get such great comments.  But we get such great conversation.  In fact, if you want to try it out, you know, see what it's like to be to use discourse, go right ahead to sign up at twit.community.  And I think it's just fantastic.  Discourse.org slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting Mac Break Weekly.  Woohoo!  All right.  Let's as long as we're talking Mark Bloomberg, let's go to part two of his power on newsletter.  Apple races to enter the generative AI wars.  He's been talking about Apple GPT.  That's what some inside the company call it.  It's a large language model.  They call the framework Ajax.  Mark writes the LLM project is a cross company effort spanning software engineering, machine learning and crowd cloud engineering.  They use it internally for employees and help some prototype future features, summarize text and answer questions based on data it's been trained with.  But he does say also is that Apple has not decided what they're going to do with it in public.  He has some speculation, including Siri, although, you know, neither Google nor Amazon have updated their voice clients with their LLMs.  And I think it's because it would be too chatty and boring and wrong and wrong.  Disturbing. Yeah.  Disturbing.  So, you know, they did hire John G Andrea, who is a former Google expert in this area in AI.  German says he aims to be conservative with the technology, although Tim Cook is pushing.  Oh no, he is pushing for broader regulation.  OK, so yeah, I think Apple's probably smart not to have this in public.  What do you think?

Start time: 3174.38
End time: 3275.92
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  There's there's too much for PR hit when things get wrong, go wrong, and they definitely go wrong.  Meanwhile, internally, these AI tools are really, really useful to a large company like Apple.  And they certainly they certainly are smart enough to know that they security wise, they can't trust chat GPT or any other any any large language model solution that they didn't develop in house themselves.  And thirdly, they have to keep the capital.  They have to keep hold of their really, really smartest AI employees.  They can't just simply if this is where all the action is, if this is where all the really interesting research is happening.  And Apple says, hey, we think it would be really, really great if you could figure out these eyelashes on this picture are not coming out the way that you'd like.  We need a new AI model to get eyelashes better on pictures.  So, yeah, but I want to be able to summarize Prost and rewrite it and analyze large volumes of information and help people assimilate a crushing inbox of mail that they can't really get their hands on.  Those people going to walk to any of the many, many companies that are paying 10 times top dollar for talent like them.  So I would be surprised if they actually had like a chat product.  But I wouldn't be surprised if in the next couple of years, suddenly recommendations get a lot smarter, suddenly online, if the option to to go to Apple support and explicitly be offered the opportunity to talk to a chat bot that might be able to solve your problem.  That's been trained only on Apple support questions and Apple support data.  I think we'll see. I think we'll see.  Like it'll be like the MSG that gets sprinkled all over everything that acts as a flavor enhancer for a lot of different Apple things.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  A lot of that it's already there, right?  I mean, Apple has been the narrative, right?  Is, oh, Apple isn't doing AI.  And the fact is Apple, you know, they built they built the neural engine into their chip.  They have been doing 60 million scans of every photo in your photo library for like seven years now.  Like they have machine learning, AI technology.  The thing is the chat bot thing.  And they didn't have that.  What bothers me about German's report is he says they were they started working on this chat bot last late last year, which reads to me very much like somebody went, hey, do we have a chat bot?  They're really hot right now.  And somebody who ever looked at each other and they're like, no, no, no.  And maybe John G.  And Andrea was like, no, they're stupid.  I told them not to do it.  And then it was like, maybe try, maybe try a little bit.  And so you end up in this situation where that feels really late to the party and makes me wonder, like, one, what are they doing about Siri?  Like, was that not was a language model like you use a language model for autocorrect and iOS 17.  But where's Siri and what is Siri doing?  And then the other troubling thing, the most troubling thing in this entire report is the fact that Mark Gurman says, OK, they don't have a strategy.  They don't have a consumer angle.  They don't have a concrete plan.  But you know what they apparently have is a ship date because they want to ship something next year.  It's like, what?  What are you shipping?  What are you shipping next year at all?  And that's where bad things happen, right?  Where they like they don't really know what the product is.  They just know they need to ship something because peer pressure, I guess.  They don't want to be feel like they've been left behind.  I think Apple being restrained about some of this stuff and saying, you know, the current large language models are really embarrassing and don't really serve the user's purpose yet.  And we're going to wait and we're going to do our typical Apple thing where everybody thinks we're late.  But it turns out we're just waiting for the right moment.  Like, OK.  But when I hear that they don't have a plan, but they have a ship date, scary because like that's not that's how disasters happen in this industry is is you ship something because you have to and not because you have an idea.

Transcript:  If you're sitting on this technology, you know, you've got it that people inside, I think, quite rightly, including experts like John Jan Dreyna, Drea say, no, no, no, guys.  This is not something we ever want to put our name on.  But there's got to be a lot of pressure.  Well, but Google's doing it.  Facebook's doing an Apple and Microsoft's doing it.  We're missing the bus, you know, you don't want to miss the bus, even if the bus is headed to hell.

Transcript:  And the danger is, is he being a naysayer or is he being really smart?  And I think the danger is that it's possible that he's absolutely right.  Assuming John Jan Andres is the guy who's saying no, if it's possible, he's exactly right.  It's also possible that he just looks down on that technology and says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, we don't like that.  We could do risk missing something important, which brings us back to Siri, which is like, OK, Apple, maybe this isn't the right thing, except everybody's looking over at Siri saying it seems like maybe Siri could be better.  And it isn't. So what you're going to do?  And I get the have being enough of an adult to say we're not ready.  So let's not talk about it. And that's a very Apple thing to do.  But but it does. When they when the chatbot came up late last year, I wonder, or were they just saying we're just not going to bother with that?  And are they going to regret that?  It is likely it is. It is like this.

Transcript:  Go ahead, Alex. I was going to say, you know, an apple missed the boat on subscriptions for a very long time.  Like they just were like, they're going to keep on having us buy music.  And, you know, the good news for them is they don't have a controlling interest in that market because of that, because they had switched over very quick, you know, 10 years earlier than they did.  They probably would have 80 percent of the market, you know, that's out there.  And so your lobbying for them to release something.  No, I don't think that they should rush at it.  I think a lot. But I think that there's something I mean, I use chat to be to every day.  So I'm kind of. Yeah. And mid journey. You're a big fan of these.  Yeah, I use both of them extensively.  And and so I feel like it's kind of hard for me to imagine how I did do what I do before I had those two things.  And, you know, like I use them so much every day that I'm that it's hard for me to, you know, because I'm constantly going back and forth.  Like if I'm trying to figure something out, I'll ask chat, GPT that question.  And then I then I start Googling.  But what it does is it gets me through that conversation like I can't think of the words to use to search for what I'm looking for or even how to think about it.  So I just ask chat GPT like I'm asking some person like and I'll say you are this and I am this.  Explain this to me, you know, and then it just goes and I go, oh, I got it.  And then I start searching and then I cross check it.  And I often find that, again, the Internet's not much more accurate than chat GPT because that's what it's based on.  So you have to kind of read and recalibrate between each page to figure out what's actually accurate.  But it gives you a good sense of it.

Start time: 3607.22

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  But Apple could be missing the boat as this is just like just like VR.  This this is still an infancy.  So most of this most of the moves made are stepping on rakes.  It's not there's a lot of stumbling features slowly.  I think that a lot of the industry and a lot of the users are starting to realize that although just asking a generalized chat bot that's been trained on all the racism of the Internet and all the idiocy of the Internet is not quite so useful.  Once you have a tool that says I'm going to ask you a question, I only want you to answer it based on information you get from this trusted source or these three trusted sources.  Or here is the corpus of all of the technical documentation that we have written in this company over the past 11 years only give me answers and text that's based on this source and this trusted source only.  That is a real power move.  Just just the ability to say learn my inbox, learn nothing but my inbox and then answer.  Let me ask you questions based on it.  So I don't think I don't think they necessarily have to.  I also think that Apple's in a little bit of difficulty because philosophically they're going to want to do that all on device for privacy and security reasons.  And that's kind of a challenge.  You really have to be selective in the features that you're going to be creating if you're only going to be doing it locally on a computer, let alone a phone.  But it's again, people that people don't know the MSG is in there.  But once you give them a choice of two different dishes, one of them has a flavor enhancer.  The other one does not.  They're going to lean towards the one with the flavor enhancer.

Transcript:  And the hard part is that I guess I would say that the mid journey in Photoshop or the Photoshop beta are a good example of a limited library versus an unlimited library.  We'll see where all the lawsuits go.  But like the Photoshop fill, you know, paint in and what it'll create and everything else is really cool.  And it's really fun to use.  And it's one tenth the quality of mid journey.  You know, like it's, you know, it's not it's not anywhere near what mid journey is doing.  And so but it's limited to what Adobe owns or what it's licensed.  And so I think that that's always the problem with limiting the library that it's based on is that you're limiting the output.  And so I think that that's going to be the challenge for Apple is they definitely don't want to just give you this unlimited thing.  But is it really going to work?  But, you know, and I think that they could through licensing through a lot of things if it just went through all the encyclopedias and all of the things that Apple could pay can afford to pay for.  To Andy's point, Apple could build the all trusted sources and then I'm asking questions.  But I do you know, I do it now with my phone.  You know, I'm on chat, you bet on my phone and I'll ask it things.  And while I'm somewhere and I do want to just be able to say, hey, you know, whatever, you know, what is this or what am I looking at or what is that?  You know, like if I pointed a plant, what is that and where does it grow and what does it do and have it just answer the questions would be really powerful.  You know, like you'll learn a lot faster.

And I would have given anything for at that point to simply ask the smart speaker in my kitchen, you know, hey, come on, hey, hey, hey, hey, slow mo.  Like if I if I'm using paprika, should I add it at the beginning of a 30 minute simmer or just or spice it at the end?  And for it to find that information and get it back to me, that would be quite wonderful.  I would just like to ask where the hell my paprika is.

Transcript:  This is an interesting challenge for Apple because the Apple Playbook, of course, as it was with the iPod, the iPhone, everything they've done, even the Vision Pro is to let the market simmer with early products until it becomes clear what directions to take and where Apple can add value and then release a product  later in the lifecycle.  The problem with AI, though, is not any one thing.  I really like your idea of taking, you know, Encyclopedia Britannica and the World Book and a bunch of vetted quality sources just ingesting them.  Apple could make the next Wikipedia, couldn't it?  But reliable, right?  And not prone to the, you know, the political fights and so forth that Wikipedia is prone to.  That could be very interesting.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Apple doesn't need to create a fact source of its own, right?  Like Apple needs to pay for some sources and use those as data sources.  And I think that is the future for Wikipedia, actually.  I think it's the future for other other data sources like encyclopedias and news organizations, right?  You pay the AP or Reuters or whoever for access not to republish.  I mean, they do some of that with Apple News, but to use it as their corpus of current events for their search engine and even link out and say, if you want to read more, go here.  And that's a pretty good model, right?  As a trust database for for this kind of search.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's why I wouldn't be shocked if if they did release this as a consumer facing thing.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was something like like Siri, where it's not focused on safety, aren't they?  Yeah, no, no, no. I meant in the sense that it is a sticker that they put on a whole bunch of different things and they indicate, hey, this is of active voice agent.  So they basically say, hey, now, now, now Apple Mail is now enhanced with Schmengel brain.  I don't know. Whatever. And now, hey, and if and now when you have your if you if you're having if you have an outline for your presentation,  but you don't have like you need a slide deck immediately, hey, Schmengel brain, go to the Schmengel brain feature inside your keynote and it will create a slide deck based on this outline.

It's not confabulating like an invented album that didn't ever exist.  It's going to the source. It knows how to search that.  It knows how to summarize that like that's that's the dream.  And I hope they are working on that at Apple.  And it may just be that, you know, what they've said is like chatbot is the wrong way to think about.  Yes, LLM chatbot is not the right way to think about that.  It's a toy. And yeah, yeah, exactly.  But I also understand why they would be feeling the pressure to announce something because, you know, they they they don't want to feel like they're behind.  But it's also not.

It's so funny because Apple can't win on the one hand.  Apple is constantly beat up for privacy.  On the other hand, now the EU is investigating ATT application.  What is it?  Application transparency.

The French antitrust watchdog, which is Le Chien qui Voie issues the statement of objection over Apple app tracking yesterday.  Or actually, this was today.  Citing concerns.  Apple could have breached regulations linked to the use of iPhone user data for advertising purposes.  Wait a minute.  What?  This is the switch you flip that says they can't track you.  The watchdog is concerned that Apple quote might abuse his dominant position by implementing discriminatory, non objective and non transparent conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes.

It'll probably cause some sort of a problem.  I do support the principle of it.  I do support the idea of it.  But in practice over the past few years, we've seen that the balance of holding large companies to account for violating user privacy is happening at a slightly smaller pace than a lot of companies that are doing their best being really, really harassed and almost put out a business by the impossibility of complying with certain terms of this thing.

That's a good thing. I hope I hope that that's what happens.  I don't hope that Apple keeps having to write a billion dollar checks.  I don't think they're going to write a billion dollar check here.  But just as that kind of pressure is the reason why a lot of the a lot of the developers who aren't making actually 85% developers as Apple says, don't pay any fees whatsoever because they're not making enough money to actually start being charged.  The tariffs, so to speak.  And that didn't happen on its own.  That had happened because of pressure from outside.

They get said another element that is critical is that even if the fee was zero, they would still have the same app store because Apple could not sell.  Apple could not sell a single device without valuable apps such as Tinder, Spotify, Netflix, news apps, game apps and the like.  I was like, like, Fortnite, like we like users were just kind of like, oh, Fortnite's not here anymore.  OK, like I just think it was like the thought that people aren't going to buy their iPhones because of those apps specifically.  I was kind of like, well, I think most that most most Apple users would just move on.  Like they just be like, oh, I guess it's not here anymore.  So you have to take them all out to make that possible.  But Fortnite, I thought, was an amazingly illustrative thing of the leverage that an individual app have has because it was like I had a whole bunch of friends that were playing Fortnite and then they just weren't.  Then they stopped.  They were like, oh, it's gone now. So I'm going to do something else.  It wasn't like I'm now going to go to an Android.  That wasn't one of the that wasn't one of the options.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  They want to look tough.  Let's let's I mean, yes, you want to first off, they bring the most egregious examples to the table.  So they say this is about saving the kids and it's about stopping terrorism.  But like it's also about providing the government with access to whatever they want to see.  And that's where it always goes, because that's ultimately what governments want.  At the same time, the politicians who make the laws that let the government operate don't want to be the ones who make their constituents angry because they broke their phone and they broke their messaging app and all of those things.  So it feels like the most likely scenario here is that there will be there's already carved outs in there for like Zoom.  And my favorite is for government people, the government doesn't the government stuff can still be encrypted.  If you work at the government, that stuff still be encrypted.  It's fine. It's the people, regular people who who don't get encrypted.  So there'll be carve outs.  I would imagine they don't want Apple and WhatsApp and anybody else to like storm out of the UK and like and stay out.  Right. Like they're going to more likely they'll have like a little like, you know, oh, they agreed to this minor thing that doesn't break anything.  And that's how we got them to stay, because it would be quite a scene.  And it would be interesting to see it if it happened.  But like that not only would that make the UK politicians, I think, maybe look bad and be a little afraid.  But like they also have to realize that Apple and WhatsApp and the rest of these guys aren't going to say yes, because they know the moment they say yes, like, OK, in the UK will do that.  Well, the jig is up everywhere else, like literally everywhere else will pass similar laws at that point.  So they're not going to say yes, they're going to say no.  So if you're a UK politician, do you want them to storm out of your country?  Probably not. Yeah. So we'll see.  But it's it's real interesting because they're right on the verge here.

And you just this is why a lot of times when politicians say they want to make a law about something, you go, well, like, are you really are you do you know, they're just you know, these are technological innovations.  These are technological infants, you know, that are that are that are trying to make laws about things that they just don't know anything about.  And they're being told that they're being given a pile of things to think about from the intelligence community.  So the intelligence community is pushing this and they're talking to people who barely know how to use email about why why it's important that they have access to this data.  And so they're like, OK, you know, like, you know, like, oh, it seems like seems reasonable to me.  And it's just, you know, and we see this in all the countries, especially the five eyes.  Those are the five the five countries that you see most the most action outside of Russia and China, which kind of have their own little world is the is the Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States and UK.

Transcript:  The Apple says one, we're not going to make changes to security features specifically for one country that would weaken the product for all users to some changes require issuing a software update.  So we can't even do it secretly.  Three, these proposals constitute a serious and direct threat to data security and information privacy that would affect people outside the UK, to which the Home Office said, well, well, you know, well, well, well, well, we keep all legislation under review to ensure it is as strong as it can be.  And this consultation is part of that process.  No decisions have been made yet.  So I think once once people sat up and took notice to the snoopers charter, as it's called in the modifications to the snoopers charter that maybe the Home Office will walk that back.  Oops, didn't mean to offend you, Governor.  Actually, a little threat to Apple in in Apple Pay, a threat to Venmo and its cash app and so forth.  The Federal Reserve Bank has launched its own instant payments service.  It's called FedNow and it's free, although the banks that implement it may end up charging you some money.  FedNow is launching with 41 banks and 15 service providers.  You know, Venmo at least doesn't charge you anything unless you want the money deposited directly into your account because they make a little money holding your cash for you.  Let me hold that for you.  I presume Apple does the same thing.  FedNow is apparently just a US example of a service is widely available everywhere else in the world.  Canada's got it. Something similar.  France has it. Something similar.  Because here in the United States, we have the Federal Clearinghouse that you write a check, you buy a stamp, put it on an envelope, you mail it.  The bank which then passes it on the Federal Clearinghouse where some guy with a green shade and garters goes, well, that looks OK.  All right.  And three days later, the money is deposited in your plumber's account.  That is kind of an old fashioned way of doing things, I guess.  Yeah. And countries like Japan have had this since like the early 70s.

It's not as though this goes live in a week or so that suddenly you'll be able to essentially PayPal your PayPal between any two entities in the entire world without using PayPal and without using any any fees.  It's basically so banks can talk to other banks, including international banks that have something similar.  But it's a long time coming and it's a good base upon which a lot of future services can be created.  I was reading about this last week, and apparently this is part of when crypto started to become a thing a long time ago, the Fed started having conversations about how well should we have a federal cryptocurrency?  Is this digital currency where things are going?  And this was one of the outcomes of those discussions, saying that it's not necessarily that we need a form of digital currency.  We just need to the process of making the numbers in one person's account affect the numbers and other people's accounts simultaneously.  We need to make that easier and simpler and make that into something faster and network that we can create.  Exactly. Just today, just say I paid I paid somebody a fee with the simplest and most technologically advanced method that was available to me.  I picked I picked up my phone, launched my bank account, and I paid somebody a fee.  I picked up my phone, launched my banking app, and told my banking app to please print out a paper check and mail it to this person in this amount.  And it tells me that, OK, this will be mailed out on this date.  We will hold the funds on this date.  I'm glad I no longer have to do the 10 steps of where's the checkbook?  OK, let's write it out.  But the point is they're still mailing a check, even though this is all digital these days.  Whereas the conversation started with you have PayPal Venmo or do you need to check with the system in place?  It would simply be whatever token you need to show to say here is how to put money into my account securely so that I can't steal from you and you can't steal from me.

So I think more people want to do this.  You have to say, though, let me this is this is the Fed joining the 21st century.  Look at this banner that they got designed somewhere that really looks like 1945 Fed.  Now it's a big billboard over a building says Fed now is live.

Transcript:  There's there. I mean, there are a lot of questions about this.  A like like you said, they they've already created their own services.  Do they want to switch users over to a competing service that they don't have their thumb into?  And also things like how much are they going to lose once when I make a transfer from one person during the week that that paper check or electronic to paper check is in transit?  That money is frozen inside my account and they can still use it for banking purposes.  How is it going to affect their bottom line when all those all those transactions happening a million times a day are instantaneous from party to party?  They are no people. People are no longer parking money inside a bank account for as long as they used to.  What's going to happen when if I get the slightest twitch that something's up at my bank or if I just get nervous about the economy, I can take five hundred thousand dollars out of an account and move it instantly as opposed to this is going to take a day or two in order for the bank to actually maneuver it.  There's there's a lot. I'm sure they anticipated a lot of this, but we're going to see a lot of interesting things happening in the next.

And I think that they're making it smaller and trying to have it not change the form factor, but have a bigger screen.  And Apple does a lot of things that are hard.  And so that's part of what makes the phone the phone is that they do they do assembly processes that are very difficult.  I remember hearing a story that the that they you know that they had to basically they lot when they first made the track pads that were that had pushback on them.  But those track pads like 40 percent of them didn't make it like didn't make QC.  Right. You know, and that was like for millions of them as they went out until they got it sorted out.  So oftentimes at the very beginning they because they're doing things that are hard.  I mean, it oftentimes is difficult.  And we've seen these delays before because of that.

So there's the aspect of this, which is just like, look, they would rather not pay Samsung.  Of course they would. But which would they prefer shipping iPhones with Samsung displays or not shipping iPhones?  And the answer is shipping iPhones with Samsung displays.  So it's interesting.

Apple traditionally moves to mass production in August, of course, shipping to customers late September.  So we're in risk ramp mode right now.  And that's where this comes from.

And we'll have to get updates on those.  I've heard it's going to look pretty much the same, right?  Maybe a little more rounded, but not a significant difference.  And then there's rumors that the camera will be even better.

Start time: 5951.66
End time: 6013.55
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Our customers love the phone camera.  The iPhone camera is the most popular phone in the world.  And we're happy to announce we've made it even better.  It's one of the most interesting things to look at for the next couple of years is what they do to the physical form and design of the phone.  Because one of the things they're still working on is they want to put the cameras and all that kind of stuff under display.  And to do that, they're going to have to maintain like square edges.  That's one of the reasons why they want that edge to edge display, because they want to lose all the bezels and just basically make this a total glass surface.  So we might see if we see like a what seems like a trivial redesign to what the case looks like, it could be in advance of a larger redesign that again is adapting for a display technology that they anticipate they're going to be switching to in the iPhone 16 or 17.  And the ability to put the face ID underneath the actual display itself instead of having to have a forehead.  Would there be an iPhone 14 Pro Ultra?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Well, with the phone, it's different because you can put the phone in a really cool looking tough rugged case, and you'll have you'll have ultra, you'll ultra vised your phone very, very nicely.  No one will know.  Yeah.  Yeah. Well, and for us, the ultra watch was a solution that you couldn't get without having this really designing it as an ultra watch from the beginning.  But also it was a way to have a different style watch on a expandable line that was kind of looking kind of boring.  Yeah, I really love it.

Transcript:  What do you think, Jason?  That's a rumor that there'll be a third iPhone Pro model, the Ultra.

Start time: 6064.58
End time: 6123.88
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, good old Mark G. Bloomberg said, I'm not sure it's this year.  He was one of our best mayors.  There's a question of whether you go up to an iPhone Ultra.  What is the year? What is the feature that makes that? Does it really replace the Pro Max and just be kind of like the super big like the Apple Watch?  You could argue that's just a marketing question, what they call the big pro phone.  And so they could do that at any point if they feel like they could.  The rumor is that the largest pro phone is going to have a camera that's like super awesome with a periscope lens and all of that.  And if that's the case and it's really strongly differentiated from the other pro model, calling it ultra instead of Pro Max.  I mean, Pro Max, for those who don't remember before there was Pro Max, Pro Max is a dumb name.  It sounds like a medication for older gentlemen.  And so I would I would go with ultra on your flow.  Max is in the world. The furrows go in there.

Start time: 6124.34
End time: 6132.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you think they drop, you call it Max and call it ultra because don't they have M2?  I mean, they have M2 Pro and M2 Pro Max and M2 Pro Ultra.

Start time: 6133.02
End time: 6148.90
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Those are just chips. But like they don't have them to Pro Max.  They have them to pro and M2 Max and Max is only available on the high end iPhone.  So like if they took that name, that name, name away and just called it ultra like the Apple Watch,  it feels like a better name to me. But the thing is, it needs to be differentiated.

Start time: 6149.24
End time: 6159.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. If the reason they say they have pro and non pro models and then within the pro model,  they have regular and both models. Right.

Start time: 6160.08
End time: 6194.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  We have we have regular and Max in both models. Oh, we do.  OK. Yeah. So, you know, but but iPhone 17 Max, iPhone 17 Pro Max, you could do it, but you could also say,  well, it's ultra this time. It's ultra. It just again, if it was identical specs to the pro,  just a bigger screen, it's not an ultra. Right.  So you really want to make it a big deal.  But if it's got the best, by far the best camera ever on an iPhone before and it's only in that model,  why not call it ultra? Like, go ahead. Yeah.  Because you've got some way to differentiate. Also, they know that Apple consumers,

Start time: 6195.70
End time: 6236.92
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  there's a there's a tier of Apple consumers that will spend whatever they whatever they get to get to get the best  particularly if it's like, hey, I'm I do a lot of photography or I'm a creator and I shoot a lot of video.  I've been happy with what I've got, what I've got on the last year's best model.  But oh, my God, this one takes it into an entire separate tier or even people who just want just like with the watch ultra.  I want a phone that absolutely does not look like the cheap version of the phone from two years ago.  I want the version of the phone that everybody knows cost fifteen hundred dollars and just came out a month or two ago.  And that's not in the Apple market. That's not particularly crass.  There are people who have that kind of money and they want that kind of new styling.

Start time: 6237.56
End time: 6270.51
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So I think the loaded phone is two thousand dollars now.  Like it's like the the whole thing.  The the you know, with the headset coming out, the 3D capability, you know, even with without changing the lens configurations,  you could probably do a 3D version in an ultra.  And that would be for anybody who wants to generate content that they'd want to watch on the headset.  I think that's going to happen either this year or next year.  It might not be until next year, but I think having, you know, arming 70 million phones with the ability to generate 3D content for the headsets is not a bad idea.  Kind of makes sense.

Like there is something about, hey, I have I've this is this is this is part of this is one of the things I put in my pocket or I put my purse every single morning after I shower and get dressed.  Yeah. And when I personal, I mean, yeah.  And when I put it on the desk or the the the table where I'm going out to eat or the bar next to me, this the choice that I made and the fact that I wanted something expensive and flashy looking  versus something that was simple and practical also says something.  So that it really is a personal item.  It's not that's why I want to repeat.  It's not necessarily crass to think that there are people who will want like a titanium button or something that has like an interesting new design that telegraphs that this is something that you need to bring Johnny Ive back as a consultant just to do the voiceover to explain exactly the bevels on the bezels have been ground to a tolerance.

They can easily explain why this car was worth $140,000, even though to me, it's a car that will take you to the train station and back again and you can get some groceries in the backseat.  There are people who want to know here is how the here's how the the engine aspirates here's the displacement.  Here is the overdrive here is here is basically how the suspension was put together.  Here's how it raises and lowers itself depending on the road conditions.  Whereas, I don't care about that.  But for those for these people, they are enough of an enthusiast about this vehicle about cars in general that this is a value added benefit that not a lot of people are going to get.  But those people are going to want to have to going to want to pay for because that's their bread and butter.

Although there are rumors, there are rumors that you may have spent more because you got it bedazzled.  I don't know.  But there are rumors that it will be more that the top of the top prices are going to go up a little bit.  So we'll watch.  I think there's some room there.  I really do.

Transcript:  Let's take a break.  And if you will prepare your picks of the week, our show today brought to you by my email service, Fast Mail.  I love fast mail.  I've been saying this for a long time.  If you care about email, you should not be using free email.  You should not be using email for which you are the product.  You should be using email that you are the customer email with good support, good features, email.  That protects your privacy.  That's fast mail.  I can go on and on about the features of fast mail because I've been a customer for more than a decade.  This has been my main email provider.  Incredible spam protection that's completely configurable.  They use spam on the server side and you can write your own rules if you want to.  They have an incredible system so you can actually have your domains go through fast mail.  So that you know, I have many domains and many of them are actually the DNS is provided by fast mail.  Now you can add or buy a domain through fast mail and it'll set up all the records for you.  Now, what do you get?  Well, the reason I do this is because fast mail works with DKIM and and all of the authentication protocols to make sure your email is going to go everywhere.  It lets you send and receive emails from your own domain.  You can have unlimited email addresses within that domain.  I love that because, you know, I have a variety of domains for different purposes and even within that infinite email addresses.  They also have this new masked email address, which lets you use a private email address every time you sign up for a product or service.  If you're using fast mail with our other sponsor, Bitwarden, for instance, or one password, when it creates a password, it can create a unique email address.  At the same time using fast mail fast mail, of course, works with any email client.  It's true IMAP implemented using the open source Cyrus server.  And by the way, they're very good open source contributors.  They constantly contribute back upstream to the servers.  But it also has an incredible app on the iPhone, on Android or the web app, which has a lot of great features.  For instance, they just added quick settings, which lets you quickly choose a new theme.  You can switch between light and dark mode, change your text size without even leaving the fast mail screen.  I like that because I can get the size just what I want looking at it.  Quick settings also offers options related to the fast mail screen you're viewing like that masked email address.  You could show or hide your reading pain, switch between folders and labels and more.  By the way, Gmail, which is not a true IMAP implementation uses labels.  IMAP uses folders, but fast mail has done it so that you can use either, which is fantastic.  You can auto save contacts whenever I reply to somebody, they automatically get added to my contact list, which then goes back to my filter rules.  Very sophisticated filter rules, one of which is if you're on my contact list, I'm going to downgrade your email.  And if you are in my contact, my address book, if I have conversed with you before, I upgrade your email.  So I see the important emails you can choose to show public images of senders from external services like Google.  You can set default reminders for events, change how invitations are handled.  That's really important if you get a lot of invitations.  In fact, I've moved all my calendar and address book services off of Google onto fast mail.  So fast mail does notes, calendar, contacts and email for me.  It's the best for over 20 years.  Fast mail has been a leader in email privacy.  This is one of the reasons I moved there.  They don't sell advertising.  They don't.  They keep my data private.  They don't sell it to marketers.  The fast mail team believes in working for customers as people to be cared for, not products to be exploited.  No advertising, no advertisers, no marketers.  You pay for free email with your privacy.  I got to tell you at fast mail, your data stays yours with better productivity features, incredible support for as little as three dollars a month.  Fast mail has better spam filters, no ads, incredible support for your data.  It's incredible productivity tools.  Obviously, I can go on and on.  I'm a huge fast mail advocate and I have been for all the years I've been using them.  It's very easy to move to fast mail.  Import your old email server into your in mail box.  And you can also, by the way, continually get mail from an old address, which makes it very easy to switch over.  Fast mail is moving email forward.  They propose new Internet standards and open source innovations that power many other email services.  But don't get stuck with a substandard email provider.  This is the one fast mail.  Reclaim your privacy, boost productivity.  You will actually love your email again.  Fast mail.  Try it now.  30 days free.  Fast mail dot com slash twit.  You know, I've been recommending this for years.  It's just the way to go.  Fast mail dot com slash twit.  If you care about email, don't use the free services.  Use an email that cares about you.  Fast mail dot com slash twit.  We have some I want to just quickly mention some big events coming up in on our club club twit this Thursday.  Rod Pyle, the host of This Week in Space, a show that launched in the club and is now out in public.  We'll be doing a fireside chat with Ant Pruitt, our community manager.  We've got home theater geeks now.  Scott Wilkinson's classic is back.  We're looking at bringing back other shows and introducing other shows all in the club because the club members pay for it at seven bucks a month.  They get ad free versions of all of our shows.  They get these special events.  They get access to the club twit discord.  Ant's going to be doing a live photo critique session August 4th.  We have a photo walk planned at the end of next month, by the way.  I want you to put this in your calendar.  Save the date August 26th, Saturday, 6 p.m.  If you're in the Northern California area, Ant and I and Elisa and a bunch of us are going to go down and take some pictures in Petaluma.  Stacy's Book Club is also coming up in August.  And then in September, very excited about this, a fireside chat.  You may remember Hugh Howey did an interview with Ant.  He's the guy who wrote the Wool book series on which the Silo TV series was based.  Really great books.  He and Daniel Suarez, his friend and buddy, are going to be joining Ant.  And I think I might I might wedge my way into this conversation as well, because I love I love Daniel on September 7th at 2 p.m. Pacific.  Members only event. So these are all we're trying to make the club something you want to be part of.  We got the discord. We have ad free versions of all the shows.  We have special shows that we don't put out anywhere else because the club members support it.  And I think with all of that, you might say, well, how much is that going to cost?  It's seven bucks a month. That's it.  Because we want to make it affordable for everybody.  So if you're not yet a member of Club Twitter and you want to support what we do and keep it going, it really helps.  I know we have ads for the non club members.  That's how we pay for those shows. But I you know, ads are a hit and miss business, to say the least.  We really like the idea of having a consistent revenue from our listeners so that we can make the best possible stuff for you.  Twitter TV slash Club Twitter.  There's seven bucks a month. There's eighty four dollars a year.  There's a family plan and there's corporate memberships as well.  Twitter TV slash Club Twitter.  Thank you for your support in advance.  That's kind of my pick of the week.  But let's find out what Jason Snell has for his pick of the week this week.

Transcript:  I'm going for a blast for the past.  So this is a classic iPhone game, Ridiculous Fishing.  It was a big hit a long time ago.  It's sort of gone by the wayside as they do.  The developer of it basically went out of business.  They shut down the studio.  But Apple Arcade, in part of its attempts to get classic iPhone games back on the platform and up to date,  went to the original people who developed the game and got them to build a new modern version of Ridiculous Fishing for Apple Arcade called Ridiculous Fishing EX.  If you don't remember Ridiculous Fishing, you cast a line, you're a guy in a boat and you try to dodge the fish and get your line as low.  Once it hits a fish, you got to grab all the fish and bring them back up and then it throws them in the air and then you shoot them out of the air with a gun.  It's ludicrous, but it's fun and really well done.  And also just from a game preservation standpoint, the fact that Apple Arcade is going back to some of these old classic iPhone games that are basically haven't been updated because there has been no business model to make sense of it.  And essentially, I think, give money to the developers to update them and bring them back in Apple Arcade, even from a company that basically shut down.  The developers are all still out there like Zach Gage, the great iPhone game developer is one of the people involved in this game.  And they've added some new features. The graphics look better.  There's a weird TikTok like thing which shows people fishing.  There's all sorts of strange stuff in there. But the core of the game is the mechanic that made it such a great game back in the day on the iPhone.  So if you're an Apple Arcade person, this is one of many classic iPhone games that is now back in the store in the arcade section.  So ridiculous fishing. Check it out.

Transcript:  I love those. All right. I'm downloading it right now. Ridiculous fishing from Apple Arcade.  It does what it says on the box. It's ridiculous. It's fishing.  So there are others that do they have a section where they say like, yeah, there's a revived classics section where they brought back like flight control, I think is in there now.  Which is a game that everybody loved, but it also just kind of died on the vine because you do a bunch of OS updates and then it doesn't really work right anymore.  And so they're paying to bring a bunch of that stuff back. Plus, you know, new titles and stuff that is unlocked and doesn't have in-app purchases.  I think Apple Arcade, they did a kind of course correction about a year ago and it's been a really interesting new selection of games that they put in there.  Good. And new old games, old new games, you know.

Transcript:  My pick of the week is time to set event from last week.  Two thousand nine in January. Apple did their very, very last keynote at Mac World Expo in San Francisco.  Yeah, and it was the very last one. And there was some announcements, not a whole lot of really cool stuff.  I refreshed my memory by reading live coverage written on the fly by no less luminaries than Jason Snell and Dan Morin,  in which I learned that they were really, really happy that cut, copy and paste was finally coming to the iPhone.  Yay. Wow.  We were relying on, there was some sort of smaller stuff that made us really happy because there was still a rebuilding year.  But at the very, very end, it was also unique for another sad reason.  This was the first one that was not keynote that wasn't delivered by Steve Jobs just a couple of weeks earlier before this keynote in January of 2009.  He had announced he was taking medical leave from his CEO positions and all of his duties at Apple.  So this was kicked off by Phil Schiller.  Must have been a very, very hard time for everybody on stage and backstage to put this together, knowing that the big guy was not going to be there.  But they did close it off in style because as they often did back then, they had, because of iTunes being a big thing,  they had access to really good talent to close out the keynote by doing a set.  And who did they get in 2009? But Mr. Tony Bennett himself, who did three or four incredible numbers.  I think that he led off with the best is yet to come, I think possibly at Apple's suggestion.  It is one of his classics. And so this is, it was of course live streamed on QuickTime.  So go on to either YouTube or go on to the Internet Archive at Archive.org.  You can find copies of it. Scroll all the way down to about five minutes before the end and you will hear Tony Bennett.  God, all but for the last three years of his life, he was in his prime.  And even when he was not in his prime, he was still nothing less than great as a singer.  You'll understand why people were so excited to go to Macworld Keynotes back then, even without Steve Jobs.  Although Steve Jobs was a very, very big sorely missed part of it.  It was an exciting time, an exciting time to be there. I'm also going to recommend don't just go.  I'm sure that you've heard I left my heart in San Francisco like a thousand times since Mr. Bennett died a few days on Friday.  However, go to Apple Music, go to Spotify, whatever. Get the complete Tony Bennett Bill Evans recordings.  This was when this is the he created his own label and he got to do absolutely whatever he wanted to do.  And he decided Bill Evans, the magnificent jazz jazz pianist, I want to basically do two albums with him and we're just going to sing songs together.  It's just him playing the is just one of the greatest singers of the 20th century singing, being backed up by one of the greatest jazz musicians of the 20th century.  Just on piano. They're simple, they're bare and they're devastating.  OK, I'm serious. Whatever whatever emotion you're having, you'll find tracks there that will intensify it and magnify it.  This isn't this isn't this isn't put on a happy face.  This is you must be you must believe in spring that spring will come just as the flower dies underneath the snow and believes that spring will come and will bloom anew.  It was it's just magnificent from start to finish.  So two recommendations, one free one you're going to have to hand over personal data to a Monopoly to let them know what you're into.  Tony Bennett, I suggest that you buy it because it's going to be Bill Evans is incredible.

I remember he was doing an interview at the radio station and I remember him saying and this was probably right about this time.  He's in his late 80s that he still took music lessons, singing lessons every week.  He says, I'm a guy. Women can sing easily, but we have to we have to work a little harder at it.  I thought this is one of the one of the greats.

Transcript:  Anyway, I ran into this accidentally over the weekend and was just kind of blown away.  There's this I don't know about the magazine, but there is a YouTube channel called Mother Grid.  And if you're into doing what I do, it's really cool.  So Mother Grid magazine, it is a breakdown.  And specifically the video I would watch is they break down the Metallica the Metallica tour that's going on right now and just the tech that it takes to get it done.  So it's not the tour itself. It is the guys in the back talking about they've got a you know, he was like, well, we've got one hundred ninety two audio track audio channels, you know, the one hundred ninety two audio channels for the concert.  And he goes, that may seem like a lot, but you remember there's four drum sets and each one has 30 channels, like 30 mics.  And so you just get the scale at which these things run.  And so I would, you know, it's it's a it will if you do what I do, if you do production, you know, like event production, it's I started going through the channel and I was like, oh, this is it's pretty nifty.  Like there's a lot of a lot of data, some stuff that I would know some stuff like they were using an audio pipeline that I'm not familiar with.  So I was like, now I have to study.  And so it's pretty pretty slick. So I would I would would highly recommend it.  The other thing that I know we just talked about music, but I was going to throw it in there.  I just saw I don't go to concerts much anymore, but I actually went to see a band that I hadn't seen in probably.  20 years and told the wet sprocket.  Oh, my God, there's a name played at Hop Monk.

You know, Glenn is such a great guy, you know, just just the lead singer.  And did they play did he play Mercy Street on your concert?  No. Wow. He has sprinkled it.  He has sprinkled it. You can find one version of it on YouTube.  If you search that he played it, I think in January, he played it.  I saw him play it by himself a couple of years ago and or a year ago.  And anyway, I'm big toad.  What you got to tell us about this before the event, not after the event.  I would have gone. I should have.  I should have. I you know, the it was it was sold out.

And yeah, he's played this, you know, and anyway, they have a great there's a company that's doing like a lot of PR so that Hot Muck has become this like the outdoor theater all summer playing a lot of great stuff.  But anyway, to the West Brocketts, great.  They played when I was 30 years ago when I worked at a radio station, they played outside.  We didn't have any permits. We just built a stage and put some speakers up and they played.  And I remember it got really cold. It was 70 degrees.  It was on June in Pittsburgh, which should be very hot.  It was 70 degrees on Monday and on Tuesday was 40 degrees on 80.  And then it was 70 degrees again on Wednesday.  And of course, they played on Tuesday.  And it was funny. I had I had the opportunity to have lunch with Glenn on on last week.  And I said, you know, the first time we met, I you know, you were playing this radio station.  It got really cold. And he goes, yeah, my mandolin broke.  He remembers it was so cold.  You know, like, you know, like pop, pop, pop off.  You know, it was so cold. And so if you know what I mean.  Yeah. So anyway, so that, yeah, the really, really great band, I would highly recommend, you know, checking them out.  I just forgot how much I love that band until I saw them again.  I mean, I listen to them relatively often, but I just hadn't seen them live and they're just a really great live band.  So if you see them, they're there.  What's the name come from?

Start time: 7838.20
End time: 7923.20
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That's coming up Friday.  It sounds like Toad the Wet Sprocket, actually.  So when you take a lot of gear, so if you're taking a couple hundred thousand dollars a year out of the country,  what you don't want to do is pay for the import duties when you bring it to France or Germany or England or Japan or whatever.  So you have carnets, and these carnets are, you know, you have to fill out these carnets that say,  I'm only bringing this in temporarily.  And it's a process.  And we've used that we obviously, Pixelcore used them extensively.  We used them, we probably worked with Boomerang maybe once a week  because we were moving so much gear in and out of the country all the time.  And so I just thought it'd be fun.  I think that it's important for building.  Every time we brought somebody in, we were like, OK, now we're going to have we're going to do a carnet.  And this is how a carnet works.  And you have to keep all the serial numbers.  And this is what this is.  We send it over.  So a lot of times we, you know, we like we can talk about things in office hours for a very long time.  Friday, we had one where we did a whole hour on gaff tape.  And on Friday, we had a whole hour.  Oh, God, a whole hour?  Not on Friday, but we did.  We did a year ago.  The whole hour on different kinds of gaff tape and how we gaff tape and what do we how we use it and everything else.  On Friday, we just did load in load out.  Like literally is an hour of how we load in and how we load out of venues.  In this case, this is I just feel like for people who haven't done a carnet yet,  this is something that you ever need to know.

Start time: 7924.36
End time: 7931.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I love it that you just put it there.  You don't explain it.  You just put the title is boomerang carnet.  You'll know if you need it.  If you need it.

Transcript:  There's a little slightly more description in the emails that people get.  So we send out emails every day.  That's a good idea.  The emails that you get, you get more description of what it is.  Because I think they I think in the email you get like all these links to all the different web's resources on Boomerang and everything else.  But yeah, but the the it's a really like what happens is is people start doing things with their cameras and then they start getting slightly bigger jobs and they can't figure out how to get all this year.  Right.  So what we did is we would smuggle it in and out.  We put it into regular, you know, like you do all this weird stuff and then you and then someone said, why don't you get a carnet?  And you're like, what's a carnet?  And they're like, oh, it's the way that you get gear in and out of countries.  And you're like, so I'm trying to get past that.  Everyone passed that today on Friday.  So that's what boomerang is.

Transcript:  Speaking of reading things aloud, thank you for reading my page aloud.  If I had to plug something today, I'm going to I realize I never plug this.  Six Colors, Dan Moran and I do a weekly podcast for members of Six Colors that I get more compliments about than any other podcast I do, which I find weird because it's a members only kind of thing.  Anyway, for six dollars a month or 60 bucks a year, you can listen to the Six Colors.  It used to be secret podcasts, but then we realized we should probably tell people that we do it so that they'll pay for it.  Anyway, it is one of many benefits you get by being a member, but we do it every week and it is a very, I think, very good podcast.  We try to keep it loose.  We're just checking in on what happened during the week.  And sometimes there's, you know, I'm doing laundry in the background or my cat is meowing or my dog is barking.  And those all those all go in the podcast, too.  So people should check that out if they would like.  I guess it makes sense.  If it's possible to get more.

So I added a couple higher levels and actually the higher tiers, the podcast, you can listen live and there's a longer version of it that we do an extra segment.  But like it's very hard to say goodbye to the six dollars or 60 a year.  You're given the branding.  You're really stupid.  Stupid number six being so low.
