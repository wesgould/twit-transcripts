Transcript:  the air first. Ray is also kind of an autodidact, a polymath, an expert in many, many things.  And he seems to love the Mac Pro because every time a new Mac Pro comes out, Ray buys one.  Some would say more money than sense. Ray, are you happy with the new M2 Ultra Mac Pro?

Start time: 264.22
End time: 303.76
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  Yes, yes. I'm quite happy with it. I knew what I was getting. I knew why I wasn't getting the studio  and later I'll explain all that. Actually, that's the real question, isn't it? Yeah.  I'm also what's known as an early adopter. I have the last three Mac Pros I ordered on the first day  they were available. And of course, that means I'm called an early adopter. Some people call  me a fool and others call me an unpaid beta tester for Apple. You probably, I'm guessing

End time: 379.68
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  Okay. I got a 128 gig memory and I got it with two terabytes of SSD. And that pretty well,  that's what those are your choices. You get, I'm going to think you didn't. Did you get the 76 core

Start time: 380.26

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  GPU for a thousand dollars more or did you settle for 60 cores? I settled for 60. Yes. Yeah. What  are you, what are you, are you doing color with the, with this thing or what? Oh yes, I'm doing a

End time: 438.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  other. Yeah. So I'm just spec'd it out in the U S you're in Canada, but in the U S that would be  $8,199. It does include a mouse, but it does not include wheels. Did you buy the wheels?  No. Okay. I did not buy the wheels. Okay. So I will not add the $400 wheels.  It is a static Mac Pro. It just sits there. It don't roll nowhere. I have to say the design is  nice. Is this identical to the old Mac Pro case? The case is virtually identical from the outside.

Start time: 438.60
End time: 527.24
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  You can't tell the difference. Okay. From the inside? Ah, from the inside. Let's, well,  let's start. Now I'm doing the transition from the 2019 Mac Pro, which is Intel based  to the 2023, which of course is Apple Silicon based. And so let's first have a peek inside my  2019 Mac Pro. Okay. And starting down at the bottom is the power supply. And then the next thing up is  I had an internal against Alex's advice. I have a 32 terabyte rate array from Promise. And then the  next thing up is I have the, uh, double GP dual GPU card, the Radeon Pro Vega two duo. And then  the next thing up is the afterburner card, which is the pro res decoder. And then, uh, there's a  blank slot shown in this picture, but there was a, uh, black magic 4k deck link extreme 12 G,  uh, video IO card. That's my, uh, that that's my universal video in and out. It'll do SDI,  HDMI component composite, you name it. And, uh, so that is what we started with. I do want to,

Start time: 527.70
End time: 531.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  before you go to the next one, I do remember you had problems with the promise card initially,

Start time: 531.70
End time: 568.06
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  right? In fact, they did the Ray Maxwell fix. I'm very proud of the fact that when the 2019 Mac Pro  came out, there were two system software updates immediately after it was released due to my  discoveries. You broke it first. You found the rake in the tall grass. You stepped on that and  your broken nose saved everybody else's right. And I will say, you know, anyway, it, uh,

Start time: 570.20
End time: 591.70
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  hold on a second, Alex, you wanted to say, I was going to, you know, there were two updates. So that  that rake hit him twice. So anyway, but the, um, but, but, but I think that Ray Ray shows like what  the, the target Mac pro user, you can see that, you know, using up all that card space and putting  those in all that space between the studio and the, and the, and the, and the, and the Mac,

Start time: 591.84
End time: 598.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  let's see the new one, Ray. All right. Just a moment here. So remember, it's a lot more open in

Start time: 598.68
End time: 760.48
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  there. Oh yeah. Now this is, this is the way it came. This is not with my cards in it. Yeah.  All right. Now my plan, my plan was to put the, uh, rate array in here and, uh, to put my, uh,  black magic video card in here. And then there's a third card that I was going to buy. I'll tell  you about that later that I wanted to put in here. But as I looked at this very picture,  before my new 2023 Mac pro arrived, I said, uh, this isn't going to work.  So I discovered my first problem before the thing even ended up on my front porch.  The first problem is if you, if you look at the 2019, it has what are called MPX slots,  which are PCI slots with an additional power connector, uh, to, to the left of in this picture.  Now, by the way, notice how the motherboard of this new Mac pro is practically nothing.  Yeah. That's really remarkable. Everything is in that, in that, uh, system on a chip,  you know, under the little metal thing. So any rate, but when I looked at this picture,  I said, you know what? My 32 terabyte promise Pegasus is not going to work because there's no  place for the power connector. And so I immediately called Apple and promise and said, Hey, and by the  way, if you look at the Apple site, the U S site, you will see that they still offer the 32 terabyte  promise Pegasus. And it says, we'll work in current Mac pro. Not true, not true. Cause it doesn't  have the new Mac pro does not have MPX slots. They're straight PCI. Now they are, what is it  called class four or, you know, the latest, uh, where the, uh, 2019 was class three anyway.  So I called them and I said, is this going to work? And at first they both said, oh yeah,  it's just needs a PCI connector. And I said, come on guys, look at the picture.  And, uh, you know, this isn't going to work. And, uh, no, that's the J two.  This is not the one for, yeah. No, the four four I, okay. Uh, cause I want to see the listing that

Start time: 760.58
End time: 779.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  says it's going to work. Cause that's, you know, yeah, there it is. It's, but this,  this page is jumping all over on me here. Hold on. I'll scroll down to that. Yes. Uh, no, not there.  Yeah. There either. Maybe they took it off on the U S site. There it is right there. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 779.76
End time: 851.52
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  Terabytes. It's sold out. And that's the good news. Slide down to highlights. Whoa. Stop right there  and see current version. Yeah. Yeah. Current generation. No, that's a lie. Won't work.  Now I talked to promise and Apple again in the second time and they said, oh, you know what?  You're right. It won't work. And promise it, but we have good news. You have a bunch of our four  rate arrays, don't you? And I said, yes. And, uh, so by now they know you pretty well. Is  that what you're saying? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Sure. Right. 2019. Yeah. So, so they said, uh,  you realize you can take those eight terabyte hard drives that are in your rate array and you  can move them over to an R four chassis and they'll work just fine. And by the way they did,  the only thing you have to do is you must install the new promise Pegasus, uh, uh,  utility and upgrade firmware and software. Okay. So you had to open, open up the, the, the case

Start time: 851.68
End time: 857.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and take the, uh, the four drives out of there. Is that right? Yes. That, that involved a screwdriver

Start time: 857.52
End time: 862.06
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  and so forth, removing the hard drives, putting them in the holders for the R four chassis.

Start time: 863.06
End time: 867.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they work just fine. Okay. Okay. That's the good news. Do you lose any capability because

Start time: 868.06
End time: 879.68
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  you're doing that? No, they run just, they, they run it. They keep in mind they're, they go back  a while. So they only run at 600 megabytes a second. Okay. Okay. But they still run it.

Start time: 879.84
End time: 891.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's this is your, this is your online slow storage. This is not your high speed. That's  right. The two terabytes are probably pretty darn fast. Yeah. The SSD is 6,000 megabytes per second.

Start time: 891.50
End time: 963.92
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  10 times faster. Okay. But now this brings us to the third card I want to install  in this machine. And that is a card by OWC, which is the eight M two.  And this card fasten your seatbelt. When it works properly, it can go at 26,000 megabytes per second  and you can get it up to 64 terabytes. I think I'm going to get the 16 terabytes.  This is the Excelsior that you're talking about. That's it. Yeah. Wow. That's the card. There's  a problem though. Notice right under the title directions for 2023 Mac studio and Mac pro  compatibility, which is known as whoops. It won't work just yet folks. Oh man. So,  so I'm now waiting for the next system software, Apple. Apple knows about this and promise and  Apple are working together. There's going to be another Ray Maxwell fix. Okay. You got it.  It's me. You know, hello Apple. It's me again. Well, thank God somebody's doing this, right?

Start time: 964.08
End time: 967.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I'm sure there'll be others follow and following in your footsteps, but

Start time: 968.20
End time: 987.26
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  good for you for doing this. So, but can you imagine having that card as your scratch disc  for your video work? Terabytes. Wow. You're going to get the eight. Well, I'm going to get the 16.  Oh, why? Yes. Sure. Why stop? You can go up. Yeah, you can go to 64, but that's $10,000.

Start time: 990.02

Start time: 998.84
End time: 1013.81
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. Okay. So, uh, uh, the OWC is probably using somebody else's, uh, SSDs in here. I would guess,  right? I don't know what they use. Uh, yeah, I have a look there. That's amazing. The problem is

Start time: 1016.56
End time: 1025.34
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  if you use their, uh, soft SSD software and you install this in a, uh, Mac pro right now,

Start time: 1025.54
End time: 1044.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the thing won't boot. That's too bad. So yeah, I'm using it. I have their little, their little, uh,  M two box and have to use soft rate with it. I'm not a fan of soft rate, but I guess it's okay.  Uh, I'm using that on my Mac studio. If you want to, if you want the 26 gigabyte transfer rate,

Start time: 1044.96
End time: 1069.66
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  you have to use theirs. You, by the way, the workaround right now is you can buy this, plug it in  and use, uh, Apple raid, uh, in the, you know, the disc utility and set it up, but you'll only get  13,000. And by the way, you have to set it up on another Mac. You can't set it up on the Mac  pro. And then you have to plug it in after you've set it up and, uh, striped it with, uh,

Start time: 1070.42
End time: 1082.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the Apple raid software. So what do you do with all this storage, right? That's a lot.  How much was the total now? I've, I've lost count. I can't add that high.

Start time: 1083.86
End time: 1100.78
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, if you, if you have cameras that shoot pro res, you do a lot of drone stuff, aren't you?  Yeah, I'm doing some drone and, uh, you know, the thing I shoot with the most now is my, my iPhone

I remember the table. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You could see the interior and you could  see white clouds and it had detail in both the dynamic range. Yeah. But nowadays,

End time: 1193.60
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  the Mac pro. Well, the bottom line is if you need IO slots and IO cards that you want to add to this,  then you want the Mac pro. Otherwise, if you don't need that by all means, get the studios.

Start time: 1193.88

Start time: 1231.72
End time: 1248.66
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's, it's, uh, the 10 and EP is still, still the, um, the big player at the  moment. We've got a lot of us are working at 4k or 8k. Um, the, the 12 K has, I've, I found  has be a little excessive, you know, like it's, I haven't, haven't found a lot of use for the 12 K.

Start time: 1248.88
End time: 1260.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you, that's the thing when you go to 12 K, now you need a Mac pro with 3000 terabytes  of storage and a tech link card and all that stuff. Well, the funny thing is the big limit,

Start time: 1261.02
End time: 1317.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  like with black magic cameras is really, uh, how to get it recorded. You know, so when you record  a, you know, it's getting a, a drive fast enough and just the throughput, just the USB-C on the  12 K on the black magic 12 K isn't fast enough to really get us the, the, the compression rate  that we want at 8 K or 12 K. If I'm doing like 8 K one 20, I'm, I'm still stuck at about 900 megs  a second coming out of that. Um, but it's still 26 gigabytes a second should be fast enough.  Shouldn't it? Well, you can't plug that into the camera. So yeah, so you're, it's, it's getting it  out of the camera is the problem at the moment for most of these things. And then once you get into  it, you're absolutely right. You have, but that drive speed is so important because you're,  especially if you start stacking, you know, you got three, four or five, uh, tracks of data and  then you're starting to apply. And this is where you start, you start applying effects and you start  doing other things, but that drive speed delivering those frames to the CPU is, is a big deal. So that

Start time: 1317.78
End time: 1327.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  speed is, is really key. Ray, you've been doing this, uh, even longer than I have. Is it kind of  still thrilling to you to see how much you can, how much power you could put on your desk, how

Start time: 1327.90
End time: 1358.14
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  much storage, how much speed? Oh, absolutely. And, uh, AI is, you know, I'm just the, the selection  capability in Photoshop and on my iPhone now, you know, the ability to point at something and  select it. I re I used to spend 20 minutes selecting something in a photo and, and, uh,  the horsepower and AI, uh, all of this just blows me away. And the generative fill now

This is a book about AI robots,  a sci-fi book from a good friend of Ray's take down the lower third so we could see his name,  Guy Omega, super earth mother. And you did that in mid journey.

Transcript:  I went to school with him at the university of Missouri. We met in the ham radio club. Oh, wow.  And, uh, uh, we're both our engineers and, uh, uh, he ended up moving to Vancouver, lives here in  Vancouver. And, uh, after he retired, he started writing hard science fiction. Everything in his  science fiction is possible. And, uh, in this book, I want you to imagine that, uh, we're at a time  when things aren't going so well here on earth and there's a moon base and there's a kind of  interesting character who, uh, has built a rocket ship that can travel between the stars.  And he has built an AI, several AIs that are going to care for a library of genetic material  and some, um, uh, incubators, if you will, to incubate this new genetic material. And he will  modify the, the AI will modify the genetic material to suit the exoplanet that is 20,000 years away.  And so they're going to send this ship on a 20,000 year trip. And when it gets there,  it's going to create human beings that are adapted to this new exoplanet. Now,

So Ray, if you, if somebody came to you and said, uh, all right,  I want to buy the most powerful Mac I need, would you, would you approve of a purchase of a Mac Pro  or would you steer him towards the studio? I think you'd probably steer him to the studio. Yeah.

Start time: 1577.44
End time: 1656.24
Speaker: Ray Maxwell
Transcript:  Yeah. It's it. I would steer him towards the studio unless he needs PCI IO, cause that's what  the Mac Pro is all about. If you want PCI IO or you want these super fast SSDs to plug in,  then you're going to need to go to the Mac Pro. And, uh, you know, that, uh, here's the bottom line.  Uh, this, this thing is anywhere from two to seven times faster than the 2019 Mac Pro. Wow.  And, uh, of course you can put much faster storage in it than the 2019 because by the way,  it's only class three. And, uh, so, you know, the, the new 23, 23 Mac Pro, uh, is going to get you  up to 26,000 megabytes per second. Just, just to me. Oh, WC, just amazing. All of this speed  and stuff. I mean, again, going, I mean, I go back to 80, 80 days and 400 K six inch floppy disc.  Yeah. And, you know, this just blows my mind. And again, that's why I'm an early adopter.  It's fun.

Rosetta 2 is remarkable, isn't it?  It's just remarkable. Yeah. I, and of course, most of the major apps, all, all of the big apps  that I'm running, they're all universal and they're all ready. I, the transfer over was quite easy  using the, uh, uh, migration assistant. And, uh, I haven't had, I haven't hit any problems other than,  uh, oh, that one problem I missed telling you about was I did have problems with the black magic  card. Uh, this was really weird. I still don't know how we fixed it. I hate that. I put the black magic  card in and the system software said, yes, I see the card, but the, um, desktop video card or desktop  video software from black magic said, I can't find the card. And so I called up black magic and they  were very helpful and they know me as well. And, uh, anyway, they, uh, they, uh, said, well, go back  a couple of versions and let's try that. And we went through two or three different versions  and then he said, okay, go back to the latest version. We went back to the latest version

There was, you know, a little, it just, you need a little, uh,  had a little hitch and it's getting long and you just need a little nudge to just, uh, just get  going.

Transcript:  time over here for the Mac pro. We'll talk about that. We're going to call you on the carpet after  these words from Zoc doc. You know, that feeling you get when you finally find the thing, you know,  the thing you've been searching for in the internet, you spend hours researching and reading  thousands of reviews and you, you know, you finally find it. This thing, be it, uh, I don't know,  sparkly disco pants. This is the stuff I buy on Instagram late at night. Designer dog hoodies,  whatever it is, you know, just it checks all your boxes. Five stars rise at 48 hours. How is it you  can get perfectly machined aluminum pill boxes in, in just two days, but if you want a good doctor,  it could take forever to get an appointment. Why is that? And how do you even know if they're good?  Where's all the reviews? Well, there is a way it's called Zoc doc, a place to find and book  great doctors who have amazing reviews, many with appointments within 24 hours. Zoc doc is a free  app where you can find amazing doctors and book appointments online. We're talking about booking  appointments with thousands of top rated patient reviewed doctors and specialists. You can even  filter specifically for ones who take your insurance or are located near you. And it's  not just doctors, almost any condition you're searching for dentists and chiropractors. And  I was looking for gerontologists. They got them all with verified reviews from real patients,  actual patients, not bots. The average wait time to see a doctor booked on Zoc doc,  24 to 48 hours. So sure you can get those disco pants tomorrow. You can get a doctor tomorrow too.  That's it. You can even score same day appointments. Once you find the doc you want,  you can book them immediately with just a few app taps. No more waiting awkwardly on hold  with a receptionist. This is simply put the best, easiest, fastest way to find the right doctor  for you. Go to zocdoc.com slash Mac break and download the Zoc doc app for free. I know you  can get it, you know, just go to the app store, but would you do me a favor and go to the website?  Zoc doc.com slash Mac break. That way they know you saw it here.

Uh, Apple put out a big emergency update yesterday  to iOS and Mac OS. I rushed what I read about it. The rapid security update, rapid security  response update. I rushed to my iPad and my iPhone and my Mac to download it and it was gone.  They pulled it. How fast did they pull it? Was it like 10 minutes? It feels like,  I think it was much less than an hour. I think it was very quick. And the reason being what? That it  broke some websites, uh, according to reports, uh, on Mac rumors, forums and on Reddit,  Facebook, Instagram, uh, and WhatsApp, zoom and other websites started giving a warning  about not being supported on Safari. Uh, oops. Yeah. It was a zero day, actually an active zero  day. That's a little concerning, uh, in web kit. Um, but they did apparently change the Safari user  agent to identify it as patched with a parenthesis, a parenthesis and some websites, which were,  I think I honestly, you want to blame the website who are looking specifically at the user agent

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko

Transcript:  Yeah. Um, yeah, but that's also why all the browser info is not real because everybody  loves about it because they want to maintain compatibility and it's like, like Mozilla, right?  They're all like Mozilla. Um, and so, I mean, I get it, but it's weird that whatever string  they should have tested, right? Well, let's change the string. Oh, it breaks everything.  We can't change the string. And that's a, that's a mistake. I was going to make a joke here that  their rapid security response obviously means that it's only out there. It's very limited time.  You have very little time. Get it quick. Are you going to, are you going to miss it?  I just missed it. And I felt, I felt at a loss. I mean, you're going to prioritize the zero day  over maybe some last minute testing of things like user strength, you know, agent strings and  your web browser, but whoops. So I guess it's a testament to how urgent they felt it was,

Start time: 2277.58
End time: 2305.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  right? They saw it was active in the wild. They go, oh crap, we got to fix this. And they didn't,  they didn't have time to test it. Uh, the user agent is how the browser identifies itself to  sites, its visits. And you can see, you know, as you said, there's a lot of most browsers lie  and say they're Mozilla just for compatibility reasons. And apparently these websites were  looking, they saw Safari and they saw then parentheses a parenthesis and, oh, oh dear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, which is not the right response either. Um, I guess Apple, Apple's probably doing the right  thing. Cause they, of course they could have just taken the A off and shipped it. And I guess they  decided not to do that. Apple says, uh, they will, it will be a response, which has a parenthesis B  in it will be available soon to address the issue. So, okay. That's way more serious than,

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  than that Moth that's that's that Admiral Grace Hopper put it down. This is that bug baby. Yeah.  At least, but at least now it's, it's easy to like revert for like a rapid security update.  Like in the olden days, like once you updated, Apple was like, why would you ever want to undo  an update? So because the, I mean, the first time something like this happens and you're stuck with  the problem until Apple fixes it, that's when people like by default say, I'm not going to trust  a security update until everybody else is until the end of the month when I don't need to use this  Mac for anything. And that's when it's most critical to actually apply these damn things.

Start time: 2366.42
End time: 2400.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. This is the one you really want and you want to apply right away. Apple has a page,  support page HT two one three eight two seven. If you applied rapid security response iOS  16.5.1 parenthesis a, uh, here's how to roll it back. And it turns out you can just go into settings  and remove it on the Mac. Uh, it's a little bit more complicated. You have to go to about this  Mac than more information under Mac OS, click the info button next to the version number,  click remove and restart, click to confirm much easier on iOS. There's a remove security response

Transcript:  entry in the version settings. I do, I do think that was a negotiated piece inside of Apple  deciding that if we are going to push these things out without an immense amount of testing,  we need to make, I will approve this so long as there's a way to undo it in case the, the  patch creates more problems than it solves. I could really see there being an argument about  saying, Hey, we can't, we, we can't do this without having a real system in place.

Oh my God.  I have not bought anything. Actually there, there is a pretty good deal on Amazon does this once a  year, right? The prime day.

So, yeah, I keep, I keep waffling on upgrading my, my Kindle knowing  that I need something that's has a USB-C and it's a larger screen, but I definitely don't want another  Kindle. And every time I look at like one of the really nice e-readers that Jason recommends,  I'm like, yeah, but for a little bit more, I can just have an, a Mac, an iPad mini, even like a last  generation one. I don't care that it lasts, it doesn't last 30 hours on battery. It's going to  be a really nice e-reader and it can be the thing that I carry when I don't even want to carry my

Is there such a thing as too small to get you in any

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  trouble? I don't, I get in trouble with the smallest things. I believe, I believe, is,  is there anything to read into this price? Is there any reason not to buy it from Amazon?  I don't, I really, I don't think so. No Apple and Amazon now have a deal that actually

Start time: 2533.40
End time: 2570.99
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  involves Apple, right? Yeah. Yeah. They, they cleared, basically they got Amazon to clear a  bunch of Apple product resellers of questionable quality out of the store in exchange for making a  deal with Amazon and Apple. So they, that stuff is, it's pretty solid. And if you get a good deal,  it's a good deal. I'm unclear whether there's a new mini coming or whether it's just that they've  got, you know, they've got lots and they want to move some and that they've got Apple. The beauty  of being Apple is your margins are so huge that you can discount a little bit if you want to move  some stuff out of the channel and they can manage it. 120 bucks off was 500 now 380.

I'm about  to buy this one. And then there's the one with the knobs for $20 up. That's actually, I bought  that one. You know, you lose a lot of buttons there. And I, in my head, I like automating stuff  myself and like little twisty knobs and stuff are not very automatable. So I'm skeptical of that one.  I haven't tried it, but I'm a little skeptical of that. And I wanted a newer stream deck. So I got

Start time: 2608.64

Transcript:  that. I have it. And it, I don't, you can see that it's not plugged in. Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. I used,  I mean, it's, I'm figuring out, I use it with resolve. Some of the encoders work, these encoders  work pretty well, but I haven't found it. And as a general purpose, I actually bought another Elgato  right before the show because I, you know, I've been using it. I have like three stream decks right  now plugged into different computers. And I was like, Oh, another one. But wait, but wait,

Start time: 2634.72
End time: 2645.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but wait, because you could buy it for Amazon or get the same price at Elgato. They're doing  their own prime deals and you get a little cover for your stream deck. Here's the, here's the,

Start time: 2646.12
End time: 2689.54
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  the problem with buying anything directly. And this is the big advantage that Amazon has  shipping. It's whole foods. Oh, whole foods. You pick your, you pick your, you pick your stuff up.  If I don't like it, I don't even have to put it back in a box. I literally take it to whole foods  and hand it to them. And, and the money is, is the credit is put back in my account in like a day,  you know, like we're hours. And, and it's just, it's so seamless that I, at first I thought I do  return a lot more now than I did before. I used to be like, Oh, I'll get around to it. Never got  around to it. But I now it's the lock in is super serious because if Elgato, I have tried to,  I have attempted to return things that their return policy and the processes.

Start time: 2690.84
End time: 2722.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good point. And really, do you really need a face plate for your steam deck? Honestly?  I mean, no, no, no, you do not. So a free $10 face deck is not going to convince you to get it from  Elgato. You're right. That's why I, you know, it's really, I was asking about this. I have never  returned anything, but it is a really great way to return stuff. And they just, I think they throw  it. Somebody told me they throw it in a container out back and then the truck, it's a box. Oh,

Start time: 2723.00
End time: 2774.48
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  you were telling me. Yes. Yeah. It's a, so they have a big box there and what they do is they scan  your stuff on the way in. So they, you, you have it there. You, you know, they'll tell you if it's  more than a couple hundred or more than like a hundred few dollars, I want you to put it back  in the box. But if it's less than that, generally they just say, just bring it back. In fact, they  tell you not to put it back in the box. Anyway, so then you, you hand it to them. They scan your  phone. They throw it in a box. The box now has a, as it contents in it, says what everything's in  it. And then people bid on these or I don't know if they bid on them or Amazon, but people buy the  boxes from Amazon and then they, then they sell them on eBay. Like, I mean, that's kind of,  there's a business model for people to buy these boxes of used stuff and sell them. So they're  buying them, you know, pennies on the dollar from Amazon and Amazon has figured out the math that  it's better than throwing them away, which is what they were doing before. They're just throwing

Like they were, they were looking at first,  they start with the marketing stuff, the charts about, oh, here's how much more,  how much faster the M2 is than last year's M1. And here's how faster it is than this Core i9.  And A, pointing out that, okay, I see some graphs here where the legends aren't actually labeled.  And I see benchmarks here where you didn't actually explain what the benchmark did.

Transcript:  And so they were, I think Linus actually went specifically and said that the, I'm not quoting  here, but that the marketing images here, marketing claims are just malarkey. It's  incrementally faster, but not monumentally faster. It's not that much faster than comparable Intel  hardware. In many cases, it's slower than comparable Intel hardware. But however, there was,  there was huge praise for just for the power management.

Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think, I think that they, I think it was very balanced and fair in that they were  basically saying that actually in the first 10 minutes, five minutes, they said that if all  they said was this is more better and more faster, it's the new, it's the new M2 Ultra Studio,  all would be Jake. It was just that they were making specific claims that they couldn't  reproduce. Actually, I think that they were also trying to reproduce like the Blackmagic Studio  benchmark that they, that they mentioned and they couldn't reproduce it. And even Blackmagic,  when they talked to Blackmagic, they couldn't reproduce it either, they're claiming. So this is,  it just seems like a really, really weird set of claims. Again, it's, they weren't saying don't  buy it. They actually, they were, the other point they were making is that if you, if you don't  necessarily need a Mac, you can buy a comparably equipped or even over equipped Windows box for  the price of like a top of the line, for the price of a top of the line M2 Ultra Studio, you can get  a top of the line Windows box that has easily the same specs and still have $1,700 left for another  Mac mini or, or an M2 MacBook. And so I thought that was very fair. What I like about it is that

And also they are primarily  like a PC oriented- Yeah, I mean, you'd have to use Windows as one of the disadvantages of that box.  Yeah, exactly. And they, and they point, and he, and they point this out very fairly that, look,  if you want a Mac, that's a fair point, that's perfectly fine. However, one thing that I really,  really respect about them is that they're putting a lot of money into a really expensive testing  lab. So it's not just, Hey, we ran some benchmarks and we copied down the numbers. It's no, we  actually have like commercial testing equipment for power supplies, commercial testing equipment  for power consumption and thermals. And so when they make a claim, they at least say, well, here  is our data. If we screwed up, it's going to be very clear to everybody how we screwed it up.  So they're not just saying, Oh, well, you know, rah rah, team windows, Mac sucks. They are,  the reason why I put it in the, in the show notes is that it did seem significant that they were  very, very firm on the idea that the marketing stuff that you see on the product page is not  something that you should even take with a grain of salt, that it does seem to be actively misleading

Transcript:  and in some places, maybe even deceptive. I, the way I view this video is that it's not even a  video about a computer. It's a video teaching people about how marketing works. And in that,  I think it's actually valuable. I should just claim here that a lot of the people who used to  work in the Mac world lab work in the performance marketing group at Apple now, and they are doing,  I will say this because I think it is left as a question in that video. They're doing real tests  and they're getting real results. Now let's talk about what they, what Apple markets, right? Does  Apple publish all the numbers? No, they don't. They leave it to your imagination. Do they choose  the hardest comparison products to compare their product to? No, they do not. They choose the most  favorable comparison. Although I would argue that an M2 Mac is probably in terms of upgraders,  it's probably more likely somebody coming from Intel than coming from an M1 because it is  incremental from there. So I can understand it, but they're also going to choose the most favorable  because it is marketing, right? And then do they, this is, and again, I don't know this from those  people. I just know it because I know it from dealing with Apple for many years. Have they done  50 different tests and then cherry picked the five that look the best for Apple? Absolutely.  And have they done, in this case with the Linus Tech Tip video, have they done a bad job  of properly footnoting, which they used to do, I'm going to say it, they used to do a better job  of doing this, properly footnoting and disclosing what tests got run and what the configurations  were so that you can reproduce the results. And I think the answer here is kind of no, right? Like  that the most damning thing in this video for me was that Linus Tech Tips is sort of like,  we don't know, we don't understand what this test is or how they got the result. And the problem  with that is then you can't reproduce it. So I think that that's, like I said, I think this is  a good educational video. Everything Apple says in its marketing about the numbers is true,  but they only share the numbers that are the most favorable for Apple. And that is always the case.  And that's why you should always look to independent sources of information. So in some ways,  what this video is, is learn about marketing and why we spend a lot of money doing our own lab  testing. And to that, I've got to give them credit. The PC versus Mac thing I rolled my eyes at,  because it's like, oh, you could get a PC that does that. It's like, yeah, but if you're buying  a Mac, you're probably buying it because you want to use a Mac and not a PC. But the rest of it,  I mean, that's the truth of it. It's marketing. I am always, when I'm watching an Apple presentation,  I am always noticing like, what did they choose as the comparison computer? And you've seen it  with the M1 and the M2, especially the M2, they talk a lot about Intel computers, partially because  a lot of the upgrade is coming from Intel, but also that's a bigger number. So it's better for

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  marketing purposes. Yeah. And there are a lot of times during a keynote, whereas I will literally  put like a symbol that means, wow, what an interesting way of phrasing that they chose.  I'm going to look into this. I will say, however, I do think this went a little, marketing is  marketing. You're absolutely right that they're always going to, the purpose is not to produce an  independent set of test results to get a certification from the FCC or anything. It is  to get people excited about getting this new product. It's, oh, but I always think about these  things though, as like committing a foul, like in basketball, it's like, okay, you're going to,  you played high contact basketball, that's professional sports, but then, okay, you drove  an elbow right into somebody's eye socket. At this point, I'm going to have to flag you on that,  that's severe playing a hard ball. Yeah. And that's the thing about the footnotes. I mean,

Start time: 3319.58
End time: 3384.08
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think that's the key to this performance marketing is it ought to be reproducible and  understandable, even if you're cherry picking, right? Even if you're choosing comps that are  the easy comps instead of harder comps, it's marketing, we get it. But when you put numbers  down, there should be enough information attached and they footnote everything. If you've ever looked  at an Apple reviewers guide or an Apple website, there are so many footnotes. And sometimes I look  for the footnotes and I can't find them, which is very weird, right? Where it's like, wait a  second, where's number small number six? It's not, I can't find it. But if you're going to do this  with performance marketing, that's where you get into trouble. I think is when you make a claim  and somebody like Linus Tech Tips is looking very, they're trying so hard to understand what  you're claiming and they can't figure it out. That shouldn't happen. You should be able to  look at the footnote and get the answer of what they did. And that's the most troubling thing in  this whole report to me is like the, when they and black magic can't verify a black magic test,  what is that about? Right? Like that's not great. This isn't like sit like some YouTuber,

Transcript:  like running a Cinebench and saying, Oh my God, the Cinebench scores are terrible. And then like  right in the comments is like, yeah, you do know that the Cinebench test has not been optimized for  Apple Silicon yet. And maybe it's not a good metric. Well, even in this video, he's running

Start time: 3397.32
End time: 3401.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3402.08
End time: 3550.48
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  you know, go ahead, Alex. Yeah. All I was going to say is that is that the  almost nothing's been optimized, you know? And so, so the thing is, is that there's been a lot of  stuff that's made universal. It'll run really well on the M1, but it's not really taking full  advantage of the libraries. And that is important. I mean, if you talk, if you look at, you know,  the kind of things that, um, again, we go back to zoom ISO, if you look at what zoom did or,  you know, what the liminal team did is they're squeezing an enormous amount of performance out  of a Mac mini, um, because they're taking full advantage of the entire, they're optimizing and  working with Apple to tie all those little things in. And you're getting, you know, eight,  10 ADP streams out of a little Mac mini. Um, and so when you, when you really talk about optimizing,  really talking about using the libraries, there's, you know, I think that there's still a lot of,  a lot that a lot of developers are leaving on the table for a variety of reasons. Mostly that  is a lot of, it's expensive to rewrite all the code into, you know, to optimize it. And it's,  you know, it's only part of the market, but universal and optimized or truly optimized,  you know, for the, for the platform or two different things that we're going to see,  continue to see that grow across that platform. And so I think that, you know, I think it's hard  because, uh, you know, any tests are going to show some things to be faster. And I do think, um,  uh, that, you know, I was, I was actually talking to Andy about this a little earlier, which was,  you know, you can build a PC that's going to be faster than the Mac studio. I mean, you know, at,  at a lower price, you know, but you have to build it like you're not going to buy it. And, and it's  got, you know, it's not going to be as sleek and it's not going to be a Mac, you know, and, and,  and a lot of people who are buying it want to have a Mac and it's important to have these higher end  Macs because the people who are buying them, like there's definitely solutions that I need that  require more than the Mac pro, you know, that there are $20,000 boxes. They've got a bunch  of Quadro cards in them. I need the Nvidia chip sets. I need all of those things. So it's not that  Apple is going to give you the highest end of all of those things, but as a Mac user, knowing that  I can buy in at $500 and seamlessly go up to about $12,000 and get enough performance for what 90%  of the market, maybe 99% of the market needs is a, is a pretty good, you know, you have to have  that whole gamut. And I think Apple's doing that pretty well. I do, I do agree that, you know, they,  everybody is finding, but every, every manufacturer is going to find the bench sets that make the  most sense for them. And that's why, that's why there are magazines and other things and Linus

I, I, having worked  with Patrick Norton for years and he used to work at CD labs and did, was their benchmark guy. I  really know that benchmarks lie just as much as statistics and marketing graphs. And it's very

Transcript:  difficult for an end user to, to know how much they, I'll be honest. I just don't know how much  they matter. Like, you know, like, okay, that's the point. I agree. You know, like, like, I don't  know how much, like when we say, oh, well, this is faster. Well, I know that it's all I know is  my Mac studio, which is the first version of smack studio and only a max is one of the fastest  machines I've ever had, you know, and it does all the things that I needed to do. And now I know that  they're releasing one that is incrementally better than the one that I have. And when I upgrade,  I'll upgrade to that. You know, I think that, cause I think that the other thing about Linus tech tips  is they're, they're like, are you going to choose for them? Linux, PC, Mac are all just outputs,  you know, like they're, they're any, they're even hardware, you know, to them because they mostly  use PCs and Linux and the Mac. I'm going to go a little farther. I think if you're watching any

Now the thumbnail,  of course, is all of Linus's, LTT's videos is some aghast. I mean, it doesn't look, I'm not saying  he doesn't do a great job, and I'm not saying he does not now have the resources of even something  like ZD labs. But I also think there's an editorial slant to this that you can't actually,

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  it's marketing. You can't ignore is that, is that just to take it slightly more gently is I'll say,  you know, his, his primary market or PC users and, and number one and number two is that he is,  again, assuming that these are like, you're going to make a choice based on performance and price  about whether using a Mac or a PC, which from a PC and Linux user view might make sense,  but Mac users are using Macs. And we just want to know that they're going to be powerful enough to  do what we want to do. You know, and so we're not, we're not really, if you're using across,

It's reasonable to say what's what's the best machine to run this particular program, that's  a different group of people than most of us who are saying, well, I'm going to run a variety. It's  a general purpose PC for me. And I want good performance, but I also want fit and finish,  I want an operating system, etc, etc, etc.

Transcript:  Leo, when you say that the benchmarks are not necessarily, you know, fair, I think that what's  interesting about it is to think of benchmarks as being objective, but the choice of benchmark is  that's what I mean. And that's the that's the truth of it, right? Like it's lies, damn lies,  statistics and benchmarks. And everybody has a different weight or different specific benchmark  that matters to them. So like when I'm I, I have to review systems like this, and I choose a bunch  of things and I choose, you know, Geekbench, which is a very general gross tool, but it is real in  the sense like, is this faster or not, you want to check that kind of stuff. But you know, personally,  and I will do this sometimes I like an isotope D reverb, which is a very specific audio plugin  that I use because I do podcasts with people in echo rooms, and I spend hundreds of dollars trying  to get the echo out. And, you know, a tool like that, or one of the other isotope audio plugins,  or a different audio plugin to me, is like the number one reason to upgrade my system.  And somebody else will have a complete Alex has a different number one reason, and a number two,  and a number three. And that's the challenge with all of this. And, and it goes to Apple to where  Apple's got its rank. And what it's just trying to do is, right, again, put itself, I had a  conversation with an Apple PR person a few years ago, where she straight up said, look, my job is  to sell, I'm a salesperson, right? Like PR is not, don't imagine that it's anything but sales.  That's what it is. And those they are going to market the numbers that work best for them. And

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that's just that's just how it is. I'm going to add to that, that every YouTube successful  YouTube channel is is designed to attract hits. So much more so than almost now than even magazines  and websites were. And so there is also a perverse incentive there. I mean, look at these thumbnails,  these guys are not just however they play themselves. None of these guys, none of the  big YouTubers are, are honest actors in the sense that, I mean, they're, they're really,  in order to succeed, they really have to say stuff that's going to get people, you know, upset and  interested. And I think LTT is very good. But I think that there's a lot of opportunity to slant  stuff. Is the primary point of this one that you can get an Nvidia 4090 and it's going to  outperform the Mac? Is that? No. That's not the primary. The primary point is simply that there

Transcript:  are claims being made that in the in the early part of the video, I think he actually even puts  it in context of like, this is the sort of thing we would call out a Windows PC maker for or graphics  card. They're right to do that. I agree. And I do and I do want to add a personal opinion that  you are correct that, obviously that you're the business of YouTube is to make sure that you  build and sustain and grow an audience and that you can monetize that audience. If you are starting  out, you do have to do, I think that you are someone is very likely to do very extreme things.  There are a couple of channels I will not name that keep popping up my recommendations,  where it's always shocked, like, oh, the vision pro sets fire to farm with baby ducks and like,  okay, you're you have no credibility and you're squandering what little credibility you have with  sensationalism. The problem, I think that with Linus Tech Tech's again, tips, my only my personal  opinion is that they've spent a lot of time doing a lot of hard work and now they have a reputation.  So if they were to just simply say, oh, God, I really Oh, God, is this really another Mac? Let's  do a hit piece on Mac hit pieces on Mac really play off really, really well. They're going to  start to burn off that kind of stuff. And that sort of stuff, you don't get back. And also they're  being very thorough and they're showing their math. They're not just simply offering personal  opinions. Thirdly, that there is a difference between a point of view and a bias. I think they  have a point of view, but they but I don't think they necessarily have a bias that way. And I think  that it's important to talk about people who it's important to have in the collection of reviews,  people who review it on the basis of, I'm not necessarily going to look upon this as this is  one of the three Macs, three computers I can possibly buy because I need my next computer to  be a Mac as a outfit that games on everything that works on everything that edits video on  everything. We are going to create our own benchmarks because if we don't understand what  Apple is doing and getting these numbers, we're going to create actual project workflows so we  can try to do an apples to apples. We're going to create an Xcode project to try to do an apples  to apples project to find out like where these numbers go. So again, I do see the equity and I  don't, I don't, I know while I'm sure that they would choose a title and a thumbnail to get people  to click, like if you're subscribed, if it gets recommended, once you get into the video itself,  I tend to trust what they say. I don't always agree with it, but I tend to respect what they say.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, okay. If the point of your video is don't trust Apple's marketing numbers. Okay.  On this one. Yeah.  I think I just said that and I think we've said that all along. I don't think that needs to.  Okay. Fine. Yeah.  This is, I feel bad for people who are trying to figure this, suss this out because it's hard to  find these days objective numbers anywhere. And I think YouTubers really have a strong incentive  to drive traffic. And that does, you know, as we've said, benchmarks can be, you know,  the benchmarks and numbers are not lies, but the way you choose and use them can  mislead. And there's a lot of incentive to do that. And so I, I, I'm pretty mistrustful.  I know LTT is good, but I'm very mistrustful of YouTubers and their reviews because there's  a perverse incentive there. That's all I'm saying. I mean, and I only, I could say that because we  don't have a perverse incentive because we don't give a crap if you watch our videos.

Transcript:  So, well, I mean, we podcasters tend to be a subscription relationship where you have a long  term relationship. Our relationship is with the audience. Exactly. And, and you know, YouTubers  would love to have a subscription relationship, but even the subscription relationship and the  notification touch that bell relationship, YouTube's algorithm overrides all of it. And in the end,  they have to make their business that way. It's a tough business to be in. And I think that  actually in the grand scheme of things, what you want are YouTubers that play the game, but then  drop the game as quickly as they can. And so that LTT video, I think is a good example of that,  where it's kind of probably not the angle that they would take if they weren't trying to get  attention. And the thumbnail is what it has to be in order to work in the algorithm. And I would  argue the top of the script is a little more inflammatory. And then the further, the further  you go in the video after they've got you, it's perfectly reasonable, right? Like it's, but that's  the game that they have to play. And that's, it's, that is a tough business to be in and knowing  some YouTubers. If you don't play the game, you will not make it. Like you have to do it.  That's how it is.

And they created this app that doesn't simply say,  Oh, thank you. Welcome. We're, we're, we're going to try to make you feel at home here. Here's a  tour. And if you want to post something, it's like, Hi, welcome to threads. Hey, here's everybody  that we think, you know, click this button to follow all of them. They'll be notified and Hey,  here's a thousand people you can invite to have. Well, it's kind of, kind of to Jason's point,

Transcript:  uh, when Meta, when Facebook started, and I guess when YouTube started, um,  we didn't have algorithmic feeds and what these companies have absolutely learned and TikTok is  a perfect example. Twitter didn't have algorithmic feeds in the beginning is if you go to a site and  it requires you to figure out who to follow and, and, and, and you have to do it well to get a good  experience. That's not the ideal experience. So unlike the way Twitter launched threads,  launches with a, with a TikTok style algorithmic feed. And actually I liked it at first because I  could add the people, Oh, they're there. That's not, Oh, that's a good one. Oh, that's good. Uh,  and, and this is to your point exactly, Jason algorithm, uh, is starting to Trump, uh, relationship,  but I understand why it's just a lot easier to get started.

Although I think we all know that the road to hell is paved with increasing engagement, right?  There is a, there is a limit to it. And there's value, there's value to both, right? I think  that's the thing that threads right now, they say there will be a non-algorithmic version that you  can look at too, but it was like, there's value in both and people can find value in both.

Now suddenly also Instagram, let's talk about  just briefly, they laundered this through Instagram. Instagram always has felt less awful  than Facebook. I know lots of people who despise Facebook, who still use Instagram because I'll  say, I'll say, you know, but you're still on Instagram. And the answer is, well, yeah, it's,  it's not as bad as Facebook. It's like, it's the same company, but they're right. It, it, it is,  it does seem to have a different set of, uh, of, I don't want to say values regarding Facebook in  any way, but a different set of decisions that they're making. Instagram has already gone farther

I have my name, my, I don't want,  I want my hand. So every time there's a new social media thing, I jump on, I establish my handle. And  then with threads I jumped on, I made sure I had my handle, I played with it a little bit, and then  I deleted off my phone because I like my battery. And so, so I was just like, you know, like I don't  have any meta tools on my phone. I still use them on the web here and there, but I don't put them  on my phone because my battery lasts so long now. Like it's like, you know, and it, it was, it was,  I don't care what anyone says. Like when I take the meta apps off, my battery lasts longer.  I don't have any paranoia about it. I don't have any, you know, there's not no upset.

Transcript:  So there were a few stories from last week we didn't get to talk about, but I'll bring up a  couple of them. Uh, one, uh, Goldman is looking for a way out of its partnership with Apple there.  We had talked a couple of months ago about the fact that they lost a billion dollars  on consumer finance and that's primarily, I would guess the Apple card. They're talking with American  express, at least they were last week, according to the wall street journal to take over, uh, all of  the consumer stuff except for their high interest rate savings account, Marcus, but, uh, they would  like to retreat from Apple and credit cards entirely. Uh, it's not necessarily a, a slam

Start time: 4925.98
End time: 4957.04
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  against Apple about, oh, it's a bad deal or this is a, this is financially untenable. It is like,  they made a really big gamble into saying we are a financial investment bank and a financial  services company. We want to become a consumer bank and we want to issue credit cards. We want  to have saving savings accounts. They made a lot of investments and a lot of purchases and acquisitions  based on that in the past three or four years. And they just, the bill came due and they're like,  okay, we're out. This is not where we, we don't have a plan for turning this around. And so  therefore it's best that we just simply fold. I don't think they, they have, they don't necessarily

Start time: 4957.18

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  have a mechanism for it. Like I think that the thing is that to do this consumer business,  the consumer business is hard everywhere. Every time you start saying, I want to sell to an average  person who's going to be measuring things in single dollar units or $10 units, you have to be, you have  to be extremely efficient, you know, to make that actually turn out. You know, when you deal with  businesses, when you deal with large investments, there's a lot of wow and flutter that can protect  you. But so many small transactions are super, super hard to do efficiently. And the companies  that do it well, do it well. And the company trying to get into it, I think they found a  little bit harder. I think it was good for Apple because Apple has figured out a lot of things and  we can see, see Apple at it, continuing to add features. I think they also may be looking at,  we're going to put all this investment in and eventually Apple's going to pull it in house.  And then we're not going to ever turn a corner, you know, like, you know, like they're, you know,  the Apple's in this process right now, it seems to be building out all the other things that you

Apple, according to Mark Gurman is going to have to, well, first of all,  it's going to launch in stores and you're going to have to make an appointment to buy one.  Apple plans, this is from a Gurman, a slow appointment only rollout of its Vision Pro.  You will have to get measured. You will have to go in and give them your eye prescription.  There's going to be a lot. They are not going to sell it. You know,  sounds like they're not going to sell it online.  Gurman also, yeah. Gurman also says Apple's cheaper model will not be out  next year. Will not be out in 25. Will be out in 2026. So this is a long runway for this

Start time: 5138.08

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  jet to take off. We all knew that. And I think that it makes perfect sense that they're going to  have, when they sell these, the first Vision Pro, it's going to have to be a concierge process  because Apple, one of the, one of the hallmarks of Apple through every generation has been,  we want the consumer to have the best experience possible. If we see a nail sticking up that they  might get the catch on or step on, we're going to hammer that thing down. And there are so many  opportunities for someone to sign for a box off of FedEx, try to get this thing working,  not have a great experience because they didn't get the right, they didn't get the right eye  interface. They didn't get the right eyeglasses things. They didn't get the first, they didn't  get the great first 30 minute demo walking them through like, here's what we're doing. Hey, look,  I'm also in the space with you because I'm also wearing this and I can show you like how you can  actually activate things. They need to make sure that the people who spend 3,500 bucks for this  and then blog about it or make YouTube videos about it, or even just people who are just excited  consumers don't simply say that, oh, wow, I could have just gotten a Quest.

And in fact, maybe even  want to make when your resource constrained, you can only sell a few hundred thousand of them total.  So you limit, you make an appointment, you limit the regions and the stores that might even offer  them. I'm not, I don't think Gurbans reports as they're not going to sell them online,  but, and they were acting at WWDC, like they were going to sell them online too, but like in store,  they're gearing up for this very complex concierge style process. And I think that's why is because  they can afford to, and it actually kind of helps gate the availability. And I think that's  important because they don't have very many, they won't have very many. And it's,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Financial Times, citing unidentified people close to Apple and Lux share, which is the Chinese  firm that's assembling the device. Lux share said Apple was only asking for enough parts for  130,000 to 150,000 units in the first year. The Financial Times says Apple is preparing to make  fewer than 400,000 units in 2024. So they had originally planned a million. So yeah, another  reason why they're not in a hurry to sell them to you. They don't have that. That doesn't scare me

Start time: 5300.74
End time: 5348.32
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  at all. I don't think that should scare anybody at all. I think that it makes me interested in  how they're going to, how they're going to sell. If they have limited numbers and they are reasonably  sure there's more demand than supply, how are they, are they going to choose to allocate these  and make sure that, look, we're going to have a, there's a percentage that we're only going to be  able to sell. We're going to only going to sell through developer channels so that you have,  they're going to make sure that there are people who are not just buying it, doing a video or  playing, having fun with it on the yacht on 4th of July weekend and then putting it in a box and  never using it again. Each one of these is an investment for Apple in future experiences and  future developers. And so if they only have a couple of hundred thousand to sell, which is  peanuts, particularly when you think about the volumes in which Apple usually transacts hardware,  it seems as though they're, it would behoove them to make sure that it goes into the hands of people

Maybe that's how they're going to sell all those Mac Pros now.  It's like, well, we only want our most valued customers. So no rumor that that's going to

Transcript:  happen. There is a rumor that the Apple's working on a large, according to German, larger than 30  inch iMac, but don't expect it until late next year. It's more than a year out. I think some  people will be disappointed by that. I think most of us have just grown accustomed to the idea that  we'd buy a Mac Studio or a Mac Mini and an iScreen and be done with it.

Start time: 5407.86
End time: 5522.40
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think my question about this product rumor is who wants an iMac that's that big and doesn't just  want to buy an external display? Like what is the market for that? And I'll tell you,  because I don't know, but I'm not going to tell you the answer. I'm going to tell you,  I'm going to ask another question here. When I have talked to Apple people in the past about  the iMac, what they've always said is you got to understand the iMac sells, you know, it's the  most popular desktop Apple sells and they sell a lot of them. It's actually pretty big business  and they go to weird places. Some of them go to schools. A lot of them go to like reception areas  and in hotels. It's a piece of furniture. Some people park one in their house, even if they've  got laptops because it gives a general purpose computer in their house. The impression I get is  that Apple sells more iMacs than you'd think. They are used in a really wide variety of ways,  more than many of us sort of like computer expert type people think of. And who would know better  than Apple? How many they sell and where they go and all of that. And so when I see a rumor like  this and I'm a little bit baffled about why, and I like a big iMac, I had the 27 inch iMac for years,  but now that they've got the external display thing going on with little Apple silicon computers  to drive it, it seems much more efficient that way. I've got to believe that Apple would not be  even talking about making this product if they didn't think they could sell a bunch of them to  somewhere. I just am not sure where that is. The 24 fits, I mean it literally physically fits in  a lot of spaces that the 32 does not. But obviously, I'm not going to question this,  if it has gone to the point where it's in development, Apple seems to be convinced that  they know that there's an audience for it. Otherwise they wouldn't do it.

Start time: 5523.32
End time: 5556.32
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah. I'll answer quickly. I'm with you. If I had heard that rumor from a less reliable source,  I'd say, okay, well a lot of people have lots of ideas about what Apple's going to be doing.  But it's a really good source. And the first thing I thought was just like what you thought was that,  okay, obviously Apple has access to better sales numbers than I do. Maybe they're aware of a certain  region of the globe in which these big all-in-ones are much, much more relevant product than like you  say, a really nice iMac and a really nice display because I don't get it. One of the reasons Apple

Rumor Apple has been shooting all their Apple TV plus shows  in 180 degree virtual reality. This is the, he's using this as the evidence, a leaked photo of a  180 camera rig set on set. First of all, Alex, do you recognize this camera? And second, is this  a rental house? Okay. So anyway, that's PRG. Yeah, that's not on a set. So that's a

Start time: 5618.90
End time: 5736.40
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  rental house. It's a big event slash rental house PRG. And those are big warehouse. Those are all  those road cases that'll get loaded into something. So I don't think that this is shot from a set.  I think that they might've sold it as that, but that's not a set. That's PRG's  like supply house. They have a bunch of them. They're big. What that looks like is the,  it looks like the Canon R series dual 180 lens on, and it's most likely attached to a Raptor.  So the red Raptors, the two big cameras that people are testing right now with those  are the R5C and the Raptors. And then you have the dual lenses that you, both of them are,  mounted there. So those are the ones that people are playing with. Obviously the Raptor gives you  a greater dynamic range. If you were going to shoot something that was at Apple's level,  you'd probably end up using the Raptor. If you wanted to experiment, you'd probably use the Canon  R5C. I don't have any doubt that Apple is shooting some content with that setup. Like I think that  they are absolutely. And by the way, the reason that dual, that's one lens. It takes those two,  it puts both of those images onto, on the sensor together. And that means they stay  synced and it's a lot easier to process. It has to be a full frame sensor and it's an 8K sensor.  And that means that you have the left, right, you know, that are there all in the same sensor.  Otherwise you have to build a much more complex rig, which have become very valuable in our market.  You mentioned that. Yeah. So they, so the, so anyway, so those, but it's much, much easier to  develop with these two. What I think is most likely happening is that Apple is probably  shooting scenes or pieces of scenes or behind the scenes of shows with that rig. And I wouldn't,  I'd be blown away if they didn't, I would do that. I would shoot little scenes to show you what that  looks like, or I would shoot the behind the scenes so you can see what it looked like.  I'd be shooting MLS with it. I'd be doing, you know, so there's so many places.

Transcript:  It's so hard. Like, so here's the problem with even with, with 360, it's really, really hard.  We did a lot of 360, but with 180, it's still hard. Remember that when you're shooting a film,  there's a lot of stuff happening right outside of frame. There's flags. There's,  you've got flags, you've got boom mics, you've got rigging, you've got all these other things  that are happening. And usually they're either right outside the frame or sometimes garbage  mapped or Roto because they were in the frame, you know, 180 lens, you get to see all of that.  And so, so it's much less now you could clean a set or do something for certain shots  that you get that 180. But I think that now as, as a, as your, um, extra day, extra content,  the behind the scenes stuff would be great. You get your mission impossible stuff and you get some  behind the scenes shots of it. Wow. That's going to be great. It's going to be so cool to stay in  there and see in 3d and be able to sit there as if you were watching and looking back and forth.  Um, and, uh, and, you know, I think that the, and, and we're hearing that, that they're asking for,  you know, 120 frames a second from a lot of folks. And so, so, you know, the AK 120 is,  you know, kind of the, still the mark that Apple's kind of looking for, which is still higher.  I still think that the next version of the pro headset is going to be 120 frames a second.  I think that the 90, what we see in the first form factor is going to be what the normal headset is  that's less expensive two years from now. The pro will go, I think up to AK 120, um, you know,  as far as the delivery method. And so, so I think that that's probably where we're, um, anyway,  so I think that it's, it would be crazy for them not to be shooting that kind of content,  but I don't think that they're shooting like whole shows in it. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's,

Like it's, you can tell when you watch something  that was shot in 3d, it looks beautiful, but, um, it also caught like people, the impression I get  other than James Cameron is people do it once and then they're like, Oh, I'm never doing that again.

Start time: 5923.56
End time: 5962.40
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  cause people are talking about IMAX a lot because we've got the whole mission impossible versus  Oppenheimer. IMAX. And I saw a video that was great cause it was from the set of a scene being  shot in an IMAX camera. And the thing that you don't realize unless you've been on one of those  sets is that the IMAX camera, in addition to being huge and only being able to short for a,  shoot for a very short amount of time, sounds like a chainsaw. So literally it's amazing. People are  walking down the street and there's an IMAX shot and the chainsaw is going and they're like, well,  if you ever asked yourself, are we going to have to loop every little bit of dialogue in this entire  movie? The answer is yes. It's like the old days of Hollywood. Hollywood changed completely when

Transcript:  Yeah. And the 3D stuff is the fortunate thing for people who are doing stuff for vision or  anything else is that we did go through this huge sprint where there was a bunch of technology that  was built for it and the controllers and lots of things were figured out, back 10 years ago or  whatever. But it's still, I do think that when people see AK 120, it's going to be something that  it's going to make a difference. And what it's so cheap, I mean, it's much cheaper to shoot behind  the scenes or shoot certain scenes when you're already doing production and add that in because  you own the production. The hardest part is negotiating all of that 180 and all the extra  shooting with a production company that is going to go out for features because Apple is building  their own content. They have a lot more. They can say, Hey, we would like to do this. We're not

If you  want to see Mission Impossible in IMAX, you have to see it this week because it only got a one week  window in IMAX because the commitment to Oppenheimer happened a long time ago, a long time  before Mission Impossible was scheduled. So mission, I think mission possible got scheduled  at Paramount and they were like, Hey, what's the deal with the one week? They're like, it came in  too late. You were a year too late for that.

Transcript:  then projected in 70. And the interesting thing for Oppenheimer is I believe that they developed  a new black and white film just for the film, just, just for this, for this piece,  because they didn't want to color. They didn't want to just, just do mono of the color film  stock. So they, they actually got their own film stock of black and white to do it. So it's a,  I mean, Nolan is pushing the out, like he, he, he and, and Cameron and a couple others have the  juice to say, I'm going to make a film exactly the way I'd like to make a film and you will all  figure it out, you know, and there's not that many directors left that can do that.

And, and that's the funny thing about Oppenheimer and really the mission impossible is that  they're probably best viewed on a big screen. So I regret, I like, I saw the Top Gun sequel  and I was like, ah, the script is terrible, but it's kind of exciting. And I get the impression  that if I had seen it really loud on a giant screen, I would have been like, oh, please.

Start time: 6359.52
End time: 6364.40
Speaker: Alex Lindsay

Start time: 6364.54
End time: 6368.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've heard that would make me want to buy a Vision Pro. Well, I just think, I think that the Apple

Start time: 6368.56
End time: 6527.44
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  needs to, they're going to want to prove that model, you know, and I think that there's, it's  much easier when it's not live, you know, so, so the fact that they can do the whole thing and shoot  it that way, I think that it would make sense to do it sometime next year. I don't have any, you  know, when it's doing, when you're doing it in post, it should be relatively straightforward to do.  When I see them tweet about it, I'm sorry.  The one thing I'll say is that they don't, it's not very hard because they're probably not going to,  they're probably going to put it on a screen. So, you know, when you think about, they're going to  put it in a window that sits inside of a space. So the space will most likely be the theater and  the window will be there. Now they can make that window 3D if they want, you know, so they can  shoot it in 3D so it pops out. I'd be surprised. So I think that they would deliver it that way.  The problem really is the way that they do them, you'd have to figure out how they do it. And they  could theoretically do it this way, which is that there's a lot of things that they do in the keynote  now, now that it's not on stage, that would be hard to do. It'd be hard for someone to watch  because, so when you put, when you create the space that the video is sitting in, so if you use  the, you know, of course in the vision, there's the windows, there's volumes and there's spaces.  The windows is what you would typically play a movie inside of the space is the environment,  but it's the one, it's the 360 slash 180 environment. When you put that in there and you  start cutting cameras really fast, or you start doing big jib shots or moves and all the Craig  shots, or those big moves where they move from one floor to another, a lot of people that will get  sick. It's making me nauseous just thinking about it. Yeah. So everyone's stomach will pull up into  their, you know, into their, into their throat as, as that moves down there. Maybe they want to do  that. But I think that the other thing that they could do is they could recreate quote unquote,  a stage experience where they're gently going so that the, the vision version is much different.  It doesn't have as many moves. It's more like sitting on a stage and it's going to deliver you  and you can still change scenes in it, but it may, they, I think eventually they could get to that.  So there's going to be, I mean, developing the 180 content for this is going to be pretty  I think pretty exciting. So we'll see how far they push it, but I think most likely they would  do a 3d version inside of a window at first. Maybe even shifting, you know, you can shift back and  forth. So you, I think this is where we're going to see MLS where you're going to see, you're going  to be watching it in a 16 by nine window. Then they score and the window disappears and you're  suddenly getting a replay in stereo or, you know, like in 180, like you're there on the, or they  just every once in a while take you to a certain part of the field and let you experience that in,  you know, full 180. I think that's going to be really interesting. Jason Snell just dropping

Transcript:  this in our club, twit discord. The new Apple developer betas have just dropped and a new,

Start time: 6536.32
End time: 6638.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I'm going to put that in quotation marks because these are still beta three, but they're  incremented build numbers. Now, why would they do that? Why would they possibly do that? Well,  one reason is this is about the time every year where the public beta comes out. And I wonder if  perhaps they had to make a few adjustments to beta three to fix some things before they unleash it on  the public. So keep an eye out. They only said July, so it could be at any point between now and  the end of the month, but this would like, if you're looking for public betas, this I think is a  smoke signal that they're probably on the way soon because Apple likes to run. Here's how it works.  Apple likes to run the developer beta by the people in that group to find showstoppers.  And they did that today. So you would think it would be imminent if there weren't showstoppers.  So if you're a developer on the betas update now, and if you're not, or you're listening to this  in the next week, maybe the public betas are even out by then. It really, there's no way to tell  until Apple, they sometimes will go right up to the moment and then be like, forget it, not today,  not today. Got a problem. But this is super suspicious that it's not beta four. It's just  beta three incremented like a couple, like the Mac one went from like G to I, right? Like in the  internal build system, they didn't even increment the number. It's very clearly just a slightly more  recent build than that. But that'll make it public. I mean, there are more people on the public beta.  It's easier to get into the dev beta than it used to be. But the public betas are very popular  these days. And I think we maybe are very close now. You've been using the developer betas. Would

Start time: 6644.48
End time: 6728.18
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  from the public betas or? I'd say it's the standard warning. Like you should be prepared.  Like if it's something that you rely on to get your day to day work done, you should probably  not do it. If it's something that you want to do for fun to get a preview or you're willing to suffer  maybe worse battery life. If it's a mobile device, maybe some apps that don't behave quite right,  but you're willing to chance it. Like I haven't had any big problems at all with any of them.  But you know, there's also on the Mac, there's software that I rely on that does not work on the  public beta. And so I have to have a second system so that I can run that software anyway. So, you  just got to be careful. But these days my beta warnings are a lot less than they used to be  because Apple has this whole public beta process. Apple is trying very hard not to ruin everybody's  summer. And so it's not quite as dangerous as it used to be. I also point out if you're a Mac user,  unlike the iPad and the iPhone, a Mac user, you can install the OS on an external drive and boot  from it and then reboot into the old operating system, which is nice and safe. You can't do that  on the iPad and the iPhone. So you're just going to have to risk it. But that all said, I have not  had any real problems with it. And some of the features are fun. So if you're willing to take  the risk, but like, if like literally you're going to lose your job, if this app doesn't work,  do not do it. Just don't risk it. Don't risk it.

Transcript:  enough money yet today. Mine's not very expensive. I mean, it's connected to something expensive,  but it's not expensive itself. It's called Monitor Plus. And for those of you using Sony cameras,  like myself, Monitor Plus lets you tie your iPhone to it. One of the big problems with not using a  Blackmagic camera with all the other Blackmagic stuff is I can't shade the camera anymore.  And so I was complaining about it and of course people started sending me the links and I  started downloading the links and the one that I found to be the most stable  is Monitor Plus. It's actually pretty easy to link into. Once the phone has said I can be controlled,  you simply turn it on. It will ask you, do you want to join the Wi-Fi connection? And then you  basically get, and I'm having trouble getting my phone to output to my switcher, but I was able to  connect to it. So you'll see here, this is what I see, which is I have a little bit of a histogram.  Scope. And then I have controls. And so now with my phone, I can look at it and I do this to make  adjustments. Can you apply a LUT while you're watching? I can't apply a LUT, but you can see me,  that's my phone. I'm just sitting there with my phone adjusting. That's my ISO. So I can actually  go in here and make some, I haven't tried to change the LUT for it itself, but I definitely can make  adjustments to a lot of parts of it. And again, having the histogram built right into it is really  nice. You can take a look at it and just know whether I'm kind of in the right space or not.  So it's a pretty slick, like I can go into my color, for instance. Sony has its own app,

Transcript:  It's one of the big gotchas when you're not, because the great thing about the Black Magic  cameras is once you plug them into the switcher, you're able to control them, shade them,  do a lot of other things. And so having something else that gets closed, it's not quite the same  level of control or fluidness that you have with a Black Magic camera. It's just that the autofocus  on the Sony is really nice. But anyway, Monitor Plus works pretty well.

Transcript:  Great. Hey, this is just in too. Thank you ScooterX in our IRC. Half an hour ago,  Apple pushed out new firmware for the Beats Studio Buds, the AirPods Pro. This has been promised.  And I think this would be the transparency stuff and the auto adapt, adaptivity stuff and so forth.  So I don't think if you have Beats Pros or AirPods Pros, you'd have to do anything. I imagine as soon  as you hook them up to your phone, it'll update the firmware. So that's good news. That's good news.  And Alex's pick once again, Monitor Plus. It's on the app store from Hon in Un.

Transcript:  Yes. It's interesting. Something I hadn't seen before. I'm evacuating myself from Evernote,  which because there's turmoil there. You're still there. Really? Wow.  Well, because it gets into my pick as a matter of fact, because one of the things in my workflow is  I need to be able to, when I find something on the web that I need to refer back to for research,  when I'm writing about something or preparing to talk about something on NPR or on a podcast,  I need to have the actual... You know what happens? Things tend to disappear or you lose  internet connectivity when you're kind of desperate to actually get access to it.  So part of my workflow is to clip the entire webpage. An Evernote via its plugin was really,  really good at doing that. Oh yeah. I used to use that all the time. I loved the Evernote plugin.  And it was great. When I boarded the train to go into Boston to do radio, I just pull out my iPad,  click on the sync button on Evernote. And now every single website that I... Every single web  article that I'm basing a lot of my talk on is going to have this stuff on it. So I'm looking  for other workflows for, I need to be able to capture web pages. I found this plugin for  pretty much every web browser out there. It's called Mark Download. And it's just a simple  plugin. You click a button and it will download your current webpage in Markdown format. And it's  very, very robust. It creates a readability version of it. So it's not as though it's going  to try to download all the buttons and all the ads and stuff like that. But it presents you with a  window of, here's the Markdown that I've captured from this. And you have the ability to edit it  before it gets saved. And then you can save it. You can also create templates so that if you want...  I was experimenting with... It's not just the content. I also want to make sure I'm capturing  certain metadata so that maybe I can script or automate certain things about these pages that  I'm downloading. And so you could create the, here's what the header should look like. Here's  what the footer should look like. You can select just parts of the site to, of the webpage to capture.  It may not be the one that I use permanently, but it was unusual and boy, does it work well.  It also integrates really, really well with Obsidian for people who are using the Obsidian  NoteTaker. And the fact that my now go-to app for most of my study and writing is Ulysses,  which is based on Markdown. There are a bunch of other really great apps that are based on Markdown  now. So the ability to simply drag that webpage into, as a new note, into Ulysses without having  to worry about, oh, I can't attach a PDF or I can't attach it as this. Working with it as a  native thing that can then cut and paste text without worrying about where I'm selecting.  That's a pretty interesting process. I think it's not a screenshot. It's an actual

Transcript:  I am going to plug my friend's novel, All Souls Lost by Dan Morin. Comes out October 17th.  It is available for pre-ordering now. I had the good fortune to read it a few years ago.  It's been sort of in process for a while. It's really good. It's an urban fantasy.  The relevance to this show? Well, there's a big tech company in it where mysterious,  potentially supernatural things may be happening. If you think that Dan might write what he knows  and that that big tech company might resemble, oh, I don't know, Apple in some way, well,  no similarities between anybody living or dead. Certainly, certainly not. It's a fun read and  it's coming out. Finally, everybody else in the world gets to see it. Definitely, I laughed at the  big tech company that the main character works for. This looks really fun. It's really familiar.  I love dance writing. There will be an audiobook. They haven't announced the audiobook yet. This is  his first book that is not in his Galactic Cold War series, which is ongoing. It's an urban fantasy  and it's just a kick. The fact that, yeah, if you know about Apple, then you will recognize

Transcript:  Yeah. It's in his wheelhouse. I want to give a little plug to an app that you've  picked before, Andy. I know you know it and like it. In fact, I thought you might make this your  pick of the week. Bear just came out with version two after five years of working on it. All new  editor and lots of new features. This is a markdown editor that is Apple only iOS, iPad OS, and Mac OS  free to use. Although if there are some advanced features, you might want to pay a measly 30 bucks  a year for like syncing. It has full encryption and it is fully marked down capable. A lot of  people like it. Very nice editor. I know you have used it, right Andy? I've used it. Obviously,

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  when I first used it, it seemed too similar to Ulysses for me to consider switching.  But now this looks like it really has. It's gotten into a really nice Ford versus GM,  Ford versus Ferrari sort of battle, which is like, oh, they've, they've, to us together have  shown the world that really great markdown based note taking apps are very muscular and useful.  And now we're basically going to start serving this market in a much more professional way.  It does so many more things. I have not, I downloaded it. I've not tried, I've not started  playing with it, but I did see a lot of things that I wish that Ulysses had. But the great thing  about markdown is that I could simply take all of my Ulysses. If I decide to switch to pair,  I just switch from one folder to the other. If I, if I decide to sync, to create a shared Google  drive folder with all of my like Ulysses projects and markdown projects, I could even like edit  markdown on my Android phone. And when I open up on my Mac or on my iPad or on my iPhone, it won't  care. So this is, this is why using a, using an open standard that's based on text files is such  a powerful thing. Cause you never know what changes are going to make in the future and

Transcript:  you're ready for it. You probably already know markdown, even if you've never heard of markdown.  John Gruber created it many moons ago and it is a very simple text-based way to create formatted  text. Many years later, it's, it's kind of a power tool and bear that's bears file format, which means  you know, it's, it's open and you're not stuck. And bear is famous for its editor. They've got  a new editor now that they've put out. I've been on the test flight of that editor for like three

Transcript:  Animation. Ooh. Yeah, we, I mean, it's a busy week as always. You know, we had a great session with  a project manager from AWS yesterday talking really about how to plan projects. Today we talked about  the overall pipeline of 3D production, which was really, really great. Alan Hawks, who's just an  incredible production, 3D production person was really giving the overview. He's going to do a  year and a half at once a month talking about different aspects of the 3D pipeline. We're  talking about acoustical panels tomorrow because it's audio day. We have Chris Seeger, who's NBC  Universal's Director of Advanced Content Production coming in on Thursday with Michael Dresden and  Jim Toten. These are the guys that work on Thursday Night Football and they're going to be talking  about HDR, objective color metrics. I mean, this is a deep hour and you might like that,  so, you know, I think that Ray might enjoy this one. These are the guys, this is what they do.  They are spending, you know, they've been building the NBC LUTs and all the other things to figure  out how to do consistent, perfect color going from SDR to HDR back to SDR, all those other things.  So they're going to be talking about that. Friday is a little more relaxed. We're just  showing a bunch of our projects and talking about what worked and didn't work and answering  questions. Then Saturday, we're talking about audio description with Joel Snyder, who is really  one of the key people who created it. Our accessibility Saturdays have turned into  quite a thing. I mean, we're experimenting with adding accessibility. We have  deaf panelists and ASL and we're adding a lot of other bits and pieces and really understanding  what the challenges are and working with everybody and it's turned out to be a really  good Saturday. So anyway, that's this week. Free, open to all. You can be in the Zoom if you want.
