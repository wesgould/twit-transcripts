We're going to find some Apple news because you know why Jason Snell braved the elements.  It was pouring rain this morning. I had no trouble getting here.

Start time: 112.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  There was no there was no rain when I parted the skies. Oh nice. And the sun led me here.  He parted. He came up. Yeah. And like the Red Sea, it just got out of the way on 101.  Yep. Sonoma County said welcome. The cows moved over. Cows moved over. Nice to see you in studio.

Start time: 128.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's good to be here. I thought I'd pop in. Six colors dot com. He's getting ready because Thursday you're going to be you're going to be doing that.

Start time: 134.46
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I'm going to be making charts. I'm into the chart mines. Leo after this I go straight to the chart mines.  I got to mine the colors. We need colors. I got to get the bars. I got to get some indigo. I got to get some pie.

Start time: 142.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got to make some pie. For the red. Yep. Six colors dot com. He's got all six of them.  He's also of course a man of many podcasts. So we're always thrilled to have more podcasts than man.  Yes. He's practically all podcasts. Thanks for coming in. It's great to see Andy Iannacocant because he's far far away on the east coast where the weather is crazy. Hi Andy.

Start time: 169.28
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah we had a good 84, 85 degrees a couple weeks ago. And once again see that what people who don't who've never lived in New England like need to understand is that there are two like phases of two specific phases of New Englanders  being jerks and being stubborn. One comes in like October, November where like no I'm not this isn't cold. I'm not turning on the heat like December. No this isn't really cold. Not turning on the heat until you finally turn on the heat.  And then comes a time in the spring where like where you turn you turn the heat off again. And then even though like you get another like eight weeks of like 43 degree weather.  Yeah I'm not turning. Oh this isn't. Look it's spring. They're buds. Yeah. They're birds on the way on the bow. They're live. They're buds on the bow like.

Start time: 213.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We had the weed whackers out to cut down the weeds. It grew all because it was such a rainy winter all winter and then it rained immediately after. So I thought well there you go.  Also from joining us from Hollywood it's Mr. Alex Lindsay of Office Hours. Do you do office hours on the road?

Start time: 231.84
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I usually do but the stuff that I'm doing right now overlaps office hours. So it's an early morning activation. So I'm not on office hours for a couple of days.  Okay. It still goes on. That's the beauty of office hours. It does. It does. It's a big web. So we had I think today we had Nick Jushin from Drexel University talking about Unreal Engine and didn't skip a beat.

Start time: 255.14
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Are you doing a lot of AI stuff on office hours now? Oh yeah. I'm really trying to decide. I can't decide.  We talked a little bit about doing this weekend AI which has a terrible acronym.

Start time: 265.86
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I'm not going to do that. That's all about me. That's kind of how we feel about AI. Wait a minute. That's your initials Andy. What did Indianotgo have to eat this morning?  I didn't think about that. I didn't even think about that. We're looking for AGI coming up next but

Start time: 283.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  They don't realize that really AI is just Andy sitting there typing really fast. It's kind of like that shot from you know where he's just

Start time: 291.38
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Actually Andy could do that I think. He's supervising a large room full of monkeys.  Do the work for him but he provides them guidance. Nice. It's actually improved the smell in the office.

Start time: 303.76
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  We're very happy with what turned up.

Start time: 306.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Apple pulled the emergency alarm. They pulled the thing, the rapid security response for the first time.  Was it yesterday? For macOS and iOS and iPadOS.  This was something. The subscript A. They had mentioned. Yeah, subscript A is weird isn't it?  They had mentioned this last year at WWDC that they had this capability but they'd never done it except for betas.

Start time: 334.34
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I guess you'd had you'd experienced it. Betas and it seems like they were just testing the facility of doing this.  Which is can we push out a security update that isn't wrapped in a full 13.3.2 update.

Start time: 347.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And people who see these updates. I know I do. Oh god.  I'm not going to be able to use my phone for an hour or I'm not going to use my mac for an hour.

Start time: 354.74
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  This was very quick. It's very fast. Yeah, they actually had to do some work to break it up into break the system up into little pieces.  So that they could because the whole you know, it's a whole locked system volume, right?  So they they've done the work of breaking it up into smaller pieces so that they can update a targeted portion of the system volume.  That's cryptographically signed and locked and all of that and they can open that up.  Replace it and that should theoretically mean that the updates are faster and smaller. Let's see. Have they said anything about A1641A?

Start time: 383.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A1641A? No. So we don't know what was in that.

Start time: 388.70
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Something important enough to do it, but that's all we know. Is that really the case? So it's an emergency. It is an emergency.  That's how it's supposed to be used is otherwise they would roll it into 13.3.2 and 16.4.2 and instead it's 13.31A.  Which lets them just get that out faster without I'd imagine also it's not disrupting their  development, you know, whatever bug fixes or improvements or whatever they're working on in 13.3.2  doesn't get necessarily derailed by this because they can push this out faster.

Start time: 418.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Last week on security now, Steve Gibson talked about some zero days  that Pegasus  was taking advantage of on iOS and I you know Pegasus style zero click  exploits. It was my understanding that they'd been patched already.  But maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe  there was something left with these zero days. The kind of thing you'd pull the trigger for.

Start time: 449.80
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I was reading that there was something. I didn't bookmark it for the notes, but there was some sort of news item about how there was a new  Mac malware as a service that had sprung up.  And don't know if that's to address this thing, but who knows.

Start time: 465.76
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Well, some of the... Apple's got a bunch of different facilities now to fight bad software, right? Because they've actually got their own  anti-malware software that runs on your Mac and checks back home with Apple and they update the definitions and they can kill apps  immediately basically. They can kill apps very very quickly. That's not this though.  So this is obviously something that required a change to something that's in one of their sealed  system volumes  somewhere that actually have to make changes to the OS in order to address it.

Start time: 496.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Andrew Cunningham said it's often WebKit related.  Of course, that's WebKit is kind of your interface to the outside world.  So naturally messages in WebKit are where a lot of these exploits happen. I should point out that there was a NSO zero click  two weeks ago  that used HomeKit  and lockdown mode succeeded in preventing it.  Of course, most of us do not run lockdown mode because it is so draconian.  But the people who are presumably the target of these kinds of NSO group attacks  presumably would be...  I don't know. It's just speculation.

Start time: 534.22
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  According to Andrew Cunningham who does great work on this subject at Ars Technica,  in his Ventura review, he actually mentioned these things called cryptexes,  which are the idea that they're not just having a single volume with all your system files in it. They've got  the smaller little micro system volumes that you can update without having to deal with the whole system.  So instead of gigabytes, it's megabytes.  It's much smaller and much faster. It could theoretically not require a reboot, although this one does.  But he said in his Ventura review last summer that  specifically Safari stuff and WebKit stuff was going to be in those cryptexes because  obviously they identified where would we most likely need an emergency security update.

Start time: 574.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The NSO group always targeted messages as well.  So I'm guessing that messages was...  You know, Google did something similar with Android a few years ago  where they moved a lot of stuff in effect in the store.  So they wouldn't even have to do this kind of update.  They would just push it down through the Google Play Store.  It's kind of similar.  The idea is let's break this up into small pieces where we just update this little function.

Start time: 597.38
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Because zero days aren't going to wait for you to release a software update in two weeks.  Yeah.

Start time: 602.02
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And also to make sure that they could push out that update as quickly as possible without having  to wait for like Samsung or OnePlus or AT&T or Verizon to build that into whatever release  they're going to be pushing out to their own phones.

Start time: 613.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't freak out if you haven't got it yet because it is a rolling release.  This is according to Aaron P613 on the Twitter.  We know he's a reliable source. I don't know.  This is the code, I guess.  And so I don't know what that means.  But somehow by looking at that code, you can see the granular ramping logic.  And so it's going to roll out over 48 hours.

Start time: 640.78
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  As logical as it is to have this system for rapid response,  you also don't want to release something that works everybody's systems without having it.  Borks them a little at a time, I find.  Exactly. Well, that's how you do it.  And then if everybody's borked, then you stop the rollout for a while.  And if not, then you keep it going.  It's going to still be more rapid than if we had to wait for 13.3.2 to be released in two weeks.

Start time: 664.26
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I guess the advice is Lisa asked me yesterday,  she said, have you heard about this? I said, no, what?  She said, oh, I got to tell you something.  And after gloating for a little bit, she then said, but I have seen on Twitter some people  saying it's problematic. But I think that I immediately do.  I think the advice would be, even if you're not a Hollywood celebrity living in the hills  with your own private screening room, you probably should update.

Start time: 690.58
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  See, being in the studio means I got to see Alex give you side eye.  Never mind. I said nothing.  Everybody should update. I mean, we always say that anyway, right?  That it's the security issues are real and everybody should update.  And, you know, you might think I'm not a target, but like a zero click  or even even some of the stuff that's click based, like people send junk text to just random people  all the time. And if they have an exploit, it can affect them.

Start time: 723.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's not sending them to you. It's sending them out to 60,000 or 600,000 or 6 million.  A lot of these are just, we're just going to shotgun across every person we have a contact for  and just see who shows up. That's not the case.  We have to be a tiny percentage.

Start time: 738.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Generally though, with NSO group style, zero clicks, because those are so  worth so much money that you're not going to use that.  Because the minute you do a 60,000 person attack, everybody's going to save those.

Start time: 750.54
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  No, no, no, you're definitely not doing that for that.

Start time: 753.86
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It's true, but there's a whole gradient, right? And the idea is that really,  unless you've got a very good reason not to update your software, you should update your  software. And it's not some sort of silly reason of like, oh, well, I just like to be up to date.  You've got a good reason, which is there are security flaws. When they're fixing them,  that means somebody knows about them and they could affect you when you're browsing the web,  when you're getting a message. Yes, it's not the stuff that's been weaponized by  groups like the NSO group, but it's still, I mean, you should do it.

Start time: 779.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The thing that you always have to tell people is it depends on your threat model. But in this case,  if Apple's putting it out to everybody, there's a good reason.

Start time: 786.40
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And they're not adding features. They're not changing.  It was an easy thing to do.  Security fix.

Start time: 790.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, it's been a long time since anything Apple's pushed out has caused  problems. I remember there was one five or six years ago that broke your phone,  but that one hasn't happened recently. And I think maybe that's the point of these rapid  security response updates is that they're so piecemeal that they're not risky.

Start time: 809.24
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I don't know what you all think, but I sometimes think that  iOS 7 and the release of iOS 7 was such a big mistake on Apple's part, not because of anything  in the content, because I would actually argue that skeuomorphism is more bad than good.  And I think iOS 7 actually took the iPhone in a new direction. We can argue about that later.  But here's my point. I can tell you how many regular iPhone users I've talked to  who have stopped updating their devices in general as a policy and have become super  paranoid about it because of that one time that their iPhone updated and it completely  changed the iPhone interface in an upsetting way without any warning.  And like that was a long time ago now. And yet the legacy of that, I still talk to people,  friends and family who used to be like, yeah, I'll update to the latest update. They're now like,  yeah, I don't really want to do that right now. And I'm like, you should do it. I do this to my  mom. I do that to friends in the community. And like, you should do it. But I get like,  everybody still feels burned by some software update that messed up their thing.

Start time: 872.76
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And we're not talking about necessarily jumping from system to system. We're talking about just  running these incremental updates that you should do all the time. There's a lot of good reasons to  not update system to system immediately. Oftentimes you want to, because it's not just Apple at that  point. It's all the third party software, all the third parties that haven't caught up and there's,  you want to look at them and look at their websites and say, are we, we're ready for this or we're not  ready for this. And sometimes they're still not ready for it. But, but I, so that is, you might  want to do slowly, but, but definitely these increments, once you've committed to an operating

Start time: 904.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  system, these incremental updates. You want to know what it's like, just be a Windows

Start time: 909.36
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  user. That's always a lot of fun. It's one of the big reasons that I just don't like,  like I don't like having a lot of Windows machines. Is this like, I had this thing with Oculus. I had  a, you know, I had a, and the problem with Oculus was, is it was like, Windows would update,  Oculus would break. Then I'd have to update Oculus, then Windows would update and Oculus would break.  And it was like every two weeks I had to figure out why Oculus wasn't working. And then finally,  I just was like, okay, I'm just going to wait for Quest. You know, just, yeah.

Start time: 938.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right. So do it and don't worry about it. It seems to be harmless. It's an important thing  for iOS, iPad, OS and Mac OS. Not apparently not watch or a TV. I don't know. I didn't see

Start time: 951.54
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  any updates. I said that would be interesting because those are, those are two apps without

Start time: 957.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  web browsers. Andrew, you have maybe hit upon it. Maybe it was WebKit.  It's, uh, Apple has dropped the lawsuit against, uh, the, uh, executive Gerard Williams, the third,  who was a lead chip architect at Apple and left and founded Nuvia,  which was then bought by, was it ARM that Qualcomm bought Nuvia, Qualcomm. Uh, and Apple, uh, sued  saying, uh, you brought, uh, poached employees for Nuvia, your startup. Um,  app Williams file counter filed his own lawsuit, uh, because say Apple tried to stop me from hiring  people and, and is recruiting from me. It's one of those back and forth. Apple record.

Start time: 1006.44
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Go ahead. It's hard to, it's hard to do poaching or claim poaching in California. Yeah. That's a,

Start time: 1013.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  right. Apple, uh, has requested that the case be dismissed. Uh, doesn't explain why, uh, Williams  had failed to persuade a judge to dismiss Apple's complaint. Maybe Apple and, uh, and Gerard have  come to an agreement. I don't know. Anyway, it's over. So you could, you can holster your weapons,

Start time: 1035.56
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  kids. Yeah, that's a, there's, that's, you can always tell when there's no, it's, it's not a  Samsung sort of lawsuit where there's no hatred. There's no real, there's basically, what are we  hoping to get out of this? And I both sides kind of realized that, okay, we're kind of done here.  Knock it off. It was a knock it off. It was a weird lawsuit. Anyway, it was basically a hackles  raised out to each other to make sure that you're not going to destroy each other. And then at some

Start time: 1059.78
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  point you just put it away. By the way, Alex res wits in our, uh, discord says, nice haircut.  You and I were at the, uh, you know, it's funny because it was, you mentioned last week you were  going to go get your haircut. We have the same, uh, haircutter and, uh, I, I had a haircut the  day before and I said, you know, Alex is coming tomorrow. She said, no, he's not. I said, well,

Start time: 1078.78
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  you better check this. I think he is pink. And I, I had, there's a complicated web thing to sign up  and it's really complicated. And I, and I, and I didn't get to the end of it. So I was really glad  that you did that because then she texted me and I was like, yeah, I'm coming. And, and, and I was  like, oh no, I'm not coming. I don't have the little reminder. And then I got, we sorted it out.

Start time: 1098.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Pet peeve of mine. I don't, every, everybody now has to have a web presence and web booking  and stuff. And they use the worst tools that are just out of date and they don't work very well.  And they spin and they spin and they spin. So frustrating. And then I was in IOT hell over the,  over my weekend trying to set up, I won't name names, but set up devices that were supposed to  pair and didn't pair and, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm still waiting. I have a waiting for that to sell.  I'll name names. I have this thing called a garden with a Y. Do you know about this?  Where you grow, it's a hydroponic thing for your home, where you grow your own vegetables. And for  it's an Instagram fell for Instagram again. And, and it's a hydroponic and it's gets cool. It's  got lights and we've been growing lettuce and the hall and, but it has to pair to your wifi.  Why? Because who knows? Because everything has to pair to your wifi, except it won't now,  which means the lights aren't coming on. And I don't know, my, my, my vegetables are going to die.  And that's just very frustrating. Anyway, so IOT hell, they use the worst, cheapest possible chips  that just don't pair to anything is the problem. And then they blame me. They said, well, you should  restart your router. I said, I have 180 devices on this router, all of which are working fine.

Start time: 1176.78
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I don't think it's the router. You know, you know, I, I did, I did get a hydroponic or something.  My mother-in-law got us a hot, one of those hydroponic things with the light that turns on  and off. I found that putting them in a pot by the window, probably a better, like the sun is  magic. There was a little bit of back and forth. And then I was like, I'm going to try the window.

Start time: 1196.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it got really big, really fast. I might have to move mine to the window. Come to think of it.

Start time: 1201.16
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  We have an arrow garden, which is a similar thing, but not smart in any way. And other than having it  turn off, it's very bright light when we're like watching TV in the evening. Yeah, we made, I had  a salad the other day with lettuce from the arrow garden. But do you have a time lapse of your,

Start time: 1216.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  of your lettuce growing? I don't, I don't. Do you have pictures, right? You know, real time pictures.

Start time: 1222.16
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  See my vegetables. Can you see my vegetables? Wow. The kids move out. When we were gone for three

Start time: 1229.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  weeks, when we were gone for three weeks, our 20 year old was monitoring the house and Lisa says,  you know, the, the app says we need water. So he put a literally a cup of water in it.  The thing takes five gallons. When we got back, it was dry as a bone. There was a little bit of  yellowing. I think I like your idea, Alex. Maybe, I don't know, we could, I guess, plant it outside  and then the rain would water it and the sun would make it grow. Actually, one of the, what I don't  know about you guys, one of my experiences with this stuff and Lisa agrees, it doesn't have as

Start time: 1263.02
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  much flavor as if it grew in dirt. Yeah. Is that the case? I haven't experienced that. Oh, okay.

Start time: 1269.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe I need more flavorful vegetables. Just pretend you're an astronaut. You know, the

Start time: 1283.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This week in gardening, but it's already taken. It's not taken. And I'm, you know what I do now  with this week in Google is I just stuff everything in there that has no other place.  I start doing an AI segment. Just like Google. Perfect. Yeah, it's Google. Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly it. Apple to upgrade its watch operating system with new focus on widgets.  Wait a minute. This is from Mark Gurman. Haven't we been here before?

Start time: 1306.32
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  This was the Glances thing. It's a lot like the first, yeah, but the Glances, I mean, again,  everything in that first generation of watch iOS was experimental. Yeah. But this is the idea here  is that widgets on iOS are actually already written using a system that could probably be just put on  the watch. There's a lot of synergy between what's going on. I like widgets on iOS. I do too. And the  idea of getting more information on the watch screen that's not in an app, being able to sort  of, they said Mark Gurman's report suggests it's going to be a lot like the series watch face where  you'll have some cards that are basically these widgets and you'll be able to scroll through them.  And I think getting things to the watch face easily and not having to go and dig through and  launch an app on your watch, which is a good direction. I mean, who knows about the implementation  here, but I think it's a good direction. I miss that Siri watch face. I kind of liked that.

Start time: 1354.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Still there. I want to get as much stuff on my watch as I can. Yeah. I have to say that that

Start time: 1359.54
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  was one of the most useful parts of the first iteration of watch OS. I like the idea of you  always have like the time in the corner of the screen, no matter what's happening, but sometimes  all I want to see is here, please just keep, I just want to post it. Note that just tells me  here is the names of the people that I'm meeting so I can keep glancing at it while I'm on the subway  and remember how to greet the people. When I'm in a certain mode, I just want this watch to contain  a certain piece of real time information that doesn't like, as Jason says, doesn't require me  to launch an app to get this going. It doesn't require me to set up a complication for this one  watch face for just this one 45 minute period. So I'm very, very excited to see how, if this happens  and they implement it really well, this could be a really, really great move forward. Also, I don't  think I saw it in the show notes, but there was also a rumor that the next edition will also allow  you to have Apple health on iPads, on other devices, on devices other than the iPhone.  If that's true, that might imply that you can actually support an Apple Watch without having,  necessarily owning an iPhone, which would be amazing for me. I've often complained that,  gee, I have an Apple MacBook, I've got an Apple iPad, I've got two Apple iPads. I want to buy  an Apple Watch, but because I don't have an iPhone, I don't get to play with the other kids.  And because if I had the ability to use an actual Apple Watch, despite the fact that I've got an  Android phone, I would be so into that ecosystem immediately. There was also a rumor with watch,

Transcript:  And Apple Watch may work with multiple iPhones and iPads, which is interesting. That's good.

Start time: 1488.66
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  What is that? Why? Well, what Andy said is one example is if you can set it up with an iPad,  which is just literally just put the watch app on the iPad and people do it, because it's really  integrated. The setup is really integrated with iOS and it does a lot of data goes back and forth.  So it might be harder for them to do it with a Mac. They could, but it might be harder. But iPad  OS is sitting right there. And if you're somebody like Andy, who doesn't have an iPhone, but does  have an iPad, that's probably good enough to get by. And they just haven't done it. And I think  step one was letting you set up a kids Apple Watch without kids and seniors. Yeah, exactly.  Where they don't have the iPhone there is somebody is setting it up for them. And the next,  and getting the app store to be independent and all of those sort of things. But one of the things  that's still sitting out there is the fact that as Andy put it, it is essentially a mandatory  iPhone accessory. That's what it is. You can't use it if you don't have an iPhone. And so this  would be a nice step, I think. And some people like, I don't use my iPhone nearly as much as I  use my iPad. So like for me, I'm always frustrated when Apple does things that are  only on the iPhone because sometimes my iPhone isn't around. It's in another room or I'm outside

Start time: 1575.56
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  We'll call that. And it's, you know, I think it's been around long enough now. It's coming up nine  years that it's time for a little bit of a rethink. I think they've learned a lot about  how people use the watch now. And back eight years ago, we might not have been like, what do  you mean de-emphasizing apps? Apps are the lifeblood of all computing platforms. And now we're like,  you know, I use apps on my watch, but like, that's not where I live. I'm living at the top level. And  we've learned a lot and Apple's learned a lot. And so it's time to put some of that into practice.

Start time: 1606.98
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Plus, listen, don't overlook the fact that there's just nothing quite like the Apple Watch  on the Android platform. The closest that you come is the Samsung gear watches, but you can't use  them without signing up for like a hundred different Samsung accounts, which is terrible.  They're big and chunky. They're like diver style watches. They're not like elegant,  nice fashion watches. We've seen how Apple is willing to sell a $30 AirTag or a hundred dollar  AirPods if it means having more money, selling more things to more people. My goodness, the  things that they would, the volume that they would sell to the Android market if the Android  users could actually use an Apple Watch. And like Jason said, not necessarily by creating a watch  app for, for, for Android, but simply by acknowledging that, gee, this is already a pretty  much a standalone product as it is. I believe that we could, we could sign it up onto the network,  onto a wifi network just by itself or worse comes to worse, have a, the same way that you  sign on to a service on Apple TV, where it just simply says, go to this URL,  go on any web browser, type in this code, and then it will communicate through the internet  to this watch over the wifi network and it will set it up for you. Would you, if, let me think

Start time: 1690.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  though, if you didn't have a phone setting up your watch, but an iPad setting up your watch,  how would that work if you, I mean, you're not going to take your iPad with you everywhere.

Start time: 1701.74
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Well, I mean, first off, they have a cellular model that is theoretically working standalone.  And if you're on wifi and on a wifi network, you could theoretically talk to a data store,  whether it's iCloud or even back to your device. One of the, you know, but I do that. I go outside  all the time without my phone and it works fine. You can receive calls. You can place calls.  There are certain apps that won't do it because they really want the iPhone to be there, but there  are also lots where it works fine. Well, and those apps would have to fix themselves. They would. Yes.  They need to learn about what they've done and think about that. Think about what you've done.

Start time: 1736.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep. Speaking of air tags, Apple and Google both have teamed up to work together to prevent lost  item trackers from being used to track people without their permission. This is something that's  been a little bit of an issue for Apple. It's been an issue for tile. Google does not yet sell tags,  right? But there's been a strong rumor for a long time, Andy, you cover Android and your material,  but I guess that they're going to do that. So maybe, maybe this is a sign that Google is

Start time: 1763.20
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  going to announce something at Google IO. Yeah. And it's also, it's just long overdue. This is a  valuable market. This is a device that people want, but there's just no safe way to market this thing.

Start time: 1775.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, if- Apple makes an Android app that works like about half the time and you have to know about

Start time: 1782.44
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  it and you have to have it installed. Yeah. I mean, this is both companies doing things,  particularly Apple, doing something that's very, very responsible. What they're proposing is that  they've already gotten together and proposed a specification that would be platform agnostic.  It would just be a resource that anybody could put into anything. It's a proposed industry  specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location devices for unmarked tracking.  And it basically means that no matter what your alert system is, it will work with any compatible

Start time: 1814.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Samsung, tile, or air tags or whatever Google might announce. And it's built into the OS,  iPhone and Android. And that's kind of what you want. So that if somebody's tracking you,  if some- so just for people who haven't experienced this, I experienced it all the time,  it will pop up a message saying there's an air tag following you around and it's not yours.  You should know about this. Have you guys seen this? Oh yeah. It would be interesting. I read

Start time: 1841.96
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  it. There's a- there are some simultaneous press releases on Google and Apple's new sites and  neither of them answer a certain question about whether or not this common specification on both  platforms would also extend the Find My Network so that now every Android phone is also helping you  locate the Find My devices, which would in itself be pretty darn interesting. Because if I could also  locate a lost phone or a lost Chromebook based on the fact that someone with an iPhone has  recently passed by wherever I left it behind, that would be pretty slick too.

Start time: 1878.32
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  One of the things I'm kind of curious about though is what happens if someone steals something of  yours that has that air tag? You don't necessarily want to turn that off. It's tracking them now  because they stole your bag. Or what do airlines do when they just decide they're going to turn  off people's air tags if they're- like I put all my cases all now have air tags in them. And I'm not  super excited about the ideas of the airline or baggage or whatever deciding to turn off my air  tags. How would they turn it off? You mean find them and take them out? If it says that you're  being tracked. Oh, they would see it. They would see it and then they would- like the airplane,

Start time: 1917.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  put a little iPhone in the airplane. They could see all the air tags in the bay. Well, or the

Start time: 1922.94
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  air tags are all sitting there. They're all sitting in the bay when they go through. And I just, you  know, there's a- so, you know, I definitely see why you don't want to track people, but I think  that what will end up happening is it'll affect a lot more people. We'll see. Because I don't think  that many people are tracking other people with air tags. So I think there's a lot of better ways  to do it. And so I think it's an edge case. And I think when they solve that edge case, the less edge  case is going to be valid reasons why there's a tracker that happens to be going along someone  who took something from you or baggage claim or something else and it gets turned off. You know,  I think that that's going to be a more likely thing to occur than people actually tracking each

Start time: 1970.56
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I bet they do. I don't think you see it. Once it takes off, you don't really know. So far,  my experience has been once it takes off, it doesn't, you know, your phones aren't really  getting anywhere. They're just burning up battery trying to find something. And so every once in a  while you'll see it appear. But overall, I think that, you know, when we're doing...

Start time: 1990.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's mostly when your bags are on the ground that they might want you to know we've sent them on to

Start time: 1996.52
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Philadelphia. Well, like a good example is we gave it to a shipper who's a really good shipper. I'm  not going to name them because we like using them. But, you know, we have an expectation that, you  know, I gave them 10 bags that had, you know, quarter million dollars of hardware in them.  And I expect that to go to a warehouse. And when I looked at the trackers, I saw this little cloud  that was at somebody's house. Oh, that's not what you want. And then it went down and it drops off.  And then that was fine. And then when they picked it up, they went to somebody's house again.  And then they went off, you know, but they obviously had spent the night at a house. Now,  maybe they put it in a garage. But I have to admit the shininess of that company was a little  worn off. You know, because I was expecting it to go to some kind of secure facility.

Start time: 2038.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All the companies now do weird stuff like that. In fact, we had, I saw a UPS van out in the lot  pulled up next to a sedan and the guy was taking packages off the UPS truck and stuffing them into  the sedan, like filling up the back seat. And I thought, should I call the cops on this? And then  it turns out that what they do is they hire these freelance, un-uniformed people to do deliveries.  And that's what's going on. They're taking some offloading them. And maybe that guy decides to

Start time: 2064.02
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  park his Buick in his garage overnight. It was less expensive than Descended by Air. So  I'm sure that they have a different way of doing it. But it was a guy, you know, the guy with his  van. And it's a nice van when it showed up and we filled it up with. Yeah, see, there you go. It was

Start time: 2076.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  just some freelancer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Apple and Google said the features will be completed by the  end of the year and implemented in future versions of iOS and Android. But this is the right direction  anyway. It's kind of nice to see Apple and Google doing something together, hand in hand, arm in arm.

Start time: 2091.58
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko

Start time: 2109.18
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  on board. They didn't develop it together. I mean, I'm looking at the draft specification here.  And it really does seem very thorough about the difference between making sure, basically it  controls like when the tracker should advertise its presence and when it should advertise its  presence. Oh, that's good. They thought about it. Yeah, exactly. So it basically goes from case to  case to case to case between like if someone has activated it saying that, hey, this thing is lost,  please, please broadcast your location versus someone who's trying to track. They know that I  have an air tag inside my bag and so they can track me by tracking my location via that air tracker  or having an air tag that doesn't belong to me that's been slipped into my luggage or slipped  into my car. It does seem to be very, very thorough. And there's a lot of, as you'd expect,  a lot of language about basically making sure that this doesn't screw up people's lives when  they don't want to be bothered by it. It doesn't prevent the feature from working as it's supposed  to work. Also doesn't cause problems for people who want this thing to remain silent. I mean,

Start time: 2176.16
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I definitely think that it'll be interesting to see how things like airlines use it because  not only I, but other people have been able to tell the airline more accurately than it knows  where our bags are. FedEx couldn't find one of my bags and I was like, it's in the LAX FedEx  and the back corner. That probably drives them crazy. I know exactly where that bag is.

Start time: 2199.98
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And I know there's at least one airline that sort of said, don't do it. And it's like, okay.  Lufthansa briefly said that we were going to ban it, but then they realized.  Well, what are you going to do? And the same is true with this, which is what are you going to do?  You're not going to, I mean, everybody, they're going to know that they're being tracked. And I  think a delivery company is going to know that they're being tracked. I think that that's okay.  I would say though, that the two things that are across purposes here do seem to be people who are  trying to prevent thefts and people who are trying to prevent stalking because those are similar  profiles. So that's the tricky part. We just had, it's even in our show list, the mayor of New York  City stood up and said, we're going to put air tags in people's cars and use them to stop car  theft. It's like, okay. You're kidding me. Someone donated 500 air tags available for free to people

Start time: 2252.10
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  to add to their cars. And the police are actually also recommending air tags.  It's a terrible idea.

Start time: 2259.84

Start time: 2275.78
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  A lot of people I know refer to him as mayor that guy now, that guy. It's that guy. But this is,  yeah, this is such a weird thing. But I mean, again, I get the impulse. My son, when he,  started riding his bike to high school, I mounted an air tag in a undisclosed location  in case it got stolen. I totally get it. Even though Apple says this is not for  tracking stolen items, it's for tracking lost items. And I know they say that, but  that is at cross purposes. If they make this really good so that you know immediately that  you're being stalked, it also means that whoever stole your bike knows that they are being tracked  and they can look for the tracker and remove it. And that's just how it is.  You just have to deal with those two things being across purposes. And I think in the end,  trying to protect people will probably win. And I think that's the right call.

Start time: 2326.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the air tags, there's 500 of them. How many people in the Bronx? More than a million.  So 500 of you lucky people will get air tags. NYPD, Eric Adams said, the mayor said, that guy,  will not track the air tags being given away. Instead, when owners realize their car is missing,  they can notify police who will track the stolen vehicle with the owner's permission.  How are you going to do that? I'll give you a log into my Apple account.

Start time: 2357.80

Transcript:  Air tags is a technology that has turned out to not be as revolutionary as we maybe hope that it  might be in a way that, you know, some, some technologies do change the world, but air tags,  I think, maybe not one of them. Isn't there LoJack? There's some,

Start time: 2386.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  there are ways to do this. That's what LoJack did. Yeah. I mean, there are other tools for

Start time: 2390.96
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  stalkers that are much more efficient than this. Yeah. You can buy a GPS for less than an air tag.

Start time: 2395.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For cars. Yeah. The 500 air tags are being provided by the association for a better New York  or ABNY, a nonprofit dedicated to the continuous growth and renewal of New York City's people's  communities and businesses. The mayor urged all car owners to consider air tags for their vehicles.

Start time: 2414.50
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Oh, the things that have been more effective in cities that have decided to do this is to,  you go to, you take the cars that are most likely to be stolen. They know that statistically. You  take it to the locations that are most likely to be stolen. They know what that statistically is.  And you start baiting it. You know, you start dropping bait and you have GPS LoJack's,  and then you don't do anything with it. You let it, you let it roam around. You let people  steal it. You let them take them. You let them, you know, and what you do is you start building up a,  you know, profile of the entire network and then you take down the entire network.  Right. That's how, that's how that, that's the way.

Start time: 2443.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it's not individuals stealing cars in a professional way.

Start time: 2445.52
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's just chop shops. No, it's a network. And so you see, you know, and if you, you know,  depending on what, how much data you have, you can attach their phone position to the,  to the tracker. Then you follow as soon as, as soon as the phone is going the same direction as  the car, as the tracker, after it's been stolen, every phone that drives along in that thing  becomes part of that net, you know, that, that, that they, that they pull in. And at that point  they're able to, you know, when you're wondering why they want all that metadata,  like it's because, you know, you start taking all that information and that information is not  the metadata that NSA gets. That's just, that's just an antenna and metadata. And, and so once  you have all of that, that information, you can build a very complex web and, but they,  they're choosing, you know, a lot of times they're choosing not to do that for a variety of reasons,  but, but that is the, that's what can be done. And that's how there are certain cities that have  gotten rid of a lot of theft by letting it just run for six months, figuring out who is who,  and then just arresting it. Yeah. That's the better way to do it. Yeah.

Start time: 2505.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I watched the wire. I know you got to roll up those networks. You got to roll them up. Apparently  this is in response to the tick tock trend of stealing Kia's Hyundai's because they're fairly  easy to steal. And of course Kia has responded by adding software updates and, and lockout features

Start time: 2526.44
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  and things like that. So maybe it's a problem. I see now I, I use air tags in my cars mostly  to get back to why Apple, I know why you do it because you lost your car.  He had find my car. I get back and I go where, cause I haven't traveled enough. That little  part of my brain isn't working. I'm like, I don't remember whether I was on level three or level  four. And so I know why you do it, but actually I have no car that anyone would want to steal.

And  if it, well, it, I mean, I thought it was a pro tip 15 years ago and we're still here. So I guess  it's still a pro tip. It hasn't retired yet. And then the other thing is if you've got a rental  car, take a picture of the license plate so you can identify it. So you know which car is yours.  Yeah, that's a great idea.

Transcript:  It gets bad. I have no regrets. Yeah. No regrets. Uh, with WWDC, it cannot come soon enough. Then  we will have much grist for the mill. Indeed. In fact, it might be worth $3,000 to buy that thing  so that we could just talk about it for the next six months. Yeah. But you're not going to be able  to buy it until the end of the year. Let's take a break. Our show today brought to you by a new  sponsor. We want to welcome them and just in the nick of time, Delete Me. Delete Me. Have you,  I mean, good Lord, but with data brokers scooping up every bit of information about you, have you,  you know, ever searched for your name online and, and noticed all the, they call it PI,  personal information that's available, including, you know, things like your home address,  your phone number, kind of a, kind of creepy and scary. It says 2010, Delete Me has been on a  mission to empower individuals and organizations, allowing them to reclaim their privacy and help  them remove personal data from online sources. You know, you could do it one by one, but the  problem is there's so many of them and you don't know about all of them. And so Delete Me is great.  They have a whole team dedicated by, and driven by a passion for privacy and commitment to make  it easy for you. So you reduce the risk of identity theft, credit card fraud. It will reduce your spam,  your robocalls, harassment, generally just all kinds of unwanted communications. Delete Me is  the most trusted privacy solution available. Thousands of customers have used it to remove  personal information online. The average person has more than 2000 pieces of data about them online.  Delete Me can find it and remove it. And as I said, yeah, you can do it yourself. I mean,  no way, nobody got time for that. Delete Me has now up to date, to date, removed more than 50 million  pieces of data for their customers. One customer said, I signed up. They took it from their awesome  service already seeing results. So here's what, here's how it works. You're going to sign up,  you're going to give them some basic personal information because they need to know what they're  looking for. And they will then go out to get this number, 580 different data brokers. Can you believe  that 580? And I bet you it's 581 by the time I say that sentence. They'll just, they'll go out,  they'll find it, they'll remove your personal information. Just go to joindeleteeme.com slash  twit. Once the removal process starts, you're going to get a report within a week, seven days,  a detailed report of what they've done. So you know if you're, you know, it's working, but here's  the key because there's always new ones coming up. It's going to continue to scan and remove your  personal information every three months, every quarter they go out, get rid of that stuff. It's  automated removal. They also opt out monitoring. They'll ensure records don't get repopulated  after being removed. The law requires a lot of these guys to say, you know, I have a form,  if you can find it on the webpage where you say, I don't want you to, you know, stop it,  delete me and do that all for you. They know exactly where to go and how to do it.  That's names, that's addresses, it's photos, it's emails, it's relatives names, it's phone numbers,  social media, your property value. PC Magazine gave them an excellent rating.  This is the one that really works is the data broker industry just takes over and changes and  expands. They continue to add new sites and features because they want to make their service,  Delete Me service, both simple to use and effective in removing personally identifiable  information, PII. And since privacy exposures and incidents affect everybody differently,  they've got privacy advisors who can help you. They can give you the support you need  to know what's bad, what's good, what to worry about. I think it's a good service and I think  you want to check it out.

Ironically, at the same time as  their employees are about to unionize. I don't know if there's something going on there. The  very first Apple store was outside Washington DC, Towson's center, Tyson's center. Yeah, Tyson.  There's a Towson's Maryland, but this is Tyson's Virginia. It's actually technically McLean.  Towson is where the union station is. Oh, okay. So I'm sorry. I apologize. Tyson's corner. Tyson's  center. We don't know if they're going to unionize or not. That's Towson. That's my confusion.  Tyson and Towson. Thank you for clearing that up. Apparently both, Apple opened two stores in May  of 2001, 22 years ago. Hard to believe. Can you believe that? One was in Glendale, but because  the Virginia site is on the East Coast, it counts as the first. Yeah, this was a long

Admit it as much  in saying, I don't know, they've probably done that before. I've been saying this is store number

Transcript:  interesting. I actually visited, I was in the area on business and of course, of all the things to  visit like in Maryland and near DC, it's like, oh, I want to see Apple store number one. And it's very,  very nice, but it's not terrible as it was. It wasn't terribly well lit. It was definitely like  very old school. So I can imagine them putting like a lot more lighting in there, giving it the  modern touch. I was trying to look at those pictures though. I was trying to figure out,  I've never seen that version of the Apple logo with the six colors vertically striped  in three, as a 3D sweep before. Has anybody else seen one? Huh? Huh? Nope.

Start time: 3234.18
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but I'm not sure in that one. You can go to the departmentmap.store slash time machine and download  all of the historic pictures of the original Apple stores, May 19th, 2001, 22 years ago,  that store opened. You know, before that people probably forgot that you would go to a Best Buy  and there'd be an Apple corner, a fly spec to neglected Apple corner where some poor  Apple employee had to stand and wait for people to come over. And Apple was quite wise. They said,  if we're going to succeed in a windows world, we're going to have to have our own stores where we

Start time: 3276.62
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  can really position our products. And it worked. They weren't competing on commission. So as a  result, the people who work at those stores weren't really incentivized to even keep not only not  incentivized to sell Macs, but also just to keep the display models running. They would just simply  be dead screens. So yeah, this is, they did such an amazing job of turning each of these Apple stores  into an embassy of the Apple faithful and basically giving you turning one of Apple's biggest  problems, meaning where do you go to get these things serviced? Where do you go to actually  find one of these things for sale and working to one of the biggest advantages that well,  if it breaks or if you have any problems with it, or if you need instruction on how to use iMovie,  you go to your mall, which is probably for most people in the country and in this country, at

Transcript:  least about a 20 minute drive away. It's, it's been really powerful when you look at what Apple  does with the, with their stores, you know, whether it's the classes, you know, basic instruction,  you know, tech support as well as selling things. So there's a lot of  flow. And I think a lot of other companies like Microsoft have had a hard time reproducing that  of having something there that, that, you know, they've tried and they just, it's just very hard  to get that magic just right. But you, you know, I often wander into Apple stores for no reason.  I'm just going to wander in, I'm going to play with a couple of things I don't own,  and then I'm going to wander out again. But when you look at the, my kids go for the classes,  the classes are unbelievable. Like these aren't like little, like we made up a little class  locally. It's like, here's how to do video. And you're going to watch a video of Zach King do  something. And then someone who's been trained to teach you how to do the thing that Zach King did  is now going to walk through it with you. And it's been, you know, obviously they've done it a  thousand times and they probably practiced it a hundred times before they were allowed to do it  in public. And so there's all these things that, you know, just really, really well,  Apple-esque designed pieces that keep people bringing it, coming in. And, and I think that  they've been great. I kind of miss the theaters. A lot of the, there were theaters in a lot of them  that when they got remodeled, they took a lot of the theaters out. We, we did a Mac break, I think,  or a twit in the theater in San Francisco. We did. And I got all sweaty. I have memories of that. I

Start time: 3407.76
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3418.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  in the theater. It was really fun. It was great. Cause the Apple, the old San Francisco store was  literally across the block from our office. Right. And so you were friends with Travis, the manager,  Yeah. I spoke, I spoke, well, cause I spoke over there like once a month. It's like, you know,  it'd be like, Oh, it's time to walk over, walk across. And I remember sitting in her, but Buena

I think the, yeah, it was someone else.  Some guy. I don't know. But it was, it was another person over there that was able to hold it.

Start time: 3459.04

Start time: 3464.78
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  who does a sub stack all about Apple retail called tabletops. Oh, Michael Steber.substack.com.  And he, I think he's the one who first noticed the Tyson's corner thing with the, with the, yeah,  it's like little apple slices, Andy, like little, little apple slices in the six apple. Oh, it is

Start time: 3482.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  weird. Yeah. That's on the, that's actually on the thing that we were just describing, which is  blocking off view on the wall, what they're going to do. But Michael is the one who he did.

Start time: 3491.28
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  You probably remember he did those, those sort of 3d walkthroughs where you could see sort of  original apple stores and actually read the things on the shelves and all of that. And he's really  proven to be a historian of apple store lore on top of everything else. It's just, I think it's  one of the great things about the internet that you find people who are super into a topic and,  and can take it on. And it's rare to have them take it on and do it as well as Michael Steber

Start time: 3522.20
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You know, apple's gotten in the last five years, apple's gotten a lot more creative about what they  do with their logo. For a long time, it was like the logo is the logo, but even some of the pre  shows that you've seen in keynotes where the logo is constantly changing shape and color and  everything else, they've, they've definitely kind of played with, been a lot more playful with their  brand than they have in the past. At their Brooklyn event where they, which was 2018,

Start time: 3546.36
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think when they did the, the iPad pro and the MacBook, one MacBook there. Anyway,  they handed out to everybody who attended stickers and they were all different, but they were all  stickers designed by, I don't even know. I think they said who and they're all the apple logo,  but with different designs on the logo. And I thought that is, I mean, first off, what a move  to do that and to have a confidence that your logo can have anything on it as long as it's  shaped properly. That they, not only can you put that out publicly and say, yes, this sticker is  not a knockoff. Apple made these stickers and handed them out to members of the media with their  logo, with this weird design on it. They came from some artists somewhere because they can,  they just are not worried. They know it all means apple and that's the power of that silhouette.  And also the confidence apple has with their branding.

Start time: 3597.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This actually started with MTV back in the eighties when MTV got their logo designed.  They got, they saw a bunch of different prototypes for it and they, they told the design shop,  Hey, you know what, let's use them all. And that actually became a signature element of MTV was,  you know, they would have all sorts of artists and animations and animate these and do all sorts of  crazy things with the logo. That was a brilliant move. And I think Bravo to apple because you  know, apple's so brand conscious and so protective of their brand. I'm sure their inclination is,  Oh, don't mess with the, the apple. Most companies, most large companies,  that's their inclination. Sure. They have, why mess with it? Right. And you, and yeah, and

Start time: 3640.54
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think apple has raised it, right. They're, they're like so far above the bar now that they  can, they're like, yeah, we'll do whatever, as long as it's the shape, right. Everybody will get it.  Everybody knows it. Right. And then, and then creativity is part of apple's brand. So having  it be, I mean, step one for Steve jobs was to take the rainbow away, but then remember they were  individual colors for a while that you could get even on people's business cards. People choose  which color they wanted. And, and now they are really leaning into just playing around with it  and not being afraid of the rainbow too, which is somebody who named his site after the six color  apple rainbow. I love that they keep bringing it back in playful ways. Yeah. You should really be  the expert, the keeper of this. I need to start a sub stack all about the apple rainbow. Yeah.  Well, follow, ask Michael, six colors.com. It'll be fun. Maybe, you know, you know,

Let's, let's plug it  again. Michael Stieber.substack.com. A lot of good stuff there. If you, if you're for some reason  fascinated by apple stores, this is, this is the site for you. I mean, really? Yeah. Holy cow.

Start time: 3719.74
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It is, by the way, it is, that's is the apple store in Townsend, Maryland that voted to unionize.  And there's a, there's an article in a local Baltimore paper about how the union is now saying  that apple's dragging its feet in negotiations, that they're not really, they, they, they, they,  they're accusing apple of not negotiating a good faith for union contract.

Start time: 3738.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3746.24
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Starbucks has been fighting it too. Yeah. But this, this is a different thing. They actually,  they actually voted to unionize. And so, which means that they, that the apple and the union now  have a better, a year to work out a union contract for its workers. And if that, those negotiations  fail, then a judge steps in to lead the negotiations. But they're basically the union is,  is now saying that contract talks with apple have been quote, very, very slow.

Transcript:  They voted in June. Ask the writers guild of America what to do about that. They've, they've,  they've gone at it and strike. And are you, Alex, are there, are there pickets around the,  the house now, or is it? Oh, no pickets. No pickets. You know, there's no picket. Yeah. All  the late night show. This, this happened in 2007, didn't it? There was a long writer's strike. All  the late night shows had to shut down. It was actually, we can credit the birth of reality TV  to the last writer guilds. It was the, it was the growth. Not the last one. 1981, 1985, 1988,

Start time: 3811.34
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  and 2007. Yeah. And, and, and really what happened was is that the, at least when we were paying  attention to that during the last writer's strike is that if it goes on for a long time,  you know, at the beginning, it creates a lot of disruption. If it goes on for a long time, then,  then content creators or the producers start to find other solutions. And so, you know, going in,  it happened to be that what was available was unscripted content. And so they were able to,  that ramped up and that, you know, changed the industry pretty dramatically, you know, you know,  and, and so it was, and so we'll see what happens if this one takes a long time to get to  there. There's probably going to be new, new business opportunities for people to build,

Start time: 3850.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  build other things that are non-scripted. Yeah. And AI is one of the issues, the way  the writer's room is being treated as another one of the issues. And of course, I'm always

Start time: 3861.82
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It's streaming dynamic is number one, right? The way that compensation was defined for writing  for television and film was all about, yeah, it was all about traditional output, right? It was  all about network TV shows or, or a Saturday morning kids cartoon show or a cable TV show.  And with streaming the money, all the streamers are terrified and they're cutting their budgets  and all that. But the fact is they're very profitable. They're extremely profitable.  And they've, they've slashed how many episodes are in a season. It's dramatically impacted  the work of the writer. And the writers guild is basically saying, we need a contract that takes  into account the success of streaming. And right now you've been getting away with not paying us  and not staffing the writers rooms and treating us like day laborers when we in fact need to be  on a contract and we need to be there for a whole season instead of just the days we show up in the  room. And all of this is, I mean, it's, this is going to be, I think it's going to be a really  bad one because I think the writers have basically said, you've gotten away with profiting on some  technological changes in our industry and that needs to stop because we need to be cut in.  And the, the producers are going to say, well, no, we would like to make lots of money.  We want to continue doing that. And, you know, I think it's going to be ugly.

Start time: 3942.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Apple is one of the people, the signatories that is being picketed.  Yep.  Apple TV.

Start time: 3951.76
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Sometimes in these cases, you wind up having outliers, Apple and Amazon, I would watch them  because Apple, sometimes what ends up happening is the companies that do not have the complete  vested interest. Like if you're a studio are the ones who cut deals with different terms with the,  with the guild. And it ends up being a one, it can be a, a, a method of, like a strategy, which is  these guys will become the model and they'll say yes, Apple and Amazon will say yes.  And then we really have more leverage with all the other, all the other studios. I'm not saying  that'll happen here, but it's possible. It will because Apple and Amazon just don't have the  market dynamics that HBO and Netflix have because they're, they're not a solely an entertainment  company. They've got all sorts of other revenue sources. They're playing a different game.

Start time: 3999.58
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Remember this, what happened with Letterman on 2007 where the show was dark for a while.  And then his show reached a separate agreement with the WGA. So they can go back.  That's the perfect parallel. Right.  And so, yeah. And so if Apple simply says, you know what, we don't, we don't really care about,  we're not part of those guys like, Hey, WGA, why don't we hammer out an agreement just between you  and us? And that becomes a way that Apple gets back into the schedule. Like it becomes a way.  And that becomes a model for, Hey, look, Apple, Apple as a group of producers seems to be okay  with it. And like Jason said, it's, it's the problem here is that the traditional model has  always been like the way the televisions have been for decades before streaming, where your,  the writers and the producers and the show creators are accepting less money because they  know that the payoff could be, Hey, look, we get to a hundred episodes. This goes into syndication.  It winds up being sold all over the world to different markets. And this becomes something  that we make money on for, for a decade or two to come with streaming. It's no, we,  we, we, we get, see, we get, we get paid peanuts. And then this does not go into syndication.  This basically becomes part of the Amazon library or becomes part of the, of the, of the Netflix  streaming library. This doesn't become continually more valuable as it keeps getting sold to  different and different markets. So they're basically, that's why they're saying that, Hey,  look, this whole model has to change. And then, and AI is going to be a big deal as well. Just the  idea of there's already, there's already some talk about how they need to have a discussion about  whether or not networks are able to basically use a chat, you know, chat bots to create or  basically enhance, exist to replace people on the writing staff. And it's, I think Jason's right.

Transcript:  I think this could be super, super ugly. Adam Conover, who was in the WGA, Adam Ruins Everything  was one of his shows, posted the offers and the counter offers in the AI, the WGA, the Writers  Guild proposed to regulate use of artificial intelligence on MBA covered projects. AI cannot  write or rewrite literary material, can't be used as source material. And MBA covered material can't  be used to train AI, which is interesting, to which the AMPTP, which is negotiating on behalf of the  producers, said, what about an annual meeting to discuss advancements in technology? How would you  feel about that? Adam says, an insulting counter just dripping with contempt. We can talk about it

Start time: 4149.86

Start time: 4161.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, what they just described here, that would be terrifying. Also imagine things like, oh, we

Start time: 4165.16

Start time: 4169.48
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  a score. And you could definitely see, I mean, I did, I was, my daughter had asked about the  theory of special relativity. And I said, I told chat GPT, I said, explain special relativity as if  I was Richard Feynman talking to an 11 year old. And it started off with, okay, kiddo.  It immediately leaned into it. And I was like, wow. And I, as someone who read lectures on,  on physics, when I was a kid, it, when it described it, it was, it sounded like it was the voice of  Richard Feynman, like it was written in that voice. And so I could see how, when you're writing  something, you could say, well, this is what I want to say, but rewrite that all in the voice of JFK  or in the voice of this gangster. And it would just kind of refine that into a, into something.  And I do, I can see why producers would resist that because there's an opportunity there to  possibly do things that are, you know, that, that a lot, cause there's a lot of times when you're  watching a TV show and I'm like, they spent a lot of money, you know, on this TV show and the  writing sometimes, sometimes it's great, but not all the time. Like a lot of times the, the,  the dialogue is like, no one in that business would ever say that in that way, you know? And,  and so you're like, and it's a writer that's writing outside of their core competency. They,  they don't know what, how people would talk that way and they didn't have time to go through that.  And so I think that there is, you know, so I think that there's a, there are places where it  could make a difference. If we, if we, it's one thing, it's, it's one thing to figure out what it  should start to look like, but saying that we can't use it ever for, you know, anything that's there  doesn't necessarily make a better product.

Thank you, ScooterX, that that's a common mistake to assume that the last writer  strike started reality TV. She points out the apprentice is older than the writer's strike 2004.

And the fact is that it's an entertainment is a mix of stuff,  but I've always admired. I remember back Andy will remember this too, back in what 87,  88 when they did the writer's strike and David Letterman and Johnny Carson both came back on  the air and they wrote their own jokes. And the whole point was not to undermine the writers.  The point was to show how they were without professional writers. And they did Hal Gurney's  network time killers, which is a wonderful, again, sewing. We could have written material here,  but instead our director is going to do stupid things. And they were funny and brilliant,  but it was satire because they were basically saying, look what life is like without professional  writers. So let's not fool ourselves. You can't, AI is not going to do it. Reality shows aren't  going to do it. They will do some things, but you need the professionals. They're the ones who make,  they are the ones who write the words and come up with the scenarios for the TV shows you love.  And again, and they should get paid. I think the letterman, the letterman show.

Transcript:  The danger is like you have a, you have a show like the Simpsons, which is in 34 seasons. That  means that you have 34 seasons worth of scripts of, of Homer Simpson dialogue, Bart Simpson dialogue,  Bart Simpson dialogue. Once you basically fine tune, fine tune a chat model for here is,  here is exactly how Homer Simpson talks. Exactly. It's, it's, it's just like,  any conversation you have with, with chat GPT is not something that you would put right into  production and you, it's, but it is a, you could get to a first draft really, really quickly.  And so you get from having, hiring a writer's room of like eight or nine people to chat,  basically one head writer comes up with 10 springboards, chat GPT gives you a rough outline,  then it's assigned to one of four people, you know,

Transcript:  that's one of the specific things that the WGA is negotiating is the, is using our writing as  training for a chat. And boy, when you say it that way, you're absolutely right. That's,  that's not a good use of that. Yeah. Well, we'll watch with interest. And you're right, Apple may,  maybe Apple will make a deal. ScooterX also sent me a link, which I wish I had been able to go  down and see this. Apple apparently does candlelight performances in the Apple store.  That is the old movie theater down in LA. This one was April 30th sold out. And it looks beautiful.  They put the, I mean, they've done a tribute to cold play is candlelight performances are gorgeous  and they put candles all around the, the performers. They did the four seasons.  They did a little Mozart on a client and knocked music. They did some Eleanor Rigby,  a little Bohemian Rhapsody, a box cello suite. Number one, the theme from the game of Thrones,  the theme from inception, the theme from back to the future. Destiny's child, say my name,  anti hero by Taylor Swift. And then about time from Lizzo. I don't know how it changed. I guess  it's a chamber chamber music group. I don't know how that would sound, but it might be cool.  And then they close with a swan lake. It's the orchid quartet, man. I would have loved to have  seen that and good for Apple for, for doing that. That was to celebrate release of classical Apple

One of the things I really appreciate about what Apple does with its higher end stores  is that it takes these public spaces like these huge banks and these huge like museums, these huge  theaters. Those would be landmarks in any neighborhood or any city that would ordinarily  be turned, that would be turned into condos or office spaces or torn down for one or the other.  And they're preserving it as a public space. It's an Apple store, but it's still a place  where anybody can come in and enjoy this space. This is the tower, the tower theater store. And

Apple Pay was down briefly, in fact, all Apple services  from Apple cash to Apple card down briefly on, let's see, a couple of days ago on Wednesday.

Yeah. They found, he found blank slips. It was all the news. He saw blank slips  from an ATM or an ATM in the truck, in the truck, in the behind the seat, they like shoved them back.  I guess a couple of them had gotten out and he was, he just called the police. He was like,  dopes. My friend's borrowed my truck. It's dented, it's dented and there's blank.  What dopes?

Transcript:  Yeah. I think that Apple, what they're doing really well is they're mixing ease of use and  interface with a reasonable interest rate. And I think that the other folks that are doing this,  there are people with higher interest rates, but they don't have the ease of use. And then almost  no, almost nobody has the same ease of use. And then, and so then they're competing only for  percentages. And I don't think they're getting, you know, you know, it's, it's a good percentage.  It's not the best percentage, but you'd really have to.

And yeah, convenience, although I did see somebody probably working for a big bank, but  let's say, well, it's way too easy to get the money out of the savings account. It's way too  easy to spend it. You know, you should put it somewhere where you can't access it so easily.  Like our bank.  Yeah, exactly.  It's just too convenient.

You have to have an apple cart.  An apple cart. Apple cart holder.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And even then I have an apple cart. I had one for a long time, but even then I had to  kind of apply, but it was, it was pretty quick. I mean, I did it in one session. The nice thing is  for apple and I guess for me too, because I get daily apple cash from my purchases every day,  a couple of bucks going in there. It makes me want to buy more stuff.  Now, you know, when I get my bagel once a week, I buy it with an apple car. When we go to the  grocery store, I say, honey, I'll buy the groceries and I buy it with my apple watch.  It's convenient for me. A little bit of money goes into that savings accounts, but that's kind of,  that's, that's smart on Apple's part. That really makes the apple watch and the apple phone very  powerful.

Start time: 4842.96
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. I was, go ahead, Andy.  I think that, you know, one of the things I was really thinking about related to apple and also  just related to a lot of other businesses is a lot of businesses, you get into conversations of how  do we get the consumer to do X, Y, and Z. Like their whole thing is like, how do we funnel them  in and get them to do what we want them to do? And I think apple spends more time thinking about  how do we surprise and delight them, you know, and knowing that that will lead to things in the  future that are better. And I think that it's just a different mindset. And I think there's,  Apple's not the only company that does that, but I think the companies that think about how do we  make this a great experience as opposed to how do we get, how do we extract what we want out of the  consumer? I think those are two different mindsets and they both can yield the same thing, but a lot  of times I think that the first mindset is a lot more effective.

Start time: 4898.80

Transcript:  The Forbes article points out that of course the savings account is through Goldman Sachs,  which is Apple's partner in the apple cart as well. And Goldman Sachs has its own high  yield savings account under its consumer brand, Marcus, but it's only 3.9%.  So now Goldman remember was complaining that they lost a billion dollars with the apple  card and all that stuff. They might, maybe they're happy, a little happier now with that  billion dollars coming back into their fold. By the end of the launch week, 240,000 accounts had  been opened, one source added. That's 240,000 new customers for Goldman, really, if you think about

They're very like, there's like, how do we, like I just got, I got this,  this package the other day. It was repackaged as a product. It's chlorine from my pool,  same company, new brand. And it's just a little harder to open. Like it's just a little harder  to open. And I know what they did. They found a cheaper way to make that bottle. Like, you know,  they rebranded it either way. And I was like, they just, that's not, that's not, they didn't  look at like, how do we make it better? We, they figured out how do we save literally probably  a quarter of a penny on that, on that thing. And the funny thing is, is that I don't even  know how much that chlorine costs. I literally don't know if they just charged more and added,  add the top work better. But I, you know, and I, you see that all the time with companies that  they're, they're figuring it like, let's figure out how to shave a quarter cent off or let's figure  out how to, and I, and I think that they think that that's the best way to run their business.  And I think that a lot of times they're wrong. And I think that people will pay more if it's just great.

Transcript:  we will talk about Apple's struggles with AI, according to Wayne Ma, writing for the  information. Apple maybe not as well positioned as we might have thought. But first a word  from our sponsor. When you see the studio, when you see our shows, you probably noticed  we are in the Twitter Eastside Studios brought to you by ACI Learning. You might say, well,  who's ACI Learning when they're at home? Well, you I'm sure know the name IT Pro. IT Pro TV was  with us since their very inception. Last year, ACI Learning and IT Pro merged to form a new group  that can give you the IT training you've been looking for to level up your career or to level  up your organization. IT Pro now part of ACI Learning. With IT Pro, ACI Learning expands its  reach, adds those great studios in Gainesville. You just saw that it can produce new content  every day, all day. They do the seven days, five days a week. They're doing it Monday through Friday.  So you can get the content, fresh content you need to advance your IT career at any stage of  your development. For example, one of the most widely recognized beginner certs, the one a lot  of people start with, the A plus cert from CompTIA. CompTIA courses with IT Pro from ACI Learning make  it easy to go from daydreaming about a career in IT to launching it. Earning certs opens the door  and is in fact a requirement of many entry-level IT positions. Supplies potential promotions if  you're already in the IT field and you want to get a better job or get promoted. And the thing  that's important to understand is not just the knowledge because the cert shows you have the  knowledge, but it's also you had the gumption. You went and you studied and you learned and you took  the test and you advanced yourself. And I think employers are very impressed by those certs. They  really are. Tech is one industry where opportunities outpace growth, especially cybersecurity.  There's a lot of demand for talent and there are not enough people to fill those jobs.  And about a third of information security jobs actually require a cybersecurity cert. In fact,  23% of all IT jobs require a cert. While organizations are hungry for cybersecurity  talent, that cyber skills gap is growing and that's why pay is also growing. If you're tired of being  in the writer's guild, maybe you should consider becoming a cybersecurity specialist. Average  salary, $116,000. ACI Learning's information security analyst and cybersecurity specialist  programs can get you that cert. Those certs, the certs you need, ACI Learning offers multiple  cybersecurity training programs to prepare you to enter or if you're already in advance,  CISSP, there's the Certified Ethical Hacker certs, Certified Network Defender, Cybersecurity Audit  school, audit is very important these days for compliance and cybersecurity frameworks.  Those are among the most popular cybersecurity certs, but they've got them all. Here's what you  got to do. You've got to explore everything ACI Learning offers because it is expanded now,  including IT Pro, but also Audit Pro. Practice Labs have expanded. They've got learning hubs  too for people who want to learn in person and of course their partnership program. If you've got  a team that you want to upskill for teams from two to a thousand, volume discounts start at five seats  and there's even a free two-week trial for training for your team. That's enough time to take a whole  course and get some sense of what this could do for you. All of IT Pro ACI Learning's courses are  chunked up into 20 to 30 minutes, so it's easy to take during a break, during a lunch hour.  It's easy to assign and one of the team platform lets you do this. Assign just an individual  episode of a course. Every one of these episodes has a full transcript. A lot of people like to  read along. There's different kinds of learnings. People like to watch. Some people like to get  hands-on. Those practice labs help. Some people like to learn in person and thanks to ACI Learning,  now we've got them all. This Thursday, not this Thursday, I guess it's a couple of weeks  off. Thursday, May 18th. Yeah, that's two weeks away. 2 p.m. Eastern. The All Things Cyber Security  webinar. Special guest Naomi Buchwalter. She's the Director of Product Security for Contrast  Security and the founder and executive director of the Cybersecurity Gatebreakers Foundation.  Particularly of interest if you're a woman you want to get into cybersecurity. Naomi's got a lot  of great advice and a lot of information. You'll learn how it takes to be a security architect.  Guys too, of course. Tips for advancing your cybersecurity career and how to bridge the  knowledge gap in cybersecurity. That's free. If you can't be there in person, it's nice to be  there in person Thursday, May 18th, 2 p.m. Eastern because then you can ask questions but they'll  make it available for watching later so you can watch it later too.

Wayne Mahou is pretty well connected. I think he does a good job. He works  for the information. One of the reasons I spend a lot of money for an information account. Late last  year he writes, a trio of engineers who helped Apple modernize as search technology began working  on a large language model, the type of technology underlying chat GPT. For Apple, there was only one  problem. The engineers no longer worked there. They left the company to work on the technology at Google.  Oops. Srinivasan Venkachari, Steven Baker, Anand Shukla left Apple last fall because they thought,  well, if we're going to work on large language models, Google is the place to be.  Oh yikes. Google actually won them so badly. Wayne says that Sundar Pichai personally wooed them.  But then again, Tim Cook tried to persuade them to stay. Must be nice.

Start time: 5627.68

Transcript:  from the horses. Oh yeah. No, and they're not going to be able to get it from the horses.

Start time: 5645.88
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  This is good stuff. My initial reaction to the story was, I totally understand why those guys  would do that because I feel like Apple, the story here is this push and pull between wanting to be  out on the cutting edge and wanting to be seen as being out on the cutting edge and Apple basically  keeping everything inside the black box until they announced something. And when you look at all the  missteps out there with AI stuff, where it's been an embarrassment for whoever launches whatever  model. In fact, the brilliant thing about inventing open AI is that Microsoft can fund it,  but it's not Microsoft who's chat bot is saying terrible things this time. Previously it was,  this time it's not. And so if I was somebody working on this stuff inside Apple and was really  excited and got told at every turn, well, we can't make it public. We can't do that. Your work can't  be public because it's going to make things up and people want Siri to not make things up.  I would think about going to Google, right? I would, I totally understand.

Start time: 5701.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's also the check and, and maybe Google was willing to write a larger check. I mean,  these guys, I've heard stories they're making more than a million a year. These guys are  hot. Oh, sure. Hot commodity. Of course, remember Apple did hire John G. Andrea away from Google.  He is the guy and he's still there. But Wayne writes, according to interviews with more than  three dozen, Wayne's been busy, three dozen former Apple employees who worked  in its AI and machine learning groups, organizational dysfunction and a lack of  ambition have bogged down those efforts, including the work of the group responsible for Siri.  At one point, when they were working on the mixed reality headset,  Mike Rockwell expressed disappointment in the demonstrations that this is again, Wayne's reporting  the Siri team created a showcase, the voice assistant working with the headset  and even considered maybe we should write our own voice commands. Oh, that's,

Start time: 5761.40
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  yep. Oh, ow. You can see it, right? I mean, I totally can see it.

Start time: 5765.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He does say the headset team ultimately ditched that idea.  And Wayne does point out Apple is still the most valuable company in the world.

Start time: 5774.18
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And I'll say, I mean, I think there's a lot of good points and discussion here,  but I will point out that as he points out, his sources, people who left, those are people who  were probably not happy being at Apple and chose to go elsewhere. His sources aren't the people who  stayed at Apple and are working on this stuff now. So just take it with a grain of salt.  But the people who stayed are never going to talk.  Well, no, I mean, you can't get those people to talk. I get that. But I'm just saying.

Start time: 5800.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the people who left left for a reason. And this is what they're saying.

Start time: 5802.84
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And this is what they're saying. That's right. But you're only getting the people who left. And I  think that, you know, I think it's always worth asking yourself, why are these people talking?  And in this case, I think it's because they were frustrated and they quit.  Or they're frustrated by the way it's structured. Or as we said earlier, frustrated by the fact that  Apple keeps everything in a big box, a big black box, and nobody can look at it. Nobody can know  what you're working on. And every one of their colleagues who's out at Open AI or at Google,  wherever they are, they are shipping stuff and it's really a hot category. And then you're working  at Apple and not only are they telling you sort of like no to a lot of things, but you can't even  admit to what you're doing. There are lots of reasons to not be there anymore. There's also

Start time: 5847.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the issue we've talked about many times. And Wayne brings this up as well of Apple being  uncompromising on privacy, which to some degree hampers its ability. I mean, chat GPT is getting  in all sorts of trouble. The Italian regulators shut them down for a few weeks because of the  issue of privacy. Samsung has told its employees, you can't use chat GPT because you might be  leaking inadvertently private company information. That's a serious concern. And so Apple,  this is a problem for Apple. They don't want to do that. I understand why.

Start time: 5883.20

Transcript:  I think the problem is, especially if you're a developer, I mean, if you're a researcher and  you're excited about AI, the problem that you have is the two things that oppose each other is  doing the right thing all the time and developing some of these AI, especially these large language  models, because what makes them cool and what makes them super effective is breaking all kinds  of rules. And so they're really effective because they just did it and they just threw it out there.  OpenAI made it really, really fun and it creates a chat. GPT is a really fun thing that I use every  day. And I know that it would be half as cool if they had tried to dot every I and cross every T.  And the problem is, is that if you're at Apple, they don't want to do anything that's going to  break any rules or hedge anything or hurt the brand or do anything else. And so as an AI  researcher, you're going to often feel like you're kind of tied up. And I think that's a really  hard place for a lot of those AI researchers to be. And any of these models that are trying to do it  the right way is that, you know, it's, well, the cool kids are over there and they're doing this  crazy thing and everyone loves them. And we're stuck with this thing that isn't going to work  as well because we're doing the right thing. And that's, I think it's a really hard place.  It's a hard way to keep developers in the fold. According to the information, John Jandrea,

Transcript:  who they call JG, thank goodness. So I'm going to call him that from now on. JG was hired because  the Siri group in 2018 was in disarray and he was brought in to kind of reorganize it.  This is Wayne Ma writing, he soon brought changes to Apple from his leadership style to policy  shifts. People who worked with John Jandrea describe him as charismatic, though soft spoken,  a tinker in his spare time. One of his hobbies is disassembling atomic clocks.  Hmm. With a sharp contrast to the type A personalities in Apple senior ranks where  it's common for executives to take over meetings and eviscerate rank and file employees who come  unprepared according to former Siri employees. However, he increased salaries, which had been  lower than those of rivals brought in many people he worked with at Google. He helped acquire laser  like a startup, which brought Venka, Cherry Baker and Chucla to Apple, $155 million acquisition.  However, it sounds like he hasn't been able to keep the team on track on purpose. Maybe he's,  I don't know, maybe he's thwarted by Apple's own upper management. Under Jandrea, Apple also  acquired other AR startups. However, founders and employees of these startups in several cases,  including the one we just referred to, ended up leaving Apple. Often departures occurred.  Oh, there's the smoking gun after their stock grants vested. Oh yeah, of course. Some of these  people told the information. Another factor was that Apple was too slow to make decisions  or too conservative in its approach to new AI technologies such as-  Show me the lie.  Long, large language models. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good long article.  You know, it's an interesting question. I understand Apple's reluctance to go a whole  hog on a technology that is frankly somewhat embarrassing right now for Microsoft and Google.

Transcript:  Well, we can't necessarily give Apple the benefit of the doubt. That's one possibility that they're  very cautious about doing the most safe and cautious thing, particularly as regards to  individual privacy. It's possible that they're just gutless. It's possible they just have no  vision for this. It's possible that they're just not interested in this. I'll give you some more

Transcript:  data from the Wayne Ma article. This is one more piece. It kind of is interesting because remember,  we've talked before about how the design team at Apple seemed to have an unusual amount of cloud.  Around 2019, engineers working on the Siri feature. You remember when you asked Siri  if something, she says, here's what I found on the web. They were working on a feature that used  material from the web to answer questions, but there was a clash over how accurate the responses  needed to be before they could release the feature. The Siri design team wanted it to be perfect.  The engineers said 80% should be good enough. Engineers also spent months persuading Siri  designers that not every one of its answers required human verification, a limitation that  would make it impossible to scale up Siri. A year later, the design team did back off the rule,  but they had to back off before the engineers could win that argument. The design team's high  standards frustrated some of Apple's machine learning engineers who argued, look, these models  are bound to make mistakes. The only way to improve them, by the way, this is Microsoft  and Google's philosophy, is to release them into the wild and tweak them gradually. That went  against the culture of Apple's design teams known for telling engineers to wait several years to

Start time: 6197.78
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  perfect a product before releasing it. It all makes sense. Yeah. But the other thing is that  like Steve Jobs' famous pitch was never, his famous pitch was, you want to join me and help  change the world. It's never, you want to join me and help work out some of the bugs we have in our  USB4 protocol stack. And when you have someone who is at the edge of artificial intelligence  research and you're telling them that, hey, this is the most exciting time for people who are in  your line of work, we really want you to focus on palm rejection for the new iPad. Like, well,  no, that's not going to really interest them. That's not going to intrigue them. And also  the fact that they were able to leave so easily, I think that also speaks to the fact that Google  has been actually working on this for three, four, five, close to 10 years. The only reason why  they're doing something as public as BARD is because OpenAI sort of like forced their hand  to at least have something out there that they're clearly, they're labeling the hell of it as  experimental. They're saying, you're helping us to develop this. We're not giving you a tool  that's actually productive or trustworthy for anything. They're annotating every step of the  way. I mean, everyone's talking today about Jeffrey Hinton leaving Google and talking about  his concerns about the czar of artificial intelligence at Google and how he's leaving  basically so he could speak more openly about his concerns about the platform. But even he is  saying that Google is being very, very cautious and being very as responsible as can be certainly  more responsible as OpenAI. So, I mean, we can, the possible answer here is that Apple is being  responsible and cautious and they don't want to release anything or even admit that they're  working on something until they can show off something that's perfect. But the other thing is  that they just don't understand that this is not how large language models work. This is not how  the best of the best of the art of artificial intelligence is going to work. Today, during the  during the show, Google announced a an improvement they're making to Google Photos where they already  have been kicking butt and automatically recognizing objects and photos and tagging things so that you  can basically find anything with a keyword. Now they're basically adding a level of abstraction  to your query so you can say, give me sort of summary looking pictures of water or give me  vacationy sort of items that are kind of melancholy in nature, which will help you find exactly  what you're looking for when you don't know exactly what you're looking for. This is an outreach of  all the AI work that they've been doing for again, three, four, five to 10 years. We're not seeing  that from Apple. I mean, Siri, it's embarrassing. We all know how bad Siri is. It's basically  functional, but it doesn't really go on someplace. I'll just close by saying that like, if everyone  who saw Ted Lasso this week, where there's a of course, Siri gets it gets a scene in which Nate  like says, Hey, hey, slow mo, how can you tell if a woman is really interested in you or if she's  being nice, then Siri says you can't. And everybody who's used Siri say that would not be what Siri  would say. Siri would say, let me tell you what I found on the web about the internet.

Start time: 6398.42
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. Or they'd have one of the team of 20 writers do it. No, Andy, when you talk about something  like Apple and AI and use photos as an example, though, photos is actually an example of Apple  using AI. Well, Apple has used machine learning models for the last like four or five years in  the photos app on phone, and it does a pretty good job on device. It needs to be better. And  what Google is introducing today sounds really good. And it's like they up the stakes for what  Apple needs to do. But that's been a place where Apple actually has used machine learning to the  benefit a lot of things involving iPhone photography. It's done that. The problem is that then meanwhile,  serious is sitting there with its 20 writers talking about a writer's strike, oh, to be on  the staff for Siri. Whoo. So Siri uses humans to write its responses. I think I think they look at  the most common questions and they have humans writing templates and things for them. And I think  that's part of the issue here. But this is and this is what I wanted to say is, is they are using  it in certain places. But Siri, to get to Andy's point about are they being conservative or they're  being scared? I think the answer is you have to you have to ask them what happened to real artistship.  Like at some point, just like with this headset, at some point, you just got to get out there  and you got to see what happens. And are they behind or are they afraid? I wonder if their  fear is actually masking them being too far behind. Because there is nothing stopping them other than  maybe that it's bad from putting Siri to out there as a beta with a switch that's off by default.  And then everybody can try it and we can learn and we can say this was a stupid answer,

Start time: 6488.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  but they haven't let it out at all. Actually, and I'll saving you $400 here in this information  article, there is that exact example, Jen Andrea and Venkatesh Chatterjee. Siri X and Siri 2.  Proposed creating a button that allowed users to report a concern or an issue with the content of  an answer. Siri's design team had rejected that because they wanted to maintain the image that  Siri was all knowing. Yeah. That bird has flown. We know that's not the case, don't we? Yes.

Start time: 6521.06
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And by the way, you're right about you're right about Siri, people having writing responses for  Siri. I actually had to try to try that question like the night that I watched. Oh, did you try it?  And it gave me that and it gave me that lame like vague thing. But then I just tried it today  and it says, Oh, wonder kind, when will you ever learn?

Start time: 6540.88

Transcript:  How do you, there's like eight responses to open the bomb, bomb bay, open the pod bay door,  you know, the pod bay doors. There's like eight different ones. If you keep on asking,  Siri will keep on telling you. And I always, I always think about that as I wonder like,  how do they decide what those were going to be? But that's in a nutshell, that's exactly what

Start time: 6578.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  we're talking about, which is they would prefer to have a clever, well-written canned response  than actual AI in Siri. It's about control. And it's brand reputation. And I understand that.

Start time: 6593.34
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, but they risk getting behind because of it. Like, I mean, that's, that's the,  that's the conundrum here. That's why I think that you can look at the story and take like 15  different things away from it. Because is it true that Apple is very conservative about this stuff?  Yes. Are they right to be? Well, you could argue that they are, but at the same time,  shouldn't they ship something? And if you're somebody who's working on AI inside Apple,  is it the best place to be if you want to be a star and get paid a lot of money? Probably not.  If you want to show off your work, probably not. It's all, I mean, if you're Tim Cook, do you say,  I'm okay with releasing a new version of Siri that gets that that hallucinates or that gets  stuff wrong and is going to make us the butt of jokes? Or would I rather just be behind?

Start time: 6633.80
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I can see both arguments. It's not just that. It's not just that. I mean, we're, we can't,  we can't hyper fixate on on on chat GPT and chat bots. This is also large use of large language  models is also stuff is stuff like what's coming to Microsoft Office and and the Google Work Suite  about saying that, hey, here are here is 1000 elements here 1000 user responses to to a survey  we did on something. I want you to analyze each one of these 1000 responses and in the next  sell the spreadsheet, summarize whether this is positive or negative. I want you to look at  everything that's in this mailbox and show me all of the all of the emails in which  that have to do with my schedule on on this specific project. It really is about and Google  has been prioritizing artificial intelligence for about 10 years now. So it's not just chat bots.  It really is this idea of this large language model, these large language models that  they're there, they can really bake into almost everything now. So it's not just as simple as,  hey, I recognize a cat in this picture. It really is that okay, is the cat happy or sad? Is the cat  is it someone who's chasing a cat? Is the cat in danger? Is this an old cat or a young cat?  And, and describe this picture for me in one sentence or two. So these are these are basically  integral features that can be used to enhance almost anything that you do on this device.  And I just hope that as Mac users and as iPhone users and iPad users,  we don't miss out on this sort of stuff. I think there's also a possibility that we might say,

Start time: 6731.92
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  and Apple's. And Apple has skipped some of those. They've skipped over those,  but it is also a different company than the company that ran an ad that said RIP Mixburn.  Or, you know, like, you know, like, yes, yes, you know, like, you know, that was a different.

Start time: 6744.58

Start time: 6758.70
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  iTunes and burning and replaying. And yeah, it was, and it was, they were accused of that,  of being, you know, piracy when they were saying something else, but it was very bold move. Right.  And I think that's Alex's point is now you're, they, to be fair, Alex, they do have more to

Start time: 6772.96
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  protect now. Exactly. Exactly. No. And they had, they had to break into that market and they,  and they did what they needed to do to do that. And here they're protecting their position and  they have lots of partners and they have lots of things and they have a brand to protect and they  have, you know, business models and their, their partners have business models. And so there's,  it's just a much, much more complicated thing. I'm just saying that that it is, it, it, it's  not that Apple never did that. It's just that they, they stopped doing that at some point,

Start time: 6798.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a decade ago. It's interesting. This RIP Mixburn ad, I think that's the tower theater in Los Angeles  that Apple later turned into its, into its store. Isn't it? Doesn't it look that way? I'm looking  at the old ad. This is from 2001. I think that's the tower theater. They assimilated it. It didn't  help that they had a guy in a hoodie ripping, mixing and burning. Yeah, but he's got Liz Faber

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  on stage, right? He's getting all his favorite artists together. We got the light bulbs and the  wall sconces. I wonder, sometimes I wonder if it's Siri. I mean, Apple, first off, Siri doesn't even  have a definition. Like it's whatever Apple says it is. It's like they say shortcuts are Siri and  the voice assistant is Siri and the, the intelligence that says you might be driving  to this location is Siri. They've wrapped it in a bunch of things, even though so many of us think  of it as the voice assistant. And as I said before to Andy, like Apple's got places where  their machine learning stuff is actually very good, but it's not, it's not in all these other  places. And it certainly doesn't seem to be anywhere attached to Siri. And I think we keep  coming back to the fact that Siri doesn't work very well. They were ahead at the start and then  they fell behind and it's inconsistent. And the one thing that I keep looking at in these chat  bots is when you attach a chat bot to some good data sources and tell it to search for the answer,  they actually don't do so much hallucinating. They actually do a good job. And you think that  would be great for Siri. And like, it's funny now that almost the failings of Siri have poisoned  us to all the places where Apple actually, or is it that everybody else is like the head headset  team and is like saying, we got to work around Siri. We want to avoid Siri because Siri is a  mess. Cause like whoever's doing the photos app has spent a lot of time training photos to use  machine learning. But then there's Siri and like the problem, the trouble with Siri, I guess.  The trouble with Siri.

Transcript:  Again, this is, I've worked in a lot of big companies over as a consultant and  this is a very common story. This is like every big company, you know, and every medium size,  every company, sometimes maybe potentially every company that has more than 30 or 40 employees  has this thing where there's dysfunction and there's things and there's, there's, you know,  things that are working, things that aren't working. There's a, there's some manager that's  holding everything up. There's some team that does stupid things. There's, you know, and it's just,  that's what happens when you get a bunch of human beings in a company that's trying to make money  and trying to figure it all out. And so we can go into this, but like a lot of companies have  dysfunction. When someone says, oh, that company was dysfunctional, that team was like, okay, well,  there are dysfunctional teams.

Start time: 6950.04
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. It's also, I mean, yeah, who, who knows what's going on here? It's hard to say what  happens, but it's hard to be a change agent at a company. And John Gianandrea is one of those  people who I think was intended to be a change agent agent about Siri and about machine learning  in general. But you know, Alex, you've probably seen this. I've certainly seen this. You get  somebody brought in and they're like, I got big ideas. We're going to make changes. We're  going to solve this. And then they say, okay, here are my ideas. They get hired, they get brought in.  They say, here are my ideas. We're going to change it. And they're like idea one. And the  people in charge are like, can't do that. It's worse than that. You can't do that. And it's like,  well, why am I even here then? I'm going to stop you right there.

And I get,  that's the ones you have to say, that's a great idea. I'm behind it. And then, and then it just,  there's like little things and you just get, you know, suddenly a year has gone by.

And if you're in really, if you're in cutting edge stuff, it's a challenge because especially AI,  you need resources to do it, but you don't want to work for a big company because they're going to  get in the way. So they're going to want to do what they want to do.

It kind of worked. Okay, well, let's write that down  and let's not do that again. We'll do, we'll spend another half million dollars next week.

Something to celebrate?  Probably not. And actually this is a kind of, maybe more of a victory. Both Arm and Microsoft  are taking a look at the Apple M series chips and saying, we better do some, play some catch up here.  Apparently Microsoft is put up, put some job listings up for people to do specialized arm  based chips for their hardware. I'm sure looking at the efficiency of the Apple chips.

And I think the problem is, is that you also have to  look at, you need to own the hard, you need to own the whole hardware subset, you know, the stack,  you need to, you know, you need to build the, the, you know, the, the programming platform you need.  There's a whole bunch of things that, that make the M1 work better than a lot of other things.  That is going to be really complicated for people to reproduce. Microsoft has really moved along

I mean, that's why they're probably starting to look at hardware at this  point. They're, they're, they're, they've not been sitting still on this. But one of the problems is

Start time: 7158.80
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  that they are, one of the problems is that they have 80% of the market, which means that they have  to, they have to, they're only going to hold onto 80% of the market if everybody who has every need  for every type of computer can realize that and run Windows on it. So they can't, they can't do  something like Apple's been able to do three times now, which is say, Hey, guess what? We're  changing the entire platform and now all developers are going to have to make sure that you, that you  change your tune and do exactly what we say so that you're prepared for this change that we're  doing in the next year or two. Windows, I mean, how long did it take for Microsoft to get people  off of Windows, Windows three, Windows XP rather. I mean, this is, this is the, this is the difficulty  they have. They can always, all they can do is add instead of having four different distinct  windows flavors and markets. They now will have a fifth one, maybe one that will be more power  efficient, but they'll still have a fifth one. Apple's quarterly results Thursday, firing up the

I will  say though, working across a lot of companies and talking to a lot of companies and even the projects  we see going by, I have never seen a corporate pullback like we're seeing right now, other than  the COVID like it is. I know we're feeling it. Are you kidding? We've had installations across  the board. Yeah. I've never seen, you know, and for me, because, because my job is countercyclical,  everyone's asking, how do we use virtual events to, we're, we're canceling all these events for  the summer and the fall. How do we use the event? How do we use, you know, virtual stuff? So that  whole thing is coming back up again because, because they don't want to, you know, they're,  they're canceling lots of events. That's what I notice, you know, and, and they're pulling back  and I've, I don't, other than COVID, I've never seen so many companies so worried. And I don't,  what's weird is that I don't see it.

Transcript:  maybe they're just skittish. All right. I've got my charts up here. So I'm going to give you a  prediction just cause it's fun. Oh good. How exciting. Which is last year at this quarter,  they did 97.3 billion in revenue. Yeah. But I'm going to say, let's say 90. So it'll be  actually up from two years ago quarter, but down by 7 billion from a year ago. So 90,  nice round number for you. That'll be my prediction. And it'll be enough that people  will freak out. But also if you look back to 2021, you'll realize it's more than they made that.  They just, it took, they took last year off in terms of this. So yeah, we'll see. 90B and that's  revenue. That's the revenue number. But yeah, I mean, so a number like that is going to give you  what? It's going to give you 20 billion in profit. Seems good. I'll take it. Unless you're,  unless you're a wall street, you know, an analyst or an investor or somebody who's always concerned  with the growth figures and nothing else. And I would argue that you shouldn't even probably  listen to those people this time because everybody knows that this cycle is going to pick up and that  they're going to be new iPhones in the fall and that Apple's still making a lot of money. And that  there's still, if you look at their growth, every time people have said, Oh no, Apple's growth is  stalled. They have a new iPhone design and the kick, the, it kicks it off again.

Transcript:  Yes. Okay. I guess I can live with it. We're going to take a little break here and come back  with your picks of the week. So if you would prepare those, my friends, while I remind everybody  the best place in the world to be the club, twit discord, what a great hang. And all you got to do  is pay seven bucks a month. Oh yeah, sure. There are other benefits, ad free versions of all of  our shows, ad free and tracker free. There's also the twit plus feed, which has shows we don't put  out anywhere else. Like the hands on Mac show with Michael Sargent, hands on windows with Paul  Theron, title Linux show, the giz fizz and brand new home theater geeks with Scott Wilkinson.  Now how much would you pay? Well, it's still only seven bucks a month, less a buck less than a blue  check on Twitter and you get so much more. We invite you to a join club tweet. Oh, and there's  the best part of all. You get that warm and fuzzy feeling knowing you are really helping us continue  to produce great content and produce new content. We've launched a lot of shows now in the club,  like this week in space, that have gone out into the public and we're very happy about that.  Seven bucks a month, twit.tv slash club twit. And I thank you in advance. Burke says you didn't sit  in my chair. You sat in the backup Dr. Evil chair. There are two.

Transcript:  It is called stop the madness. It's a safari extension. It'll run on Mac and iOS. I like it  already. I don't even know what the madness is. It is from underpass software. Jeffrey Johnson is  the guy's name and it's it. What doesn't it do? It unbreaks web pages that are broken by dumb web  developers. So let's say a website disables copy and paste. I hate that because I can't use my  password to manage. Yeah. Or it doesn't let you use contextual menus or does auto playing video.  You install stop the madness and you don't get one feature. This is like a what doesn't it do  of browser extension. There are like 50 different check boxes of things it does.  Bypass, link shorteners, hide banners, protect the command click, protect drag and drop.  My feature that I wrote about last week on Six Colors that I love is there's also custom CSS.  I went to a website. It might have been nine to five Mac and they have a new feature, which is  they put a comment from their forums in the story. Top comment from a comment.  And I don't want to see your comments. I don't care that it's top. I don't want to see it. Well,  all I did was right click, inspect element and Safari got the CSS for it. And then you go into  stop the madness and you say that CSS display colon none. And it overrides their CSS and it goes  away. So that's how this works. There's so many, so many things that it does, but yeah,  like there's a website that I visit a lot that doesn't let me open in a new window. So command  click doesn't open the link in a new window. Stop the madness fixes it. Now I can do that.  Like I should have been able to do before. It's just, if you've been annoyed by the web,

Start time: 7725.64
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And then also it does redirect management too. So if you've got like a page that you always want  to go to a different page, you can actually set in a pattern and it'll, it'll redirect your browser  there. So I use that because I subscribe to one of our local newspapers and not the other one,  but I always get links for the Mercury news. And I have a rule that when I click on a Mercury news  link, it opens in the Marin IJ. I want the IJ baby. So yeah, stop the madness. What doesn't it do?

But yeah, so yeah, so I went to an estate sale over the weekend. This  is the nice time of year where- Andy, how do you find estate sales near you?  Well, I actually, I didn't, I was not interested at all until I found this website called  estate sales.net, which is just, it was, it's just an estate sale finder where you just,  here's your zip code and tell them like, how far away are you willing to travel? And also,  do you want to include auctions? Do you want to include moving sales? Do you want to include  a whole bunch of other stuff? And it will just simply give you a list of everything that's

Start time: 7848.50

Start time: 7874.44
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  You can, you can also, you can also have it just basically email you alerts every time there's like  a new listing for, for somewhere. It's a, they're about through, actually the estate sales.net just  got bought by another company for like $40 million. Wow. It shows you how big they are,  how successful they are. There, there are a couple of, I'm sure there are a couple of other sites  for this kind of thing, but it's the only one that I actually, actually bothered with. And  as I'm not, it's not like I'm packing up the car every single weekend to, you know, stock my eBay  store or anything like that. But if I find out that there is a decent estate sale, like within,  within bike, bike distance of my house, yeah, I'm in there because it's, you know, it's, I refer to  I think of it as burglary fantasy camp because you enter an unlock door, you walk in, you open  drawer drawers and closets, you take things, put them in your bag. You do have to pay off someone  to at the door, you know, do not squeal on you. And usually it's a amount of money kind of  commensurate with how much was the ship in a bottle? This actually, I bought like a whole bag  full of stuff for like 50 bucks. So this would be a whole and what I like about estate sales that  you do see like weird stuff, like odd things, including like old computers, old books, old  stuff like that. But also things like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not joking. Like just like the estate  sale was like on Friday morning, like on Wednesday, I was thinking I was, I was doing food shopping and  it was in like the little housewares aisle in the supermarket had one of those like fish spatulas.  I thought, Oh, I can get one of those. But I didn't get it. And then of course at the estate  sale, like I'm rummaging through the kitchen drawers and Hey, look, fish spatula. All right,  there you go. It's a perfectly good, perfectly new like fish spatula that cost me a fraction of $50.

Lisa is going to be very interested because she likes estate jewelry and, you know, class,  she has a number of very beautiful old brooches and things that she, she's picked up. And I think  this would be a lot of fun. Maybe for mother's day, it might not be too late for me to, to gift  her with a fine brooch or a chair with a specially sculpted bottom or, or, you know what glass jar  marbles. Perfect for mother's day. Estate sales.net. Thank you, Andy. You really do you, is your house

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  loaded with stuff? No, no, no. The MIT flea market and I kind of like tapered off of things, but I  do, but most of the, most of the good stuff in my house are stuff from like local, like yard sales  and estate sales. Because you know, they, it's, I'm, I'm lucky in that I am a moderately moderate to  low income person who lives in like a seaside quaint village full of lots of people who have  lots of money. And so oftentimes they're like, well, you know what? I, I have two $500 Cuisinart,  but I suppose I should get a third $500 Cuisinart, but now I have one $500 Cuisinart that was five  bucks, whatever, just get out of my house. And so oftentimes the nicest stuff are things like for

Start time: 8112.70
Speaker: Leo Laporte

It's not necessarily the deceased in this, in this case it was someone  who retired had, oh my, I wish I could tell you the story of this person because he had such an  interest, he's having such an interesting life, but he's now like 90 and he moved to be closer

Start time: 8135.26

Start time: 8139.84
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  All right. Yeah. And so I want to move away from my kids, but it's, you know,  similar thing, similar premise. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. And so, and so like most of the,  they hired an estate sale company that after, after the family had basically taken, after he  had moved everything that he wanted, all the family like got all the things that they wanted  and the state sale company came in, photographed what was left. And it's not like a fleet, it's  not like a garage sale where there's tables really set up. It's pretty much literally again,  I'm not joking like, oh, let's open up this drawer. Hey, look, here's all the utensils.  So anything in the house you could take. Yeah. I mean, anything, anything you see is available.

Start time: 8179.16
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is for sale. This is kind of a relief to me because honestly I'm kind of worried about what's  going to happen. We could just do that here. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? The last, the last,

Start time: 8187.76
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  the last time I moved, I kind of did the exact same thing, only it was, I'm going to move,  I'm going to pack everything that is that I want to keep. I'm going to put into storage,  everything I want to put into storage. I'm going to give away the things I want to give away  the rest of it. I'm going to pay a nice couple of guys in a truck, $1,200 to simply say everything  that is remaining in this house, put it in your truck and get, take it elsewhere, sell it, burn  it, whatever you want to do, just get it out of the house for me. And they'll, they'll do that.

Start time: 8222.30
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  you're, you can't, that's a bonus. That's the fascinating thing. Cause in this, in this sale,  like he was, he was ex military. And so he had a couple of civil, he had a civil war, like Navy  scabbard, a scimitar or whatever, and a couple of other cool things from like the civil war that  he collected. But also, it's a good thing you weren't a burglar. You might've chopped your  head off. Yeah, exactly. But, but, but also like, as I'm looking at the pic, like the 60 pictures  that are inside this gallery of, oh, here's what you can expect to find there's like, oh,  would I, would I really go there and just buy like, here are like all like those little  plastic jars of spices that you accumulate over like 20 years. Like I, I would probably rather

Start time: 8261.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  buy fresh spices. Yeah. Old spices, not so good. Yeah. Yeah. Mr. I'm just, I can't stop. I can't  stop. I know it's, it's very prosable. I'm looking at these people's house as they sell everything.  You know, like, I don't know if those women's feet are for sale, but this is really strange.  Really. Alex Lindsay, distract me quick. Right. Before I buy something I don't really want.

Start time: 8292.28
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, I bought something that I didn't, didn't, I thought I would need and then didn't need for a  long time. And it just sat around in my garage. Yes. And, you know, at my garage someday we'll do  a sale from my garage. I call it, you have had sales and we have taken advantage of them. Yeah,  exactly. So I still have a lot of, so I call it kind of spelunking because there's a bunch of boxes  and they're up in an addict and I kind of start pulling through them and I find all this stuff.  And one of the things I knew that was sitting there somewhere was this ambio mic. This is a  Sennheiser ambio mic that I had bought for some spherical project, maybe 10 years ago. The good  news is the client bought it, but you've got it. Well, I, the client paid me to do a project and I  knew I needed that mic and I bought it. And then I, and then I used it for that project. And then I,  now it's just sitting around. I forgot about it. Yeah. It sat around and it sat around and I,  it wasn't that successful in the project because the streaming platform didn't do it very well.  And it was kind of like, Oh, okay. Those early days. Anyway, we picked it back up again. And,  and what we did at NAB was we took this, this, this ambisonic mic. This is,  this is using an ambisonic mic. So it has an array of mic microphones, four of them,  and it'll do four XLR outs. And it's a, it's a specific pattern. And what we did is we plugged  that into a, a sound devices Scorpio. And then, and then we went out of that into, and embedded  those into an SDI signal, put them into a live view and streamed it back to our office.  And with a live view. And so what we did is we had this ambio mic in channels, you know,  whatever, four through eight and two microphones, the people walking around, uh, NAB with the  microphones. And the reason that I, I find that interesting, we're going to talk more about it in  office hours in the near future, but a lot of people, when I said I was going to do that,  thought I was crazy. You know, they thought that this was a nutty, you know, and I do a lot of  nutty things. So it's reasonable to think that it's a nutty. But it's just Alex at it again.  Yeah. Yeah. But I had this idea, like, what if we were able to capture the feel of being there,  you know, not just the SM58s with the, you know, let's get the surround sound, all the traditional,  like, how do we get the rest of it in there? And it worked stunningly well. Like,

Start time: 8420.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you know, when you, did you have it? So people were watching in a VR headset so that when they

Start time: 8424.74
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  turned their head and stuff or you could, we could do that. We didn't. So what we did is we were one  of the, I don't know how many channels right now have 5.1, but our YouTube channel can do 5.1. And  so what we did is we shot it in HDR 10 and 5.1 surround. So it was an HDR stream going through  the live view. So live view, the 800 has the ability to do 10 bit. So we were able to send back  an HDR signal back to San Rafael from, you know, from Las Vegas and convert that to, you know,  an HDR 10 signal that goes to YouTube along with 5.1 audio. And again, it was one of those things  that, that I felt I had a hint that it would work really well. And it works exceptionally well. It's  just a test. We're not, it's not published right now, but, but we, but what we, what we found was  is that by having this ambiolet, the cool thing is we didn't have tons of mics. We had four and  it was this little thing and someone just walked behind it with a pole. They just had a pole behind  the thing and betting this in, but you really felt like you were there. You felt like you could  hear the louder booth over and behind you and, and something else is there, but the mics and  what's cool about it is because we use that ambio separately, we could control how much of that  background noise is there. So we could bring it all down a little bit and the mic, the microphones  that are being used, we're not using that for the people talking. We were still talking into  microphones. And so you could, you could control how much audience there was, you know, in those  surround speakers. And it was anyway, I, I went from going, Oh, ambisonic is pretty cool to, wow,  this is really cool. And there's less expensive versions. This one's like $1,300. This is the one  we used. There are more expensive versions. AKG just came out with an eight mic version of this.  This is amazing. Zoom has a much less expensive version. That's three or $400.

Start time: 8531.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Zoom's kind of always done this right with multiple microphones pinning.

Start time: 8534.62
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  They have multiple, but they have XY. This is a, Zoom has a little one, a little ambisonic one that  you can use. And the cool thing is, is you can take that ambisonic information and then decode it  and put it back in as beds for other surround sound things that are, that are out there.  But it really creates the space in which something, even if your primary focus is just a microphone,  I was, I was kind of amazed at how immersive it felt. And so-

Start time: 8559.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Could you use it like a handheld mic and talk to people?

Start time: 8563.54
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You wouldn't want to move it around. You want to have it-  No, cause it, yeah, you want to, you want to have it be something that's grabbing all the environment.  What you want to do is have that walk around mic that is still, because by having something like  an SM58 and having it have a lot of off-axis rejection, so it gets rid of all of that.  You have two pristine channels that you can put in the center channel.  And then you can mix it.  And then you have all this other stuff that you can mix in to, to, to taste, you know, and,  and figure out, you know, what makes sense, you know, for that experience. And it,  it's, you know, for those out there doing, you know, watch the show, I know a fair number of  them, you know, there's, there's definitely a group of Mac, Mac break folks that are in broadcast.  It's worth looking at. I mean, it's really look, you know, I know it sounds crazy to go past stereo  and go into five dot one and, but it's a, it's a really cool, really cool-

Start time: 8609.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. Cause so, you know, years ago,  cause the technology wasn't there, but it's there now and then, and times have,  and so this mic, I mean, mics don't change. So this might make much sense now.  I mean, the fact that I was doing this with a relatively, relatively simple rig. And I think

Start time: 8624.12
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  it was the first time anybody's done five dot one from a show floor. Yeah. Yeah. Live, live. It was  like a live stream from there in the ATR five dot one. Were you mixed with somebody mixing?  Yeah. So, well, the funny thing is, is that it was, so it was, it was pretty much straight channels  into the live view. And then it went back to San Rafael and Mickey McAchor, who's in the Philippines,  he's part of office hours. He was actually running the software. So we were using,  L Acoustics, Alisa Studio, along with a, and I can't think of the name of it, but right off the  top of my head, something that'll interpret the ambisonic and feed it back in. So he's running  the mix. So the mix was actually being done in San Rafael from the raw data. So there's the mic

Start time: 8669.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  data and the ambisonic data. And Mickey's sitting there in the Philippines going like this.

Start time: 8674.78
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Well, at first he was swearing at us because Kevin and I were trying to figure something out.  Of course, I didn't know what I was doing. And we, we, we tried to, we were testing it the day  before and we screwed up all the channels. So it was, it was all screwed up for the first half hour.  And then he figured out what we did and tightened it all up and made it work. But it,  so when it started working, it was, it was really, you know, really fun. And we're going to be doing  that when more of our coverage. I mean, my goal is by the fall, everything we cover will use five  dot one, you know, like in the ambisonic mic and everything else. And it's, it's, um,

I mean, I think that we were constantly trying to figure out what's the next thing,  you know, and how to, and how do you take in the, in the advantage that we have is because we're  doing a show every day, we're constantly like, well, we'll just keep pushing that edge until  that edge becomes normal, you know, until that, you know, until we're not thinking about it anymore.
