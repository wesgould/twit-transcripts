There was a half of us were like, you know, half of the group was  like, oh, it's never going to work and no one's ever going to buy that. And the other half was  like, I can't wait. Where do I order? Where do I put my credit card down? So it was a split crew.

Transcript:  um, a nice gentleman, Oscar says, hello, Leo, and thank you for everything. Oscar the grouch.  Uh, I, if I can real quick, I was, uh, in the elevator about to make my way back to the car.  And this guy from across the elevator suddenly does a double take. I say, and he points at me  and then he goes to it. That's all he said. And I said, yes. And he goes,  what? Forgive me. Forgive. I said Micah, he goes, oh, Micah, sergeant. Oh, where's Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  having fun down there at WWDC, the 2023 edition. Yeah. We covered the keynote. I did it because  we had planned to do it with you and then you got a last minute invitation, but that gave me a great  opportunity to bring people up onto the stage from the club. How was that? It was great. It was  the, you know, it was Kev Brewer. It was Joe Esposito and Joe from Brooklyn. It was the usuals,  but, uh, but it was really, I thought quite fun. I thought they did a very good job. And, um,  and what was interesting, I was talking with one of the producers afterwards and they said,  he said they knew the rhythm of how we do these keynotes, like when to talk, when not to talk.  It was really, it was, it was true. They watched a few, I think. That's cool. So, uh, if I were a  smart, canny podcaster, I would save one more thing for the end. Okay. As if it is one more thing,  as if it were one more thing, just like Tim Cook did. We were sitting here. I'm sure you were,  Oh yeah. Saying, okay, you've gone an hour, you've gone an hour and a half. I think it was getting  long. Uh, and actually at one point I was really wondering, maybe they're not going to introduce

Start time: 311.94
End time: 316.64
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  this. We had that feeling too. Uh, sitting there thought maybe it just wasn't time.

Start time: 318.02
End time: 336.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow. I mean, that would be really a big deal given how much publicity, but they never said  they were going to introduce it. Exactly. You know, Tim's been saying AR, AR, AR for a while. So,  you know, we know he was very interested in this. And before the event started, there was a moment

Start time: 336.34
End time: 365.76
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  where both Craig Federighi and Tim Cook were on stage. And what gave me the hint that they were  going to was right before the video that everybody else got to see from out in the world saw, uh,  Tim Cook said something along the lines of this is going to be an historic day. I love that he used  the N historic day and historic day. And then that's whenever the video started, the part that was  streamed live elsewhere. And so I thought, okay, definitely at the end, but then it just kept going  and going. And I'm looking over at Jason Snell. He was sitting next to me and, um, are they going?

Start time: 366.10
End time: 377.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they, they won more thing. Uh, when they won more things, they also won more thing, the price.  And this was the reaction from, uh, from the crowd. Oh, I'm glad someone captured that.

Start time: 379.00
End time: 386.89
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Starts at 34.  No, that is not a, that is not a sound effect. That was the real sound in the audience.

Start time: 390.56
End time: 400.32
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  That was so intense that I really honestly had to reach out to a friend of mine who was there  and say, did that really happen? He said, yes, yes, it was anything. It was even louder.

Start time: 400.92
End time: 420.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We didn't hear it of course, because Apple, once again, even in the absence of COVID,  because you were all there, you were unmasked, you didn't get special  Apple. Uh, they still decided to do it recorded. So tell me how it happened to that. You're sitting  in the press from what I could tell from your tweets and others, you were kind of in the back.

Start time: 421.04
End time: 463.50
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Yeah. So this time, because there were developers there, they got the front seats. And then there  was a small row of some of the blessed Apple employees who got to be there because their teams  were kind of featured. And then right behind that row was the press. And so we were near the back,  but it also was, it kind of gave the press the opportunity to be in the shade shade.  So we were sort of comfortably sitting, although right where we were, it was with the sun. But  anyway, you're sitting there and you're looking up at the stage and everything's getting ready.  They're playing that music. You can see the huge screen and what they did in the past. What they  did again this year is Tim Cook, Tim Cook took the stage and talked briefly and he was saying,

Start time: 463.72
End time: 470.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  he was wearing a light blue shirt. And I noticed that, oh yeah, because there was a different  shirt in the video. He did not attempt to match his outfit. Yeah, there was no matching there.

Start time: 471.62
End time: 490.28
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  And they talked for a little bit. Craig said a few things and sort of joked about  the presentation and then it kicked off. There was no after with that. As soon as it was over,  then we all kind of looked towards our press contacts. The, our sort of PR people were off  to the side and said, where do we go next? And then they shuffled us off from there.

Start time: 490.58
End time: 526.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Alex, you were really, you said, I frankly was surprised because I completely disagree with  you. You said that they're never going to do a live performance again, that this is, this is,  you know, so good. And I grant you that, I mean, they get a lot of information into two hours and  six minutes, but they're never going to do a live event again. Yeah. I think that's really a shame  because I think you really, I feel like you really lose. Well, yeah, you like to live in a bubble,  I guess. I miss because you don't go out much. No, but people keep on saying, I don't understand

Start time: 526.20
End time: 547.92
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  why the energy, you know, Google and Microsoft have lost so much energy in their events. It's  not that they've lost energy. It's that Apple's is so much tighter with so much more data and so  much, it's so much more visual interest that when you go back to a stage, it's like, it's like going  from the highway to a gravel, you know, I think you could do a hybrid where you had people.

Start time: 548.66
End time: 588.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to see the executives. I want to see their energy and enthusiasm. I want to see,  and we didn't see it, Tim Cook wearing a Vision Pro. And I think you could do that and introduce  videos because I understand it's a much more content rich way to present it and then much more  clear. But I do think you lose something from not having people on stage. I really do. And I think  Apple's at risk of becoming, they already kind of look like this. In fact, even building Apple  Park with everything facing in, they already look like a company that doesn't participate with its,  you know, they're on a, they're in Elysian fields up there somewhere. If, if Google and Microsoft

Start time: 588.98
End time: 597.78
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  are doing physical events in three years, I will be really surprised. I think it's over. Yeah. Like  the idea of the keynote is done. You know, it's, you can put a fork in it. Like it's maybe, you

Start time: 598.14
End time: 601.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  know, Steve Jobs are still here. There would be no question that you would want. No, no, he's the

Start time: 602.10
End time: 654.18
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  one that brought it forward. You have to be, but you have to be Steve Jobs or Mark Benioff from  sales, Mark Benioff from Salesforce, by the way. I don't understand anything he talks about, but  he's amazing at talking about it. Like, like his, you know, and he's trained, you know, trained by  Tony Robbins and, and just incredible, their entire staff. So if you're at that level and you're  willing to spend two hours a week being trained, then, then I think that doing keynotes makes a  lot of sense for you, but none of these executives are doing that. And all of it is just painful to  watch people who are untrained, untrained, stripping through things, reading teleprompters, even Apple,  when, you know, when Steve was gone, it was the, the magic was gone in that process because they're  not actors. You know, Steve had something that they didn't have. Steve made the keynote a keynote  because he was so good at it. You know, but the thing is, is that that was like, you know, that

Start time: 654.54
End time: 661.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  was a, I'd rather see a live, a live rock show than a perfect canned performance. I'd rather see a

Start time: 661.42
End time: 697.48
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Broadway show than a perfect movie. But, but, but that, those are incredible, generally,  talented musicians that are very talented and prime and spent thousands of hours getting good at it.  The executives are not those people there. It's more like watching a live show of someone who  just learned how to play the guitar, you know, like, like three weeks ago, and that's not super  exciting. You know, like, you know, it's, you know, and that's what they look like. That's what  executives look like when they go out on stage is like a kid who just learned how to play the guitar  and trying to play you. Mary, Mary had a little lamb, you know, it's just, it's really painful.  I've watched literally thousands of sessions. So I think that's part of it.

Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie But on the other hand, like this isn't Las Vegas. This is really is  energy engineers and product managers explaining this thing they've been working on for the past  seven years. It's okay if they don't land that triple jump off the, off the, off the trampoline.  You know, it's, I had to say that maybe the biggest cognitive disconnect I had was like,  wow, I'm seeing pictures of like an audience of people watching a video together on a screen.  Trey Lockerbie Yeah.  Trey Lockerbie Like if I, I mean, and I know that people didn't come,  the people who traveled to go see it didn't go to see it just to watch the video. It was because,  okay, maybe there's, there's going to be a demo area and also I have the ability to talk to people  afterward. But oh my goodness, if you didn't, if you didn't spend, if you were not like within one  hour's travel time of that, of that venue and you flew like six hours to again, watch what was a  very, very stilted, canned presentation with really very, it was, you're right. It was very  professionally done. There were no trip ups. There was no stumbling. There was no like pauses  as, oh, we thought that he would be able to cross from the right left stage to the center stage more  quickly than that. But on the, on the other hand, it was like watching a video game walkthrough in  many ways. And that again, it's, it's okay because this is just a product demo. This is not supposed  to be showbiz, but I got it. All right. We don't have to go on. We only got two hours show.

Start time: 783.84
End time: 795.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie Let me just, let me just say one point about that is that as someone who's done  a couple thousand of these, I can tell you that that little like they just walked to the wrong  part of the stage. That's like two weeks of meetings. And that's why a company, once they go

Start time: 795.70
End time: 805.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  into records, we don't look at enough. They're going to probably do it recorded from now on.  I think there's something lost. Let's talk about the, I'm going to be grumpy today.

Start time: 806.52
End time: 820.72
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  You did not get to try it on Micah Sargent. I did not. The most that I got to do was walk into a  room where there was this sort of center table and there were two headsets on poles.

Start time: 821.28
End time: 824.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie This reminds me a lot of when the iPhone came out. You couldn't really,

Start time: 825.22
End time: 828.80
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  you couldn't really go near it. And you just see this animation playing on the front screen.

Start time: 828.80
End time: 845.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie Is this your TikTok or is this  Micah Sargent No, I  Trey Lockerbie Somebody else's TikTok.  Micah Sargent Oh, yeah, I guess it is. Yes.  Trey Lockerbie Yeah. Oh, it's our TikTok. Here's your video from our Slack channel. Very,  very crowded. How many of them did they have there?

Start time: 845.58
End time: 850.32
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Micah Sargent They had, I believe, well, I guess it's double. So it was six around the table.

Start time: 850.32
End time: 862.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie And I wonder, you know, they're doing these,  there's a, there's a close up of it. They're doing these demos for people yesterday and today. I  imagine because it's stretched out so far that there are a handful of them.

Start time: 862.80
End time: 878.32
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Micah Sargent There are not only are there a handful of them,  but what is important to understand is that much like the first iPhone where if you push the wrong  button, everything fell apart. That is what we are seeing with these headsets. These headsets.  Trey Lockerbie So people who are doing the demos are saying

Start time: 878.32
End time: 902.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Micah Sargent Very well.  Trey Lockerbie Highly guided.  Micah Sargent Yes.  Trey Lockerbie There's another part to this, which I should mention, which, and I think this is  a big problem for it, is you have to set it up. You have to have your face shot with the, with the,  with the device, the Vision Pro, but also your ears scanned with your iPhone. You have to have your  face scanned with the iPhone.

Start time: 902.90
End time: 935.76
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie And right now they don't even have that process fully baked in yet. I can't,  I cannot stress enough how much this is. This is why it's coming out next year is that it's not,  it's, it's not there yet. Right now they're doing it with an iPhone. They're not, you don't actually  do this setup process with the headset itself. You do it with an iPhone that then pipes that  information into the headset. And the Lance Yelanov was one of the folks who was able to  try it. And I think did a really good job of detailing the experience a little more than I've  seen from some folks. They have a special device that people who make lenses for glasses.

Start time: 935.76
End time: 944.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Micah Sargent Zeiss makes the lenses. But you have to get your particular prescription.  Trey Lockerbie Yes.  Micah Sargent They had an optometrist's testing machine.

Start time: 944.42
End time: 980.00
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie To figure out what to put pop in. And they do this all. It's almost like,  Micah Sargent Assembly line.  Assembly line. Yes, exactly. And so you don't see what's happening behind the scenes. Then you go  in, it's there for you to put on. Another thing is that they didn't show this. You don't see this in  the videos. You don't see this. I didn't see this in the photos that I was able to capture.  But there is also a strap that goes over the head to help add support. It's interesting that  they're not showing that. I don't know if that means that eventually they hope they won't have  to have that or what if it's an optional strap that's in the, you know, in the eventual box.  But there's all this stuff that's kind of happening behind the scenes.

Start time: 980.14
End time: 1079.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie The reason I think that's kind of important is because one of the, oh, hey,  we happen to have one right here. Thank you, Anthony, for bringing yours in.  One of the reasons I think it's important is because one of the use cases might be  to have this at an Apple store to let people try it or put it in an Ikea showroom to let people  do that thing that Alex Lindsay thinks everybody wants to do, which is place furniture in their  house. But if the setup is so lengthy and personalized, by the way, it even has  iris recognition so that it knows it's you when you put it on. It is a very personalized device.  It's not something that you could just have in a mass market situation. And we should say  everything I'm saying is about this. We don't know what five years or 10 years or 20 years down the  road they'll be. But I have to say, as far as I could tell, for reading a whole bunch of stuff  and looking at a lot of videos, A plus in technological innovation. We'll talk about  some of the features. Really something only an Apple could do. In fact, Meta hasn't done it.  HTC hasn't done it. Nobody's done this. One. Two, I think in terms of performance of delivering a  product that's amazing, they've done A plus. But I cannot help but point out that ergonomically,  this is a solid F that people are not looking to strap screens on their faces. And so what happens  when you develop something so cool? It's almost like they made the world's best submersible  submarine. And it's like, oh, this is amazing. But it's just not something people are looking for.

Start time: 1080.32
End time: 1133.84
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  You disagree, Andy? Well, I wouldn't say it's an F. I mean, the thing is,  ergonomics are not good. My overall take on this is that this is not the machine that Apple wanted  to show off. They just got impatient. They stopped waiting for the display technology  to become small enough, compact enough, then to do what they wanted to do to make the device they  wanted to make. So they decided we're going to make something that is a very conventional looking  familiar device. It'll be familiar to people who have been using VR headsets for the past five or  six years. And we will simply move on from there after demonstrating that we know how to run these  displays. We know how to get enough detail that you can read text pretty much at any size, no  matter where you put the window in the virtual space. That lag is not going to be a problem.  And that as far as comfort goes, it's going to be as comfortable as such a device can possibly be.

Start time: 1151.20
End time: 1178.54
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  Most of the people that I read who got the demos, A, they said that the setup was actually very,  very quick for what it was doing. It wasn't very, very cumbersome. They also mentioned  specifically that one of the things that Apple was admitting to was that they were still working  on that interface between the device and your head. They had a limited number of sizes available  to make sure that things fit correctly to people's heads, but they were working on by ship date,  having so many of these different variations. One of the things you'll do is have your face scanned

Start time: 1178.88
End time: 1185.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  and they will custom mold a front piece for you. So that's another reason you're not going to see.

Start time: 1189.64
End time: 1196.38
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  And the other thing is regarding the fan that most of the people that I've been reading  and the one person I talked to said that you really couldn't hear the fan.

Start time: 1197.24
End time: 1200.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. That's fine. It's good they have a fan because otherwise...

Start time: 1200.76
End time: 1231.72
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  I wouldn't say F. It's F compared to what... But you do have it right on the money. We've  been talking about this for a long time that this is still...  In general, VR headsets are...  I'm joking about this, but I mean, boy...  He's putting on his view master.  To put on this really big ski goggle thing is a really big thing. And I think it's kind of  adorable that they came up with the eye view saying, maybe it'll be okay if we have a  lenticular screen that will make people be able to see your eyes behind it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's another totally dystopian and weird thing. They showed a father taping a video tape,  3D stereoscopic tape of his kid blowing out the candles. Yeah, that's great. Except all I'm seeing  as a kid is a creepy eyed dad. Everyone I'd spoke to did not. No one that

Start time: 1252.18
End time: 1257.52
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  I spoke to had a positive reaction to that idea of having to wear it while you capture the video.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We don't live in a world where we want to distance ourselves more from people.  I have a credible movie theater in my house. If I want to go to the movies,  it's because there's other people there. So I think this is... To me, from an ergonomic  and a psychological point of view, this is the wrong direction. Now, we've all said, someday  they're going to make these as spectacles that'll just sit lightly on your nose and  you'll have augmented reality. Show me those then. I'll give it an A plus on ergonomics.  But I don't even think the technology to make that exists. So Apple is doing a lot of hand-waving here  for something that I think is dead on arrival. Personally, dead on arrival.  They'll sell a million next year. Yeah, that's fine. Still dead on arrival.  And by the way, I don't think they're making a lot of money. People were creeped out about  3,500 bucks. That's probably pretty close to the bill of materials. I mean, it's probably...

Start time: 1314.48
End time: 1361.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, it's... You can't... The problem that everybody else has now, if they think... If  they disagree with you and decide that they want goggles, they want to make them. The problem is,  Apple has locked up so many patents along with... 5,000 patents, they said.  Along with building something that is so self-contained, it will be hard at any  price for anyone to put out any piece of device that's going to really compete as heavily with  that right now. The biggest problem that HTC and Facebook had and Google had was a constant  discussion about price, which Apple stopped talking about. Apple was just like... I mean,  that isn't the highest end headset that I've seen, but it's the highest publicly available one,  or will be. And the ones that I saw that were nicer than this were a quarter million dollars each.

A lot of technology went into that thing.  That sold 35 million and was considered a failure. I don't think this is going to sell a million big

Transcript:  pro that then becomes the consumer model? I think you're still probably three or four  years away from a consumer, a model that's less expensive than this one. So this is the stopgap,  but it's not a stopgap. I don't think it was a stopgap. I think it is another step in something  they were building from the beginning. So the thing is, is that there's no... I think that they...  No, it's not a stopgap. It's a step because they're not saying, oh, we couldn't get to what we  wanted to. I think that they've been building a systematic process. This is part of that  systematic process. I don't think they got impatient a couple of years ago. I think that  they probably had this largely figured out five, four or five years ago, as a headset of this is  what the first one's going to be. And then the next one will be much more transparent and the  next one will be much more... I mean, Apple is oftentimes working at 10 years in advance.  And so the thing is, is that I don't think that this is... If they got impatient, it was in 2017  or 2018 or 2016. It wasn't last year or two years ago. And so the thing is, is that they...  So I think that the problem is, is that you can't build the headset that you want without people  interacting with the headset that you can make today. So while you can...  I understand that.  Talk about that. And what happened is all the other headsets have been dumbed down  because of price. Even the Facebook one that was $1,500, which gave more headroom,  price has been devastating to these devices because they just require so much technology  to be fluid. And so Apple's making it more expensive. They're allowing themselves to figure

They had to cost that much. In fact, Harry McCracken pointed out that the  Apple One, which cost $666 in its day, in 1976 dollars, would have cost $3,554 today. So  it's $54 cheaper in real dollars than the Apple One.

Transcript:  But this, this, this would be, this would be a very, very weird choice for, for Metta to have done  for Apple. If they have the, they have the money to simply say,  exactly. If I think that they have the ability to launch a product like this without any real  expectations, that's going to be a success in any way other than it works.  This, what they have to, what I think that what their priority is that they have to sell the idea  that this is going to be so the 4k display that you're going to have off of your Mac is so good  that it's going to be the equivalent of a real display for you. When you have a app windows  floating in front of you in front of environment, that's going to be so easy to use as a display  that you're going to be able to use it. They have to, they just have, and they have to prove  the idea that this is not just for training people in how to, how to, how to maintain an  aircraft engine in the military. This is not just about gaming, that this is going to be a  computing platform. So I think that their idea is that so long as they develop a first generation  of hardware that can sell that, that idea that this is a platform for apps, not just a way to  look at magic dinosaurs jumping up and down on the desk in front of you, they will consider that a

Transcript:  win for the next, for the next generation to come. And I think that one of the big things is that  while everybody else had to figure out how to build all those things, Apple is making a lot of  the apps that already exist just simply work in there. And so being able to, you're not leaving  this to use something else, which is a big a hill that everybody else had to clean to climb is like,  what do we do and how do we get people to put it on? Well, there's just a ton of things that you  can just go ahead and do in there. And so, and you know, I think a lot of that's by the way,

Start time: 1667.28

Speaker: Leo Laporte

And the reason they  could do that, Alex, is because it's basically, you know, iPad OS. I'm sure it's running a mock  current. It's very similar, I think to iPad OS, I'm sure. Yeah. I mean, they're, they're at the,

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  at the platform state of the union yesterday, they were running through like what it, how,  what it will, what will, will it be like to take an iPad app and modify it so that it will work  on vision OS again, assuming that you just, you don't want to just have it just be an iPad  window that's, that's floating in front of you. And really it's you drag something new into your  Xcode and then you simply decide here's your, here's your Swift view of your, of your current  app. Do you want to hang, hang things off the bottom of it? Do you want to have certain things  and what do you want to add three-dimensional elements to it? If that's really all you want  to do with it, you can basically promote it to being a vision OS app very, very quickly.  And of course they want people to be more ambitious than that. And I will also say,  as an aside, that if all it does is, Hey, look, I can have virtual screens all around me. That's  not terribly ambitious. And I hope that they crack the idea of 3D computing and a 3D spatial  computing as something more than I can, instead of having to, instead of having a next day,  a $320 new monitor to have a fourth or fifth or fifth screen on my desktop,  I can just drag a window up there. It has to be better than that. And I don't think they really  made that case yesterday, but again, it's about the ecosystem, about being able to take the app  that you created, make amendments to it and turn it into an actual vision OS app that has shadows  that reacts to the light that's around you. That when people enter the room, that your app will  fade into the background so that person can get the focus. All these things you get for free.  That's a very, very powerful mojo for a developer. So I think really that it is important to

It  could be a year out. So, well, let's say May 31st. But the audience for this is obviously,  it's not us. It's not, it may be us, but it's not consumers. It's developers. That's obvious. Now,  did they give any indication when developers might get the first?

There's basically a virtual environment inside of Xcode so that if  you're testing out this thing without having the hardware, you basically have like a 3D  first person shooter look at this fake from the thing they've developed inside of Xcode to  test it out in.

What is the calculation a developer has to make? They have to say, well,  do I have the skills? Do I have a product that would fit this category? And finally,  is there going to be a market for this a year or more out?

Transcript:  As a small developer, that's a hard conversation to have because it's a lot of investment with  not a large market. As a large developer, I mean, I've been doing immersive media for 30 years now.  So we've been building these things for a long time. And one of the things that's required to  make this work is to do a lot of it. So you can't think about how to make it work or how  it should interact until you've done it. And so for a lot of the larger developers and gaming  developers and infrastructural developers that want to get into this, they're going to build  a small division that just, if it doesn't work out, they'll reorganize those three or four people.  But there's going to be three, four, five, 10 people in a lot of Fortune 100 companies that are  figuring out what the next thing is and trying to make sure that they're not caught behind  because it is very complicated and not something you can come up to speed really quickly with.

It's that it will look at least as good as it did in the  theater. Let me ask about that because that's the distinction. Because Avatar is not stereoscopic.  Or is it? Yeah. Avatar and Avatar 2 are both stereoscopic. They're designed to be two eyes.

Start time: 2022.38

Speaker: Alex Lindsay

End time: 2087.22
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  The up-conversion won't be that great. But the... And there's lots and lots of movies that are  up-converted because that was a thing for a while. After Avatar came out, everybody built... For all  of us, I literally sent out an email this morning to a friend of mine who's got a couple 3D cameras  and like, hey, you might want to rebuild those. So you might want to build those and get them  put back together. He's got them sitting in pieces. But the issue is that there's a bunch  of things that'll be interesting in that development area. For instance, it'd be really convenient to  be able to show sports live. But it's really hard to get the rights to that. If only they had a  soccer or football or something that they could shoot in stereo that they could put into that.  Oh, wait, wait. So MLS becomes a lot more... Makes a lot more sense now.

End time: 2138.34
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  you can do a lot of it. I want to say this is where I feel there might be... In these early days,  Apple very much positioned both on stage and in the first introduction to developers,  the idea that even more whenever we saw apps from iPhone and iPad make their way to the Mac,  even more so, I don't think they're... The developers necessarily... I think the first  question they ask... You talked about the questions they should ask themselves. The first question  they ask is, do I need to do any development for Vision OS? Because so many developers can take the  apps they already have and just have them as part of a spaces workspace where it is just that slack  that they don't need to make use of the volumes and spaces. Go ahead.

Start time: 2138.72
End time: 2210.72
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  To your point, there's a lot of stuff that will be available to the user immediately without any  special development, but there is a lot of opportunity to build out something that is  really taking advantage of the platform. And those are the things that end up at the top of the store.  You can port your thing over, but what's going to end up in the  Vision store at the front page? And even when it's small, it's a lot of people willing to spend  money on it because this is the only place they can go buy that stuff. When you do something...  Elements was not the greatest app in the world ever made to talk about the elements. But when  it came out for the iPad, everybody I knew bought it because we were just like, it's $15 and we all  paid for it and we all wanted to see what they were doing in 3D and everything else.  That's going to be another opportunity for them to go back and grab that data.  Again, sports, you're probably going to see a bunch of stuff. Apple is probably going to dump  a lot of money into the market. I was the beneficiary of Google and Facebook doing that.  There's going to be a lot of people that are pushing... They're going to spend a lot of money  into that market to energize it and to prove and show models. And so I think that there's a lot.

Start time: 2211.88
End time: 2269.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do not doubt that Apple will pour billions of dollars, literally, literal billions.  For the next five years, for people who are doing the development and creating content.  And all sorts of stuff. Yeah. And that's... If you're going to say there's something in the  Vision Pros favor, it's that Apple is clearly all in on this thing. I mean, they must've spent 10  billion... Well, I mean... A year.  A year, right? That's what Meta spent. That's what Meta spent. So they must've spent $10  billion for the last decade. That's a lot of money on this thing. And I expect they will continue  spending significant amounts of money into the future. And I think that their reputation is a  reputational risk because if it's not a success, people are going to look at Tim Cook.  So they needed to succeed. I think that there's this fundamental thing that everybody seems to  ignore. People do not want to strap devices to their face. I think 70% of the population

Start time: 2271.16
End time: 2279.75
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  probably doesn't want to strap anything on their face. I think it's probably 70%, 70, 75%. But  30% of the population is still a lot of people. So this will be something for the 30%. And that

Start time: 2283.28
End time: 2330.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  will be enough of a market. It certainly will be financially enough of a market for Apple. Apple  doesn't have more than 30% of the smartphone market globally, but they have much more than the lion's  share of profit. So they can make money on it. I'm not saying they can't. I don't think this is  going to change the world. And the only reason I'm being so negative is because, and I knew this would  happen, you're going to see every pundit in the world swooning over this thing, especially people  who've tried it on. And there is something to swoon about. And we're going to take a break and  then come back and talk about the technology because it's really, this is Apple operating on  all eight cylinders. I mean, they've created something technologically amazing. I just,  I think it's worth pointing out that this is a yet to be demonstrated market.

Start time: 2332.98
End time: 2429.76
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  And for me, the thing that really, really sticks to my craw is that the iPhone is a small percentage  of the mobile market, but the market for people who actually own smartphones is phenomenal. It's  getting close to a hundred. No, no, that was a long, long process. I wouldn't agree with that.  But what I'm saying is that the development of the phone was such that they're so commoditized  and they're so useful and so relevant to daily life that if you are at the lowest income level,  the United States government will buy you a phone and set you up with a data plan just to make sure  that you can have an email address, just make sure you can get access to government services,  that sort of thing. If this platform, I'm not just limiting this to Apple, if this platform is for  people who could shell out a thousand bucks for this kind of a headset, that's not the aspirational  level of technology for the people who have the money to spend on something that may or may not  be actually useful. And Leo, you had one of the most important points that everyone who got the  demo today and yesterday has been swooning about Avatar 2 watching through this headset.  But would you rather watch Avatar 2 in 3D through this $3,500 headset alone or would you rather  watch it on the sofa with your spouse and your two children on a $400 4K TV set? Watching it as a  group together without having to buy everybody a thousand dollar headset is absolutely the more  enjoyable way to watch a movie. I think that's going to be true for a long, long time.

I'm not saying that there isn't,  but I'm still saying it's going to be a big deal. It's going to be a platform.  TK It's a big deal now. Leo  Bones I think that over the years, as they become much... There's going to be a high  performance version that keeps on staying at $3,500 and keeps on getting better. It might even go up  to more money and be even better than what we see here. There's going to be a less expensive  version that's going to... They're going to have less and less expensive versions like they've done  with every other product that they've made. They've made one that they could do at the price that they  sold it at. Then they go upwards and downwards from that. We can probably expect five years from now  to have one that's $800 and one that's $8,000. That's probably the direction Apple will take it.

Transcript:  TK The advantage that Apple has is that number one is that what it took to do this was an  incredible investment that almost no other company could afford.  Leo Bones Nobody could do this.  Number two is that they have the skill set to do hardware at this level that almost nobody else has.  Number three, I'm not nobody, but almost nobody, especially at that tolerance level.  Number three is that they have an entire ecosystem that they're setting up that they've  already set up for the last five or six years. That's tied into the hardware, to many, many  pieces of hardware, your AirPods, everything else is all tied into this experience.  And nobody else has that entire thing. And what Apple has been slowly doing over the  last couple of years is starting to play games. And this is the biggest, and I've said this,  I don't know, for the last five years, that Apple's number one problem is antitrust because  they've taken the size and ability that they have and they're basically playing games that  no one else can play. And they're going to go, we're going to play a game like the M1 chip.  TK And it's an argument for letting Apple get big,

Start time: 2670.04

Start time: 2674.42
End time: 2705.68
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I mean, there is no other company. But the problem for the rest of the industry is like,  you can't, there's no real answer to the M1 chips because you can't really get everybody to agree.  You know, like Apple owns everything that's required to make that work. And being a vertical  system is almost impossible to do. And you should never try to do it by yourself if you're a little  company, because that's almost suicide. But once you get over to the other side, you have no  competition. They have no competition in there, true competition in where they're going.

They've got, you know, the Ferrari is  still out there and getting down to the Yugo will be hard for their Honda to, for them to figure out.

The issue is, is that they're going to have a hard time going back to the other headsets. Like that's  going to be the thing that is going to be difficult is that they're going to have a hard time-  TK Well, start budgeting everybody because you're going to have to save up your pennies because-  TK I've got a giant piggy bank.  TK But what I say is that people will decide they can't afford that headset, but they're not going  to say, I can't afford that headset. So I'm going to buy the Facebook headset. They're going to,  or the Meta headset. They're going to say, I can't afford that. And I'm just not going to use  headsets like that. It's going to be, it's that much different than the other ones that are there.  That's the problem.

And then,  then another company says, Hey, that's great, but what if it could fit in a short pocket? What if it  costs half as much? And what if anybody could write software for it without having to pay a fortune  for a development kit? And then that's the platform that takes off for us.

And, you know, here I am sitting here  in the mud saying we're never getting to the stars, but we will talk about what is quite impressive  in terms of technology. And by the way, the Mac Pro was announced. Incidentally, and the 15-inch  MacBook Air, which is probably the only thing everybody's going to buy. I bought one. We'll  talk about that.

Our show today brought to you by, thank you,  everybody for putting up with my cranky crankiness. I'll calm down now. Our show  today brought to you by ACI Learning. Oh, man. I want to thank them. They are sponsored our  coverage yesterday of the Apple event, of the Microsoft events, the week before the Build  Keynotes. They, yes, sponsor the studios. They've really been very good to us. Thank you, ACI  Learning. And one of the reasons is because of our long relationship with IT Pro. Wait a minute,  you say, don't they compete with IT Pro? No, they are IT Pro. They've merged. IT Pro has been  our trusted sponsor for the last decade. And they, as you probably know, most of us have  experienced it, provide engaging, entertaining IT training to every one of our listeners.  As part of the ACI Learning family, IT Pro's capabilities will continue to impressively grow  now even more so. Highly entertaining, bingeable, short form content, about 20 to 30 minutes,  full transcriptions. You can watch them make it that the studios are open Monday through Friday,  nine to five. And you can go in the, just like you watch us live, you can go watch them live,  be in the chat room with them live. They have 7,000 hours of on-demand content. And the reason  those studios are running all day every day is because everything changes. The test change,  the search change, software changes. There's new software. So they keep up. And that's the nice  thing. You're getting the freshest content possible. 30% of ACI Learners are MSPs. Now,  I thought that was really interesting. I found that out the other day. That Managed Service  Providers, that's what we use. We don't have a full-time IT staff. We have Russell and his team.  He's an MSP. And ACI Learning is great for MSPs. The MSPs love the practice labs that ACI Learning  offers. They test and experiment before deploying new apps or updates without compromising their  production systems, which is really nice because all you need is an HTML5 browser. You can even  do it on a Chromebook or iOS device if you want to, and then run instances of Windows Server and  desktop clients. And I always say, and I say it because I mean it, because I did it. If you'd make  a mistake, you just close the tab and you're back to square. It's okay. You didn't harm anybody.  They also have, I love this practice exam so you can prepare for your certification  examinations by taking the test before you take the test. That is the best way, I think,  to get people used to the test format, how it's going to be. You can get the knowledge,  but having the experience of taking the test ahead of time really makes a difference. One happy MSP  team leader said, and I quote, I had 110 engineers in the field. We had dozens of IT Pro accounts.  Last year alone, they passed over 40 certs. Whatever your business, whatever your IT team,  you know you need to keep them up to date. It's a benefit that keeps them employed. And by the way,  keeping them employed is a high priority these days. Plus, they love learning more and they  will benefit you because your company, your business, your MSP will be more secure, more  effective. ACI learning. You know how I know that people love ACI training? The average view dropout  rate on most training videos is about 70%. Only 30% make it through to the end of the video.  With ACI learning, 80% make it through to the end of the video because the videos are compelling,  they're entertaining, and even more importantly, they're valuable. You're getting what you need  from them. So don't settle for subpar training. You can use ACI's Learn Pro Portal to assign courses,  upskill your MSPs, manage seats, assign and unassign team members. You'll get great graphical  views of how it's going. Retain top talent, upskill your team with IT Pro training from ACI  learning. ACI learning courses are easy to navigate, so much more straightforward than traditional  training programs and they fit your style and your needs. And by the way, ISO certified. You're  getting the world-class training your team deserves. Ask that of the other guys. Right now, as an  individual, you get 30% off if you use the offer code TWIT30. That's for a standard or premium  individual IT Pro membership. Don't worry, great discounts for group learning for teams from 2 to  1,000. The volume discount is down at five seats across audit, IT and cybersecurity readiness.  ACI learning has premium training options waiting for you. Go.acilearning.com slash twit. Go.acilearning.com  slash twit for more information and a free two-week training trial for your team. That's enough to  complete everything you need for a cert, actually, if you work hard at it. Go.acilearning.com slash  twit. Thank you, ACI learning. We appreciate your support. I've really been impressed reading through  you know, of course, we saw a half-hour video, but reading through later the articles,  Lance's article in TechRadar, Marques Brownlee's video about the technology really,  that's what most oppresses me. It strikes me as A plus technology, 4K screens. They said  postage stamp sized. Is that, that seems smaller. Large post stamps, I think. Okay, a big postage  stamp. Plus, if you need a correction, if you wear glasses, Zeiss lenses that are magnetically

Yeah, you can wear your contacts if you want, but I think you'd want to wear those  lenses. It's a fovea. This is really cool. I was hoping they would do this. The rumors were they  would do this as a foveated display. Alex, you better explain what that is. Yeah, a foveated

Start time: 3289.84
End time: 3380.40
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  renderer, basically what it does is it's looking at, there's basically static or dynamic. So,  a static foveated renderer is going to be a renderer that assumes that you're not going to  look to the sides. And so it's going to render, it's going to focus all of the resolution,  possibly frame rate, all into the center of this or the center of where it thinks you're looking at.  What Apple appears to have is a dynamic foveated renderer and that dynamic foveated renderer  follows your eyes. So it's literally watching your eyes moving around the screen and where the  center of your focus is, which is actually a pretty small area of focus. It is making sure that you  get all the resolution that you can possibly, that you need or that it can provide there.  And then as you move away into your periphery, it starts to lower that resolution and potentially  even frame rate away. So mostly resolution, most likely in that area. And so by doing that,  it allows it to take limited resources. Obviously we had unlimited resources. We would not use a  foveated renderer. We would just make everything really sharp. By having a foveated renderer,  what we're able to do is have just the resolution that you need at any given moment. And it appears  that Apple has done this very well. I mean, if you don't do it well, you see it as you move your  eyes quickly. Yeah, yeah, it would be weird. Start to see edges and so on and so forth. But in this  case, it sounds like they've done a pretty good job of it. And that means that that's part of what  allows them to have such a high resolution for those is that the resolution of the screens is  that high, but how many bits it's actually sending to those screens at any given time  is much lower, which takes a lot of weight off of the processors.

Transcript:  These are micro, by the way, I think foveated rendering might help with the comfort as well.  I suspect and maybe even with nausea because it's going to give you the sense of peripheral vision,

Start time: 3394.04
End time: 3451.20
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  right? Much more natural. The thing with nausea is primarily frame rate. So that is the thing that  a lot of people are on a lot of R&D. 12 milliseconds. Yeah. Yeah. So 12 milliseconds are about 83 frames  a second, but that's where most people have an issue is in there's two things that can cause  nausea. One is that your inner ear and your basically, basically most nausea is related  to your inner ears feeling something that your eyes aren't seeing. That's what happens with  seasickness. Yeah. Yeah. Is that your eyes aren't seeing because for a million years before we did  all this other stuff, if your eyes were seeing something different than your inner ear, you had  been poisoned by something you just ate and you need to get it all out of the system as fast as  possible. And so we had a natural, people who survived had a natural reaction to throw up  when they did that. And so what happens with low frame rate is that you,  so the thing that happens with low frame rate is that your eyes are behind, which is another

End time: 3456.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3457.24
End time: 3486.52
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  body says there's something wrong here. And it's very subtle. It's, you know, Disney did a bunch  of research on this in the nineties and, you know, with big onyx boxes and everything else,  and they would turn the frame rate up and down to see for rides, when do you blow chunks? And  it was, you know, between 12 and 18, depending on the person, about 12 to 18 frames a second,  at 12 frames a second, no one could hold it. There's also the issue of the difference between

Start time: 3486.84
End time: 3499.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the focal length that your eyes are saying by triangulation versus your actual focus distance.  And those are not going to match because the screens are close, but the objects look

Start time: 3500.02
End time: 3632.24
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But the apparent, what it appears for you is important in that area. You know, because the  reality is when you're looking through glasses, you're looking through something like that.  You're looking at something that's right in front of you that is sharpening what's out there. So  it's where we're focused to in that area. But the issue is that the frame rate, as well as the other  thing that matters a lot, and this is where they're going to have trouble with 3D movies, is that  the, if you change the orientation of the camera, you know, a lot, or even a fair bit in 3D,  you'll get sick because we used to do this. We had this thing in one of the 360 shots that we did,  it was stereo. At the end, my brother was Steadicam. He'd get to the end of the walk and  they'd turn the Steadicam sideways. And it always told us when that person got to that part of the  Oculus test, because they would take the headset off immediately. They'd pull it up. They're like,  oh, you're done. Anyway, so you can't change it. And where that becomes a problem is, you have to  make content for... This is why it's important to do a lot of content. Making content for these  headsets is completely different than making content for TV because you actually have to slow  down the edits. You can't, for some people, especially at higher frame rates, you can't  have big moves, big helicopter moves, jib moves, shaky camera. All those things are going to affect  people's experience of the piece. And so you have to build the content. Eventually, people are going  to not be building content that they're trying to take to the theater and to the headsets.  Oh, interesting.  What you're going to start seeing is you're going to start seeing high frame rate, at least 60 frames  a second, possibly 120 eventually. But high frame rate content has less cameras, possibly only one  camera experiencing those things and slowing everything down because that's what people are  going to like. And that's also why the cameras on the headset are going to be really good. As  soon as people realize they can't treat the headset like they treat their cell phone, which is like  they'll go up and down like this and be dancing. When people put those headsets on to shoot their  kids or whatever they want to shoot film in 3D, they're going to have to think like a camera  person and not move their head very much.

Transcript:  7.5 micron pixels, 23 million on two panels. If I do my math correctly, that's 11.5 million  per panel. That means 4K, roughly 4K. Three element lenses as well. They said that's a big  deal. I don't know why that's a big deal. But anybody stop me. I'm just going to keep going  through the specs and you stop me if you have something to add. M2 in this, of course, it'll  be an M3 next year and M4 and no, no, no. Actually, it's interesting because if it comes out next year,  it probably should be an M3. They might end up shipping it with an M3, I would imagine.  And a new chip that Apple's designed called the R1, which sounds like a DSP. It's designed to  support all the inputs, the cameras and so forth, and keep that responsive.

Start time: 3752.28
End time: 3772.62
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of amazing. I mean, the R1 is an amazing chip. And it gets back into,  you have to know a lot about chip design to build something that is built, really purpose  built for this headset. And not a lot of companies could put that together.  And again, I think that that's part of what makes this thing work.

Transcript:  S1 I don't have any. No, I think that, I mean, I think we've talked about this for a long time.  I think that Epic's lawsuit with Apple was an epic failure.  TK Yes. It should support the Unreal Engine, but it won't.  Alex Well, it's not just that Unreal could have done this. Unreal was being brought up on stage  every keynote for a couple years as Apple built up towards this. They obviously knew where Apple  was going with this. They were building into it, and they decided that taking a high-risk  maneuver was more important than what they were getting added onto and opened up the lawsuit.  You know, the thing is, is that most of us didn't, we had forgotten that Unity really did anything.  By the time the lawsuit started, we had kind of forgotten Unity. I'd done a lot of Unity  development. Then as soon as this happened, all of us were kind of like, well, we'll see what  Apple does with Unity. The question really was, is Apple going to build its own development platform,  or whether it's going to use Unity? It looks like it's a bit of both. Apple's building up  their own capacity to do that, but they've taken a relatively solid path, which is they can't fix

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  That would be the best case. There's been so many memes done of Mark Zuckerberg wearing headsets  and stuff like that, that I think that Apple probably just said, we don't want to be those  memes. And we don't want to be the ones that they put those pictures on. I think that's probably why

Start time: 4064.52
End time: 4103.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  they did it. Well, now they're going to have creepy eye memes. I think there's memes awaiting  no matter what you do, to be honest with you. Those eyes are generated from the scan that you  do with the LIDAR on your smartphone, on your iPhone initially. And that also creates your  avatar for use in FaceTime. I have to say the FaceTime usage is not compelling. It's not like,  they did this because they didn't want to do what Meta did with the spaces and the feet,  the legs are missing and all that. Those people are not in the room with you. They're on a screen.  So basically you're just seeing a FaceTime screen with- I thought that that demo was the

Start time: 4104.18

Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Yes. And I think that this was the one place where I felt there was a mistake done in the keynote,  which is they chose later on in the technology portion to talk about what you looked like in a  FaceTime call. So I kid you not, when they first showed off FaceTime using it, everybody was so  distracted talking to one another going, so what do I look like in it? What do I look like? No one  was paying attention. No one was paying attention. We were all asking questions. We were all  processing in our head. How is it possible that we look? And then they finally addressed it. I  think that that was a mistake because it took everybody out of the moment where up to that  point you heard these oohs and ahs. Suddenly there was this murmur of why are they not telling us  what we look like in this view? And I- They should have focused through the presentation

And I think everybody in our audience, and I bet  you everybody in this theater was saying, the calculator? Oh, I thought it was Xcode.  Wasn't the calculator, it was health. But we'll get to that. I hope. Yeah. But yeah,  there's only eight hours in the day, but if we can, we'll get to that.

Transcript:  But actually just quickly going back to iView, you are right that the trick, if we have that  roadside picture of Jesus with the eyes following you, it's the same technology. It's a lenticular  display so that if people look you from one side, they'll see the side of your face. They look at  you from straight ahead. But yeah, when I'm wearing that and our housekeeper comes into vacuum,

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  supposed to work. I like the idea of it. I like that they're thinking about, well, how do I interact  with people in the room? How do people know that, hey, look, I'm actually got the knob turned all  the way to, I don't want to see anybody in the room. So don't try to, don't think that you're  actually making eye contact with me versus how do I give myself a sense of feeling of presence? But  just like with those avatars, it seems like the risk of looking incredibly dorky with this,  because this technology kind of works. It works admirably well, but not well enough. I think the  risk is very, very, very high. I do think that the, I did notice one thing that kind of got me  interested in the avatars that they mentioned that they can also represent you basically if you're  if there are people who are just using a regular Mac or regular iPhone to FaceTime with you,  your avatar will be just basically, will be you in their view of you in the FaceTime call.  It made me wonder if that couldn't be something that I could use even if I didn't actually have  the headset on. Like if I owned it and I've, or in some way or form, I've created this avatar,  but it's like, I don't want, I want to do my, I don't want to have to find a hoodie,

Start time: 4280.30

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  that was a feature. Yeah. That's definitely a feature, but what I'm wondering is that if it  will work, if again, if I don't own one of these things, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. Because

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think that what's interesting, if there was ever a zigzag, I think it's actually that face,  that face there, because I think that I really felt like Memojis was building up to be you.  Yeah, no kidding. When you want to be virtual. And then it felt like, because the problem is,  is that the uncanny valley level of that is going to be like, even just seeing the demo at its best  quality, I could see the weirdness that happened in that. It was very, you know, Polar Express,  you know, like, you know, it was Polar. Uncanny Valley. That's the poster child for uncanny valley.  So I just think that, I think that it was, it's so close. And the problem is I would, if I had the  choice of scanning my face and being in there or being my Memoji, and I think this is one thing  that Apple really has done well is Apple has the only Memojis or style like that, that looks,  that potentially looks better than you do when you put them on. Whereas all the other ones are kind  of like a, you know, Metas and, and a Snap and everything else. They make ones that they all  like a dorky, pretty dorky version of you. And, and I think that Apple, Apple has actually done a  really good job with the emojis. Now we're kind of throwing that out and doing something that's  going to be, I'd rather be a cartoon than be something that's really close to my, to my face.

Transcript:  You know, so the other thing I thought was way advanced ahead of anything anybody else is doing,  there is no physical controllers. It's looking at your hands and you don't have to put your  hands in front of you. Your hands can be in your lap and the gestures, similar to the gestures  Microsoft proposed for the HoloLens, but a lot, it looked like a lot more effective because,  and this is, I think the most cool thing, it's tied to your eye tracking. So they have, it sounds  like very sophisticated eye tracking because the interface requires, if you want to say, click an  icon that you look at the icon, the icon, once it sees you looking at it, pulses a little bit.  And then you tap two fingers together anywhere, like on your lap, and you click it.

Transcript:  Your eyes are the cursor. Marques Brownlee said similarly, you could look at a field  and then start talking and it would automatically, just as it does on the Apple TV, when you press  the button, it would automatically fill in the field with text. I think that's pretty innovative  and does solve a problem that other headsets have. And it really, you know, one of the things I  really find puzzling, Meta's talked a lot about this, Microsoft talked a lot about this, Apple did  too, is the use of these devices, not as entertainment devices, but as productivity tools. And if,  and, and, you know, that's why the HoloLens had flicks and swipes and all sorts of weird gestures.  They had a gun gesture. And I don't know if that's really what anybody wants to do for a living.

Start time: 4459.40

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Oh, and for HoloLens, they had, the HoloLens had a deltoid problem, which is that your shoulders.  Yeah, absolutely. You had to be up in front of it. So you had to hold your arms up for,  again, if you're going to use it for a long period of time, two hours or something, it's not a big  deal to do this every once in a while. It's a big deal if you're going to do it for two hours,  you're going to be up like this. So being able to sit there and do what you want to do.

Transcript:  Fatigue is an issue in general with all of these, which is how long do you want to wear this thing?  It's going to get sweaty on your face. I don't care what kind of custom muff you've made,  what kind of fans you have. And, and then there's the issue of, you know, it's just kind of an  uncomfortable setting. So Apple really has solved this by making sure that you can't wear it for

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  The people who, the people who got the demo say that it actually kind of twists and locks  into the helmet, which kind of, which kind of, which kind of makes sense because  you're moving around. Yeah. You don't want to, well, not, not, well, not only that,  but if it disconnects, you're suddenly completely blind. Exactly. Cause you don't have,  you don't have see-through that's actually just cameras. They're, they're doing that.  So they would want that to be locked in. Although that does, I wonder how much discussion they had  on how long does this tether have to be to the battery because they're going to be, if we, if  you have to say a requirement of using this device is that you have to have a shirt with a pocket in  it or you have to have clothes that have pockets in it. That's going to be a problem. Oh, I can't

Transcript:  Yeah, that, that, that is what, that is one of the few things that I, that I spotted. Like I wonder  if they're waffling here. They said that you can use it all day. They didn't, but like, like I kind  of alluded to, did they say that theoretically it will, it can draw power all day or do they,  are they saying that? No, no, no, it's not ever going to overheat and give you a thermal shutdown  like, like the other headsets do after a certain amount of time. That will be, I'm sure, I'm sure  they don't have that answer today and they will have the exact next year when it launches. Then  we'll know what all day there's, there's, there's gotta be a reason why these demos last 30 minutes,  but then they kicked the hell out after 32 minutes. Like take it off, take it off now.  For God sakes. While they hose you down. We studied thousands of heads said Apple that

Well, and I know it's a number of tweets and  social posts from people who said, you know, I've been working on this for, you know, my,  somebody said my 30% of my life and I'm really glad to see it out. Finally, I do not want to in  any way, criticize anybody who worked on this. You have done brilliant work. It's amazing what  you've created. You've taken a product category that was really not very acceptable and at least  raised it to the level that people want to wear it. I am not, I am not quibbling with that whatsoever.  It's very impressive what Apple's done. I'm just thinking from the point of view of a product,  if it's going to be a popular and only time will tell that. Yeah. Yeah. I've, you know, I will be,  I've kind of gone out on a limb here being Mr. Cranky, but I will be  sincerely surprised if in a few years, this is, this is something people are wearing. I will be.

Transcript:  No, I'm glad this is part of the conversation because there, this is, this is Apple is so  good at running these events. They're designed to dazzle people who don't have a lot of time to  really sit and think they really have to publish like that day. And so there is a lot of stuff that  is like, Oh my God, it's so bright. It's so shiny. I'm glad to see that in a lot of, and most of the  hands-on stuff that I've, uh, uh, writings that I've seen, it is, it is very balanced about how I  was really impressed with it. But the thing is I did, my head was a little tired after 30 minutes.  When I took it off after 30 minutes, it was kind of disorienting going back to the real world,  balanced by, Hey, I can actually take notes on my phone. That's how good like I could see through.  We have to make sure that we know that what we're seeing is kind of like what we saw on the very  first iPhone demo. We're seeing the further they pulling it out of the barn, all nice and shiny  and bright. So putting it on the, on that little turntable so that we can all take a look at it  and take pictures of it. This is not the time for where it's even possible to really rate what it  can do, how practical it is and how people are going to be able to even tolerate it on their  heads. That's going to come probably in December when Marques Brownlee and I, Justine get there

If you're going to watch, I didn't see all of them.  I didn't see Justine's, but, uh, if you're going to watch one, I think that was a pretty good one  to watch.

Transcript:  hundreds of billions of dollars. And even, you know, the other thing that's unknown, even if it  isn't something that people want now, Apple's going to spend so much marketing money. You're  going to see ads on football like you've never seen. Right. I've already seen ads in social media  places. Sure. It's a little weird to spend any money on advertising now since they don't have a  product, but I think come this fall, depending on when they really plan to ship this, uh, you're  to start really seeing a blitz. I mean, if you spend a hundred billion dollars developing a product,  you can spend $10 billion advertising it. $10 billion is a lot of ad time. And by the way,  I just like to say as negative as I've been about the Vision Pro, we certainly would love some  advertising dollars. A hundred million. That's all we ask a fraction. Well, I can say,  you're not going to get it by saying talking the way you're talking. You know what? That's the  beauty of this is I don't have anybody's ass to kiss. And, uh, you know, Apple wrote me off years  ago, probably rightly so. Uh, and I'm going to be honest. That's all. Uh, it wasn't surprising to  any of you that not once was the word or the letters AI uttered. Not once. They said machine  learning, but that was it. And that's interesting because I have now the page from, uh, the, uh,  the, uh, the tracks, uh, at WWC up on my screen. And yeah, there's a whole big ML and vision track,  including detecting animal poses, discovering machine learning enhancements and create ML  and lifting subjects from images in your app. But obviously there's a lot of AI in or machine,  really AI is a terrible term. So let's say machine learning. That's actually really a better term,  uh, in everything in this, uh, in this vision pro. I mean, it's, it's, it's doing a lot of work,  right? Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Uh, all right. One more break. And then I think we should, unless,  okay, I'll, I'll, I'll do a break in a bit, but anything else, anybody wants to say about the  vision pro and Apple's vision for this scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. I went through my, uh, my  notes, you know, my, uh, my outline. I do, I do have to say Craig Federighi.  It's a living God. Uh, he was very much looking for the dad joke moment. Uh, of course,  last time it was running his fingers through his hair as he ran from one set to the other.  This time it's playing. Is that real? You think that I guess it is.

And I like to know what they couldn't talk about  yet because they can't promise it, but might eventually be interesting. I also think they

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  any documents. Um, but, but before, before we move off, the last thing I wanted to say was just that  I'm actually kind of intrigued about the people that are going to buy it at least as there's,  there's, everyone's going to have like a pie chart of how they justify the $3,500. And it's  kind of, they're going to say, Oh, $600 for watching videos, $400 cause it'll be a nice  thing for, uh, for gaming, uh, $800 because I've really wanted to develop for this. But I think  that one of, for a lot of people, one of the biggest pieces of the, of the pie chart are going  to be being able to do spatial photography and spatial video. Uh, the idea of being able to record  the scenes around you, not because you're, you're, you're creating models or that you're making  scenery for some other project, but just to capture something in the greatest fidelity.  I agree that, Oh my God, if you're playing, if you're spending your limited time on this earth  with your adorable three-year-old child and you have this big half of a watermelon on your face,  I don't, I think you, I think you're parenting. I think you're making it.  I don't think it's, I don't think it's, but when I'm, I'm sorry, but, but just, just to finish off,  but the, uh, I still remember a number of years ago, I tested, uh, and wrote a, wrote a review of  Sony had these digital, uh, HD 3d binoculars where it was looked like very, very traditional  binoculars, but essentially each half was essentially a, a, a, a HD camcorder that was  giving you video. And the number of times, and during the month that I had it, I would do things  like I would be at Faneuil hall and I would just with my binoculars be watching like a street  performance and then to be back like in my house and put these things up to my face and to be  watching this again in 3d with decent, with decent video and everything. That was a powerful,  thing. And so the idea, if, if $3,500 is going to be a bit rich, but I could see somebody who,  okay, if I, if I, if I had made better professional and or financial decisions 20 years ago  and I had that kind of money to spend, I would be really keen to buy again, 40% of that pie would be,  I just want to take shots of where I am right now, not to replace my life, but because later on,  I think I'm going to be enjoy the fact that I have these like immersive 3d recordings of this

Start time: 5186.08

Transcript:  space that I'm in that I like. And I think that the other thing is, is that I, I, so I thought  that was one of the most compelling things about Google glass was that I could look up and I could  say, you know, Google take a video or whatever, and it would start to record. And I have these  incredible little videos that I found. I just found recently on my Google account of my kids,  when they're much younger, from my point of view, now only in 2d and 720p, I'm going to assume that  this is going to capture the video probably pretty close to the resolution that I'm looking  at it at 4k, because they can do that with their phone little, you know, the phone can do it.  So they can probably do it there. If I'm getting those, there's, there's two things there. One is  that there's going to be a, I think an interesting market for shooting things that you want to  experience. Another thing is to shoot things of the family. And when other people have these  headsets, you know, I think that shooting for them will be also interesting. And I think you're going  to see people going to a sporting event or other things and shooting something for someone that's  in 3d that is all there and they can then watch it as if they were as if they were there. And I  think that's going to be an interesting little model that that occurs there. It's going to be

Start time: 5251.08
End time: 5293.68
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  an interesting driver for when the people the first adopters will be shooting all this video.  And maybe a lot of people when it comes down to 1500, and they're like, Oh, I really wish  we're $1,000. But now that I see that, oh, this is there are these three or four different VR  channels that people are telling me about, about people who were at live events that recorded  really, really well. And finally, finally, I did the I did think that since you mentioned it,  I did think that was really, really interesting, because that was the exact same demo that was in  like the intro of Google Glass, like, Hey, I'm a mother and I'm watching I'm wearing I'm able to  play with my child, have eye contact with her play with her while still like capturing this moment in  video without feeling as though like I'm parked behind a camcorder. So I thought that was an  interesting bit of like cross cross pollination. Glass was a little bit more transparent,

You know, Apple announced some things that people actually want,  believe it or not, and can get importantly can even buy. We'll talk about that in just a bit.  With our fabulous panel, our show today, fabulous brought to you by zip recruiter. Did you know,  this is a wild stat on average, it takes 11 weeks to hire for an open position, 11  weeks. That's almost three months. That's a quarter. That's all that's time that everybody  else has to work extra hard to fill in the gaps. That's the amount of time, 11 weeks that the  manager, your boss or you, if you're the boss has to go through this kind of not pleasant process of  finding people. Do you really have that kind of time? No, no, but good news. You don't have to.  If you're listening today, I got some great advice for you. Do what we do. We had an opening in our,  I mentioned this before in our continuity department when our wonderful Ashley decided to,  you know, she wanted to work a little closer to home. She had a long commute.  So she gave us two weeks notice. We immediately, I remember Lisa doing this. It was a breakfast,  went to zip recruiter. We've done it many times before, posted the job.  Within literally an hour or two, we started getting, I love it because Lisa's very, you know,  it's stressful. She's going, oh, what are we going to do? I don't know. We're going to admit it.  We're down a person. It's going to be very hard. Two weeks from now, I'm going to have to work,  you know, eight hours extra, whatever. Within an hour after posting, she said, oh, this person's,  oh, this person's, we ended up getting, I think three or four, really, it was very tough.  We chose the best though, Viva. We love you. And we're so glad we got to work with you.  And we're so glad we use zip recruiter. Stop waiting. Start using zip recruiter.  Zip recruiter can help you find qualified candidates for all your roles fast. And right  now you could try it for free. Ziprecruiter.com slash Mac break. There's so many things to love  about zip recruiter. I'll tell you some of the ones that we love. One, you're posting the large,  you know, you're casting a broad net, the largest possible group of people. Because if you, if you  agree, the right person is there somewhere, you got to reach them. Right? So one post on zip  recruiter goes to a hundred plus job boards. It goes to social networks. It goes everywhere.  Now you've cast a wide net, but you might say, in fact, if you've ever done this before,  I know what you're saying. You're saying, but I don't want them all to call me.  Are they going to all email me? No, it doesn't. No, that's the beauty of it.  It all goes into the zip recruiter interface. They even reformat resumes. So they all, they're  easily scanned because they're all in the same format. They even allow you to add screening  questions, true, false, multiple choice, even essays. So you can screen out people who just  don't fit right away. You don't waste any time looking at those. And then you can quickly  rank the people, eliminate the ones that don't fit, hire the right one fast. It's so great. So  that's, that's one thing I love about zip recruiter. Another one though, that's really amazing. They  use their, this is, they have more than a million current resumes on file because people come to  zip recruiter looking for work, right? So they use their powerful matching technology to quickly find  and send the most qualified people to you. So in addition to the applications you're going to get,  you're also going to get a message from zip recruiter saying, Hey, look, we found these  five people who seem to fit their, your needs. Maybe you'd want to talk to them. And then you  look at who you like and you invite those people. Those people, by the way, really are great because  they're going to respond to you. They're so flattered that you ask, they show up for the  interviews. It's really great. I think it's no surprise that four out of five employers who post  on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day. Frankly, we got them within the  first hour. Speed up your hiring process with zip recruiter. See why 3.8 million businesses  have come to zip recruiter for their hiring needs.

Wasted no time to leap into the thing I care the most about. And we had heard that they might  announce a Mac book air 15 inch and indeed they did. And the words that warmed me to the  bottom of my heart, pre-order today, shipping next week. I ordered immediately and mine comes  next Tuesday. Nice. What color? So I have like you, in fact, this is why I didn't really need this. I  have the M two midnight blue, but my daughter needs a new computer. That's my excuse. So,  so I'm going to get it because she has a really old Mac book here. So I'm going to give her this one  and I got the 15 inch, but I, I couldn't bring myself to get the midnight because of the  fingerprint problem. Fair enough. And at least I got a Mac book pro that was silver like old school.  And I thought, wow, I remember those days. I thought for nostalgia reasons, I wished I had

So I had this on my lap. I put my  hands on about burned my hands. Luckily, as the event went on, the sun moved behind us. So it  wasn't as much of an issue, but Dan Moran had the silver one.

Really actually you don't even need this is exactly the  same as the 13.3. It's just a little bit bigger. And interestingly, I did some calculations. I was  very pleased to see same dots per inch as the 13.6, which means I'm going to get an inch more.  I'm going to get about 200 pixels more top to bottom. So that's an inch more. And I think  a little more than an inch on the sides. So it will give me more real estate. I was worried that  the dots per inch, the pixels per inch were going to go down. And so it would just be bigger icons,

I think the 15 inch, they're smart to do this. It's like,  there will be a real market for it. They also are giving you a 10 core GPU, which was a, one of the  things you had to do in a, in an upsell, a build order for the, the 13.6 inch. And they're giving  you the six speaker sound system that the MacBook pro has. That was one thing I was unhappy with on  the MacBook air was the sound wasn't great.

It's definitely not a pro computer.  It's not like, and I don't think we have any mistakes as pro users that we should be using  in an air to do what we do. But the M two is so good.

You know, I would, I would love to  add an eighth of an inch to it and have it last 50% longer or a hundred percent longer.  Cause you know, when you're typing in numbers, it's, it's 18 hours or whatever, but when I'm  rendering in compressor or central 4d, it's like three hours. And so I, so when, so, so I need to,  you know, I, we definitely need, you know, I think the Mac pros, I'd love to see them get beefier and  thicker and more powerful and have the airs continue to hold that space so that Apple's not  trying to do the same thing with both of them. This is the garage band iMovie computer. You're  looking at the final cut logic computer. And I'll be honest, final cut and logic, I'm sure would run  for many small projects would run just fine on the air where it becomes problematic is again, when,  when you start to do long renders, it's going to be heat. You know, there's going to be some heat  throttling there on long renders as well as the lack of Thunderbolt ports is a big deal. Cause one  of them is power. I think it has, it has a, no, it has a MagSafe. So it's MagSafe plus two.

Transcript:  gigabytes of Ram is not enough. It's, it, it's pretty good. I mean, like there's not that many  people. I mean, well, when you get into really big renders and photogrammetry and other things  like that, there's an in science calculations. And so there's a bunch of things that you have  to hold all in Ram at one time. And so one 92 can be limited, but that, that market is crazy small.  There's one thing to be small market. And then there's to be a tiny, tiny little market that,  that would need that, that much more Ram. But, but I do think that, that for the most part, 192 is a  pretty, I mean, it's amazing. I had to write a three page paper to go from 128 megabytes of Ram  to 192 megabytes of Ram megabytes for star wars. And that's what I was rendering. And so 192 is

So, you know,  that's stunning. Yeah, that's a lot for a GPU. They mentioned it on the feature quilt for the  Mac studios, but it's, I think also true of all M2s, there's a neural engine. And the key on this  is very interesting because Microsoft, which is still stuck with Qualcomm and Intel  has been hurting because of this. They've been talking about NPUs for a long time.  They coined the term neural processing unit, but only the Qualcomm chips have NPUs. They're waiting  for this fall when Intel will announce Meteor Lake and put out an NPU based Intel platform.  So Apple has a real advantage because all of their hardware now comes with a neural processing.  Engine. That's a big deal. I think not for generating, not, you don't use it for generating  models, but you use it for all of the kinds of things running. Yeah. It's kind of wild. How much

So Moore's law when sort of modern computer architecture  folks have tried to look at how to sort of keep that vision alive, they have turned increasingly  to these neural engines as a way to sort of figure out how to bridge the gap between how much smaller  we can now make transistors versus what we would expect to see according to Moore's law. And so,  yes, it's an every aspect of your use of the machine where that neural engine is trying to  do things in a way that is smarter, which then makes it work faster, makes it process better.  31.6 trillion operations per second.

Lisa got the Macs M1 and these are way faster than I need. So these  are impressive. I didn't ask this. Did they increase the number of displays the Mac book  air could handle? No, they did not.

I mean, I think that the big, the only thing that  you really, what you get with the pro as you, as you start to move up is the, is the increased  number of lanes of, of Thunderbolt and the PCI's, the slots, you know, so have been able to add six  cards for IO and being able to have a lot more, I, a lot more lanes for the Thunderbolt or the big,

Start time: 6343.40

The M two ultra, uh,  Mac studio is meant to be the one for people, for companies or whomever who don't want to do a lot  of thinking that who just wants to, I need to, I need the machine that just does what I needed to  do.

Start time: 6439.56
End time: 6483.76
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And I love that. I love what Apple did there, which is that we don't feel like we're getting  less to buy a studio. We can break out the, the, the Mac studio and have it be a great computer  to do. If I'm a three, if I'm doing 3d rendering, I feel like I can just go to the Mac studio as  easily as I could go to the Mac pro. But if I need to do video IO, then I know that I need the Mac.  I probably want the Mac pro because I'm now going to, um, want all like when I do a video  production with my studio, like if I'm using memo live and I, you know, wire all those things in,  I'm using literally every port on the studio. Like it is every, there's a wire going into each  one of those for the monitor outs, the camera ends, the, all the other things, you know, I would much  rather, that's the kind of thing I'd rather do on a Mac pro. And you are paying for that capability.

Start time: 6565.30
End time: 6570.10

Transcript:  So the, the most expensive, the most expensive M2 ultra Mac pro is $40,000 cheaper according to  the verge than the maxed out Intel version. I think that's probably the Ram. Cause the Intel  one would go to two, two and a half terabytes of Ram. Right. It was, it was, it was a lot more  something insane. Yeah. Something insane, but something, something. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean,  it's apples and oranges at that point. People though, so tell me about this. This is the issue,  I think the Jeep, the discrete GPU, even though you have PCI bus on there, what can you put in

Start time: 6610.00
End time: 6742.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  those slots? I mean, well, like video cards, you know, for one, so video and audio, I, O cards are  all things that you would, it's really, I think that that's the, I don't know if that's the only  market, but that's the biggest market. You can also put in more hard drive. You can put in solid  state hard drive, you know, yeah. So you can put in these MVM, very large MVME cards that are like  32 terabytes or whatever that you can drop into there. So there's definitely some, you know,  but IO drive systems, network systems, you know, but things getting in and out of the computer,  it's not going to do a GP, which is unfortunate. I mean, a lot of us wish that we could put an  Nvidia card in because there's a bunch of like custom processes in the Nvidia. You've got CUDA  cores and you know, you can't, but that's never going to happen. So the, but so the, you know,  but I, but I, you know, it's not that we don't want them. We just stop thinking about it. So  it's too far away. But the, but the, I think that it's, it's, it's, you know, you have an incredible  workhorse of, you know, like, so for instance, we were talking about it this morning on office hours  that, that zoom, you know, if, if we, if we could get enough bandwidth, we could pull 48, 48  individual 1080P signals out of that computer with the cards. You just drop the cards in that we buy  sonnet boxes for right now. And you'd have one box pulling 48 and which sounds crazy unless you're  doing a virtual event, you know, so if you're doing an event, you want to grab everybody and be able  to jump between everybody and move around having all those ISOs might, you know, might make sense.  So, so those are the things, but right now there's other, other limitations, but it's,  it's not for a very specific, you know, it absolutely is. Well, and it's going to be, it's,  so yes, it's going to be for what it should be is for a very specific group of people. But you know,  I live in Marin and you know, the, the, there's a lot of Jeeps in Marin and they are all super  clean. They're not going off road. No one's using that Jeep for what the way I mean, they have,  and we're talking about the Rubicon's, you know, there's a lot of Rubicon's in Marin that are  pristine, you know? And so, and they even have all the rigs and everything else. So there's a market  there for the folks that I would buy for that case. If I, if I had more money than sense,

You can, you can put enough,  enough hard drive space into that, into the computer that, that you can get yourself into  an enormous amount of trouble.

The movie basically was deleted and then they  went to the backups and the backups weren't good because they had it misconfigured. ELT. They thought  they were going to lose the movie. Right? Right. Then somebody says, you know, I was  bringing this at home, working at home. I think I have all the files at home.  She probably had the promise 32 terabyte. I mean, how big is Toy Story 2? Anyway, they rushed over  to her house, put the computer like in a egg carton, you know, and brought it back and cross  their fingers because that's like years of work down the tubes. They saved Toy Story 2.

That's why she was  working at home. And of course, you know, you know how the poor, the person who deleted everything,  it was like the classic, entering a certain line that says, oh, I just delete everything from this  folder. And then he puts a hyphen in there. There's an, oh no, do this recursively to every  single volume that's attached. Like, oh dear. So Galen Sussman saved the movie in 1998 because she

But I think that they  definitely, the Mac mini is in a different place now where it's much more modular.  You can decide what you want. It's a lot less expensive. The thing that really wears out is  the screen and the screen size. And now you can buy a bigger screen for it. And I don't really think  that. I mean, I just now I say that I just bought an iMac for my parents-in-law because they had one  before and it's all in one place and you can plug it all in and it just works. And I definitely see  the value of keeping something like that around. But I think that for almost everybody,

It maybe gets up to 24 at some point  for whatever reason, but it's never going to be another big one. It is going to be a, you know,  it's going to be an entry level computer. They're not going to make a pro version of it. They've  got too many other pro things that are out there.

Repairing them was super expensive. We should explain he was teaching, so these were classes.  School in Rwanda. Yeah. The problem that we've had is that it's replacing them after the power  supply or whatever. Trying to fix an iMac is non-trivial. So for the same cost, if we had  monitors instead, we could have just got another Mac Mini. Actually, I think we're getting her a

I have a QD OLED TV,  which is incredible. It's the brightest OLEDs out there. They're really gorgeous. Kind of stunning.  Samsung is going to make a QD OLED. It's the Odyssey OLED G9.

That's cause I made a bunch of that.  That's all you need, right? And then we're 11,799. That's nothing.  Now with taxes, I'd probably go over. Well, let's see. I should just put this on my Apple card.  That's practically free. Oh, do you need it? Do you need it? Oh, XDR.  Well, I sure would like that. It's only five grand. Oh, wait a minute.

I'll have to say that I think that I think that one of the reasons why, uh, Apple decided to put  those like downward firing cameras, uh, on the, on the, on the headset so you can do like touch  controls, like without having to lift your hands is that they're there. They know that all of us  would be jumping on them for every time. Apple says people know the reason why we don't do touch  screens on the Mac is people don't want to have to raise their hands to use the computers.

Hey, um, I would recommend that if you want to  give this a go as the, you folks who are developers and who are developers, here is the host of iOS  today. So do iPad, not iOS because Rosemary this morning had to completely restore her phone  because of a bug in iOS before the show started. She's using the developer edition. Yes. She's  using developer betas for everything. Of course. Um, I haven't installed any yet. I I'm usually a  lot quicker, but I was there. So I just haven't had time.

Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  I learned yesterday about that live voicemail feature is Apple is kind of spoofing this.  It is something that happens locally on the device. And what is happening is the phone is  essentially answering the call and then transcribing with the voice. Like it plays  your voicemail back and transcribes the conversation that takes place. And if you choose to hit  answer, then all it's doing is letting you into the call that it's already taken.  So that way it doesn't have to involve the carrier. Exactly. Makes it on device. I think that's fine.

Start time: 7681.30

Journal. You can, it's kind of like day one, but it's going to, it's a health thing,  right? It's going to have prompts. It's going to say, be grateful. What are you grateful for  today? That kind of thing. I like that you can look through your whole system and the activities

Start time: 7706.80
End time: 7724.72
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  that you're doing. And so I can imagine, you know, I'm go, we go to an undisclosed location  where they show us what it's like to make sound for movies. I don't know what that is. Don't know  where that would be, but. And it's like, Hey, you recently went to this place. What was that  experience like? And then I got to write about having that, you know, that's kind of a cool idea

Start time: 7725.32
End time: 7745.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte

So day one can add this feature, other, other, uh, journaling apps, health is also much improved.  It looks like, uh, in fact, health comes to the iPad. Finally, no calculator for you.  Widgets on the iPad. That's going to be interesting.

And basically now congratulations, your widget, the widget for  your app can now be deployed on the watch. It can be deployed on the phone, can be on the desktop,  can be here and there.

End time: 7828.16
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  I was talking about, as I always do me, I used to be worried about you going into a ditch.  And so I made a shortcut, actually, Matthew made a shortcut for sharing your ETA, right?  But here's the thing about sharing ETA. I can see your dot and follow you along as you're going.  And when I think about people who are out in the world, they might be going places,  maybe they're friends. They don't feel comfortable sharing their exact location,  but they would feel comfortable if in an emergency, their location was shared.  That's where check-in is different from what you have right now, because check-in will keep  everything private unless you're in a situation where you need to, at which point then it will  share your location and information like how much battery life you have left.  I think this is a fantastic feature. We've seen a few third party apps try to do something like  this, but not quite succeed at this level. So I can't wait for this to come out because I know  that I would feel more comfortable using this with some folks where I wouldn't want to full on just

Start time: 7828.30
End time: 7897.82
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  give them my location. Yeah, that's a big deal. You just tell this feature, I expect to be home  by 9 PM. When that doesn't happen, it will try to contact you if you don't respond.  The people that you've set up to be notified by this get, like Michael said, not just your location,  but hey, here's your last time that you touched the phone. Here's your battery status. Here's  your cell phone status. Here's your Apple Watch status so that you can get all this stuff together.  One thing that I've asked Apple about this, haven't got a response back, is I want to know,  what if one of your emergency contacts does not have an iPhone or does not have an iPhone that  is running iOS 17? Are they SOL or is it something where it sends out an SMS if it is received by  the version of iMessage that runs on iOS 17? It gets redesigned as one of these beautiful graphical  sort of displays of what's going on because that would be quite a kick in the teeth if they said,  yeah, we don't want you to be rescued by anybody who has Android. We feel as though that's a good  way to pressure that friend if they really want to save your life to have an iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is a good question. If you cared, you would get an iPhone if you really cared.  Thank you, ScooterX, for pointing out that little subtle thing, but Apple, which has always charged  $99 to be in the developer program and required that you be in the developer program to use the  developer betas, has now lifted that requirement. The free version, just sign in with your Apple ID,  continues to give you Xcode and all of that, but you also get OS beta releases.  That's a new dot on the comparison list. Thank you, ScooterX, for pointing that out. I think  they should. That's great. Apple wants to get people on the bus. You're either on the bus or

And I don't want,  I'm usually doing something else. So I just want to be able to read it real quick and see,  oh, that's what he wants. I can respond super quick.

Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  was mostly non-vocal as we should be. And we were, you know, and so it's funny, I was asking the  question, what almost made you clap? Because that's kind of what you had to do. But ever the  developers, of course, were very vocal. And then that section between where there was the apps,  Apple folks, obviously very vocal. But yeah, it was only on occasion where you'd get the sounds  like the price of the vision. A few jokes that came up, the name of that feature where you share  your contact, the name drop feature that got a lot of laughs that was called name drop.  And then some of the stuff like a few of the stickers were funny to people.

Transcript:  I guess. Well, but also why love this if I'm sharing a video with someone and I need to leave  before I can drop in the cloud. Yeah. Yeah. And I should also mention since I'm here,  if you want a more in depth look, Rosemary Orchard and I covered all iOS and iPadOS this morning.

Start time: 8055.84
End time: 8073.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should have mentioned that. Yeah. We're just rehashing. So that's where we're going to move  very quickly. Anything in the iPadOS 17 you thought was worth, I love it that we're going  to have widgets, interactive widgets, which means we can and lock screen customization and lock

Start time: 8073.18
End time: 8103.34
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  screen customization comes to the iPad. But yes, those interactive widgets, this is great  on both iPhone and iPad because more and more we're getting to the state where we don't  necessarily need to open up an app, wait for it to load or whatever it happens to be and be able  to access it. That right there on my, it's almost like it's making it more Mac like because my  desktop is what I'm looking at instead of a home screen. Right. And I can interact with these  little things. And I mean, that's how it should be. And I'm sure Rosemary, I mentioned her name

Start time: 8103.52
End time: 8109.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 8109.42
End time: 8113.74
Speaker: Micah Sargent

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  Notes is getting much more. Go ahead. Yes. One really big thing that we, that I've really,  really wanted for a long time, iOS, iPadOS 17 now supports external cameras so you can plug in a  webcam and actually use it. Oh, really? I didn't see that. That's great. Absolutely. It was, it was  in the state of the union yesterday and I've also seen other people talking about it. I FaceTime on

Start time: 8166.30

Start time: 8169.96

Start time: 8181.70
End time: 8222.96
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Yeah. As you said, I've got a few improvements. I know I will say so Christopher Lawley,  who has been a guest on iOS today and is like the stage manager guru, he nearly stood whenever they  said improvements to, to stage manager there, whatever a lot of people are griping about who  use stage manager. One of the things is sort of whenever you take a window and you try to move it  around, it would sort of jostle everything around the place. They fixed that. So that was exciting.  And, oh, I forgot to mention in notes, when we were talking about the LogSec thing,  one thing that they didn't announce, I believe on stage, but was in the little details is that you  can link between notes. So one note can link to another one. And that's really that personal

Start time: 8223.18
End time: 8234.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  knowledge. Yeah. They're getting, yeah. Notes it's too bad it's not cross platform. That's the biggest  downside to that. But if you live in the Mac and the Apple ecosystem, I guess technically,

Start time: 8234.72
End time: 8240.32
Speaker: Micah Sargent

End time: 8257.52
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  to use PC and logged into iCloud to grab onto them. Okay. Good. I don't do that very often,  but it knows that for those of us who are mostly 99% dealing with the Mac, it is super powerful.  Like I use it. It's like, yeah, it's all the time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is even better though, because they're going to, they apparently added a bunch of new  wallpapers, all of which become alive. And that's the thing is that they turn into your

I don't, I don't know if you folks feel that way,  but I, so I'm a Safari user and that's one of the things that I did like about Chrome and about a  few other browsers that exist out there are switching between profiles. So I was excited

Start time: 8358.08
End time: 8366.12
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  about it. Yeah. They're also doing sharing of logins and passwords. So if you have,  if you have a family that all uses the same Netflix package, you don't have to basically

Transcript:  sync between them. That makes Apple key chain is getting closer and closer to full fledged  password manager. That's one of the last things that was still missing is the ability to share.  That's good. That's, that's actually quite huge. I will use that because Lisa's on a Mac. I'm on a  Mac. She's still using last pass. I'm using Bitwarden. So I can't share through our password  manager, but we both have Mac, so I can share through key chain. Yes. That's, they're doing

Start time: 8392.12
End time: 8426.32
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  something similar with the, with the find my network click, but they're, you can have an air  tag that can be shared, that can be found by multiple people in your family or in your group,  which is interesting, which is nice because, okay, that's great. Cause maybe you and your spouse  are equally invested in finding out where your suitcase mounted up. But it's like, if there is  a warning when you activate it, say, okay, by the way, that means that if someone's, if a family  member has put one of these tags with you without your knowledge, it's not going to alert you that  there's an air tag following you because this is your air tag. So make sure that you're not in a  stocky sort of situation. So, but this, that's unavoidable. I suppose we were talking about

Start time: 8426.42
End time: 8484.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that on Twitter on a Sunday, a lot of spouses turn the fine, my own Lisa and I have it on. So I know,  you know, she's delayed, she's still, I could look, oh, she's still at work. I don't have to start  dinner or whatever. Those, I think if you trust your spouse and you're not worried about them  stalking you, I think that's a, that's a good safety feature. And actually Apple has really  enhanced that to some degree, which is great. But I agree with you only do it if you really trust  the other person. You do have, let's see, web apps. Now this was one Safari thing that I wanted to  know more about. And in fact, I, I'll have to watch the track on this because Apple's been laggard on  progressive web apps, which is a standard from Google and Microsoft. And without Safari  participating fully, PWA was kind of DOA. It sounds like Apple is now turning it on, but they  didn't say PWA. So I'm not sure if it's an Apple feature, that's a far thing. That's not progressive

Start time: 8484.64
End time: 8494.83
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  web apps or what? I don't know. It hooks up nicely with a feature where now if you have a website  that is a web app, you can now actually have it as an app in the dock. Yep. So they're clearly

End time: 8552.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  own window. Yeah. That's not so special. Frankly, that's not progressive web apps, but the fact that  they can do notifications, I don't know. Maybe we'll see. Yeah. They brought that to iOS first,  right? With notifications. Live stickers also come to Mac OS. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. I guess so.  Mac OS is compatible with 2019 iMacs and later 2019 Mac Pros and later 2017 iMac Pros and later  Mac Studios, obviously the MacBook Air from 2018 or later. So it has to be a fairly recent air.  It looks like, in fact, do you have to have Apple Silicon? I'm wondering now Mac Mini 2018 or later,  MacBook Pro 2018 or later. So a lot of older hardware now left in the dust when it comes to

Start time: 8562.72
End time: 8573.36
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  I'll say it's not only game mode, but they've also for developers, they've actually added a whole  suite of tools for converting Windows games to Mac and it's really, really quite a rich environment.

Start time: 8573.38
End time: 8628.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they're trying to- Christina was talking about that and I thought it was very interesting.  They have effectively released DirectX 12 emulation for the Mac. Now they say it's a way for  game developers to evaluate whether they can port their game to Metal. But in fact,  they have and they are using crossover wine. They're actually contributing to an open source  project, but in a weird backhanded way through homebrew, the ability to run DirectX 12 games  in emulation on a Mac. To me, that's very interesting. Christina Warren noticed it and  started posting it. Here's a actual video says Apple hid something amazing for Mac gaming at  WWDC. And so Apple was actually showing Windows games running in Rosetta in DirectX 12. What?

Start time: 8632.02
End time: 8642.16
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  So- That's a pretty big deal. It'll convert your renders, it'll convert your shaders. It's ambitious.  So let's see if Windows game developers fall for it.

End time: 8682.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will actually give credit to the great Andrew Tsai who noticed that he is an Apple developer  developed Spam Civ, which is one of the great Spam tools. I think it's that Andrew Tsai.  So his video discovering this is a big deal. And I think it's very interesting. I suspect we'll see  some open source crossover on this. This was huge for Linux when the Steam Deck supported Proton  for cross compatibility. Suddenly all these Windows games ran beautifully on Linux.  And I think this could be actually huge for Apple Silicon as somebody who likes to play games.

End time: 8717.00
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  Mac OS as well. You can finally, with both the studio display or the iPhone,  actually control the composition when you're using that center stage feature. Finally,  Jason Snell, when he heard this. Glory hallelujah.  You can say look to your left, look to your right.  You can choose how the zoom and pan happens. Before it was just automatic to try to re-center  you, but it was sometimes kind of odd. So now you can choose between wide and ultra wide.

Start time: 8717.12
End time: 8720.96

Transcript:  Apple TV using continuity cam. That feature I'm so excited about.  Ever since I moved here, every Thanksgiving and Christmas, I do this strange iPad dance with my  family back home who only have iPhones. And so they're trying to hold an iPhone and pass it  around. And I'm getting sick looking at the iPad as they're passing it around. So the idea of,  of course it'll be, it'll require a little support call to get them to get it set up.  But once that's done, we'll be able to have them up on the screen as we sort of celebrate

Transcript:  And there's a session. This is exciting. There's a session at WWDC right now,  talking about using something called dock kit that will let developers  interact with motorized docs for the iPhone. So what we're thinking is,  I have one of those motorized docs.  Uh huh. So you thwack your iPhone onto this MagSafe dock and then you can FaceTime  from the television and the doc can move with you as you're moving around your space.

Transcript:  Okay. I see something here in video conferencing called a bubble overlay. Although I wrote  bubble lover leg and I think that was Freudian. I know the bubble level is,

Start time: 8802.32
End time: 8868.94
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  I don't know what that is. I'm kind of annoyed by this because they took this from iOS today.  No, I can't. It was your idea. Rosemary Orchard and I, when we do our show in the morning,  we have a bubble of ourselves, uh, often overlaid over the iPad so that we can show what's on the  screen, but also still appear on the screen. Apple's being a little bit more clever because  it's using a lot of the features, the true depth and everything to kind of cut you out.  So you're almost overlaid a little. They showed like your full size with your PowerPoint or your  keynote. Sorry. Yeah. Behind you. And then that's the other thing is that yeah,  you can go from this small bubble overlay. I loved that. Sorry. Bubble lover lay to the bigger  version that yeah, has these multiple layers. And in Mac OS, there's going to be a new, uh,  picker option that lets you choose specific apps that you want to show in third party  conferencing apps. So instead of using zoom itself to say, I want to show just this window  or I want to show just this app, you can go into the little green plus icon and say, show this  app like Safari or this window in zoom and then use my bubble overlay, et cetera, et cetera.

Transcript:  This was part of a segment they called audio and home, which was a little weird. It was like,  we kind of these loose pieces, shove them in there. But there was one that I thought was really  interesting. I've kind of come around on the AirPods pro. Uh, they're more comfortable. They  actually sound really good. And, uh, Kevin Toffle, uh, who does the IOT show with Stacy Higginbotham,  talked about how he uses them as kind of Arizona hearing aids. Now Apple we thought for a long  time was probably interested in this category, especially now that over the counter hearing  aids are legal. They talked about something with their, uh, uh, AirPods that I think really is,  is exactly what hearing aid users want. They call it adaptive audio. They've always had  noise canceling and they've always had transparency. Now it'll slide between them. So I'm walking down  the street and there's a jackhammer. It'll turn down the sound, but even more importantly,  you come up and say, hi, it will, it will turn down the background and focus the sound on you.  That's what you want a hearing aid to do. Hearing aids are all about intelligibility of speech.  Um, I think this is, I can't wait to use this. I think this might be,  and what Apple it looked like is trying to get everybody to do is, is where your AirPods all

On top of those features, uh, also understanding the behavior of when I listen to podcasts,  I typically typically have my volume here. When I watch movies, my volumes here. When I listen to  Beyonce, it's here. Whenever I listen to, uh, the, the strokes, it's here and then be able to,  you know, move between those different volumes automatically. Does it know that from location?

Start time: 9026.20
End time: 9050.70
Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  okay, but let me be clear. This is mine. This is my understanding from speaking with a few folks is  that it's not using, um, a UWB instead it is because of the advances in Bluetooth.  It's a little bit better at determining the signal of the Bluetooth and using that. It doesn't do an  arrow. So all it does is so I thought maybe they were having the remote image,

Yeah. Yeah.  I wish it was more than that, but unfortunately it's not. And then the great savior of relationships  everywhere is that you and whomever is in your vehicle that you're allowing to,  this is going to cause problems. But okay. So I actually asked about this because I thought  share play with the car play share play in the car. Yeah. Um, and I thought this has got to be  off to that. Somebody in the back seat can change the music if you allow them to, but you have to  allow them to. And this is why I like this is because I'll tell us, I'll talk about how it works  for me right now, which is if I'm, uh, in the passenger seat, my partner's driving and there's  a song I'd love to listen to. I say, um, can I please, please, please, please, please add a song  to the queue? And he says, okay. And I say, okay, well, and then I hold up his phone to his face  while he's driving just to the side. So it unlocks and I can add a song to the queue.  Now I can just do it on my own phone. Uh, and interestingly, only the person who is connected  to carplay needs to have an apple music subscription. Oh, so you can still DJ even if you don't.

Transcript:  getting something new. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was really excited about the two hiking things,  topographic maps coming to maps on Apple watch. That's really cool. And so you'll know what the  altitude is before you go there. Yeah, exactly. And B, I think that it's helpful in trying to  determine, I know I got lost, but how do I get back? And that's paired with the new, um,  wayfinder points so that it will tell you, exactly the last time you had a cellular connection. And  then the, not only just the last time you had a cellular connection on your cellular service,  but then it'll add a second way point. That is the last time you had the availability to place  an emergency call, which is available on any carrier. So even if your carrier doesn't reach  as far, obviously you can place an emergency call on any carrier. So it'll show you that waypoint  as well. I thought that was awesome. Nice. So benefits to hikers, bikers, oh, and then widgets

We, um, Trey Radcliffe and I were trading notes on, on this,  on, on Twitter that we have a whole theory that, you know, it, you know, a couple hundred years ago,  you were just emotionally blind. You know, like if you were, if you were myopic,  so you had to be very, you had to be very crafty. Yeah. That's why we're smart. Yeah. We had to be  very crafty because we're the only ones that are blind was the ones that could see very well. We  were like, we had to be able to do something. That's our, that's our whole theory. That's the

It's a watch bump instead of a fist  bump. A watch bump. That might be the new thing. So watchOS will be great. It was activated by  fist bump. That would be so cool. There was, many years ago at CES, IBM had a technology. They put  a computer in your shoe and then use its capacitance. Did it kick somebody? No, you would shake hands  and in the capacitance and the, and the contact. Wait, so you had to run a wire all the way down  to your shoe? I don't know how it worked, but you would shake hands with somebody else wearing the  IBM foot shoe. Right. Not the foot shoe. The foot shoe. You shake their hands and a bummer,  lover light would appear over your head. No, and you would exchange business cards. I love it.  It's ridiculous. Let's make it again. Well, they were trying to, and this is, this is it. This is  only right. Done right. Again, Apple. Good job. What were you saying, Andy? Oh no, I was just going

Transcript:  to say that the lockdown mode, since we're talking about watchOS, lockdown mode now also extends to  watch, to watchOS. So we can block, if you lock down your phone, you can also lock down your watch  as well. So if you feel as though you're being targeted by like natural national surveillance  agency and that your, your phone or devices are being hacked to get access to your messages and  contacts and stuff like that, the watch used to be vulnerable to that. Now we the state, the exact  same lockdown mode that goes into the phone now applies to the watch. And it's all yeah, it's on

Speaker: Micah Sargent
Transcript:  In fact, there was a lot of conversation, you know, leading into it that I was having with  other folks about how, Oh man, if Apple takes the time to announce all of these Macs, it's all going  to be overshadowed by the headset. So why would they not just announce the headset? Yeah. We mostly  talked about the headset. A lot of people are mostly talking about it. And so it was kind of  interesting that they still chose to announce the Macs here as opposed to just doing one of those

I was, I was on WGN radio in Chicago this morning and the host said,  so I understand that now I can cuss on, on iOS, on my iPhone. And I'm like, say what?  Think about what do you, what do you mean?

It was, it was, it was, I thought a very interesting event. I was so glad  not to hear the letters 5g or AI. Oh my God, 5g. Anywhere in it. There was a lot of AI in it,  large language models, machine learning, but, but not AI specifically. And I think it's interesting  that where the rest of the industry has turned away from VR and AR, you know, look at Meta,  they went, what there's like, that's that meme with the guy going by with the girl and, and Apple  is, you know, keeping their eyes on the prize. They're sticking with the one, the program.

And one of these people is probably going to be right. And we're, we shouldn't, we shouldn't  guess that it's going to be Google. We shouldn't guess it's going to be Apple, but oh my God,  I feel as though both of these companies cannot have made the exact same right decision though.

However, I don't think they made any  huge mistakes. I think to the extent to which a virtual reality ski goggle type headset can  succeed in 2024, 2025, I think they've set themselves up nicely. But again, we're going  to find out in January, February, what they're actually delivering and what the experience is  actually like. But again, I don't, nothing, nothing that can rag on them about nothing. I was,  not that I was setting them up for that, but I think that I was very, very pleased with yesterday's

And more importantly, just very excited to dig into these developer  sessions and learn more. That's where the meat of it is going to be. There are a lot of sessions  I've been eyeballing.

We're going to take a break.  Come back with your picks of the week in just a second. Our show today brought to you by Melissa,  Melissa. Oh, I've talked about them before. The address experts, the leader in global data quality,  identity verification, and address management solutions. Actually some, you know, good news,  a little pat on the back, Melissa, because they just, the clean suite and data quality suite  from Melissa have just once again been named leader by G2, which is a leader itself in peer  to peer software in the 2023 data quality and address verification spring report. Good going.  That means that's not all. They momentum leader, high performer across the small business,  mid-market and enterprise segments. They were named good partner and easiest to do business with.  Yes, I can vouch for that. We always love talking to Melissa. Easiest setup, highest user adoption,  easiest admin. Well, that's a bunch of reasons to check out Melissa. Along with leader status,  Melissa ranked highly in the price category for clean suite and data quality suite across many  segments. And I think that that's a real testament to Melissa's strong belief that data quality  should save you more money than it costs you. You know, that you should have a positive ROI.  And you really do. You know, the, on average, poor data quality costs an average of $15 million  a year. So Melissa's affordable, high quality solutions for data quality and address verification,  not only save you money, they say they might save your bacon because bad data gets worse.  The longer it stays in your system and then the more losses you can accumulate. And there's all  sorts of other associated problems. Melissa eliminates waste from incorrect mailings.  Melissa improves customer satisfaction with seamless real time identity verification tools.  They may help you with compliance. There are a lot of businesses where know your customer  is a requirement. And if you've got duplicates in your database, that's just going to waste so  much money. Melissa's matching and Ddup tools help establish a, I wish I could do this on my  personal address book actually, a single high quality record listing all customer touch points  for a customer. So you get a complete 360 degree view of each customer. It helps you serve them  better, market to them better. Melissa complies with USPS's move update requirements, assures  the most current address data because they're processing through the USPS's own national  change of address database. Melissa, you know what? They've been doing it since 1985. No wonder they're  experts in global intelligence solutions to help organizations unlock accurate data for a more  compelling customer view. And by the way, you should be reassured your data is absolutely safe  with Melissa. They undergo continuous independent security audits to reinforce their commitment and  to reassure their customers that they are committed to data security, privacy and compliance requirements.  And as a result, they're SOC 2 compliant, they're HIPAA compliant, they're GDPR compliant.  Your data is absolutely in the best hands. I'm seeing on the website, for those of you watching  the video, there's some great case studies on the Melissa site. Go to melissa.com slash twit. If  you're at all interested in how you might be able to use it, look what some other  best practices are. Make sure your customer contact data is up to date. Get started today.  You get 1000 records clean for free. Good way to test it at melissa.com slash twit. Melissa.com  slash twit. We thank Melissa so much for supporting. Mac, break weekly. Melissa.com slash twit.

The app that I want to talk about,  it's available on the iPad and the iPhone, but you can install it on the Mac and I have it on the Mac.  It's called knots 3D knots, knots, Barry farm, like K and OTS, like Italian knots. And that's  because it is an app. Oh, I love it. I know this app. I love this app. Yeah. It teaches you.  So you get to learn in this beautiful animation, how to tie all sorts of knots.  It's just kind of fun learning about all the knots that are out there.  They have them categorized quite well and you can slow things down. You it's a, they're all 3D. So  you can sort of spin them around and look at them. And I wanted to mention this one because I can  imagine in the vision pro future where I could take this knot, pull it out. This would be able

Transcript:  Co your pick of the week. Mine is something that we've talked about before. Other people have  picked it as the pick of the week. However, this time I have now got access to the arc browser for  Mac OS, the new beta. Uh, and I'm going to add my own testimony to this. This is a really,  really great browser. Other people have recommended it. Uh, what I love about it is that it's the first  browser that really tries to reconceptualize how a web browser should work in 2023, 2022, uh,  instead of having, Hey, here's a window with an address bar and some bookmarks. The rest of it,  it's up to you to organize it and to figure out how to use this and make the best, uh, make the  best, uh, uh, make the best productivity out of it. Um, the way that I've got the arc browser set  up for myself is that I basically have decided to use it as it's actually dark right now, but  when I'm using my, my Mac book or my desktop Mac, my external display here is my iPad pro.  And I have the arc browser maximized in this, in this display. And I use it basically for  everything that I use kind of like as a web app. So when I need to get my mail, I've got icons for  mail for YouTube, for Spotify, for Slack, all like little icons, role of icons in the sidebar.  And it also lets you set up like workspaces for when I'm doing all of my research and stuff to,  to figure out, uh, to figure out how to, uh, all the stuff I'm doing for this podcast,  all the stuff I'm doing for NPR, all the stuff I'm doing for the material podcast,  all the stuff I'm doing for one different project. They're all in like individual like spaces with  that are nicely lined up in the sidebar there. Uh, the only, the only, the, the only thing I  complain I have about it is simply that I like it too much and I absolutely need my web browser to  be cross platform. I needed, I need, I need to have it on my Mac, on my iPad, on my Android phone,  and also, uh, my, my, my Chromebook. So if I get too attached to this, if I get too productive with  it, I might be stuck with using this for everything. And I'm not sure if I want that, but it's, it's  free. Go to arc.net to sign up for the beta, uh, and start using it because, oh my goodness,  it is exactly everything that safari should steal everything from this Chrome should steal  everything from this. This is how we have been neglected as web users. And finally,

Start time: 10539.30
End time: 10606.48
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  than it used to. This is the launch. Oh yeah. This is the new one. It's a brand new one. It's a built  up, but, but the, um, uh, we used to have to, um, to get enough frame rate to play on the, on a 7100,  I think it was, you had to restart without all the extensions. And so at the end of the day,  I worked in a game company. Um, and so I was, I was an art director in a game company. We were,  and we were all in one room, a tiny little game company, five of us or whatever.  And, uh, you would hear one person about five or six o'clock. So between five and six, we were this  dong. And that meant that means they're restarting with the extensions off. And suddenly,  and suddenly, no one would say anything. No one would say anything. It was like,  dong. And then suddenly you hear, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm compiling, I'm compiling.  And they were like, dong, dong, dong. And everyone would, everyone would go in and we'd play  and it would always be like, now if one of your wives called, the key was that no one was allowed  to fire because the, you know, and, um, and, uh, it would always be someone, someone's going, no,  no, I'm just finishing up. I'm just finishing up here. And someone would fire their gun and then  suddenly, no, no, I'm not playing marathon. I'm not, you know, and this is not by the way,

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  they're going to, they're going to re-release it though. It's going to be, I think they're going  to take what they learned on halo and then apply it. So marathon, we get, we get marathon back and  it's just going to be, anyway, for some of us, we played it a lot and, uh, uh, it's, uh,

Transcript:  Karsten Bondi told me only recently, we all played marathon like crazy on the site when  we were all doing the MSNBC show. This is like you in the mid nineties, 94. And, uh, we, we do the  same thing would happen. They'd all play cause it was a network game. It was one of the early  network games. And, uh, Karsten told me that behind the scenes, they were saying gang up on Leo.  And every, every time I joined the game, 15 rocket launchers, but all at once would fire up at me.  So it turned out that I was the bad guy. I was, what do they call it? Among us. I was the intruder.  Yeah. What is that? I was the, anyway, imposter and they was a get him. The difference was they all  knew I was the imposter. Uh, but that's not your pick. What's your pick? It's not my pick. Uh,

Start time: 10673.78

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  pick pick is, uh, coming, uh, I think it was released on Friday, uh, but it's called zoom  cuts. And this is new from liminal. This is the company that of course makes zoom ISO and zoom  OSC. And what this is, is it's, it is taking a lot, not all, but a lot of what we have in zoom,  ice, OSC and zoom. So these are, you know, those are, um, wait a minute. So is it, so Andy Carluccio  Yeah. Sold liminal or just sold? No, sold liminal. This is part of zoom.  It's zoom extensions from zoom. But, but, but zoom is, you know, liminal is keeping its own company,  you know, so it's separate from zoom. So it's like, you know, LinkedIn didn't become Microsoft  either, you know, like, so it's, so zoom, so liminal is, is a subsidiary of zoom and they keep on,  you know, they're developing. We love Andy. You introduced them to us. We think he's so great.

Start time: 10726.72
End time: 10731.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we use zoom ISO right now. We're using zoom. Yeah. And you're using it now for the, I guess,

Start time: 10731.30
End time: 10735.90
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  for the, I heard you were using some zoom stuff for the calls over the weekend. Yes. Andy wrote

Start time: 10735.94
End time: 10742.07
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  us a great script and oh man, it's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. So what zoom cuts does is, uh, it,

Start time: 10745.34
End time: 10854.30
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  it allows you to take a lot of the tools that we have in zoom ISO and zoom OSC that are a little  geeky. I mean, they, they tie into a lot of other things and have it just with shortcuts.  So now you can, you know, there's a lot of like things that you might want to do in zoom  that, and that now there's all these short and it's just a short, you know, these are shortcuts,  you know, so now you can use them as shortcuts. Um, uh, Adam Tao, who is, uh, who wrote, who also  have written another program that I, that I talk about, which is, um, uh, my brain just turned off  here, but, um, uh, but the, um, but Adam, uh, is at zoom as well and it is, uh, and he has, uh,  written a lot. He's really into shortcuts. So, so he, so he built this all out, but what this allows  you to do, if you're running zoom events, um, this is, this allows you to go in and, um, uh,  allows you to do a lot of the tools like mute everybody, unmute everybody, uh, you know,  get information, do all these other things. And if you have other programs that do, uh, shortcuts,  you are able to, um, uh, integrate those. So you can say, I want you to cut to this and play this.  So you can talk to another app that is doing shortcuts as well as you can build very complex  shortcuts because of shortcuts can do that on its own, but these, these give you all the hooks that  we had with zoom ice zoom, OSC and zoom ISO to do those controls. Uh, you have those, um, here and  it's, you know, for a lot of people, uh, like my wife, friends, I, the stuff we do at office  hours is pretty complicated and it still needs OSC, but the stuff that my, my wife does, um,  where she's running zoom events in the native zoom environment, um, this is a really powerful  set of tools that folks like her are going to use a lot. Zoom cuts. I w do you think, uh, that, that

Start time: 10854.56
End time: 10877.58
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  was, uh, John, a beta of zoom cuts that Andy was using to automate our workflow for the  ask the tech guys. No. Ah, okay. Yeah. Isadora. Yeah. We've talked about that in the past. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. Liminal net limo, limo, limo, limo.com. That's a, so the company's liminal,

Start time: 10878.30
End time: 10919.06
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  but the website is liminal plus ET.com. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And it's the other one that Adam  writes is mix of back pro, which is something that you, you, I've already recommended that in  the past. And it's the, uh, you can't use an, I, in my opinion, don't, you can't use a black magic  ATEM without mix effect pro. So it's, so he's, he's really tied well. And again, because of that, the,  the, you can tie controls because you have the same person that wrote both of these,  you can tie the controls from the ATM into the zoom to tie all those things together as well.  So it's a pretty nifty setup and we're going to be talking to both Adam and Andy are going to join  office hours on Thursday to answer people's questions about this and

We've gone longer by an hour than the  Apple event and we didn't even cover all the stuff they covered. So you're right, Alex. I,  I give you a victory instant victory. Well, three hour later victory. Uh, we could,  we maybe could have been a little more terse. I am sure. What are the so conversations? Three hours  goes by like that. I can't believe it's been three. Unless you're listening, in which case  you're going to cuddle puddle of tech love. They're doing two X speed. So they're fine. That's right.  It's only an hour and a half for most of them.
