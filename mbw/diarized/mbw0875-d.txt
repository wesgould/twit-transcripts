Transcript:  There you go. Hi Andy. How messy is my office back there? No one knows.  You're not going to find out from there. What I like about Alex is that you're getting the vibe  of like a late 1980s, early 1990s cable news channel sort of thing where this just,  oh look how busy we got. So many busy things in our newsroom. It's dimly lit, but we've got,  you can see by the number of screens that we're not doing this on the cheap. We've hired lots of  people really, honestly. We're watching lots of television to get you the news. And it in turn

Jason Stelz got the  week off because as he mentioned last week, we're so proud of him and his daughters graduating from  college and he's there up there doing that. But we took this as an opportunity to get the great

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a bit for the show. Thanks a lot. You're great too, dude. Don't be blowing any horns. James is  legendary as, when did you first start developing for, was it Mac that you started with or iOS that

Start time: 233.94
End time: 251.44
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  you started with? Yeah, I started Mac, the first PCALC shipped in December 92. So it's well over  30 years old at this point. So that should give you a baseline for how old I am. Yeah. Yeah. I'm  only actually, I'm only two years younger than Jason. So I can't actually throw him in. So you

Start time: 251.56
End time: 255.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  did shift it down though. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I mean, mathematically, yes.

End time: 286.16
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Emotionally. No, no, you got to leverage that. I have older sisters and I'm only two years younger  than the next youngest one. But according to Time Magazine or whatever, she's technically a baby  boomer and I'm technically generation X. So you boomers, I can't be fixing your phone all the time.  Okay. I can't keep explaining to you how America Online works. Switch. I have to ask James if you're

Start time: 297.54
End time: 324.80
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  literally. I genuinely, I held my breath for the couple of seconds. I mean, like I had actually,  I think I posted to Mastodon earlier in the day. I said, like, I will be genuinely surprised if they  don't release a calculator these days because it's such low hanging fruit and they get such  stick for it. But no, they didn't. So it was health. And, but we were all thinking calculator.

Start time: 326.06
End time: 329.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We thought James is going to get a Sherlocked, but you wouldn't get Sherlocked because yours is so

Start time: 329.58
End time: 356.80
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  much superior than anything Apple would do. Well, I mean, I think the thing is like the platforms  that we sell the most on is phone and Mac, whether it's a calculator already. So it doesn't actually  matter. You know, they shipped a calculator on the watch even. You know, I was actually,  I had a bet with somebody that they would ship a calculator on the headset before they shipped it  on the iPad, but it seems like they're not doing that. The vision pro calculator. You just look at

Start time: 356.98
End time: 381.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  a number and it adds it in. I mean, you want to be surrounded by your numbers. Really? That's it.  3d numbers. Well, anyway, we're glad you didn't get Sherlocked. And I think that's actually,  I'm going to interpret it as little a tip of the hat to you that we don't need to do a calculator  on the iPad because there is the best calculator ever already. I, there, I think that most of Apple

End time: 417.12
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  like I was once, I once talked to Craig Federici at WWDC and I was sort of giving him the  background of myself and I started to say who I was and sort of tell some anecdote.  And he looked at me and he said, I've heard you tell that story on a podcast. And I thought,  the only podcast that I have told that on was debug, where I said a lot of fairly negative

Start time: 417.26
End time: 424.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  things about my time at Apple. So, um, oh dear. Oh dear. That was a very interesting backhanded

Start time: 424.56
End time: 440.32
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  way of saying, I know you. Yeah. I mean, I have like, if we get onto talking about widgets,  that was certainly something that I was known for nine years ago. Good. We will talk about

Start time: 440.50
End time: 463.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  widgets. We'll talk about everything. Cause I wanted to bring, I said to John Ashley, our producer,  it would be great to get a developer on and get their take on everything that happened at WWDC.  You're the perfect person for it. I guess I should ask you first, what you think of the Vision Pro?  I mean, are you going to do PCalc for the Vision Pro? I mean, yes. You'll do dice for sure. Cause

Start time: 463.68
End time: 557.26
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  dice actually makes sense. Like, so I've, I was playing as many people know the PCalc about  screen kind of went a bit berserk and this 3D game and all that sort of stuff. And all that was,  I started it because I wanted to learn about 3D graphics because there were rumors like six  years ago, seven years ago about the headset. So I wanted to have an idea about 3D graphics.  And so, yeah, I mean, like as it stands, if I do nothing, the Apple still run on the Vision Pro,  um, because it will run iPad apps, but it seems like there isn't actually like to get it running  as a native Vision Pro app. There's not much work I need to do. I actually did most of the work last  year. Um, the, and I think with, with PCalc, you know, the thing that I think about, uh, when they  showed it off was like one of the first apps they showed off was Microsoft office, which is like,  the least kind of, uh, whiz bang 3D thing that they could have led with. And I think what they  were saying there is like any app that you would want on your computer or your iPad or your phone  or whatever is the kind of app you want to have on this device. And so, yeah, I mean, I'll do PCalc  for it, but as you say, dice, um, I've even got an AR mode in that already and I haven't tried it,  but maybe that actually even does something already on the Vision Pro when you launch it

Start time: 557.44
End time: 569.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  in AR mode. How close was your guess since you developed this before it came out, uh, as to what  the API, the SDK would look like? Uh, did you, um, I, I'm actually, I was,

Start time: 571.04
End time: 637.62
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  my guess was that they were going to cut off all the old technologies and they were going to say,  no UI kit, things like that. And they were going to say Swift UI only for the whole thing.  And they didn't actually do that. What they said was you can use UI kit, but we will judge you,  uh, for doing so. Uh, and you know, some things might not work quite as well, but the stuff is  there and it will work. Um, the only API that didn't really make the cut was scene kit, which  is actually what I used for the 3D stuff initially with, um, PCalc about and with dice that, that  can't display 3D content. Like it can display it flat in a window, but that doesn't work.  So there's, they actually brought across more than I thought they would. And I'm sure they will cut  that off, uh, pretty soon, but, but it means like, because if you're getting iPad apps existing once  over, they needed to have most of that stuff there anyway, in terms of, uh, UI kit and things. So  yeah, I mean, I was pleasantly surprised by that. I was quite surprised by the price. Um,

Start time: 639.68
End time: 642.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the higher than you thought are lower. I'm going to guess higher, but

Start time: 643.96
End time: 680.80
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  yeah, higher because when people were, when there was the rumors saying, oh, it's going to be $3,000  that were floating around beforehand and everybody was saying, yeah, this is just going to be like  the iPad again, where, you know, we, we all think it's going to be $3,000, but then they come out  and they say it's $2,000. And we go, wow, that's so cheap. Um, wouldn't be cheap. Um,  and so when they said three and a half, I, uh, audibly swore I will not look at what I said.  I mean, I understand it, you know, I totally understand. This is not a device that anyone is

Start time: 681.00
End time: 689.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  actually really intended to buy. You know, this is the, I should point out. Yeah, I will. And I

Start time: 689.14
End time: 877.58
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  suppose we are. Yeah, I think it's, it's like, it's the first, it's the first device, you know,  it's to, to, so that people like me can make stuff. People like you can write about it and  experience it. And you know, some rich tech bros will buy it as well. And you know, we, we'll,  and there's your hundred thousand a quarter right there. And we'll see how it goes because, you  know, like five years from now, 10 years from now, um, that I think is the product that people  will be buying. I don't think this is like, like the iPad where, you know, they want to get this  into as many hands as possible. And so it's priced accordingly. Uh, this is like, we're going to  build the absolute best thing with no compromises whatsoever to show what can be done. And then,  uh, we'll get down to actually selling it to regular human beings at some point in the future.  Uh, but, uh, hi. So another thing that I should say, not wishing to monopolize the conversation,  uh, I'm having problems with my eyes and I have done for the last year, um,  basically chronic dry eye stuff. So I find it difficult to look at screens for a long time.  I have no idea whatsoever if strapping one of these things to my face is going to be better or  worse than looking at a normal screen. My guess is it's going to be much worse. So I come to this  with the unusual flake. I want to develop apps for this. I have no idea if I'll be able to use it.  Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. That is a kind of,  you know, if this is the future of computing truly, um, if I can't use it, then well,  I guess I retire. Uh, uh, uh, we'll see. Also, I have no idea how this thing works in terms of,  uh, glasses, like specifically, where is the focal point of this thing when you're looking through  it? Cause I haven't heard a specific answer to that. Cause like all the, like I'll kill, I've got  many VR headsets, too many, my wife may say, um, I've got like the, the quest and PlayStation VR,  two of these things. And most of them, the focal point for that is kind of like two meters plus  away. So it's, if you need glasses for distance, then you need that as your prescription to look  at the thing. But even if you're looking at something up close in the headset, it's still  got the focal point of far away because these things won't shift, uh, focus as you change your,  as you look at things. Um, so I need glasses for computer screens, which are, you know, like up to  a meter away, and I don't need glasses for stuff that's two plus meters away. So I don't know if  I'm going to need to get, uh, glasses for how it's going to work. So there's a lot of unanswered  questions, but I really want to try it. Um, but, uh, I was not, uh, flown out, uh, by Tim Cook,

Start time: 878.48
End time: 894.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to try my Dice app on it. Sadly. Uh, I should have started by asking you how the burnout's going,  because I have to say, when you posted that blog post, uh, almost two years ago now, I, I was like,  oh my God, James, we had no idea. Yeah. I mean, like,

Start time: 896.72
End time: 943.60
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  I think I sort of passed through the burnout and I got to a place, particularly when my eyes were  giving me the most trouble. Um, and I was like, I, I'm, I've reached a more Zen position of like,  I'm going to do, I'm going to do what entertains me and makes me happy. Uh, and I'm not going to  sort of like push myself badly to, I mean, like I say this and I said this the last couple of years,  like I'm not going to push myself to have everything ready on day one and to ship with  this device on day one or to do this on day one. I have done it every single time, but you know,  I'm at least starting to think. You're famous for that actually. Like we can say, well, let's see

Start time: 943.92
End time: 951.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  if James has it, uh, when it ships and always you do. Yeah. I mean, the thing with P calc

Start time: 951.84
End time: 999.36
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  specifically is the, the core code of P calc, um, like the, the actual brain of it is super  portable and it's very small. It's just math. So I can, I can stuff that anywhere and all it needs  is like button presses in and text out. So that is very easy to put in places. So when it, when  it's something like, you know, if we come, we talk about widgets or even this thing, it's not,  it's not super hard to put stuff on and to have something there, but yeah, it will be,  be, you know, if you see me, uh, uh, working way too hard to get something out for day one,  for this headset, you can tell me to slow down. Okay, good. I hope you will tell yourself to

Start time: 999.52
End time: 1010.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  slow down and your family will also tell you slow down. James, it's not, it's okay. I will tell you  this right now. If you don't get it out, the day iOS 17 ships will be okay with that. It's fine.

Start time: 1011.44
End time: 1017.10
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  The, I know, I know people will, but it's just that self-imposed. Yeah, that's what it is. Of

Start time: 1017.44
End time: 1030.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, speaking of burnout, Mr. Alex Lindsay, you should probably listen to  what James is saying, Alex. And I don't know. Alex is working every moment of his waking life,

Start time: 1030.50
End time: 1053.98
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  which is about 18, 19, 20 hours a day. I think, uh, you know, I pace myself better now. I just  don't travel as much. You know, I think that's the big thing is that I, I was doing the travel was  what was really nailing me. And, uh, now that I'm pretty resistant to it, uh, yeah, I spoke it. I  spoke at info come last week without actually, um, going, you just assume now everybody's nose.

Start time: 1054.54
End time: 1074.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I would think James, you wrote that blog post in the middle of the pandemic. I would think the  pandemic actually might've made it worse because you've always been, you know, homebound in a way.  Just, yeah, I mean, I can actually leave the house. I want to point out. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No,  but you know, I have, you don't have an office to go to or do you? I don't know. No, I mean, like

Start time: 1074.30
End time: 1089.24
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  this, this is the spare bedroom in our place and it's, uh, uh, we, I've been here 23 years in this  very room cranking out code. So, um, hence why you can see on the shelves behind me, things like

Start time: 1089.42
End time: 1096.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  original halo in it's box. I thought I saw that, but then I thought, Oh, it must be dreaming.

Start time: 1096.94
End time: 1113.68
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  That's, that's, it's like looking behind me. I can see halo, uh, some star wars games, some like  age of empires. It's just cause I haven't cleaned the shelves up. That's it. Well,  they're pretty tidy looking there. They look good. It's not quite as curated as some of the other

Start time: 1113.78
End time: 1136.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  people, shall we say on the show? Sometimes you'll put it in color order. You could do that. Maybe  just, I think that's a little weird personally. Um, yeah, actually I think about losing your eyesight  as for a coder, that's gotta be the worst possible outcome for me losing my hearing. And as my hearing  deteriorates and I realize it's, you know, your life, your, your, your life work is at risk. So

Start time: 1137.08
End time: 1204.74
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  that's, I understand that's scary. Yeah. I mean, I'd like, I, I'm not losing my sight as such, like  at least currently, uh, you know, it's just, I, I'm limited in the time that I can look at computer  screens and phones. So I have to kind of choose that carefully, which might be a good thing.  Yeah. No, I mean, I think it is a good thing. And I've actually, one of the things that came out of  this is I started to read books again, which is something that I kind of fell off for 20 years  and I'm now way back into it. Oh, good. And it's like, I thought my attention span had  permanently atrophied to the point that I couldn't sit down and read a book, but apparently I can.  So, you know, like I, I'm not, I'm okay. You know, I, uh, it's, but it, but it is, there were points  certainly in the last year where I was, you know, genuinely thinking, you know, I got my, my max  loaded max studio, I ordered it. And then by the time it arrived, I was starting to have like first  symptoms of stuff. And I was thinking, why did I order this, you know, like 5,000 pound computer?  I don't even know if we'll be able to use the thing. But when he says pounds,

Start time: 1204.88
End time: 1255.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just, for our American audience, it's not weight. No, I mean, those things are pretty heavy,  but not that heavy. I bought, uh, I bought the new MacBook pro and I thought I'd bring it in for a  show and not MacBook pro MacBook era for show until the 15 inch. And you know, I'm sad because, uh,  uh, it's unfortunate, but on Macedon Stammy, uh, Paul Stata, my, uh, said, well, because I was  saying how nice I thought the screen was. And he said, well, how can, how does that compare to the,  the, uh, what do they call them? The XDK screens on the MacBook pro, which my wife has a MacBook  M2 MacBook pro max with 64 gigs of Ram 14 inch. So I put them side by side and now I don't like it  anymore. I want my, I want the MacBook pro. I'm like, Oh man, it really is crisp and nice and

Transcript:  possible Apple VIP. Not really. Oh, I'll never forget going to a lounge. I think we were flying  to England and I was at, I don't remember which lounge it was. Maybe the British airways lounge  and Johnny Ive was going to be in the lounge and they had roped off an area with a velvet rope  and they had, and they had balloons and they had his welcome, sir. Johnny. I mean, it was VIP  central. It was bizarre. And everybody's trying to sneak a peek of, of sir. Johnny and his private  lounge. You're telling me that you don't get balloons. No, no, I don't get balloons. I don't  get nothing. I'm sad. I do remember that day because I couldn't find my ticket. I had a,  I just got e-vest on and I had too many pockets. Where is it? I know it's in here somewhere. I

It's, it's,  it's rarely, it's like, it's like, well, Jason thought here, so we have Paul McCartney on, but  we don't want to talk all about music or, you know, societal change since the sixties.

Transcript:  my opinion of Paul McCartney went up enormously after watching all of that get back documentary.  Wasn't that amazing? And it was like, I was like, Oh, he really did have to corral all these people  and he was doing all this work. Wow. Okay. Yeah. You know, so that, that was one thing about that.

Transcript:  John comes in with Yoko. The other thing is my, my opinion of Yoko went up that she wasn't the,  you know, the evil wife breaking up the Beatles there. She just was sitting there knitting,  but really the problem was they were both on heroin. John and Yoko were completely zoned out

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  but George is the one that brought the 24 track. He had like the, the crazy 24 track recorder  that took like a, a electrical engineer to run, you know, like there was this one kid who knew  how to run it and he's the only one that had to run it. And it was like this very complex. Yeah.  It was a really great documentary. Like you think like when Peter Jackson did it, you were like,  I don't know why he did that. Like it just seemed like a really deep dive. And now you want,  I haven't seen the whole, the long version, but I'm,

Or, you know, they're trying to figure out how to,  what get back is going to be. And just watching them compose a song. Or even like all the extra

Start time: 1522.22
End time: 1575.62
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  no, no, that's not, that's not. Yoko was a completely benign presence the entire time.  She just reading the racing news, knitting every once in a while she'd break out and  but it wasn't, you know, it was welcome. Nobody was minding it. Yeah. The best part is of course,  when they were really far afield now, it's your fault when you mentioned Palmer. But the best part  is when they put a microphone in the teapot in the lunch room and without their knowledge recorded  John and Paul and Paul and Paul's really trying to keep John in the band. And it was, it was really  interesting to hear that real, very genuine dynamic when they thought they were off mic and off camera.  It's a little, you know, here we are sitting there. Really? They put a microphone in the teapot. That  was rude, but I'm glad they did. Thank goodness. Yeah. They, for my historical point of view.

Start time: 1597.82
End time: 1732.76
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  tracks? So I'll watch like with the, the, the remote stuff. Like there's no point for a developer  like me really to do the travel over for the current kind of format of conference, because  you're going to end up spending like $10,000 to sit in Apple park and watch a video that I could  also watch. That's a good point. And there is, you know, it's more now than it was. Like I think  as the years go past, I think they're adding more and more like in-person stuff that is actually,  I think useful. And maybe next year is the time where I would actually go over. But so what I've  done for the last couple of years is, you know, I'll sit and I'll watch the, the keynote and the  state of the union live and sort of, previously I would tweet out my unfiltered thoughts and now I  just post them to mastodon. It's much the same. And, you know, I will then like get the sort of  high level view of everything and then I'll see what has changed, what I think is going to impact  me. Like it's always good when you can come out of a keynote and think, I actually don't need to  do it. I think that is the best feeling in the entire world of like, if I do nothing, everything  will still work. And it's cool because in that situation is like, Oh, I could actually spend  some time working on features and things for the users rather than just catching up with what Apple  wants this year. But I mean, so you see what the big stuff is. And then it's a case of like watch,  you know, they release a bunch of the sessions day by day. I mean, everything is recorded probably  weeks beforehand now, which I think is good because it gives, you know, some of the people  who are presenting who would, if I had to do it, certainly I would freak out standing in front of  like a thousand to 5,000 people having to give a very technical talk live with a code which could  break at a moment's notice. And that now they can at least, they can have a lot of people on who are  doing their things and recording their stuff. And I will sit and I will watch, you know, just what

Start time: 1732.96
End time: 1741.88
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  interests me. I'm curious as to, I've watched probably 20 or 30 other ones from this, this,  and usually that's about the range that I watch from WDC. And how many are there total? Is that

Start time: 1742.02
End time: 1755.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  like a third of the total? So many. Yeah, there's a lot. Okay. 30s a lot. Sounds like a lot to me  because they're each an hour long. That's a lot of hours to put in. Yeah. There's a lot of half an

Start time: 1755.36
End time: 1764.76
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  hour I would say these days because they make them just basically the length they need to rather  than, you know, you have to fill a particular slot in the conference. Yeah. I think that it was,

Start time: 1764.92
End time: 1807.48
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think that there there's about a hundred of them, I think somewhere in that ballpark,  like 90 to 110 typically there. There's typically six a day for there used to be four rooms that  did them. So four rooms that did six a day. And then, and they would have to add to your point.  Most of them had to, the target was I think to last like 40 minutes or 45 minutes long. And,  and a lot of times it felt like things were getting stretched out because they don't take Q&A.  So it wasn't, you weren't, you weren't getting any benefit from it. I have to say that I,  I find them much more pleasurable to watch now than they, than when they were live. The audio  is much better. The imagery is much better, which is much easier to watch them, especially at speed,  except in the dub dub BC app, which doesn't have a, I don't know if you watch them at one X or do

Start time: 1807.60
End time: 1812.80
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  you watch them faster than I watch at one X. If I watched anything at higher speed, my brain would

Start time: 1812.88
End time: 1841.18
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  explode. I go into motion mode. So I'm the problem with the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  the Apple TV app is that it runs it. It's a 1.5 or two. You can always tell that someone doesn't  actually watch things fast when they skip 1.75, because 1.75 is the right number for most things.  And so, so I'm always like on the tee top of those, but I just find them to be, I felt like  it's a huge jump forward as far as I'm curious. So you, I mean, the, the other thing that they do

Start time: 1841.32
End time: 1877.04
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  in them is that they have the transcripts there immediately, which is very helpful because like  I can, before I even watch a session, I can just have a quick scan through the transcript and see  if it is talking about the kind of thing that I'm interested in. Sometimes it's not obvious,  particularly from the title, what the level of technical complexity is going to be. So yeah,  I mean, I, I like, I think the developer is pretty good. I, as I say, I watch all the stuff at one X  anyway. But I can't watch all of it because there's so much. And if I do try and watch all

Start time: 1877.04
End time: 1881.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  of it, I will remember none of it. Well, and you want to watch the stuff that's germane to the,

Start time: 1882.26
End time: 1916.24
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  you know, your program. Yeah. Yeah. And some of it is also, you want to watch the stuff that's  like new and exciting. So like all the vision pro stuff that that's kind of like, well, this is,  how are they going to do this? You know, what, because you get the broad strokes in the other  things, but then you get in like, how is this implemented? How, uh, what can I do? What can't  I do? Um, and yeah, so I've watched a lot of vision pro stuff, which is not like we haven't,  we can't even order SDKs at this point. So, you know, I have front-loaded my brain with all the

Start time: 1916.38
End time: 1933.66
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  information that is completely useless at this point. And may well change. I mean, I, I really  get the feeling I likened it, uh, on one of our shows to a concept car that you might see  at an auto show. I get the feeling that when it does come out, it may be a somewhat different  product. In fact, I'm betting, I'm betting that the scary eyes in the front will be gone.

Start time: 1935.70
End time: 1960.64
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  I think they're a hundred percent staying. I think that's the core thing of their design  because it's like they are, they are a, nobody else has ever done it. So this thing stands out,  even if it stands out in a way that I don't like. But I think like I get what they're trying to do  that they're trying to kind of make it less cutting you off from the world.

Start time: 1960.64
End time: 1970.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's the sense. Yeah, but you are cut off and, and putting an uncanny valley pair of eyes  on the front does not make you less cut off. I'm sorry. It just makes people run away

Start time: 1970.50
End time: 1976.08
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  in the other direction. To be honest, I will say I haven't tried it. So like,

Start time: 1976.10
End time: 1986.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  yeah, neither has any Apple executive. I think it's telling that they didn't, nobody wore them,  which means they're not ready, right? That they're all simulated in the, in the videos.

Start time: 1986.98
End time: 2133.72
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think like, I suspect the stuff is like three quarters there. And I think that,  you know, the, the, the foundations are probably working pretty well. I mean, from the sands of the  people I know who have got demos, like the technology, like the hardware certainly was  impressive. Some of the software, like, I know some people that when they had their heads scanned  for the FaceTime thing, they didn't get a particularly pleasant looking avatar out of that.  But, you know, I could see that stuff improving. I just, I, I, it's like, so when the iPad came out,  or before the iPad came out, when, when there was, it was announced and we got developer kits for it,  we could write apps in the simulator. And same for the watch and same for other things,  like we could write the apps and we could see them on a screen and we could interact with them.  But it didn't give you the sense of what it would be like to actually use the thing, which  affects how you build your apps. So there is a sort of, once you're actually using it,  there's a feedback process of I'm playing with it. Oh, this makes sense to do it this way. Or this  is, you know, this thing is too far away from where your fingers would be, or this button is  too small or something. And I think there's going to be a process for this as well. It's like,  once we actually get to use them and see what it's like to use them. And this is such a shift  in terms of like, thinking and design. I mean, in some ways it's not because like the apps  they're showing off are kind of like, mostly 2D windows that you're moving around with 3D content.  But until I have one of those things on my face, and I am actively running my code on it, I,  I am hesitant to pass judgment on it, because I just don't know what it's like. And I,  I have skepticism, I don't, I still don't know what it's for. Like, I get, I get that this is  like, technologically, possibly the most sophisticated piece of consumer electronics ever made,  shall we say. I still don't get what it's for. But I haven't tried it. So that's the thing. I

Start time: 2134.02
End time: 2159.02
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  can't, I can't throw stones at it. Yeah, specifically, specifically about the magic eyeballs.  I'm not sure that that that could be that could become the touch bar of the Vision Pro. That could  be the thing that, okay, we really thought this, we had something, it turns out we didn't have  anything here. We're going to start to give you back all the buttons that you're complaining  that you didn't have, you know. And if they're going to make a less expensive version, those,

Start time: 2159.30
End time: 2164.10
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  those, those screens are one way to cut a couple hundred bucks. Yeah. Not only that, but that's a

Start time: 2165.42
End time: 2280.64
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  display right at the very, very front of the device on a device that could be made lighter  anyway. And you don't want weight at the front anyway. The other, and another problem is that  this is, I've been reading a lot more about, like what, like what designers of night vision goggles  have been learning about just the, just the mechanics of how to design something that you  wear on your face and people are going to be looking around through the world at. And another  complaint that's coming through about this design is that because you have this screen, this has to  be, has to cover the entire front plate. You can't have cameras like right where your, where your  pupils would be, which, and so they're going to be lowered like another like inch or so from where  you're actually looking, which it remains to be seen how confusing that's going to be.  There's a paper that I read about, again, people who are designing these things for night vision,  saying that even moving these down a little bit causes a bit of confusion because the brain,  it creates a whole bunch of problems where the brain adapts. And then when you take the goggles  off, your brain now has to deal with the fact that there's, there's this entirely new way of  looking at the world. So there are a lot of small things about it. It just, it just, and a lot of  these things are going to be maybe worth the expense, so to speak, because of the technology,  but I, it really changed my mind about again, what I have to call derisively the magic eyeball  effect that has to really now be very, very important. It has to be crucial. It has to be  a signature thing that says, Oh my God, Apple has figured something out here that no one else  has figured out and everybody has to start stealing this idea. It turns out to be such  a great idea to have this screen facing outward to make it worth like the extra weight and the  extra changes that makes it the balance. And in my eye, I don't, and I don't think it's, it just looks  I think there's a reason why they didn't demo it to anybody at all under any circumstances during

Start time: 2280.68
End time: 2331.06
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  WWDC. And I'm assuming that the eyes and that the like section of face that they're displaying  is the same CG face that they're capturing for FaceTime. I think everybody thinks that it is.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I do think that there is going to be like that slight extra uncanny valley to  that view because if it is, if it is that, but still I haven't seen it. So I like, this could be  like, when I see it in person that I will go, right, I get it. This makes sense.  Um, yeah. So I, I'm, I'm hesitant, but curious enough that I will probably drop three and a half  thousand dollars to see how it works. Well, another data point from a scooter X and our IRC,

Start time: 2332.20
End time: 2343.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the Apple vision pro video is now the most viewed Apple video on YouTube with 50 million views in  the first week. So there's certainly interest in it. People want to see it. I mean, like, yeah,

Start time: 2344.78
End time: 2379.34
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  this is, I think probably the most kind of futuristic thing they've done for a long time.  I mean, like the iPhone, when we all got the iPhone, we were like, this is great. It has a  great user interface. This entirely makes sense. You know, we, they've done like amazing things,  but it, it, it's a phone. You know, we understand this. It's a touch screen. We've kind of seen  those before. Not as good as this. This thing is like, Oh, and here's a spaceship. Right.  They've boldly gone where I've, I've never flown a spaceship before. I don't know what it's like.

Start time: 2379.80
End time: 2389.36
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. We don't know. That's right. And I think Apple deserves, and a lot of people give it  a lot of credit for what Apple's done in the past, but this is not like anything Apple's done in the

Start time: 2389.52
End time: 2416.24
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  past. It is a bit of a reach for them. I think the pricing also helps scare off a lot of the,  a lot of folks that aren't sure. So you're going to end up with a lot of people that are there  testing it. I think that it, it is, I think that, I think that they'll probably keep the eyes in some  form. They're going to have to keep on developing them. I think that they're, they're part of the  interface to tell you that someone's looking at you. Right. No, I understand why they're there.  They tell you why they're not there. But I think it's also the thing that's going to, that's people

Start time: 2416.34
End time: 2441.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  are going to fixate on as being the creepiest part of it. And I think that that's something Apple's  got to fight against. Hey, James, let me ask you if it's Mac OS or iOS or its own OS, you tooted  the day at WWDC that it looks like they're out of sync, that iOS 17, but XROS 1.0, somebody responded  to you that he didn't think it is iOS. Do you have a better sense of that now? I'm not a hundred

Start time: 2441.36
End time: 2457.04
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  percent sure. I mean, I think like it, like any of Apple's operating systems, they're all generally  certainly the, the, the iOS derivatives, like, you know, what's on a home pod or what's on a watch or  whatever. I think they're all kind of like, there's a lot of core stuff. That's the same.

Start time: 2457.30
End time: 2464.82

Start time: 2465.20
End time: 2483.42
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  I don't think that this is anything radically different from that, except it's got like a bunch  of real time stuff in it. Right. Um, so, you know, like I, I think all of these, all of these OSes  are related, you know, they're at least very close cousins. Yeah. Yeah. That makes, that's fair. Yeah.

Start time: 2484.88
End time: 2503.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the stack that, uh, Apple put in the keynote. Um, and so there are iOS frameworks  at the top level, as well as special frameworks that are spatial for the particular vision pro  and the spatial audio engine. Uh, plus the foveated renderer and the multi app 3d engine. Those

Start time: 2503.70
End time: 2523.20
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  are all unique to the vision pro. It's interesting. Yeah. Um, but that big core OS section of the  bot, that's probably the same thing that's on everything. Yeah. Um, same kernel cross whole  platforms. Yeah. And it's mock kernel. I think so. I mean, like the, like even my monitor is running

Like many of  you, especially during quarantine, I wanted to support my health, uh, with, you know, and I ended  up having a fistful of supplements that I would take every morning, but this has changed my life.  AG one from athletic greens. I can give my body what it craves all in one daily nutritional drink.  It's the first thing I drink in the morning. So this is 12 ounces of, of cold water. AG one comes,  you know, normally you'd get the, the packet, the big, big packet and the scoop, the month's supply  and the, and the canister, which comes with the full package, but I like these. I'm going to  Disneyland tonight and I'm going to bring these along with me. So I have my AG one and my travel  packs. It shakes up easily. It tastes fantastic. AG one's been around for a long time since 2010.  It's become part of a million routines since, uh, I've, you know, when I started doing the, uh,  AG one thing, I asked around and everybody I know, they approve it. I haven't used that for years.  It's the best all in one solution for daily nutrition. Saves you time, confusion, money,  a lot of money. I was spending a lot of money, $3 a day, a little less than $3 a day for AG one.  It's got everything. Uh, it's got supplements. It's got probiotics, prebiotics. This is the best  bang for your buck. A seamless, easy daily habit that covers your day's nutritional basis. 75 high  quality minerals, vitamins, pre and probiotics.

Transcript:  include iPadOS as well if you want. I think the, I mean, there was, there was lots of little things  that, you know, that's how it's been for the last few years, right? It's, it's all kind of a little  incremental. I mean, I think there was like, I genuinely said like by the time we got to the  keynote, just before the vision pro, like if that had been all there was, I would have been pretty  happy with the, the, the, the show because like there was enough stuff, like things like,  you know, the improvements to auto correct and stuff like that. That's going to affect like

Start time: 2771.68

Transcript:  Finally. Um, and you know, there was little things like, you know, just the being able to share air  tags amongst people that is going to be so useful. So that like, if, uh, my,  you know, like if I put an air tag on my bike and my wife rides it, she's not going to get like a  constant warning that she's being tracked because it's so annoying. Yeah. Yeah. So there's lots of  little things like that, but I would say like the most, the thing that caught me the most was the,  the return of interactive widgets because that's, I think going to make a lot of stuff, a lot easier  in terms of, um, having like very quick access to doing stuff, you know, like you just want to  check off a task or do something and you don't want to fire up an entire app to do it. Um, and  so I have my own history with widgets. Yes, you do.  I may remember. Um, back in the distant past of 2014, when we got our first widgets, uh,  the first old school widgets, cause they're completely different mechanism. Uh, I built a  PCalk widget because there was a calculator widget that Apple did that was on the Mac and they didn't  do one on iOS. And I thought, well, they've done it on the Mac. So I'll do it on the Mac. I'll do  it on iOS as well. And, you know, as I said before, like the core logic of PCalk is small, self-contained.  So I just stuffed it in there and it released, it was very popular. It got featured by Apple on the  store as one of the best examples of a widget. Um, and then a few weeks after the introduction,  I got contacted by Apple and I was told I had to remove the widget. Um, because I quote, uh,  widgets couldn't perform calculations. That's so Apple. And it was the kind of,  one half of your company is featuring this as a great example. And then the other half is telling  me that widgets are not allowed to do this. So can't do it. And, uh, I tweeted about that  cause there was a bit of back and forth and then they basically said, look, final decision, this  is what's going to happen. There is no higher power. You can appeal to just accept it, remove it,  move on. Uh, so I tweeted about that. Then I went out for dinner and when I came back,  it had been retweeted a lot and had ended up on like CNN and places like that. And I was like,  Oh no, because like the Apple, Apple says don't run to the press. It never works. I think that  language is in the, um, the, the user, the, um, review guidelines. That's not true. You know,  running to the press does actually work sometimes, sometimes. Um, but I hadn't actually  intended it like that, but you know, people like Jason and whatever had picked this up and retweeted  Christina Warren, uh, said stuff about it. And, uh, it got big coverage and I got a phone call the  next day from Apple saying, we have changed our mind. You can do, you could, you know, widgets  could do anything they like. Uh, please carry on. And it was extremely surreal time, uh,  an extremely stressful time because I'd spent a lot of work on this to get them to working. And,  uh, it turned out to be an extremely lucrative time as well because it raised the profile,  of peak out enormously. Um, and like that year I bought, I think it was, I bought a pretty nice  retina IMAQ and I had a holiday in the sun. And that was how I relaxed from the stress of, of,  of all that. Um, and you know, I think the thing was like engineering, the engineering side,  we're absolutely happy with people doing this. They built these things to be flexible and,  you know, whatever the mark, the, um, app store editorial people were happy with it because look,  Hey, there's a thing people like it. It's great. It's functional. Um, somebody somewhere, I don't  know who had a problem with this. And, uh, it, that, that their mind was changed. I don't know  by the swell of public opinion or by somebody higher up the chain or whatever, but that change  happened. And what that actually meant, it wasn't just me because there were other people as well  who were told, nah, your widgets doing too many things. We don't like this because we're Apple

Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  see, you could still generate math, you know, adding numbers together, pretty like, uh, basic  stuff for CPUs. Um, there may have been, I think like I was pushing the bands of how much memory  the widget was using, but there was a fixed limit. And it was like, it was very low. It was like  64 megabytes. You could use that and then, you know, your, your widget got killed. And  so there was a lot of optimization to fit it into that space, but it worked and it fitted fine.

Start time: 3130.54
End time: 3138.24
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Um, so that's actually an amazing number to think that you need 64 megabytes to implement a widget.

Start time: 3138.72
End time: 3201.44
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  It's kind of mind boggling. Um, but, but like fast forward to this WWDC announcement and we've had  these non-interactive widgets for the last couple of years since 2020, um, which are completely  different. They're written in Swift UI. Um, and you can have buttons on them, but the button just  triggers a URL which can open your app and do a specific. They were basically images on the screen.  They were not. Yeah. I mean, like they effectively, um, you can have some interactive, uh, like  timers and things on them. I think anyway, point being that, uh, like you could do something like  in dice by Pico. Okay. I've got widgets and it's got like an array of dice on it and you press one  of those and it will launch the app and it'll tell the app to roll that dice. So it works as a kind  of quick launcher, but what these now do is you're, uh, you can have a button that when you press it,  it will execute a piece of code and then you can transmit information back to the widget.

Start time: 3201.54
End time: 3211.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're interactive. You can, you could do something with them, which is kind of what you  did when you first did the widgets, right? Way back when. Yeah. So I was listening to, um,

Transcript:  upgrade, uh, with, uh, Jason and Mike Hurley and they were, they had just come out of like some  briefings or whatever and they said, uh, James can't make a calculator with this. Um, you know,  it's not, it's not meant for that. It's, it's, you know, it can't be done basically. I think.

Start time: 3234.18
End time: 3242.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3242.48
End time: 3263.76
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  said, don't James, don't get excited. I have, I have no knowledge as to what transpired,  who they talked to. But somebody said, all I heard was you're not allowed to do this.  And so what I did was before the end of that day, I had a working prototype of a peak out running

Start time: 3264.72
End time: 3271.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  as a widget in the environment. Well, it was like, it was a challenge. They threw down the gauntlet.

Start time: 3272.74
End time: 3294.84
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  I mean, they didn't throw it down, but it was, it was like the best way to get me to do something  is to tell me that I am not allowed to do. So I, I have a prototype, but you know, it's just,  it's a really basic thing and it looks terrible, but it's got buttons on it. You can push the  buttons and you get numbers, you know, so, but are you afraid that if you did that, they would,

Start time: 3295.16
End time: 3305.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  they said, then say, well, yes, technically you're able, but we're not going to let you.  What would you have the same issue that you had last time? This is indeed the billion dollar

Start time: 3305.70
End time: 3389.40
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  question. You know, what is going to happen if I submit this and I don't know the answer.  And the thing is there's nothing in the rules to say that you can't do it. So what they would have  to do is they would have to say something like, well, we've now got a rule which says you cannot  have more than four buttons or something like that, or, you know, but they have to actually  specify it and they have to draw like, you can't, it's very difficult when you're saying like,  these things can be interactive and they can write, run code, but they can't run too much  or they can't be too, I mean, like, for example, if I made a dice by peak out widget,  almost exactly the same look as the current one, and it's got a row of buttons for different dice,  I could have a thing. You press a D 20 and it gives you back a number between one and 20.  Is that too much calculations? Is that, you know, am I crossing the line with that? But I'm not,  or I'm not crossing the line with that, but I am crossing it with a calculator. And somebody  somewhere has to sit down and they have to formalize a rule or they have to just, you know, kind of,  what I hope is that they will say, hey, this is really cool. You've done it again. This is brilliant.  We all miss.

Transcript:  You're hoping, Andy, that they don't say, James, you're spunky and I hate spunk.  You got spunk.  The other way to interpret it.  You got moxie, kid.  Let me just completely parenthetically sidebar, but do you use Apple's random number generator  or do you create your own or how do you make sure that those dice numbers are random?  I use Apple's. Apple has good random numbers.  Is it pseudo? But it is pseudo.

Start time: 3487.70
End time: 3513.90
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  It is pseudo, but it's good and it's genuinely good enough for like rolling a d20 or something  But I also, I don't know what the number is at that point.  What I do is when I roll the dice, I'm simulating the physics of it.  So I have a 3D object with weight and I'm throwing it, but I throw it and put a different  spin and force on the probe.  That's really cool.

Start time: 3514.72
End time: 3519.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 3520.84
End time: 3566.50
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  So that's where I use the random number stuff to work out just how much force or spin to put on  the dice as you roll it.  And then the physics engine takes over and it bounces around and once it stops moving,  you have a number.  I think that's a pretty good way to do it.  It's not like I say just give me a number between one and 20.  So I think it's pretty random.  You can also set it to auto roll and then export statistics if you want to know  exactly that this is not weighted or anything like that.  I stake my role playing game play on it being correct.

Transcript:  Oh, God bless you, sir.  I'm not being sarcastic.  I love your apps because they're like the food at a diner where it's like here is a cheese omelet,  but it's going to be executed absolutely perfectly.  This is at the pinnacle of what cooking can be simply because it's a basic thing,  but executed with no excuses, no mistakes, no factor of it has not been thought about.  Even when you think it's done, they couldn't enhance it.  You enhance your stuff more.  So when I think that you're adding a dice tower, I'm not saying, oh gosh, it's funny that no,  this is exactly what this app is supposed to be.  It'll be the Socratic Dice Tower.

Transcript:  Glenditt's page.  The platonic deal of dice towers.  I think James is in the pantheon of Apple developers for that reason.  And I think that's one of the things that makes it was first the Mac, but in general, Apple,  I hope they give people credit because one of the things that makes Apple so appealing in all of its  hardware is that there are a few handful of developers.  We used to call them the delicious library guys, right?  Who put that extra care into their apps who are really in, you know, they're not just  cranking them out, which is something you see on the Windows side more.  And I think that's what makes Apple unique.  And so thank you, James, because at Apple, really, honestly, Apple should absolutely  venerate you because that is the distinction, in my opinion, between Apple software and everybody  else's software.

I don't think I entered while I was an Apple employee because that would be wrong.  But I think it was shortly afterwards or something.  But anyway, Drag Thing, if anybody remembers.  Oh, I love Drag Thing.  Apple launcher.  Yeah.  That was entered for one once and I basically got told, and I was asked to submit it.  So I submitted it.  And then they said, no.  And I was like, well, why did you ask me?  Oh my God.  So I never did anything from there.  And nowadays it's pretty much, I kind of, you know, don't call us, we'll call you.  We will find your apps.  And I think it's right that they're celebrating the new stuff and not the  stuff that's been around for 30 years because everybody knows.  Not everybody.

The only thing that I really miss about not having an iPhone, about having Android is that  I love I love my my Android hardware.  I love the things that I can do with the end or that I can't do with the iPhone.  But the creativity and the, I don't know, the artistry of the apps just isn't there.  They're great.  They're solid.  They do what they have to do.  I can't remember the last time that I downloaded an app to my Android phone that gave me the  level of delight that most most iPhone apps do.  That's something that's something that Apple really needs to be praised for.  As much as we laugh about about the interactions between Apple and developers time and time  again, they've created something that attracts the sort of people that, oh my God, this is a  wonderful canvas.  I can be as weird as I want.  I can I can execute a program and app to the extent of my individuality here.  And Google just has never been able to do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, there was.  We used to call it the delicious generation because of a delicious library.  Those are very skeuomorphic.  All of those.  We've come a long way since then, but there is absolutely a care and attention to detail  and even more an attention to aesthetics on the Apple side that just is really lacking  everywhere else.  And that's one of the reasons we still love our Macs.  Apple really needs to understand that.  They put that into their hardware and their OS.

Start time: 3917.48
End time: 3937.68
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think that that's also why it's hard to get Mac, Apple users when there's an iPhone or Mac or  iPad to go to another platform.  Yeah, it's because you open it up and you just feel like the fit and finish is gone.  Like, you're just kind of like you went from something that everything's kind of nice and  rounded and fitting and everything fits together and then everything's kind of like it's all still  there.  It's just not pretty anymore.

Start time: 3938.94
End time: 4101.56
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  The thing that is like, you know, when when Apple does something, yeah, let's say the new  settings app or something and everybody's tearing, tearing stuff apart or whatever.  And like, oh, Apple's completely lost the ability to do design, blah, blah, blah.  And then you actually compare all that stuff to any other platform and it is still superior.  You know, I think that's the thing that people forget is like, yes, we complain about this stuff.  We complain about this stuff because we love it and because it's, you know, we feel, ah,  this could be slightly more Mac like, you know, this whatever it is.  But yeah, I mean, I've been using a few other, you know, like, show me the television that the  user interface is in any way good.  Yeah.  I've never seen one.  Horrible.  Yeah.  And even like I got, I just got the one of the Hobo Libra 2 e-readers and it's nice,  but the interface isn't quite as good as it should be.  Yeah.  And it's the same on every piece of consumer electronics.  It's just like, it's functional, but it's not consistent and it's not whatever.  So yeah, I mean, I've still got like sat next to me.  I have a copy of the human interface guidelines from 91 or whatever it is.  I was just going to refer to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that book was like my Bible when it was developing software.  It was like, read this, internalize it.  I literally at university, we had my favorite class of like the entire computing science course  that I did was a human interface design class.  And what they would do is they would take something like the open and save boxes on the Mac  and they would completely disassemble it and say, this is why they made this choice.  And we would do things like we would do user testing and it's like, let's find out what the  best way to do something is to make it easy for users or whatever.  And I think that kind of class is still ingrained in my brain as I want to do this right.  And those guidelines and everything else.  So I think that is, and even people who like are young, but they didn't encounter that stuff,  or they've started on iOS or whatever, it's still there is the quality there that inspires  people to make more quality things so that they look good on the platform.

I'm sure there were others, but for some reason, Apple really had this vision,  this unified vision in 1984 and continued it.  It's attenuated a little bit and things like settings,  maybe you're an example of where it's not quite huge too.  That's very modal.  But if you compare it with settings on Windows, the control panel on Windows.  I mean, you'll appreciate it.

Transcript:  And I think that one of the things that did drive that is Steve Jobs very early on  learned calligraphy.  He was an esthete for sure.  And really was into topography and everything else.  Topography is kind of in many ways the finest version of attention to detail  because you're talking about the space between things and how big the serifs are  and what the X height is and all of those things make a difference.  And I think when you're paying attention to things at that level,  it's one of the things like, for instance, when I use Keynote, you can tell  the difference between Keynote and other...  Absolutely.  Yeah.  How it handles the font.  It's just a different way of anti-aliasing, spacing, everything else is just a little  bit better and it gives it a higher gravity to it.  And so that's the thing.  When you pay attention to that level of detail.  And again, I think that a lot of folks that use Apple products are either consciously  or unconsciously are just used to that.  That's how everything works.

I really do want to delve into a little bit iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17  and some of the features that you're looking forward to, James, and things that you've  noticed.  We've got to go deeper on that, but it's really great to have James Thompson here,  legendary Apple designer and developer, creator of pCalc and pDice.  He's the P-Man.  And we're glad to have him.  I think we need to change that.  Yeah.  That's not probably what you want to have in your lower third.  Also, Andy Hanako is here.  He's the G-Man and Alex Lindsay.  He is, I don't know what, man, but we have the entire Justice League united here on the  show for you today.  Our show brought to you by Melissa, the M-Man, a leading global data quality identity  verification and address management solutions provider.  They're the ones.  They've been doing this since, believe it or not, longer than James has been doing  pCalc since 1985, specializing in global intelligence solutions so that organizations  can unlock accurate data for a more compelling customer view.  And you know what?  Every year they get the awards.  G2 has once again named Melissa's Clean Suite and Data Quality Suite leaders by G2,  the leading peer-to-peer software platform in the 2023 Data Quality and Address Verification  Spring Report.  Also named Momentum Leader and High Performer in the same reports.  Across the small business, mid-market and enterprise segments, Melissa has received  many recognitions, including Good Partner, Easiest to Do Business With, Easiest Setup,  Highest User Adoption, and Easiest Admin.  If you're a Melissa customer, you know Melissa definitely deserves that.  If you're not, you should know what Melissa can do.  It's pretty impressive.  Melissa is also very affordable, I should mention.  They ranked highly in the price category for Clean Suite and Data Quality Suite  across many segments.  That's because Melissa firmly believes you should make money on data quality.  It shouldn't cost you more than it saves.  So they continue to offer the best affordable solutions for data quality  and address verification.  I think everybody kind of intuitively understands that bad data in your contact  list can cost you money.  But did you know poor data quality can cost organizations an average of $15 million a year?  And that number goes up.  Every year, bad data stays in your system.  Melissa will help you eliminate waste and lost opportunities from incorrect mailings.  It'll improve your customer satisfaction with seamless real-time identity verification tools.  If you have to comply with various federal and international guidelines, you know that  sometimes customer verification is a problem, is a friction point for your customers.  Not with Melissa.  Their real-time identity verification tools are fast and effective.  They have matching and deduplication tools, which will help you eliminate dupes.  I tell this story all the time.  A restoration hardware used to send me five of their catalogs, same name and address,  same catalog every six months.  And it was bizarre because I know those catalogs, beautiful, four-color, thick catalog,  must have cost them a ton.  What a waste.  Plus it kind of irritates the customers, right?  You want a single high-quality customer record that links all the customer touch points.  So without duplication, right?  So you know everything you need to know about your customer to serve them without annoying them.  You'll be glad to know Melissa complies with the U.S. Postal Service's move update requirements,  which means you're getting the most current address data because they process through  the USPS's National Change of Address Database.  But that's just one of many ways, Melissa, to make sure your data is accurate.  Since 1985, and don't worry your data is safe with Melissa, they continually undergo independent  security audits to reinforce their commitment to data security, privacy, and of course compliance.  They're SOC 2 compliant, HIPAA compliant, GDPR compliant.  You can use Melissa with confidence.  Make sure your customer contact date is up to date.

The debugger in Think Pascal was one of the best.  And I believe one of the people who worked on Think Pascal was Rich Siegel of BB Edit fame.  I didn't know that.  So they were in Boston.  That's right.  Yeah.  And yeah, that's where I got started.  And we were doing our coursework at university in Think Pascal.  And I realized that the copy of Think Pascal that they gave us  had all the Mac Toolbook stuff with it.  And I was like, hey, I could actually write an app with this.  So I went out and I bought Inside Mac, like one, two, I think I got like one, two, three, and six.  And I missed, or seven.  And I missed like some critical things.  So the first version of Peacock, if you ran it on a color machine, bad things happened.  But yeah, it was like I bought all those books at vast expense.  Yeah.  And just sat for the summer.

Transcript:  You use Swift now entirely in Xcode?

Start time: 4695.44
End time: 4807.64
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  Nope.  So I'm using, Peacock was written in Pascal, hand converted to C,  a C++ wrapper around that, then an objective C wrapper around that, then a Swift wrapper around  that. So the analogy that I always use with Peacock is if you remember Star Trek,  the motion picture where they discover that the enormous entity that is threatening them,  like right at the center of it is the original Voyager probe.  Voyager, yeah.  And then there's all this just layers around it. That is what Peacock is.  So a lot of my code is objective C at this point.  And because Peacock has been around long enough, some of it's rewritten, some of it,  new stuff like widgets is all Swift and Swift UI, whatever.  But there's no real point in rewriting existing working code as you write new stuff.  Yes. And when I did Dice, Dice was like, it was a spin off of the about screen from Peacock.  And I was challenged by Jason Snell to make a Dice rolling app. And I decided I would make one  and ship one in, I think I gave myself a week and I actually took me two weeks from new project to  being on the app store was like two weeks. But because I was reusing a lot of Peacock,  code in that, that is also objective C and remains objective C. So I'm a contradiction  in that I simultaneously like to adopt new exciting things as quickly as possible,  but I'm also extremely conservative in some of the technology choices I make  because now this stuff works.

Start time: 4807.88
End time: 4815.78

Start time: 4815.98
End time: 4832.96
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  No, it's not actually too bad. You can call Swift and objective C,  you can interoperate between them very easily. And you can have one bit of your app being  Swift UI and one bit being just regular UI kit. It's actually pretty good for that sort of stuff.

Transcript:  So I actually want to kind of stick with 3D because you really did do an early 3D  app. So you were right on that bandwagon from day one. Are the interfaces for Vision OS  similar, different, better, worse?

Start time: 4857.00
End time: 4890.09
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  I mean, it's pretty similar. I mean, everything, what they're trying to encourage developers to  use is Swift UI, which they've extended out for 3D stuff. But you can still port over your UI kit  app as far as I can tell. There's also Reality Kit is what they have been using for AR stuff  previously, which exists and has been extended in-

Start time: 4891.46

Start time: 4894.78
End time: 4940.40
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think there's going to be things that I need to do. Like with dice, I'll need to  enhance things because like I said before, the scene kit, which is the main thing dice uses,  isn't a thing that you can really use for 3D. But I have this Reality Kit test mode,  which I use for doing the AR stuff. And I know that I can build that out fairly easily and  have something that will work in 3D. I mean, I haven't dug deep into things like the hand gesture  stuff and like how, you know, will I be able to like pick up a dice with my hand?  Oh, that would be cool.  Roll it. And I think that might be possible.

Start time: 4940.52
End time: 4950.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 4950.94
End time: 4971.02
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  No, I think you can. I think you can use stuff and you can use direct interaction with objects.  I don't think it's going to be a case that you have to do it like the sort of the pinching  your fingers together and looking at stuff. I think there could be some hands-on stuff.

Start time: 4973.18
End time: 5008.72
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Those are the questions I'm going to find really, really interesting where I think that sometimes  you get sort of like an inner... You get into a problem where it's like interface  skeuomorphism where, hey, if I want to roll the dice on this actual real world table in front of  me, the obvious way to do it is that I'm going to let the user reach out with their hand and pick  up the dice and roll them when that could be cool and fun. But when you get to the part where  people like this app and they actually want to use it, maybe they would just rather have like  a hovering widget that they can just tap on. And then like a dice cup simply raises up on its own  as if magically shakes it and then dumps itself out.

Start time: 5010.10
End time: 5044.16
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  I think that is the case. And I think if you were actually with your vision pro on playing  Dungeons and Dragons over FaceTime, let us say, you might just want to have a little window off  at the side with your dice by P. Kalk in it and you tap a button or gesture at it and roll the  dice. You probably don't want to be sitting like in a cave surrounded by dragons. While that would  be cool, I don't know that that is like the... I don't think people specifically roll dice or do

Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  They do. Because even on the iPhone, when it's got the, what do you call it? The depth indicator  stuff. Lidar. Yes. With the Lidar, it's scanning the room and it's building a 3D model of the  surfaces that it sees. So long as it's seen it, if you roll the dice, it will fall off your table  naturally and will roll under a chair. And there is like even just doing that through a phone or  iPad screen, which is not the way to do AR, there is something magical about having a  dice roll out, roll under a table.  Because it should. That's what dice does.

And that's, you know, because that's where the money is. Well, it's also the whole  app store economy is just a weird thing, you know, and like actually making money is difficult.  It's, I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's easier if you've been around for 30 years and people know  your name and your products, but coming to stuff, you know, if you've got an app that you're  launching and you're trying to get it in front of people, that's a really hard thing to do.

So when you, when you, when, and this comes pre-painted, I got to tell  you, but if you wanted to change the colors, you could do that. I like the fact that it comes with  an iPhone, a microphone and an older iPhone. Cause I think this is an old, did you do this,  Patrick? Who did this? This is very nice. Got the Fez. I'm sitting on an exercise ball. Patrick,  very nice. Let's see. How about Sonoma? Anything? You know, I wasn't completely clear.

Start time: 5410.84

Windows flirted with it under, and then decided this is  too much of a hazard. I could, I could see them bringing it back now that, now that Apple's doing  it. So I'm, I look forward to that. I think it's going to be a nice feature. Yeah. I mean,

Start time: 5433.10
End time: 5489.92
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  there was a few little things that I really liked, like the being able to turn web pages into  standalone web apps. How close is that to the full PWA or is that just Apple's version of? No,  this is just, I think this is just basically, it's just wrapping a safari window into an app  that, you know, you can layer, layer amongst other apps and it's got an app in the dock and things  like that. It's, it's the, it seems like the ideal kind of thing that you can like constrain  Facebook or something like that into. So it's kept securely away from everything else.  And I think I was looking at the list of things, you know, there's nothing that's like amazing. I  mean, like the, the game mode stuff and the, you know, the, the more interesting commitment to doing

Start time: 5490.04
End time: 5521.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  game stuff. I find that interesting. Well, I was, I think we've been talking about it. We're very  pleased to see Apple wrote a fairly long 20,000, according to Christina Warren, who wrote an article  about it, 20,000 line addition to the crossover line library for Mac that allows you to run direct  X 12 games at a fairly good pace on the new Apple Silicon laptops. Yeah, I, I would say the, the,

Start time: 5521.96
End time: 5530.00
Speaker: Jason Thompson

Start time: 5530.20
End time: 5539.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  they say it's to test your game to see if you could port it to metal, but you gotta think  there are going to be people who are going to say, fine, I'll just take it the way it is. Thank you

Start time: 5539.56
End time: 5603.16
Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  very much. I don't, I don't think it's for that. I don't even know if I would let you do that,  but I think it like any, I know people who work for Mac game porting things and a lot of them  have internal libraries to do this kind of thing already to, to convert the direct X calls. And  I'm not a hundred percent sure. And I would need to look this up, whether Apple contributed the,  changes that they made to this back to the open source project or whether they, you know, like  are keeping them to themselves. I certainly heard some people complaining that they weren't  sharing what they had done. So I, I can't speak with authority to whether they did or not, but  it's interesting, but I think it is more a case of like here, here's your game running, like,  imagine how much better it would be if you actually spend some time and you converted this to metal.  Right. But you know, just the fact that people have run, you know, fairly modern games.

Transcript:  too, ultra graphics. It's good stuff and it's interesting. It does show what the performance  is. And I like the fact that Apple is kind of leaning into games a bit more because  certainly they've had a reputation for like, let's say the last 30 years of not being  great with games. But you know, even the stuff that they showed, you know, like they had Death  Stranding, which is a, I don't know, two, three year old game. And No Man's Sky and I love No  Man's Sky.

Transcript:  Well, it, it, it, it's, it's, it's in Unreal. I mean, it's, it's the same company, but MetaHuman  kind of lives in its own world. I'm sure it's using part of the engine, but, um, but MetaHuman  is pretty impressive, um, on a whole bunch of layers for a long time. We could only make things  that look like kind of like somebody cause you'd pull dials. Now we can do photogrammetry and  actually get ahead and replace the head and MetaHuman and have it all map. And the big thing  there is that you can animate it with your phone and stuff like that. So it's, it's kind of, it's,  it's slick. I mean, Epic, Epic's doing a lot of great stuff. Um, they are going to be most likely  on the outside looking in. I don't think that they're, I don't, I don't think that Apple and  Epic are talking. And so that puts them at a huge disadvantage to unity. Um, because, um, because  unity, I think is, I mean, obviously they were in WWC. So there's a lot of embrace, Apple's embracing  a lot of what unity's doing. And I don't, again, I don't think that Epic and Apple are in on

Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  yeah. It's like, I, it, it seems like that is just going to be a political thing, but I think the  people doing the technology, you know, as we say, like this thing for, um, MetaHuman for doing the  facial animation and stuff running on an iPhone. So it's not like the, it's not like Epic is saying

Start time: 6022.56

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  we shall never touch another. No, no, I don't think, I don't think, I don't think Epic wants to do  that. And I definitely don't think the unreal folks want to do it. I think that they're just  not going to get a lot of Apple's attention. You know, there's, it's not that your Apple's doing  anything to them. I just think that Apple's not going to step, Apple's probably not going to  step out of its way to help Epic at this point until they drop their lawsuits. So,  so I think that's going to probably be the, probably how that's going to work. So it'll  be interesting to see. I mean, unity fills a big gap and is what Epic was filling until Epic did  the lawsuit. Um, unity is filling a big gap for Apple because they can't, they can't build all

Start time: 6054.86
End time: 6067.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Yeah, the ponds are beer bottles  and Jim's the king. Obviously maybe we'll make a, I don't know who should be the queen.  But that would be kind of fun. And Anthony tells me he was using reality scan to capture me  and then he's going to rebuild it within MetaHuman to create a MetaHuman Leo. So you can now, I guess,

Start time: 6109.16

Start time: 6121.32
End time: 6152.44
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's expensive. Yeah. It's just, it's the, because it's not buying Unreal, it's buying Epic.  And Epic, Epic has a lot of money right now. This thing called Fortnite, you ever hear of it?  I mean, the problem with both Unity and Epic, they weren't worth a lot, you know, five or eight  years ago, but now they're both in the plus $15 billion valuation range. It's not that Apple can't  afford it. It would just be a huge, you know, I mean, I think that, and I think that, so I,  and it would be hard for them to, I think, incorporate those two things together. But yeah.

Start time: 6152.52

Start time: 6161.10
End time: 6190.40
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  costly, I think. Yeah. And the thing is, is that, is that the, you know, Unreal Engine is, is,  you know, obviously very connected to what Epic wants to do, which is the whole lawsuit is over,  you know, they want to build marketplaces. They want people to do exactly what we were  talking about earlier, which is sell items to each other in a metaverse and, you know,  sell houses and cars and all kinds of other things, but they don't want to give Apple 30%  of every sale. So that's the, so that their entire business model is wrapped up.

Start time: 6190.54

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Transcript:  Well, exactly. This is the company that fought each other viciously in court. It still is,  as far as I know. The battle continues. Epic Games net worth $32 billion, according to the  last valuation in April of last year. Apple could afford 32 billion. Come on, Apple. But yeah,  you'd have to do a hostile takeover, right? Are they, I don't even know if they're public,  to be honest. Anyway, that's a silly wasteful time. We've got Paul McCartney here. Let's ask  some important questions. You guys, anything? Alex, are you actively looking at developing  for the Vision Pro? Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm already in pre-production. Yeah. So yeah,

Start time: 6251.88
End time: 6502.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I mean, mostly we're looking at, you know, I'm mostly looking at the video end of things. So,  you know, how to deliver right now. It looks like we're still going to be kind of clamped.  When we say that Apple didn't cut any corner, I mean, didn't, you know, wasn't constrained by  price. I think they were constrained by either weight or heat or something, because most of us  think that the naturally eventually want to get to 120 frames per second, six or eight K per eye.  They're at 90 now. This first headset. And 90 is kind of a weird, from a video perspective,  it's a weird frame rate because now they does 96 or 24 frames. So if you're playing a movie,  it'll do 96 so that it can give you whole frames. Right. You know, it doesn't cut those frames off.  So, so it's 4X the 24. So that's there. But otherwise everything's 90 frame. 90 frame makes  a big difference for 3D when it's animating in front of you, but we can't produce video at 90  frames a second. So we can produce it at 120. What's the screen? Is it 4K screen?  They've been a little squirrely about the exact, exact resolution, but it does appear to be for  you. It's some kind of four, some version of 4K or close to it. So, yeah, so it's, it's, it's going,  and you can't watch movies in it. So it has to be some way reasonable way to come. Not only,  not only can you watch movies, you can watch them in 3D and it's going to be a great platform for  a 3D. And because of the way of the Wawa. And avatar is a good example. Avatar is a 48 frame  per second film. You know, so they, you know, they talk about being 48 underwater and 24, it's 48.  And then they just double the frames when they're above, above the water. And then they go back to  single frames and 48. And so, and so the, but it's a 48 frame, which is you can't play that back in  a lot of places. I mean, you know, your average TVs don't know what to do with that and so on. So  the headset is actually going to be really great for watching things like avatar. And I think that  you're going to, it's going to bring back, there's a whole bunch of us now that are suddenly trying  to find all those 3D rigs. You know, I was just talking to someone who has a whole bunch of rigs  and he's like, yeah, I can't sell these ones anymore because there's, they're under demand  and I got to use them for production. I can sell these ones. You must have some in the shells  behind you there. I don't have, I, I have one, you know, this one right here, that's a 360 set.  That's a, the Ozo. Yeah. And so the, but it's not going to be the quality that we would want to,  you know, shoot for these now. So, so a lot of us are looking at things like the R5C,  which is the Canon, Canon's R5C with a, they have a stereo lens on it. So you can do 180,  but that would be feeding the spaces. So you'd feed that into a space environment rather than the,  the volume or window environment. But really when you're watching movies, you probably watch it in  the window environment. And the advantage of that is that you can shoot rectilinear video.  So we can, if we fill the video, fill the video frame, we can go ahead and shoot  quote unquote traditional 3d, not 180. And, and so then, but the problem there is that when you  start doing that, we have all kinds of problems like convergence and where those cameras are.  And those, those become these really complicated, you know, rigs. And so that's what we're, we're  all trying to find who has the rigs that are still sitting. There's two of them in our building.  We're trying to get them to rebuild them again. That used to be the next big thing. And then it  wasn't. So there's all these millions and millions and millions of dollars were spent on these rigs.  I mean, these rigs, like you can get a rig now. It's like, it was $60,000 or $70,000. You can buy  them now for about 10. And there's a bunch of people that are in good discussions about buying  those at 10. And, and, and, and if you email me afterwards and say, who's, who's selling these  for 10? I can't tell you cause I'm trying to buy. Yeah. So, so the, but, but those are, you know,  it's suddenly everybody's interested in 3d again, because these will be incredible headsets for it.  And the big thing is, is that when someone spends $3,500 on a, on a headset, they're likely to buy a  lot of things that get made for it. So if you're, you know, there's this kind of the, the, the,  in the first couple months that these headsets go out and really the first year, there's going to be  a lot of demand for the next new thing in, you know, I mean, you can definitely move all your  apps to it, but something that fully takes advantage of the headset should be pretty

Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  interesting. Well, you're gonna have a question. Go ahead. I was just gonna say one of the questions  that I had about the headset, which I haven't really seen answered is so you can record,  like when you've got the thing on, you can record what you're seeing and then later

Speaker: Jason Thompson
Transcript:  Yes, but it's, it's more the kind of like, um, they seem to be moving. They seem to be positioning  it as you're watching, you watch this memory back in a window rather than experiencing it full.  Oh, that's interesting.

Start time: 6542.52
End time: 6593.68
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  As you, I don't, I don't, yeah, cause that's, that's a, it's a, from a resolution perspective,  it's much more complicated. Um, and so I think that those cameras may not be able to, I mean,  the cameras that need to do that may not be able to do the 180 at a, at a resolution that would be,  that would be high enough quality that would make it worth it. So I think that that's probably why  they're not a small fish eye spread spreading all of that 180 degrees out over 4k. Let's say  if it's capturing 4k, wouldn't necessarily, it would probably look a little soft. So like by,  by pulling it in, they can get a higher quality for that, that window. And I'm gonna guess that  that's what they're going to do. Um, and it's funny, you know, a lot of people talk about that,  people aren't going to put the headsets on, but I mean, when I grew up, people were putting big  cameras, they had big camcorders and everything else. This is just the next camcorder. The, um,  and, uh, but the other thing is I, I, I imagine version two will have better recording. I mean,

Start time: 6593.80

Now it was less, um, it would be less weird with the Google glass of all  things than it would be. But, but the, um, but, uh, I also, I'm just going to be blown away that  by this iPhone 16, we don't have a camera set up in the iPhones that will shoot stereo for the  headsets. I think there's a 50 to 60% chance we'll see it in this camera that comes into the next one,  given that they knew that this headset was coming. Um, and I think it's probably 80% by the next year  that we'll see, uh, the ability to do stereo acquisition in the camera in the iPhones,  because it wouldn't take very much to do it. I could see them do an extra high end

Start time: 6672.74
End time: 6732.30
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  one more lens. Like it'd be a quad instead of a, instead of a thing. And you could, that's all you,  cause you would have two lenses that are matching. You don't have to spread it out because if you  look at the hydrogen that, that, um, red made, those lenses were, those, uh, sensors were right  next to each other, which is not interocular distance, but still got enough data with,  with computational photography to, uh, it looked pretty good. I mean, the red stuff looked pretty  stereo, um, even with, uh, sensors that were, um, a centimeter apart. So these, the ones that on  the phone would be two or three times as far apart as the red camera. So you could definitely  generate 3d data, um, relatively, especially with help from the LIDAR and everything else.  You'd probably be able to create some pretty great, uh, 3d data, but you could do it potentially with  just computational photography right now with the current lenses that are there. I would worry that  it just wouldn't look right. You know, like you'd want two lenses that are identical. Um, but, but  Apple's got lots of engineers thinking about that. I'm sure. To me, it depends on how much more

Start time: 6732.42
End time: 6754.08
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  expensive would that second lens be or that additional lens be. And would the, is there  enough elasticity in what people are willing to spend for the pro model to say, Hey, I don't,  I don't own these goggles. I don't care about these goggles. I don't want these goggles. What I,  what I would much rather be able to do is afford another 256 gigabytes of, uh, of storage, but no,  I'm being forced to pay for this extra lens that I don't know if I'm going to actually use or not.

And so I think that, um, I think that they'd probably  sell just as I don't think they'd sell any less, even if it was $200 more, I don't think it would  matter. Okay. As someone who buys the pro version, like if it was $200 more, I'd be like, oh,  there'd be something else I can't buy. It wouldn't be less memory or, or the less of the camera.  It'd be something else in my life that I don't buy because I, because I want a little more camera.

It's such an amazing thing when you see your parents in their twenties and in their teens,  just hanging out, it's going to be amazing. Like 20 years from now when the, the, the TikTok kids  and the Instagram kids and the Visco kids, all of their children are going to be able to see  to their, to their embarrassment. Like here is, here is my, here is my parents like me going out  there having fun, occasionally doing things that are stupid, but Hey, look, they, they, they, they  raise two kids and they're happy with their lives.

Transcript:  picks of the week and wrap this thing up. Apple is facing some headwinds. Japan has,  is now pushing for both Apple and Google to add side loading in the Japanese versions of the app  stores. It's a new Japanese law. Apple's going to have to do it this summer, probably in the EU as  or next summer in the EU as well. So, you know, it's going to be, it's going to be kind of this  patchwork quilt of, of app stores in different countries, probably not here, although who knows  what the FTC will do. The EU says all smartphones must have user replaceable batteries by 2027.

Start time: 6962.84
End time: 7018.32
Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not talking necessarily talking about like having the back removable in a car.  Oh, those were the good old days, man. I love, I loved it when I could buy three  batteries for my Samsung S3. And, you know, but now we have, we have batteries that because  of greater battery management and chemistry that they, well, they, they last a couple of days. So  now it's not quite, you don't have to worry about getting it through a day. There's, there's,  there's been a lot of pearl clutching about this one. This, the, the proposal again, doesn't say  that you can't have waterproof phones anymore. You have to have externally pop off. They're  basically saying that do not be jerks and do anything to the design that would make it,  that would prohibit someone from opening the back and removing a, removing a battery and putting a  new battery in. So it's, it seems, and also it's notable that they're not putting this, they're not  making this happen until 2027, which is like four years from now, which is almost exactly the cycle  of design for a brand new model of phone. It's likely that Apple, in other words, will just make

James Thompson, our very special guest from PCALC, Andy Onako, Alex Lindsay, and our  show today brought to you by ZocDoc. See, now we don't have the National Health Service here in  the United States. We actually have to find our physicians on our own. ZocDoc, though, really  solves this problem. And what I love most about ZocDoc is it's a free app, iPhone, Android. You  can go onto the website and get the link by going to zocdoc.com slash macbreak. But you can actually  narrow down the search by insurance so you can make sure you're going to a doctor that takes your  insurance by whether they're available, whether they have room. A lot of times these days in the  U.S. you get a doctor and they say, well, I'm not taking on new patients. Well, that's no good. Well,  ZocDoc will find the doctor that is. And it's not just doctors. It's physicians, dentists,  chiropractors, and every specialty. I mentioned this before. I was looking for a  gerontologist for my older parent and I was able to narrow one down. In the area who takes her  insurance, who's available, this is fantastic. Oh, I left out the most important part, user reviews,  verified reviews of the doctor. So you're going to find a doctor that fits your needs. This is  important. Everybody has kind of different requirements for a doctor. Some people want  a doctor to explain it all in great detail. Some people want a doctor just to say, just tell me,  doc, what should I do? Give me the one answer. You get to get the doctor that fits your style  because you can read these reviews. ZocDoc is the only free app that lets you find and book doctors  who are patient reviewed, take your insurance, and are available when you need them and treat  almost every condition under the sun. Book an appointment with a few taps in ZocDoc's app.  You'll feel better faster with ZocDoc. Some of these docs are available within 24 hours.  Forget Dr. Roulette or looking around on the internet. You don't want to choose a doctor  based on Yelp reviews, please trust me. ZocDoc is the way to go. ZocDoc.com  slash MacBreak. Download the ZocDoc app for free, then find and book a top rated doctor today. Many  available within 24 hours. ZocDoc.com slash MacBreak. Thank you so much for supporting  MacBreak Weekly, ZocDoc. And I know a lot of you have used it. I've used it now and it's really  fantastic. ZocDoc.com slash MacBreak. James, do you want to share a pic of the week?

Transcript:  with. It's a little esoteric, but this is the Mr. FPGA. It's an open source hardware and  software project to recreate classic consoles, computers, and arcade systems via an FPGA  processor, which is basically reprogrammable hardware that can become other chips. So the  idea is you download the design of a chip like a Motorola 68000 to the FPGA and then it effectively  becomes that processor. Which in theory means that you get a more accurate recreation of the thing  that you're trying to simulate. It's slightly more complicated in practice and what is emulation  versus simulation, but anyway, that's the basic idea. So this thing can become like a classic Mac,  a Commodore 64, a Super Nintendo, pretty much anything from Pong to the PlayStation.  And you get this development board and then- Which looks a little bit like a Raspberry Pi.  Yeah, it's exactly the size of a Raspberry Pi. And then you get these additional boards,  which stack on top. So that one in the picture there was showing it's got a VGA port on the top.  And you have inputs for putting classic controllers and analog stuff or whatever you want.  And it's really fun and it can basically do, as I say, Pong to PlayStation. So you're talking  at least 20 years worth of computers and things really nicely. And because it's an open source  project, lots of people working on it and there's new stuff coming out all the time.

You send it the thing saying, here is the circuit diagram and what the chip looks like,  and it becomes that. So it's like a transformer.  I think it's the same technology Apple used in the afterburner card on the Mac Pro. I think it  used an FPGA on that. It's really just a way of creating hardware using software.

Sometimes there is an argument that, well,  this is really just fancy emulation, but sometimes it's not. It's the best thing I've seen for  like running old consoles or computers, Commodore 64 era stuff and having it feel like the original.

Or you can do it yourself, or you can do what I did, which was source this developer kit that  has the FPGA on it and then buy from a variety of sources the other boards and put it together.  You can buy the bare circuit boards or you can have the whole thing. To buy a fully  specced one, it's about $500 and it's cheaper than that if you don't need all the pieces.

Transcript:  Mine is a simple one. Brad Root has written a really cool screensaver that I just... He  tweeted it at me and I said, okay, screensaver, I like screensavers and thought I wouldn't like  it that much. I thought, okay, whatever. But oh my God, I'm enjoying it a lot. It's called Aline.  All it is, it's a screensaver written in Swift that all it is is essentially a JSON that  will download images from a list of URLs that are continually updated on the screenserver.  However, what it's drawing from is a collection of constantly updated  Bauhaus style abstract art generated by stable diffusion.  Oh, wow.  And again, that's why I read that in the GitHub description. It's like, okay, well,  maybe that could be okay. But as soon as I put it in, I forgot, my God, this artwork that...  I don't know what parameters they're giving it, but it is generating legit, beautiful pieces of  art that don't look like stable diffusion, anything. They don't look like AI, something.  They're just very, very pretty, almost distractingly pretty on a big screen.  And it's free. And I think that there isn't enough development of cool screensavers because when  your screen isn't doing something, it could at least make your office or your house pretty.  And this definitely does that.

Transcript:  Everything's been pretty affordable so far.  We're all going pretty affordable. I am recommending there's this little program that  people can get called Apple's Keynote. It just got updated last week. And it has an important  feature in it that some people it's worth talking about just because it now imports SVGs.  I know that that doesn't sound like a big deal to a lot of people. But for many of us,  getting objects in and having them become shapes and then being able to make those shapes into  our own custom libraries and be able to break them up so you can break up the shapes, you can  turn them into custom libraries. There used to be an AI to keynote filter that used to work  that stopped working. And if you're building a lot of, if you build as many presentations as I do,  being able to have a lot of custom shapes in there. And again, it's not an object.  So when it becomes a shape inside of Keynote, it means that you can fill it with different colors.  You can treat it like a shape. It's a different class of object. And that hasn't been something  that we've been asking for almost since version one. So it's just been like,  and why can't we just import this? And so the last update has made the SVGs available.  And so it is for those folks that use Keynote a lot, they'll be quickly checking for their updates.  I don't have everything automatically updating. And literally people were sending me  Discords going, Keynote now has SVGs. So this is a very geeky Keynote user, heavy Keynote user  feature that has been added. There's a couple other things. I don't know what they are, but the SVG  thing is worth it. And I still think that Keynote is probably one of the most powerful  communication apps ever built. So if you're not using Keynote to its fullest,  I would highly recommend looking at the feature set because it's much more robust than everything

Start time: 8191.60
End time: 8196.48
Speaker: Jason Thompson

Start time: 8198.72
End time: 8339.60
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I'm putting together, I have this really complex presentation I'm building right now. And I realized  working on it, someone was talking to me about it. And I was talking about how I started really  going off on Keynote about how great it is and everything else. And I said, I've made more money  with this app than any other app that I've had on my phone. Because it's the one that you sell ideas  with. And I've sold more projects with it than anything else. And I use it up. I use up all the  little animations. I dig deep into all of my object order and how they all come on. And I don't have  anything. I never have a slide that just pops up and like this is all the information. It's like,  I'm going to bring this out, this out, these pop these out, move these in. And there's so many great  little animations in there that help you tell the story. If you're an educator or someone obviously  doing business, I mean, it's just, and I've built whole videos with just Keynote, just build the  entire video out and send it to someone with my voiceover. And it's just done. And those ideas  then pass around really nicely and cleanly. So I'd highly recommend if you haven't played with it,  and if you haven't taken advantage of it, it's free. It comes with your Mac and your iPad.  So it's and it's just, and it works on your, I mean, it works on the iPad version, by the way,  has all these features that the desktop version doesn't have. I was sitting in, Apple has these  educator, free educator seminars, which are really great, by the way. And they have, they were showing  stuff like you can just grab with your pencil, you can just grab an object and just animate it  by just moving it around with your pencil. Just build a motion path like this and then,  and then hit animate and you just animate it out. And there's little things like that, that  even for me, we're new because I don't use the iPad to design my, I use it to flush out my,  or knock out my ideas, but I don't usually use it to refine them. And there's a lot of tools in there  as well. So, and you know, you can control it with your watch, you can go frame by frame with your,  with your watch. And so it's, it's a, it's an incredible application that I'd highly recommend  if you haven't played with it a lot. And so I'm just using the excuse of the fact that they finally  added this, probably the only feature we want, we've wanted more than SVG or equal to SVG is USDZ.  And so we're, we're all crossing our fingers. So I will now explain what Alex just said.

Start time: 8342.08
End time: 8360.54
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  SVG stands for scalable vector graphics. These are the images you'd create with like,  Adobe Illustrator instead of a bitmap. They're actually descriptions of triangles,  lines and circles. And so they scale infinitely, infinitely small, infinitely big. And I get,  I didn't know that you couldn't import an SVG into-

Start time: 8360.60
End time: 8470.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And turn them into shapes. You can bring, you can bring, you can bring line art in the past,  but it wasn't, it was treated as an image object as opposed to a shape object.  It becomes a bitmap all of a sudden. And so-  And it's still scalable, but the main thing is, is that you couldn't turn it into an,  a true object inside of it. And what that means by turning into a true shape means that as you,  cause a lot of times what you're doing in, in keynote, or at least what I do is I decide  this is going to be black and white presentation, or this is going to be a colored presentation.  And I can very quickly change all those colors of all my shapes to match whatever the look and feel  that I'm building into looks like. If you have an image, you can't do that. Like, so you can't,  you can do little bits and pieces. You don't have those handles. So treating it like a shape,  being able to break it up. So for instance, there's shapes, you can take a shape in keynote  and select it and then go in and say, I want to, you know, and again, yeah, you can combine shapes  that, you know, so- So you haven't lost your, the, the, the features of the SMG.  The outline. Yeah. Like for instance, a good example is when you do the, when you do the  earth shape, there's like an unrolled, an unmapped, a Mercator projection of the earth in-  Oh, and you get all the countries. Oh.  It's kind of nice except for no one needs Antarctica. So like, so you're always like,  so you're always, so what I have is I have a, I have a shape of, I, no one cares about it.  I don't care about Antarctica. I'm in Salty Bear. But no one cares. And so I, I, I,  what I did is I took that shape. I, I break it up into points and then I delete Antarctica and then  I save it as a shape. So then when I add mine, I'm like, I don't need that. I don't need that part.  And so those are the kinds of things you can do with an SVG that you can't do necessarily with  any of the other image files that you have there. You have to just crop them. And so it also makes  sure if you start using log, a lot of logos, I like my logos to print well. And which means  that I'm bringing in giant pings of all my logos or so on and so forth. Or an SVG now. And yeah,

And we've embarked on doing, we've got a,  we're doing accessibility on Saturdays for the whole summer. It's usually education. And we had  an incredible event, we had an incredible one on Saturday where we were actually had, we had  deaf panelists and ASL interpreters and all of the, and they were seamlessly talking back. It was  us figuring out how to make that all work so that they could, they were just part of that  conversation. And it worked much better than, I was a little concerned about it, but you could see,  here you see someone talking, but there's other places where they were actually, if you go to  other, and so it was a lot of us figuring out. But if you look at like when someone's signing  in the main window, you'll see someone signing there. Yeah, there you go. And that's someone  talking. And now our, so then what has, the ASL interpreter has to swap, switch shift gears  and translate to us. Oh, that's interesting. So the speaker is speaking in ASL and then you

Seven bucks a month also gets you ad-free versions of all of our shows, special shows we  don't put out in public like Micah Sargent's Hands on Mac, Hands on Windows with Paul Thurotte,  Scott Wilkinson's Home Theater Geeks. It really is a very important part of our monetization these  days as advertising for podcasts starts to dwindle. You pick up the slack and we thank you for doing  that. Thank you Club members for making this possible. After the fact, club member or not,  ad-free versions of the show for the club, ad-supported versions available on our website  at twit.tv slash mbw. There's also a dedicated YouTube channel to Mac Break Weekly that has even  more ads and some of which we didn't put in there. And of course, the best way to get this show is  to subscribe. If you go to twit.tv slash mbw you see links to some of the big podcast applications,  but also the RSS because we are an RSS feed and always will be. And you can subscribe right there  and get the show the minute it's available of a Tuesday evening. Thanks for everybody for joining  us.
