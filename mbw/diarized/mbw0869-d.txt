Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Hello. Yeah, it's it's always fun  Like when the first things I do in the morning is like read it read my daily comic strips on go comics  And then I also just like see is there anything really awesome in my youtube feed that I don't want to start the day before  I watch and so it's always nice before oh, I'm gonna have to take a look at that before before later  So when the video start posting okay, good thing. I didn't decide to go for a walk or anything. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Life is strange that way all of a sudden apples on the East Coast. I don't know it's  Who's who's working in PR at 6 a.m. I don't know somebody pushed the ball  It's all about Madison Avenue, baby. Yeah, you know it probably is right. It's all about stock  And Alex Lindsay  I'm sure when the news came in was busy busy busy because he's gonna be one of the people's gonna be using  Final cut on an iPad I betcha betcha betcha hi Alex. We were in office. Hey, hey

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  We were in office hours and someone asked the question. I was like there was a guy in the office  Question I was like there what there was I didn't get to see it because usually we're in pre-show and  Weren't really paying attention to that by then and and you know, I was happily surprised looks good

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I make a habit of going to the Apple newsroom right before the show just in case  usually disappointing not this time and as we knew  Jason Snell has taken the week off visit mom. It's Mother's Day weekend coming up  He's a good son. So  Instead of the six-color charts today, we're gonna have the Apple insider charts today with Stephen Robles. Hello, Stephen

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great to be here. I even have a final cut right here on my iPhone already. No, you don't you stop that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't not allowed  Not allowed and say it's coming out mate. So the new I should say the news which we haven't said yet  Apple is bringing Final Cut Pro and  Logic Pro to the iPad  You will have to buy it a new in fact, it's a subscription  Which means five bucks a month for each a mere $60 a year  I think that's a good deal. Frankly Apple's been offering that has had the best deal ever you bought  I bought logic like years ago Final Cut Pro years ago never gave him another cent for  $2.99 or whatever it was so, you know, I don't mind. I think five bucks a month is a fair price  You will have to have an M1 or later iPad to use Final Cut Pro  You will have to have a  A12 or later to use logic  The you know, we it's not out yet  Despite what Stevens showing us it won't be out till May 23rd. Is that a real copy? You've got there Steven or no

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  No, that last week a basic Apple guy on Twitter. He's a great follow, but he created a Final Cut iOS icon just for fun  Maybe he's got some inside knowledge

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He might now we should say it will not run on an iPhone so right I knew immediately and for good reason look at  The UI this is logic  They're not gonna fit on a six inch screen. That's for sure

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  but what a perfect way because because now we are we are the  The multiple generation of we have to freeze frame whatever we're watching no matter what it is to look for like Easter eggs  And then and other conclusions  There is no better troll than to simply put an icon somewhere in the back of the screen so people oh my god  I forgot to clear his desktop before

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Apple didn't do that didn't they there was a file at the last event  Wasn't there a Final Cut Pro on an iPad? I feel like there was I

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Showed off DaVinci Resolve on the iPad. They did announce DaVinci Resolve. Yeah before before resolve was announced

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So Apple talked about DaVinci Resolve on the iPad before resolve was announced on its own

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, now we know WWDC is June 5th  So there is a larger story, which is why did Apple do this now?  It would have been a big and a  WWDC level announcement, I think  We've been talking for a long time how about you know, this is Jason Snell's refrain  You made this amazing hardware and you don't put professional software on it

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's what a waste  I think that's one of the big problems that Apple has is that there's no real reason to upgrade your iPad very often because  Most of the apps run perfectly fine. My kids have the first iPad Pro 12.9  And they're still using them just fine  You know like they don't ever feel like they can't do what they they're trying to do  On it and and I didn't really feel the the stretch until I put resolve on on my iPad  Where's like? Oh, maybe I need to get the M2, you know as because I still have with the M1  I felt like it was doing pretty well  And so so I think that Apple you know  I think we want to see more of these professional ads because the iPad is capable of it  It's just that we're not seeing the apps, you know to take advantage of it  So I think it's a really interesting thing  I think that the membership had to happen Apple spent so much time talking to developers about using  Subscription services that if they had put it out as a single item it would have undermined their entire  You know thread that they have about how you should run an app

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I do think it's telling though because last year they had the iPad OS announcement  Desktop class apps was like a highlighted headline there  Then they talk about freeform and so I do feel like Final Cut definitely could have had a huge moment at WWDC  This year, but I think it's because they're making room for a big announcement  I mean the rumors about the VR headset are kind of all over the place  So maybe it's to make room for that and all the big enough. Yeah, I agree with that completely Apple

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Apple isn't like Google Google will  Google will expand the length of their like their developer keynote to include anything that they think that they want to put in there

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're by the way, we're gonna find out tomorrow because it's tomorrow  We start at 10 a.m. I have a feeling we'll be pushing Windows weekly in this week in Google. Yeah

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Not to turn this into a Google podcast  Like whereas Apple has a lot of Apple has just a lot of simple linear things to talk about and hey  You know what? We don't we don't really have to visit developer keynote  We don't really have to talk about we don't really announce Final Cut and new audio logic apps for the iPad right here. Whereas  Especially especially this year. Google's is  shareholders, please don't take our stock just because we don't have we don't have a chatbot and  Also bored please don't fire me a CEO I'm doing ever so hard a job right now

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gonna be you nailed it. It's gonna be the Sundar Pichai apology tour tomorrow. We'll see actually they're gonna talk a lot about AI  I know they've got a folding phone, which they finally admit they're gonna be making they'll have things to say

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  But it is and it is refreshing to talk to me to bring it to Apple  It is refreshing that I always thought that Apple has a sort of sometimes an infantile  Infantilizing attitude towards its users saying well we everybody we hate leaks because we want the the delight and surprise our users like  And this isn't Christmas Eve. It's like whereas Google Google is like sure. Oh sure. Well sure  We'll show you the folding phone. I sure we'll talk about we'll talk about this tablet because we're working on it for about six months

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's perfectly it's very different attitudes, isn't it? I?  Think my my read on it was just Apple wants to clear the decks for  Yeah, what will be the most important announcement of WWDC the VR visor

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's a big question still around now  This may be why suddenly there wasn't a lot of updates to Final Cut and a lot of people have been talking about  We haven't seen any new features for like a year and a half  People are starting to go well if Apple and we went just went through NAB where you know resolve and Premiere saw a lot  of updates and so a lot of Final Cut users were getting a little antsy and or are getting antsy and  and so I think that that this was  I think that this clears the deck but what we don't know is is that the only thing that they're gonna update so a lot  There there's a lot of tools that  Apple has added a final cut in motion that would make it very useful for the delivery of content for AR and VR headsets  And so the question is is is the delay that we're seeing?  related to them putting a bunch of new features in that they can't talk about and the team has  Essentially stopped working on everything else for the last year and a half and and just working on getting the 3d  Tools up to speed getting the VR tools up to speed those are all in there already to some degree  But they're not very well formed

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You'll be using both Final Cut and logic to create content for the headset

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Oh, and potentially an Apple's been adding of course logic has been adding lots of  immersive audio tools and so on so forth into it, but I think that also the that  Potentially Final Cut in motion become some of the primary tools to drop video level work into an immersive environment  And we don't we don't know if that's the truth or not yet  But we will in a couple weeks, you know  And and so it's gonna be really interesting to see if that if they roll out and that's why it'll all make sense of it  If it doesn't they're gonna have a you know  Final Cut will still do great, but it it will be it'll need to really focus on the social media, you know  Environment because I think if they don't update within by October  I think that most professionals will start moving to other things and their market will and their market may it may be fine  For their market be mostly social media producers and that may be where Apple's going and that also is easier when you make it  Available on the iPad. So so there's that could be the the solution as well

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Final Cut Pro for the iPad reading from Apple's press release introduces an all-new touch interface  And intuitive tools I'm looking unlocking new workflows for video creators a  New jog wheel makes the editing process easier than ever and enables users to interact with content in completely new ways  They can navigate the magnetic timeline movie clips and make fast frame  Accurate edits with just the tap of a finger or better yet the pencil if you have a little bit

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I think is really exciting. It's it's called auto crop and it shows some screenshots on the actual Final Cut page  but this is a feature that you see in things like cap cut and other apps that you can get for iPad where it will  intelligently crop a full and 16 by 9 clip to a vertical clip for things like reels and  Thing on the subject and what's interesting they buy that from Quibi  Most companies will call this an AI feature like this is AI Howard cropping and if you look on Apple's landing page for Final Cut  They're very careful to not mention the words AI or artificial intelligence anywhere, but for the auto crop feature it says  Intelligently adjust footage for vertical or other aspect ratios  And so I'm curious it's farther farther down the page where you see like the the glass blowing  Candle thing there's scene removal mask, which is like an auto green screen  Which again is a takeoff like tick tock and what they do auto crop and voice isolation. Those are kind of three features put together  I  Curious if they will actually say these are like ML machine learning features AI features  And if they'll bring these to the Final Cut on desktop because this auto crop feature as far as I know is not in  Final Cut for the Mac right now, and I'd love to see it. That'll save me a ton of fun

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's really interesting to me too  but whether do they are they gonna decide to make Final Cut into a  iPad focused edition of Final Cut meaning that they're going to have a pro level editing suite  For people who are likely to be editing on an iPad or are they going to try to do  We're gonna try to give you an equivalent experience as much as as humanly and engineering possible between these two platforms  So if you were switched to so you could start editing a project on Final Cut for desktop  Spend some time on the plane continuing the project on iPad and then continue back on the original when you come back  That's two different ways to do it and with the M1 chip powering powering both of your machines  There's a lot of potential there

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Well, it says on the page you can send a project to Mac. So if you start in Final Cut on iPad  You'll be Mac, but it does not say you could send it backwards  And I imagine some compatibility issues if you start in Final Cut on a Mac and try to send it to the iPad  I don't think you'll be able to do that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't go full round trip. I

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Mean one of the real powerful things there though is to be able to do an assembly while you're still shooting and so yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That makes me think that's the point is right to bring the iPad to the studio

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, and so you could be sitting there with an iPad and a director or someone sitting there and they could be doing this  on a laptop as well, but an iPad is kind of a nice place to do that where  Now I don't think the iPad can ingest yet  Directly, but you could be potentially sending something via NDI or sending something up to frame  I oh as can't camera to cloud and then pulling it back to the iPad in the same location  Or and then being able to assemble things and you can do that with resolve as well  And so those are things that I think that being able to make those decisions the reason that editing  If you have everything storyboarded and you start shooting everything and you start inserting them a lot of times before you've broken down that set  And set let go of the crew that you're spending $25,000 a day on you can go and shoot a couple inserts  I need a couple hands this or I need something else  And so the closer we get to being able to edit while we're shooting the oftentimes the more we just think of a couple things  That would be nice to have for the editor later

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so so those like a fancy video tap with a little more control. Tell me  Just for those of us who are not pros like you  You can't ingest what does that mean?

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Just means that right now  there's no way that I know of that you can plug in some kind of card that would let you take the  HDMI or SDI feed from the camera and  Capture it directly to the iPad and so we don't I don't think that it should be capable

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So where would you ingest it? You said if you have a NDI connection you can watch it live  But how it otherwise what are you gonna do have to have a computer there and ingest again you'd save it to files

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You know you'd either save it to files  You know the cloud files or you could do something I imagine you could tie it into something like frame.io  So frame.io you can have a camera to cloud which is you have a taradec or something connected to your  Camera and it's uploading while you're shooting every time you hit stop  It just uploads that file to frame and then people can pull it immediately down  And so those are those are ways to kind of get it in there really quickly  It this is the beginning probably because again the USB C is capable of  Getting video in we have other USB  USB devices that will capture  Video the m1 and m2 are definitely capable of managing that process  What's missing is the subsystems that would allow that to easily flow straight to files?  You know on on to the on there, and so that's but it feels like and I mean one of the reasons probably they're requiring these

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Higher-end iPads is you can hook up a Thunderbolt drive to the iPad and use it yeah as

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Right as you're being not clear. It's not clear from the information  They've given whether you can edit off an SSD. That's something where luma fusion on iPad  You can actually have the footage on an external  SSD drive connected to an iPad with a Thunderbolt cable and actually edit with the footage sitting on the drive  Nowhere on this final cut landing page does it say you can keep footage on an external drive and edit it  Okay, so you might have to actually transfer it on to the iPad directly before you can edit it, but it's unclear

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They didn't say anything about that's a big deal because you  Mean they do make two terabyte iPads now

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But still and I think it I think if we think about really large projects  We're probably gonna go back to desktop, but where I think this really fits in is for social media  So if you're like I'm gonna go to  Cine gear in a couple weeks, and we're gonna shoot a bunch of stuff  I'm definitely take an iPad down, and I'm just gonna try shooting  I've done this with luma fusion in the past which is that you know if I want to shoot a short I can I'm just  Gonna try to shoot it probably with luma fusion and with final cut just to see what what it feels like  but I could theoretically just be shooting everything with the iPad have a nice little rig you can get these small rig or  You know a  Couple different use the iPads camera

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Yeah, use the iPads camera for social media. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean like I have one of these little you know USB C dongles  With an SD card slot on one side and so like I would bring my sony a7 for your pop it  Yeah, just pop the footage. You know put it on the iPad and then edit it in final cut

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Whether you have to copy or not will make a difference of course to you  I guess you wouldn't want to edit on an SD card anyway you would copy it to the iPad well

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And I think that again when you're talking about wanting to turn things over really fast  I look at like shorts  You know one thing I'm interested in is like do the plug-in architecture that works in motion  Will it go over to work in final cut can I for instance save a bunch of?  Effects that I build in motion that might be my lower thirds might be my my  Text ups and so on so forth that are all designed the way I want them and I just have to type them in that  Would be an incredible integration, but I don't know whether those will be supported at least in the first version of iPad

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So lots of questions raised by this Apple announcement obviously

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Go ahead one other word on external devices on the page under the monitoring settings  It talks about capturing progress footage on iPad, but you'll also be able to monitor external microphones  Connected to the iPad and this is a big deal because I deal with a lot of microphone and podcasting and iOS devices  And it's largely like a black box like you usually are not sure if it's using the external microphone  You don't really get audio levels from the external microphone  And so here it looks like they're making an effort to encourage external mics show you that monitoring live on the iPad screen  As I feel like maybe a year or two from now we might be close to that kind of  Ingest of video footage whether it's an external  Mirrorless camera connected via a cable or a webcam and I do hear from a lot of people that wish they could connect things like  External cameras to an iPad for a video podcast or whatever

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that that's that's one of the few things that defines the difference between I'm going to New York for two or three  Days I can just take my iPad and I'm going to New York for two or three days, but I have to do one 15-minute  Pretty okay quality video stream. Therefore. I have to bring the notebook plus plus everything that I need to  Sensorize with it. Yeah, that's showing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You do they're showing some tick tockers shoot with the iPad at the skate park then go to the diner and edit at the diner  And and everything they need and post from the iPad I presume right just put it right up there

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that I think that we're seeing Apple Apple's been doing this for a couple years is they're focusing more and more  On social media, you know content creators. Yeah, they've been very successful in that area  So a lot of content creators are have because that's fast  It's you know when you're not, you know, you you know  We're not getting paid per hour  You want to be able to throw it together as quickly as possible and so a lot of creators use Final Cut  Right now and so I think that it seems like they're looking at a market that has really  Embraced them as opposed to the the film market, which has been just not not super  Excited about Final Cut and so so, you know, I think that they may end up  Leaving not leaving but definitely focusing more energy on the on the social platforms. Yeah, well, that's a huge and growing  Platform it's bigger. It's it's far bigger than the broadcast markets getting smaller social media is getting bigger  It's probably not and the problem is is that in social media  You know a lot of people that every new feature is something that they're pretty excited about and they have you know  And when they want it a lot of people want it in film and TV  It's a lot of really fiddly things that people want  That take an enormous amount of engineering and the chances of them actually using  Apple's product is very low because they'll complain about something that they want that they have an avid or or premiere or resolve  But the chances of them actually changing course for that for that feature is very low  So the the ROI for Apple to chase after the film and TV market is very, you know  Very hard hard case to make whereas in social media. There's no real clear winner  There's a you know Apple and I think Final Cut is probably one of the largest  Installed devices for that kind of thing, but it's a very it's a it's a market that is still ripe for a lot of disruption

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it's you know, the pricing also tells you that's where they're headed because if it's if it's a pro market  You could charge a heck of a lot more for 99 a month  Get one month free or you could pay 50 bucks for an entire year and that's for each product  So if you wanted both and I guess there people would want both that'd be a hundred bucks a year  That's well within any you know

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Social media creators budget that makes sense, right? I'm curious if it will be available for iCloud family sharing also  My my kids because they're inexpensive labor  I've actually have them taking my video podcast content and making vertical clips so I can post a tik tok and real  Thank you, they don't have a Mac and I actually don't have a family Mac around set up they have iPads and actually to  Change 16 by 9 video to a vertical clip on an iPad. You can't do it in iMovie  You know, it just doesn't have that kind of feature  So that auto crop and final cut is going to be the deal and so I'm gonna get them final cut  Unfortunately, they have older iPads. So don't tell them I might have to get a new iPad

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can use it on an air though, right and you'll want the app on a on the M1 air M2 air and you'll want the

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Pencil I imagine or no Alex. Is this the kind of thing you think is I think I bet you there's a lot of there's a lot  Opportunities for innovation with the pencil as it relates to final cut  I think they saw in some of the examples they showed some places where you could paint on it and so on so forth if you  Look at how?  even how it's being used in keynote like there are features in the  iPad version of keynote that aren't available on the desktop  so I can grab onto an object for instance and just  With my pencil on keynote and just animate it just swing around  I want to go over here and then I want to go over here and then I want to go over here and I  Let go and that animations there now. Yeah watch watch in this clip from the from the film that they put out

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They've got a creator using a pencil to in logic, but then drawing a curve drawing a sound  Yeah, there's all sorts of possibilities aren't there? Yeah  of course those guys in the diner were as as as was earlier creator are annotating and  Putting text because that's what creators do they like to do they put text on there on their video

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  With the pencil I think if you just think about just circling doing something where you're just circling something and then  Doing an arrow over here even for not just for creators, but for teachers a lot of things  There's there could be potentially an enormous number of opportunities here that you wouldn't have in a traditional  NLE so I think it's a really interesting interesting opportunity. Let me quote the the movie is

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My friends are really gonna be gassed if somebody gets nasty with this. They're gonna become really good  I don't know what the kids are talking about, but obviously  Apple's they seem very excited  They seem rather impressed  Get nasty with it and gassed. Okay fine

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  It's exciting that Apple also said third-party content will be available  On iPad so motion VFX  FX Factory Pro  I use a ton of motion VFX plugins and so the fact that you can use those kinds of lower thirds and animations  Which is big for those shorts and vertical videos also. It's pretty exciting

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and if you start loading this the even just the free samples Apple provides on logic  You're gonna need many many gigabytes of storage. You're probably gonna want to dedicate an iPad to these tools

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I just want to see if I want to see if they add some kind of emoji function where you can just immediately put in  Your little emoji heads, you know right into Final Cut and you build your own. Oh, you know, you're gonna be able to do that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They actually showed in the video  They showed the press and hold to turn into a sticker in  Final Cut and then the moving that sticker onto a title card  Is that that I don't think Final Cut has that right now does it you could do it in messages?

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You can do it in messages and then it's in your photos and then you can export it from photos  The text there it's just a matter of adding that little piece to the stack. So yeah, probably wasn't that hard

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is I think this is very exciting news. I think worthy of announcement at  WWDC which makes me even more excited about what they might announce next month WWDC. Yeah, I

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  wonder it's gonna be interesting to see like as has been mentioned the  use of external lightning devices  Would be super interesting  I wonder if this is a good time to do a head-to-head between is  Is it slower to ingest and edit stuff often ingest and edit stuff?  Across lightning as then it is to use unified memory because it's always been one of the one of the selling points of at  least on the desktop  Here's why you we can't let you upgrade stuff on your own because we have this brand new memory model  That's ten times better than anything you would like if you were able to just buy an $80

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  $80 drive and put in yourself. Do you think this also means that Apple will announce iPads?  I mean this would be a  prime  Opportunity to say hey, here's the iPad made for Final Cut and logic

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  In the home to is way more powerful

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Don't have an empty iPad air yet, so they might just say we put the m2 in the iPad air and call it a day

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Maybe I mean I think that I think that the this most of what this is is they've got a lot of things to it  And they need to you know clear the deck a little bit as Andy said and and they just need to have us a  They're very  Fortunately for all of us. They're fairly  Disciplined about how long these these keynotes go and so I think that they're trying to get it down probably to 80 or 90 minutes and

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I think they want it lower than that. I think they

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Have been 80 90 minutes have they not tight  Wwc and then tights they were they were tight 60s for a while  Yeah, and I just know because I have to oftentimes we're doing stuff  Okay office hours and I we get to the top of the next hour and I'm like, oh gotta go. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Top maxed out with two terabytes of storage  the current  pro with an m2 is  So that's PC price. It's not like you know  I mean you're that's a PC premium PC. That's yeah, that's buying a MacBook Pro

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be a bummer if you spent all that money for it and you realize that oh this one part of my workflow  That's super important for me on my Mac is not present in this iPad. That's

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's I do think but if it made you feel any better you can buy a Mac right now  You can buy a Mac studio and I was in Costco buying something and I I walked by I was buying some work  I closed I walked by the Mac studio and it's  1,400 1499 for a Mac for a Mac studio

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Amazing that's that's what I run it. I'm a studio just the m1 max version, but it's incredible. I love the Mac version

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I have the Mac so that's what I'm on right now. And and and I it was very I don't have I was like  I can't spend that money  My pockets are smoldering just walking by so it does make you wonder when you see  $500 discounts at Costco you wonder what's gonna happen at dub dub like it feels like they're trying to clear product, you know  You know exciting I'm getting excited now product

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I was not excited about the VR headset be honest with you  But right if they announce new Macs new iPad Mac Pro Mac 15 inch MacBook Air probably  Yeah, we know we don't know we don't know anything we think  German knows  We just follow in his wake and again

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I I would say that if I if I was gonna release another Mac studio or a Mac Pro  What I would do is sell as many at Costco as possible and then you know in the couple weeks  I'm now yeah, you know, you like clear it clear that deck cuz it'll be really hard to move them after that. Yeah

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  We gotta see the Mac Pro right the Mac Pro's gotta be coming. I mean somewhere out there

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They said it's coming. They have years ago. They said it was coming up this year and there are and they're already late

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  So it's not as though releasing it the WC will make it on late  So now that now that now the pressure is off oddly enough

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, well and and and but I will say that the last time they announced the new Mac Pro was the ed dub dub

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So yeah, that's where you that's that's the that's where the pros are  Where the pros are that funnichello Frankie Valley frankly Frankie?

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Wasn't Frankie Valley was the other Frankie. It was five years ago now that I think about I think it was 2018 when they did  The the new Mac Pro the new cheese grater was I think 20

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  This is rekindled my hope for aperture  No, I think this should kill your hope for aperture but there is there is one more pro product missing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  From an iPad that could mean that it could be your full-time  Computing device and that would be X code, right?  We always said if they put final cut on there  And X code on there, then you don't need a desktop anymore. But I don't see them  I don't I wouldn't want to code on an iPad

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It would nice to be have that that alternative though and especially for given that the iPad isn't just  Apple's tablet. It's also their budget computer  And so the ability to for people who are getting on board the Apple ecosystem for well under a thousand dollars as low as  $300 to be able to develop and deploy actual  App store apps on the thing that would be a game-shaker. I thought by now they would they would advance their

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Swift  Playgrounds to the point where you could do I guess you kind of I mean you can put it on this app store  But where that would be a point, you know, whatever you call it drag and drop  Programming kind of thing where some typing whizzy wig  And playgrounds is kind of slowly much more slowly than I would have expected moving in that direction  Maybe that's what we're waiting for not X code, but just playgrounds to become more powerful

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  The desktop final cut to a subscription model after that's a good question. I

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Don't I I think that they're just happy there once too. I don't think that they're gonna change it  I don't I think that that would be hard because a lot of us have used that as a reason that we stuck around  For a long time. It's like it's like well, you know, you don't pay the subscription for it and you know everything out

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, and and so I think that people were pissed by the way. I saw a number of people, you know in the usual  Snark zones Twitter and reddit and hacker news that there was oh Apple's doing an Adobe

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Wow, it's a lot less money like $5 is $5 a month and $50 a month is two very different numbers  You know for for what's going on?  Well to to be to be fair $10 as cheap as 10 bucks if you just want one

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Oh, the perhaps for for which is which is which is which is one of the crown jewels minimum

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Minimum they don't let you take each one of those so Photoshop you get 10 bucks a month  But if you want after effects or premiere you got to buy into the entire suite like it's and that's the thing that  Has that's a lot of reason that folks like me won't use premiere is because I'm like  I don't need all of those apps and I don't want to pay for all those apps  They they could you know, I get the business model, but I don't appreciate it  But the but the on the flip side of that like a if it keeps you completely up-to-date like on new revisions as they come

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Out that's nice thing. That's one of the what's one of the benefits of Adobe  What's one of the benefits of Adobe I think that they did  They did follow through on their promise to say that look  It's not as though we're just gonna give you an option an alternative towards never giving us any more money and ever again  They do keep enhancing it with really really nice barn door style  But the other but the but the other cool thing is that it really does lower the bar for a lot of makers that  People can figure out that they can afford five bucks a month or even I've got this one project  That's gonna take me fit me three months  I'll invest $15 in a three month subscription to Final Cut Pro  But they may not be in an economic position where they can say I can I need Final Cut Pro  But I just absolutely cannot cannot afford it right now

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think and again, I I wouldn't have as much of a problem with the dough  I paid ten bucks a month for Photoshop, you know, like, you know, like and that's fine bundle is worth ten bucks a month  Yeah, yeah, but it's it's the  This is but you and you but but it's the you have to pay for everything else  Right if you want just because all I want is after effects and and potentially premiere. I don't want all the other apps  I don't need them, you know, like it's quite a lie. It's quite so it's so it's I just feel like there's there's a push storage  expensive storage on you and well and again for me  There's there's a point of subscription makes sense. The developer gets money on ongoing Lee  They can you know that allows them to innovate I get that  It's the I'm going to bundle you into something that makes it the green shores that I make way more money  Yeah, it's a manipulative behavior that I don't that I just think Adobe, you know  I'm sure that they're making a lot of money, but it's really you know  They're they're creating this huge gap because there's a lot of people upset about it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a difference between an ongoing income and rent seeking and Adobe's absolutely rent seeking at this point

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  and the thing is is that and that's why a lot of people like as you know, the other problem that Adobe has is that  There are three times as many engineers working on resolve as there are on after effects and premiere  And so that as resolve keeps on getting better and better and better people are you know, like for me  I'm half and half final cut and resolve  So when I do precision work, I use resolve when I use fast fast and furious  I use final cut and it's about half of my half of my editing time is spent on one in one of the other  I don't and I don't need them to change. I'm not trying to figure out which one's going to win  I just use the two and I know what I want to go into a product. I project  I know which one I'm going to use and I don't try to figure out how to get the back and forth between them or anything else  You know, I just do the thing right and so I think that I don't really feel that pressure  But I will say that I know a lot of people that are using premiere that are you know looking at resolve as a $300 buy once  Never even pay for an upgrade  Like why am I you know, why am I here, you know?  And it wasn't that way a couple years ago  But it's starting to start to really you know edge people out and it's because they're only using premiere and being forced to pay  For everything and that's just a that's the that's the thing that is really driving people crazy

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've been feeling as I said at the beginning guilty that I paid once five or six or seven years ago for logic and and  Final cut I don't feel guilty at all  Well, I want to yeah, I mean Apple has Apple doesn't need the support  But I don't think it's a problem saying five bucks a month or I think that's fine appropriate  I do think really there's an interesting story here. I think you nailed it Alex that Apple is pivoting to creators  Or you know social, you know social media style creators tiktokers and youtubers as opposed to movie studios and TV  And I think it totally makes sense. It makes a lot of sense. That's the right way to go  That's absolutely the right way to go. And by the way, that's the most vital interesting area right now in production, right?  Yeah, well with the writer strike. Absolutely  Yeah, your timing is a lot of Apple

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, the timing the timing couldn't be any better  There's a whole lot of you know, a whole lot of people that they're just gonna sit there and wait for the next thing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the creators go crazy. Yeah, another thing somebody in our discord pointed out in none of these videos or stills  Do you see stage manager? Oh  Good good catch  Isn't that interesting right you would never takes up so much space you want that full screen you want every inch of it  No, I don't turn it off too. Yeah, I don't use stage manager flop ola

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah  Something's catch up, you know catch up, you know Apple can put some stuff out and it goes a little slow for a little while  Like like freeform is not something I'm using every day, but I feel like oh I could I could see using this  You know, like like it's cool. I just can't find other people to play

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  In my case it wasn't so much that I tried it and rejected it it's more like I tried it I saw that wow  There's something interesting here  But it is not so intuitive that I can pick it up as I go I'm going to have to find  I'm gonna have to wait and it's like it's like binge watching a show that everybody tells you is awesome  It's like it's not I'm not rejecting a better call Saul  I'm saying that I have to defer starting to watch it until I feel as though I have enough time in my schedule  To start like adapting to this but but just just getting back to I mean, I think that you are right about  Not pivoting towards creators, but making sure the creators are really really happy  I mean it does click in with something that happened. We're gonna be talking about the earnings call later on but  One of the most interesting things in the Q&A was Tim Cook was asked directly say hey about what about the with the pro level?  The market has a pro level market doing any ignore and he said oh, yes  We're absolutely committed to the pro market, but he did say like outright that we do consider  Do I have the quote here? We consider ourselves a consumer oriented company  So it's not as though they're ever going to abandon pros  But when they see where's where's our bread buttered?  It's basically on people walking to a store with their grubby hands full of cash  Pulling it down and then walking out with something they're going to adore  Yeah, as opposed to the machine the machine Smith's so to speak

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  And I said and I will say as a pro the Mac mini and the studio but the Mac mini especially has fulfilled more needs  Than I've done I've had you know  It was always like oh, this is a great little package of it was just a little bit more powerful and now it's more powerful  And and I think that between myself and own I know I think we've now  bought 30 of them  You know not a minor amount of them and and they're great as glue and you put them in you know you go  Oh, I just my son needed to do some programming at school. Just gave him back many  You know just he's got monitors there just plug them in and and it's just you know  It's it's so powerful and and so I think that I don't think that the demand for the pros is that is high enough  I mean, I think it when they show like and this is the percentage they won't cut it out  But if they split out this is much how much we made with the Mac Pro it'll be like oh, yeah  I need a little sliver that barely exists, you know, and so that's probably also why there's not a lot of pressure  I do think it's important though from a mind share perspective for them people to feel like they're you know  There's a there's a value to having an F1 team, you know  like you know and there's a value in the development of all the things all the product all the  Technologies as well as just where you position the product  So I think having a Mac Pro does make a difference in the long term  I think exactly when it comes out and the actual income doesn't matter

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's what the process what's happened is the definition of cool kids has changed because it used to be  People would look to the pros as although the cool kids. They they're the ones who really using technology  We're gonna emulate them now  I really think the cool kids are the people who own Mac Apple stuff and are creating with it and  It's not the studios. Those aren't the cool kids anymore. So I think Apple's completely justified  And it's certainly a good economic decision to just say look and cool kids use Apple and

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  The thing is is again most of the pro the pro line is mostly focused on how do you make it more like avid?  Like that's the request right?  Right that and that's not a how do you how do you this is what we want to be more like the product that we're probably  Just gonna stick with anyway  Whereas the social media market is really creating new things new ideas new ways of cutting, you know  Yeah, and and and it's really hard like when I work with so, you know  I think that what people don't realize is how hard it is to cut  You know the kind of stuff that we see like it seems like an easy thing when you know  Like Steven put up something this morning about Final Cut and I was like wow  That's moving fast and and the the but the thing is is that you  that kind of editing is really hard, especially when you're at a you know at  I work with a lot of creators and that kind of work is an enormous amount of very fine-tuned edits and and  graphics and and they're paying attention to things that broadcasters aren't paying attention to and how they put all the stuff up together and  it's much faster editing oftentimes and  They need somebody to pay a lot of attention to them and it you know resolve may do some of that  Premier probably less, you know, because they have rush so they're gonna know which no one uses  So nobody's got a rush team that no one's using I've never seen rush in the wild  Yeah, I know that's what nobody wanted everybody  They've got a product that they think that they're always gonna use and so so I think that having I think that for creators having  Apple and black magic sitting there kind of vying for their attention  Which is I think is really it's really great for them and we're gonna see a lot of innovation in what video looks like as

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  You know, it's also it's also really about this quickly  It's also really good for Apple's business because  Apple isn't really about hey  We're gonna sell a whole bunch of people a bunch of $10,000 computers and we're gonna be really really happy about those margins  It really is about we are acquiring a customer and then as soon as we get a customer  We can monetize the hell out of them the person who bought the instead if we can get that  That that creator to buy an iPad instead of the $1,500 Windows laptop that they've in gaming laptop  It's not just that $1,500 iPad they're probably gonna get a watch they're probably gonna get air pods  They're probably gonna subscribe to Apple services and now they've got revenue for life  And so that's not necessarily something that someone who's has the $10,000 to spend on the tricked-out Mac Pro. They're just looking for  Return on investment bang for the buck take off the features that I want. They're not necessarily learning  They're not incessantly setting into motion a sequence of events that leads to them getting an Apple themed tattoo in seven years  Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple wants to be hip Apple does not want to be establishment. They are establishment  That's the dirty little secret, but they don't want to be seen that way  They want to be seen as a punk with the leather jacket the turn up a collar going. Hey wait a minute. That's not hip anymore either

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  But also in order to be that relevant and especially with like the influencer tick-tock crowd  They're gonna have to move very fast because as I scroll tick-tock as you do  I see the little cap cut logo on so many of the trending videos  Because cap cut will add these templates and filters that will then go viral on tick-tock  and then everybody wants a video that looks like that and  So they go to cap cut to make the video and in order for Apple to compete and not you know for people to choose  To go to final cut on their iPad versus cap cut on their phone  They're gonna have to stay with some of those trends or at least offer some of those filters and effects

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  People want to you you're already at a date tick tocks dead tick tocks over. Oh god. Oh, no looking at tick tock for man  I don't know what's the new one. I just know that like my kid who was a big tick tock influencer has moved now to Instagram and YouTube  And there's no cap cut on his videos. Although I do notice this is sponsored by beef  It's what's for dinner. So I think he's doing alright. I've heard I've heard of that brand  Sponsored by beef  He died the way does this with the MacBook Pro 16 and Premiere  So and he did there's no ad for it and nobody's asking him and there's no behind-the-scenes. Oh, here's how I do it  Nobody cares about teens. He's a fogie for heaven's sakes. I know he's 28 now. Oh my god. He's out of it  So old  Here he is. Here he was with somebody even an older foggy  Smoking a stogie  fogies with stogies  All right. Let's take a little break. We do want to talk about the quarterly results  Even though the six color graphs are not here. They are going to be here in absentia  There's a lot of other stuff including the New York Times just noticing that Katie Cotton passed away  60 days ago or something  Apple insider your your publication had the story April 10th. The New York Times published the obituary this week

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  They probably didn't have they probably didn't have that obit ready to roll. I think yeah. Well, she died very early surprisingly  It has to be a New York Times obituary. So I wouldn't be surprised if it really did take them a few weeks to get

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All those quotes. It's a really good. It was a really good. It was nice. It was really nice  Yeah, Katie cotton, of course longtime Apple PR  person  And really the person who put Apple on the map when Steve Jobs came back  So yeah, she deserves a lot of credit passed away at the age of 57 in April  But the New York Times a bit was this week  Let us move on and we will have more in just a bit. I'm gonna pop my collar  Turn up my thumbs. Hey  And talk to you about zip recruiter if you are starting a business, but you know as somebody who runs a small business  I really appreciate zip recruiter  When you're whether you're starting a new business, you're growing a business or like me  You're just trying to keep that business all the wheels on  You need the most talented people on your team. I've really learned a  Company is just it's made of people. It's just the people in the company. So when you're hiring  You're building that's that's the building blocks. That's the foundation of the company. That's where zip recruiter comes in  It really works. You can try it for free right now zip recruiter comm  McBreak  If you're gonna start a new business think what it would be  It doesn't matter if it's a charity or a taco truck  You still have to hire people for us when we're under 20 employees and when somebody leaves  That's a big gap. That's a hole because suddenly we've got to cover all those responsibilities and at the same time find somebody new  That's why Lisa always goes to zip recruiter and she does it at breakfast. I'm sitting I'm watching she's posting it  She chooses it recruiter for a number of reasons one you're posting to the largest possible audience  Your post on zip recruiter immediately goes out to a hundred other job boards. It goes out to social  Just automatically so one click of the mouse and you're everywhere and sometimes I know people say well, wait a minute  I don't want millions of phone calls and emails from people who I don't want to hire  No, no, don't worry. It all goes into the zip recruiter interface. They reformat the resumes. They're easy to scan you can have  Screening questions. This is very powerful, you know, yes, no  Multiple choice even essay questions that will let you kind of filter out and  And rank the remainder and then pick the right person fast, but there's one more thing zip recruiter does that is  transformational  Lisa will post at breakfast zip recruiter will take that post and go through all their current resumes more than a million resumes  Using their powerful matching technology and find people whose qualifications match  Now they don't they don't invite them to apply they send them to you. You can look at them  Same screening process and say I want to invite these three these three really look good and  That makes a huge difference because when somebody is invited to apply for your job, they respond because that's you know, that's flattering  That's good. So one of the big problems these days in hiring is people just no shows on the interviews no shows, you know, they  Not with zip recruiter. Those people are gonna apply and  I have to say with those labels that you could put on here. That's another way zip recruiter really differentiates itself  You can say though that you can work remotely for instance or training provided or urgent  We have an urgent need and those labels are many more will stand out  Among all the other listings and that's very powerful zip recruiter really works  She'll post at breakfast and I love it within an hour. She's saying oh look, here's one. Oh, here's another way  And it's such a huge relief because we're desperate we got we got to fill this position and by noon  She'll have usually three or four really great candidates  That's how we found FIFA in our continuity department  Let's zip recruiter fill all your roles with the right candidates four out of five employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality  candidate within the first  Day for us. It was just a matter of a few hours see for yourself  Right now you could try it for free use our special address just for Mac break weekly  And I want you to use this so that they know you saw it here zip recruiter comm slash Mac break zip recruiter  comm  slash  Mac break Mac B R E a K  Zip recruiter it's the smartest way to hire and it's exactly how how we do it. It really works  So in a nutshell apples  quarter  surprisingly good right  Better than expected anyway Jason Snell last week said I predict 90 billion in revenue  It came in a little it came in higher about 94 billion  In revenue 94.8 billion, so I guess that's 95  Better than the market expected the margin better than the market forty four point three percent. That's a nice margin  That's nice profits  21 point twenty four point one six billion in net income. That's three. That's eight billion dollars in  a month for three months a  little bit off the year-to-year  previous  But that's you know still good money and the real surprise I should let me pull up the six colors charts because the real surprise  Was the success of services that has really outperformed. Yeah Apple all-time all-time record

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Mention that was not not just because not not just because of one particular segment of it  It was across the App Store Apple music iCloud even payment services. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz you you know, usually the the caveat I say is well  It's all through the App Store and any by the way, right that ain't gonna be forever because the EU is really really pushing them  on that one

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, also also they in the QA. They also did call out that  App Store game revenue is way way down  largely, that's good and  Partly that's because they had an artificial booster in kovat, but they're mentioning that  Advertising advertising revenue is down game revenue is down  And that's probably where you see a lot of the thought of the bad news happening services now near

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nearly a quarter of their revenue, of course iPhone still, you know more than half  So even a little more than half the before 7% iPad 8% Mac 9% wearables

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  March quarter record for iPhone

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, which this is not if this is normally a slow quarter, right

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, the quarter first quarter is  It includes holiday sales and so a lot of those that takes a lot of the air out of the second quarter results for  Mobiles because whoever was waiting to waiting to upgrade it has probably upgraded by now, right?  So yeah, I mean there's a lot of really good news here. There's a they were better if you read the transcript  Anytime they every single segment either includes the phrase quarter record or it record or says  Unprecedented foreign exchange problem headwinds and unprecedented macro  international macroeconomic turn-downs, so, you know, like basically  Basically the score of like each category there like the Mac was Mac is down like 31%  Oh the other the third phrase is is hard to compare because of course this quarter last year  We were we were getting a big bounce from the release of Apple silicon  So the fact that Mac Mac sales are down 31% is hard to it's hard to compare

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  15 year old it's all excuses excuses excuses excuses

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It's it's it's valid but that's that's the point of an earnings call  Basically, you want to have the have the bad news to try try to leaven it as best you can without getting sued by shareholders

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because you can't say things like that during was it was the worst news the the Mac revenue change  I mean it's bad news for me because I'm a Mac user. I love Mac but year-over-year Mac revenue was down 31%

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I mean, that's a big drop. It was it was the most dramatic iPad was down 13% That's again also also m1 changes  Wearables was steady down just 1%  And even then again, this is where they try to make sure that you they get all the good news out  They're saying they're hit they had record quarters in the US and greater China greater China despite being down 1%  Services again nothing but nice things to say about services

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So and and of course that the Mac had after the m1 was released had just an explosion  so it's really hard to keep that pace once you've  You know once you've had such a huge influx

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Display all that yeah all came out in that March 2022

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  America's down a little bit China down a touch  Yemi a Europe in the Middle East up a little bit  Japan kind of flat  Yeah, I mean this what else did Tim Cook say any other kind of gleaned you glean any  He talked about AI. He said we're cautious

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, he did. I mean he did and careful. Yeah, he was asked about that during the QA  And he did the usual double-edged thing of saying that we're cautious  We think that it's still early days, but also kind of like what Sundar Pichai was saying in defense of their late  Arrival into the chat bot saying hey, we've been we've been an AI guy  We've been using AI in fall detention detection. We've been using AI the EKG stuff  So that we have AI throughout our experience  We just we're just being cautious and we're being we're being safe and we're being secure which is which is completely valid Stephen Kovac asked him about

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Layoffs he said that's the last Tim Cook said that's a last resort and so mass layoffs not something  We're talking about at this moment. That's good news in a tech industry that has laid off hundreds of thousands this year

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And they're still hiring that was that was a CNBC interview that they gave I think just before the earnings call  And so they're saying we're still hiring just not as just not as we're slowing down that rate just a lower  Level than we were before

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're doing all the right things are challenging the things that we spend we're finding a few more ways to save on it  This is of course a message to investors. We're frugal. We're being careful. Yeah

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  So since and mentioned cutting corners where they can again not as desperate as  Not as desperate as you know, google probably saying we're still using disposable flatware  But we're asking people to not throw them away. Just rinse them keep them in your pocket. That's your spoon for the week. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anything else that we gleaned from the earnings call our interviews per your post  a lot of it was

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  A lot of apple's message was all about emerging markets and saying because we're not doing it for the first time  Emerging markets and saying because they were they did have to admit they did have to admit that  There was a lot of slowdown in the u.s markets  But however, they're basically talking about india not just as for manufacturing but as a new market  That's kind of one one question one caller actually  Compared it a little bit to the situation and their opportunities in china about 10 or 15 years ago  And tim cook said specifically that yeah, we think that there's a big opportunity large often because again  Hitting upon the the question about china with there's a lot of people who are entering the middle class and those people now have money  to spend on  Luxurious brands they didn't he didn't call themselves themselves a luxurious brand  But but you know what you're talking about here  Yeah  What I do see in india is a lot of people entering the middle class  And i'm hopeful we can convince some number of them to buy an iphone as well as see how and we'll see how that works out  But it's working out. Well  Um

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Did say that the apple savings account has had a you know, a critical response to the high-yield savings

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, we know that uh, that was another drumbeat. Yeah. Wow

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was a huge success. Um  Apple made enough money that they're going to do another 90 billion in buybacks  And of course that helps the stock quite a bit, right when they do

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, because that that that drives off revenue but that's also it's starting to become a little bit more controversial  Because even if you're not like, you know quasi-socialist saying well, how can you help?  Why don't you put some of that money back into improving worker worker situations?  Uh, but a lot of it is that even congress is uh, they're proposing I think the seec  Is putting in new rules that are going to affect in the fall about how look you can't be invested  We are it's we are calling it a stock buyback, but under  Rules that we abandoned a bunch of years ago. That's basically investing in your own company using insider information  So we are putting into effect a whole bunch of new rules about how you can do buybacks including basically  You have to announce like exactly each the 90 billion dollar in buybacks basically means that the board has approved  90 billion dollars worth over the coming seasons  depending on  Opportunities that apple sees so the government is basically saying now that you have to explain  Every single transaction when you make it you have to explain why you're making it why you're making that this quantity of investment  Why are making it now basically to make sure that they're not  Playing some tricks saying that hey  we know we know that the that our stock is going to tank in the next two months because we're going to have to we're going to  Have to announce that this thing where this this device where you charge both the phone and the watch on the same thing  Is never going to work and we wanted to make sure that we get value  Out of the company or we you know do whatever we have to do before then so it's it's a little bit of controversy there  But on on the savings accounts that was another drumbeat thing where a lot of a lot of questions even when  You can always tell  part of the message is that when they try to weave a success into every as many answers as they can possibly make it and  Apple saves accounts was one of them. They were asked specifically by well  How do you see this as an ongoing driver of revenue?  and that the interesting interesting response in that he didn't tim cook specifically was not talking and talking about it as  uh a product  Revenue generating products so much as like he directly compared it to part of the apple health portfolio saying that the apple watch will help you be healthy  with  Exercise heartbeats keeping an eye on your stats things like that  We think that our financial products are basically also helping people to build financial health and wealth health  So that was interesting again. You're there's there's  They're not talking to the press they are talking to analysts who are going to be directing like  Hundreds of millions of dollars on investment money depending on what he says the fact that he declined to say that we're hoping to make  Some money off of this  Is either a shows that he's very much taking the long view about when they can make this profitable or he is being very  Again, he's tim cook. He is he is coded with teflon  There is nothing he's he's got he's got nothing to worry about in terms of his position or the or apple stock  The fact that he is declining to say that we're trying to make money off of this  We're actually just trying to create an apple health product and basically  Yeah, exactly get people and if there's a business aspect to it to get people more entwined into the apple ecosystem meaning to again  We don't want to just sell we don't want to just sell somebody a laptop or an ipad or watch we want to  Create a new a new a new customer that we can then make money off of for the next five ten fifteen twenty years

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Interesting. It was a funny comparison to the to the fitness thing  But apparently they only want financial fitness in the u.s. No one else gets on apple card and iphone users

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Android users can die in the street poor  and homeless  That was your fault for not buying an apple watch. You should have bought an apple watch

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  It's so hard just to get it to work in the united states, let alone

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I can imagine the banking regulations you'd have to face and all that stuff. Yeah, it's crazy  Yeah, absolutely  I I just realized I ran and got my i'm so excited and now that their final cut's coming out on the ipad  I can use my bridge keyboard  uh with my uh with my

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  That is an investment you're gonna love for the rest of your because it feels it feels good that you're investing again  Becoming a customer and just part of the ecosystem and part of that tribe  It just I I myself got a bridge tattoo on the back of my neck here. I'm so happy about it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, this was a I I bought it uh early on before apple obviously came out with its  Own a magic keyboard with a real trackpad  Um, and this looked kind of cool to go with because it's heavy. It's aluminum  You know, I mean, it's a real keyboard not a not a kind of click like not like a key fake keyboard as

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  As nice as the apple magic keep I love my apple magic. Yeah  It feels it feels like you've got a tablet with a mobile thing on  Bridge was great in that they basically said if you want if you want it to to feel like a laptop

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Damn it. We'll give you a laptop. Yeah, but I used it for about one day because it weighed like so it weighs as much  Does there was that and it's thick and I you know, I got the magic the apple magic keyboard  And I was like no, I so i've had this bridge keyboard  In my drawer, I just realized and then of course the story came out  This week the bridge has basically gone completely belly up staff unpaid  Orders unfulfilled. I seem to remember this was a I want to say a kickstart. I feel like was crowds  crowd sourced originally

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  It's unfortunate because it really felt like a brand that would be around for a long time  And and it was one thing when the ipad launched with a smart connector at first  I feel like I could be wrong but in the announcement it was like, you know  This smart connector is going to you know  Bring a whole new wave of accessories for the ipad and all that and it didn't really happen that way  You know, even with a lot of those bridge keyboards, you still just have to do a bluetooth connection  And it's just not ideal like I don't want to charge another device  The magic keyboard is the ideal solution for me. So it's unfortunate

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nine-to-five mac talked some former employees  Who said yeah, I mean the company was mismanaged during growth. There were misleading statements from its two co-ceos  An overall hostile working environment  I don't know anything about that  I think regardless impossible to compete against apple if they're going to sell a similar product  and this is the problem apple has you know, they  the ecosystem for add-ons for  Uh, you know apple stuff is severely limited because of what apple, you know, they don't make a doc. So there's a doc business, right?

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Unless you're a partner like logitech and you can make things like the crayon that apple literally will talk about in the keynotes  Right and pushing the apple store as almost well they were I think they were selling the bridge in the apple store briefly anyway

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they were yeah

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, they they do mention this like in the nine to five mac article is really really good  They talked to a lot of people and they had they they dipped into a lot of their own experience and knowledge about it  And yeah, they mentioned that for instance when the magic keyboard came out it could naturally as an apple product for an for an apple ipad  Running an ipad os it could do things that no third-party keyboard could possibly do and like and like stephen said when  apple often will work with a third party  Third-party manufacturers and kind of lift them up if they can if that company can make something that apple doesn't think  It can do a great job or doesn't make a good fit with remember that when apple  Like a few was it five years ago or something?  When they had their big ipad education event and they decided look we need education can't necessarily spend a hundred dollars for an apple pencil  So not only will we so we will basically have was it logitech create?  A court the apple crayon  Create a crayon for the ipad that is almost as good as just not quite so so important  So yeah, they'll partner with you  But you boy if you if you're not as tight as as apple and logitech are watch out. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They do quote some guy named jason snell who said that the bridge trackpad was  Quote not remotely close to apple's trackpad in class  He described the final product as being an imprecise jerky experience that was simply no good  So, yeah, thank you jason for killing bridge

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It's your fault. That's okay. That's okay. I'll get I know I got a cousin who's into laser  He'll give me a discount if I if I'm on his instagram  But yes, and and to be fair this this is why it can really really bite you in the bite in the butt because  It's not that they made it effective product  Is that the only way they could get at that point the only way they can get the trackpad to work  Because third party pointing out of excuse me third party pointing devices were not supported in ipad  It was at that point was to do kind of a hack and basically make it into an accessibility  Hack so that it would basically turn accessibility you basically use it as an accessibility third party pointer  Which was really not necessarily optimized for that kind of thing. It was great that they got it working at all  But it's not something that when you when you got something someone like jason snell who's no fool  He was just basically going to say i'm not going to accept any excuses  I'm going to tell you that this was a pain in the butt to use. Yeah, that's going to be bad

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  It actually got the bridge touch pad. It was actually a standalone magic trackpad device  It was nice sleek black and it was usbc  The reason I got it was because I didn't want to have lightning anymore. I was trying to go all usbc  But even that would just wireless touchpad. It just wasn't as good like it just wasn't good enough

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To you it's too bad, but that's what happens, you know in the world  So if anybody wants to buy this  I'll give you a good deal. No, no, no, you can't have john you want to why would you want to buy it john ashley?  What would you do with it? You don't want to buy it really i'm gonna i'm gonna keep it  It's gonna go my library of five dollars failed. Yeah, no, i'm not giving you  This is gonna this is a nice box. It was it was a great product. I thought it was very interesting product

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Um, do you think it will work with the with a google pixel tablet next month? Maybe maybe

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  maybe  I should ask you andy if you want to join us tomorrow at 10  I forgot that you cover, uh, you cover android stuff unless you're doing it for material

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  No, uh, well i'm gonna be paying attention for material

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But if you would like to join us we would love to have you jeff charvis and I are gonna do the keynote tomorrow  at 10 a.m. Pacific for google  I  Oh, I oh I oh it's off to where we go  uh apple has  Um, well this is a weird headline from bloomberg law, so i'm gonna go with it apple fails to fully reboot ios simulator copyright case  You may remember corellium made a security research tool that emulated  iPhones  Uh, that was a useful thing for security researchers  Uh on monday the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit ruled that that simulator is protected by fair use  Took they had to go all the way to the court of appeals for it  uh in corsec  Of which is the name of the simulator furthers quote further scientific progress by allowing security research into important operating systems  And so  It's okay and apple says okay fine. We're gonna drop it this suit's been going on since 2019  And they've lost every step of the way they they pursued it all the way to 11th circuit  Uh, so this is good news. I think  You know fair use has a posse anyway in the 11th circuit

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, but you see the I think it's been made. I think it's in I don't think that it's moot now  Yeah, it doesn't matter. And so I think that apple's kind of like, okay  Well, there's nothing to do about it now and and for a little company that did this  I don't think I don't you know apple tying you up in court is you know, a pretty expensive process  So I think that that might have been also they  Want to make sure that everybody thinks about right going down that path because they're gonna you know  Because that's hundreds of thousands of dollars that it costs to defend, you know to to go to court. That's that level of  Of case is not not ten dollars. And so I think that even if apple loses sometimes, I mean, I've  Definitely worked for large companies that they just tell people yeah, we know we can't win  But it's still going to cost you a half a million dollars  You know, like you know, like this is this is the car, you know, just make sure that it's worth it apple

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean corellium did have some support from third parties like public knowledge  Who felt that this was an important case to defend?  So I don't know how much of it came out of their pocket. But of course, that's a long four years and

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  You know in court, you know, and you can see why apple fought it  So for so long the the line you can't that they can't let anybody cross is hey  We made something that can run that can pretend to be an ip an apple computer and run the software or at least  convincingly do it even if it's something as important as  As running security checks and trying to investigate the vulnerabilities, but yeah, they don't they don't want that door open even a crack. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh the we mentioned that the eu continues and probably this summer will tell apple  Uh, you're gonna have to have a third party store at google as well in their play store  Also a little warning from the eu  uh  Coming specifically from eu industry commissioner terry bretton  About apple's plans to or reported plans to implement a made for iphone certification  on usb  Accessories used to be c accessories and the fear is or the thing terry is addressing is  Uh that apple produced chargers might allow faster charging speeds on the iphone 15

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I actually don't think that yeah  I think that what what they seem to miss there unless someone misread it or everybody misread it is  The made for iphone will probably have to do with  Data, you know like you know, whether it passes data or not. So I think they're gonna let you charge all you want  But if you want if you're not made for ipad, you won't be able to connect a device that actually can talk to it

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So yeah, this is only about charging. This is only about charging and bretton is merely saying  We will stop iphone from being sold in the eu if you try to skirt our new usb c charging policy. So  Apple will have a usb c charger  They don't have to this year. I think they have to buy next year

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But by the end of next year by the end next year theoretically release one more product  Into the end they are two more they could do the 15 and the 16 and still be  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  But it's not it's not totally surprising that the eu would basically issue this warning and do it in such a public way saying  You're not you're not going to get around this by saying hey great  You can charge you can charge for third-party chargers. Enjoy your five watt  Right 18 hour to a full charge thing right worth the fight wasn't it everybody?  Because you know  That would have been petty and stupid but you could totally see apple doing that  I'm not saying i'm not saying they would do that. I'm saying that I don't know that they wouldn't do that

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  The only thing is is that the only question would be is could they could they charge it faster if if both devices are talking?  To each other so you know  It has to do with over driving the battery and and so on so forth that if they have if they have something because the problem  Really is is that you know you buy all these chargers and you know the chargers are varying level of I mean usbc is kind of a  Commoditized product there's a lot of things that aren't great that are released with it  um, and so so the thing is is that you could argue that apple would want to  Have the devices be able to talk to each other so that they can manage the power that's going to the to the phone and so  Um, that would be the reason that you'd want to have  Have your own closed system to to make that actually work  Apple can do a lot of other things like put a different, you know  Put your usbc in and then have something on the back that charges really fast  You know that that isn't that is you know something so that there's a lot of ways to work around it  Well, it'll be interesting to see what apple does. I don't think

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  iPhone 14 pro more than once to lightning  I charge with magsafe in the car at overnight and so even with this usbc port even when I travel  I bring the magsafe duo still because it's funny. I

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You're 100 right. What's really interesting is is that I I didn't I I papood mags the the I papood the the  Inductance charger for a long time and then I had I got that one for my car  And now i'm addicted like I just put these little things everywhere  I set my phone on it and I can't remember the last time I plugged my phone into anything  You know, I think that I wouldn't be surprised if the if the base models of the iphone  Come without any connector  In the next, you know in the next a couple years  The pros will probably stay there because you have to move a lot of data  But I wouldn't be surprised if apple just closes it off completely my problem

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would I wireless charge for everything I do but but I I like having a wallet case  And this the charger doesn't go through this  And so I have to plug it in and I would be disturbed if I couldn't have my nice thick wallet case  But also  You have that peak case alex and I the peak charger is fantastic on the back  Yeah, i'm not gonna put my charge. I'm not gonna put my id and my credit card in something  That's only attached to my phone magnetically. I'm sorry. That's works great  I did it in europe. I did in europe because I wanted to have uh for some reason  I can't remember there was a reason oh because I didn't I was going to use my phone as a camera  And didn't want to have this that's exactly why I moved to it  And the problem really is not so much the the the bottom part of the wallet case  But this silly wrist strap which for some reason every time got in my picture  So I've got enough problems with my thumb getting in my picture. I don't want another thing that can get my picture  So yeah, I use the peak case which I love  Um, but that has that's special charging. That is a special  Hard magnetic thing, right? I mean it's not and you still have to take the wallet off to do it  Yeah, and I do but it's still a lot easier

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Well, I mean but for you, I mean for I'm I'm really a big proponent of choice  I really think I don't I have I have wireless chargers in the house. I don't prefer them when it when it comes down to the  It's time my battery is down at the end of the day. My battery is down to 12 or 13  I like being able I like plugging in a cable. It's just more convenient. It's going to be there  I've got this i've got this i've got this charging cable that can be used for  18 different things inside my house  It just as opposed to having this plugged into a wireless charger that can only be used with like maybe three or four things  But but it would be churlish if apple didn't like support usb power delivery, which is an independent standard  Supports five amp charging and that again that would be kind of churlish  I i'm with you when it comes to the ability to create a custom protocol that can  Uh do a much much more intelligent and much more safe a version of charging again high speed  But also without overheating without damaging the battery  That's a big big priority  But for them for for I think power delivery has to be table stakes for any usb c charge phone

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think that what's interesting is is that apple could  There's a fine line there, which is that apple could deliver something that will charge just as fast  But the battery will last longer if you use the made for iphone version because it's going to it's going to condition that that power  And so and I think that that's that's going to be a really hard one because if you plug it in and test it  It'll be fine, but over a year or two years if if the computer if the device is able to talk to it  It's going to change the it's going to vary that it'll be interesting to see how that goes

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, but power delivery wasn't wasn't designed by chimps  I mean it was they they took that in consideration and if and when you're talking about the difference between hey  This phone will last me seven years versus this phone battery will last me four and a half years

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I did a video on a magsafe battery packs and  I compared a bunch of different ones and when it comes to just the heat generated from a lot of these third-party magsafe batteries  Like I just don't trust it. It gets too hot and so when it comes to charging my phone  I know it was really poo-pooed by a lot of people but apple's first-party magsafe battery pack  It's the one I go to because it's the only one that feels like they've found that balance of actually charging it and temperature  And I don't feel like my battery health is going to take a 10 hit after using this pack for a few times

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So and again, I I think it's really gonna be about the made from iphone is gonna be really about data  It's not going to be about power. Yeah, like it's that's the data data and devices

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I mean if you don't think you probably are not going to be able to if the day in which in which you can attach  An external camera to an ipad. It's gonna have to be a made for made for ios or made for ipad device certified

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I do want to mention. I put the link in the show notes, but in the esr  Magsafe wallet. I know you don't want to leo have like cards on this magnet thing  But the esr wallet built in find my  So it has find my on this magsafe one and not like the apple magsafe wallet find my where if it just disconnects it marks  The location this has like legit find my not precision locations  But you know find my like chipola devices and stuff  And you can have the cards has a loop where you can like hold it with your finger  And the whole case actually is a stand for your iphone. So the esr wallet I I recommend so I mean the peak magnetic

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  wallet is  I mean it didn't fall off while I was in europe it made me nervous  So I imagine this is true, too. You can have a really strong magnet on these magsafe backs

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Uh, well, I have it because I have the peak. Um, you know that attaches to your vent, you know, I have the whole thing  Yeah, yeah, I bought I bought like when it snaps on it snaps. They were a sponsor. It's not and I bought everything

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have two different bicycle mounts. I have everything and uh, even you know what I really like  Uh, there was a little sticky magnet that you put on your bedside table and the phone goes right onto that and that's really  Yeah, that's really nice  But uh, I want I want to be able to carry safely  You know my driver's license and my credit cards are protected in this wallet and plus I love the idea that the wallet protects the front of the  Of the screen so if I drop it as long as it's closed

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I know I have a screen protector on it and I guess the you know, I like

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Apple care apple you guys don't do apple care. Yeah, but well, I mean

Transcript:  Real quick just this up gray video. Uh, I'll put the link  It's the difference between the uk great britain and england and it's an old video both hilarious  And he even explains like the crown and all the territories and how it's all like  Terminology.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The uh, he's british, right?  Or no, he lives in london, but he's american. He's american, but he lives in london. Yeah  I am not britain

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I'm just i'm just i'm just gonna say that with I mean he chose the scheduling for this  Why he chose to schedule it like days before the eurovision song contest where there's going to be all kinds of  Unflattering comparisons about the pageantry and the entertainment value and how invested people are in this he's not going to come off  Well, because people are going to be way more interested in eurovision than in his coronation

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh lead  Ios 16.5 release candidate  Uh, not rc does not stand for royal coronation stands for release candidate  ipad os 16.5 release candidate mac os 13.4  watch os 9.5 and tv os 16.5 all the rcs  Came out today  What is they all came out to play? What does that mean?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Uh, I don't know that there's I don't think I haven't seen anybody who said there's any kind of breakthrough features  It was kind of interesting in that apple doesn't apple doesn't talk about unannounced products  But they did like accidentally or just you know  Who cares sort of mentioned that when they they press release about the pride bands said that oh  It's good. These pride bands are the the pride bands and the pride watch face are going to be released this day next week  It will require a watch os 16.5 and ios 16.5 so that oh so that means that you're releasing 16.5 on next date  Haha, we have a scoop

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I think the only notable thing is the uh sports ball tab in the news app  Dedicated sports tab

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  yeah, apple does these pride bands every year and  usually when they do the pride bands they uh  Release a wallpaper to go with it and I guess  I mean, I I don't think there's anything else that will require an update in the operating system  It's probably the wallpaper right? That's uh, that's going to come with it

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but it's cool. They do that every year  I mean, I think that they they not only is it cool themselves  But they said they set a trend that now if you have any kind of like a wearable  You can now you can get the the pride band for your fitbit  Um, I don't know if the I don't know if the pixel watch is making enough money to get to generate a custom pride band  But that's a really really cool thing and i'm glad they do it every year. Yeah. Well and it's 49

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Every year it's kind of a nice little kaching kaching  King  Uh, so the band does match the wallpaper. Uh, it's not my favorite band  Um, I agree. It's more than just some nice pride bands, but not this one

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I think it can double as a birthday band like it looks like birthday cake  Yeah, it's not like it's not like the rainbow stripes. They usually have some kind of yeah, which I really liked. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe they've just run out of ideas

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Exactly. How many times how many times can you yeah?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, it's it's kind of an ask apple's former head of iCloud  Is now working  for general motors  Remember that gm decided they were not going to support carplay or android auto in their future vehicles  so, uh this guy who  You know, uh my my gabot who worked  At uh at apple for iCloud services and infrastructure did i-message and facetime  He will be executive vice president of software. So presumably responsible for whatever general motors puts in their cars  Instead of carplay. We have a uh, chevy bolt that has carplay. I'm not buying a car without carplay  Sorry, in fact ford even said we lost that battle 10 years ago  Which is true because the car software is never as good  Uh as uh apple and google can do I think

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I think especially where gm's coming from they're not coming from trying to create a better service  They're coming from trying to make more money own it  So they're coming to from bleeding us just bleeding us a little bit more and that that position  Where they're you know where they're coming from when they develop this is how do we squeeze a little bit more money out of the consumer  Is never going to build a better product and they don't have enough juice  The problem is is they have a commoditized product that isn't no one cares about like, you know  Like no one cares about it like in the sense that I have to have a gm  If you're buying a tesla you're buying a tesla, you know, you're not you know, you might get over that  But you're buying a gm. You could just as well buy a ford  Like it doesn't really right, you know  And so the problem is is that other people will just be like they could buy a honda ford a volvo  Whatever it doesn't like they're not in a place where that they're that they have to they'd have to come up with something that is  Truly different for people to be willing to put up with  You know not having something that they everybody uses on their in their product. And so I I think it's I  I  It'll be really interesting to see how this turns out for them. I'm looking forward to it with popcorn. It's too bad

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I I think actually the chevy bolt is a great ev. I was very happy with it  I was interested in their new platform the ultium platform, but they discontinued the bolt  So they could do ultium and they're not going to put carplay in the next generation. So  Yeah, it's off the table. It's worked out so well. So dumb just off the table  I mean it's the reason I don't buy a tesla either to be honest  Uh, there is nothing better than apple carplay. It's a and because you're getting a new phone every few years  You're getting new up operating systems updates all the time  It's just always going to be more up to date than anything a car manufacturer can do jim farley is right  They lost that battle. It's done

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I actually just recently  Had got carplay but by a third party like little screen that you put in it's called the carparade  I have an older car so there's no chance I was going to get like built-in carplay  But now that i've used it for the first time like since it's launched, yeah, i'm not going to use anything else

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and you control it  Yeah, apple gets all the info

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You know that's and I will say that like when when all things are even if if a car manufacturer actually puts in the entire  Carplay display that apple was showing is like this is what's there. Oh, i'll buy that one. Yeah  There's a lot of people that are going to go. Oh, i'm just going to buy that and and because again  For most cars they all fit into a little box of you know, there's a sedan they have a truck  They have a van they have a but I don't look at it like oh, I have to have the chevy van  I mean I look at it like well, there's like four vans and i'll play around with it and i'll look at what the features are  And so I think that there's you know  I think there's not that many cars that stand out that are within a reasonable price range, you know  And so I think that most of them are just like some basic things that you like a little bit better than others  And so I think that that's going to be really hard for for gm. I think they're going to actually take a  Pretty big hit, you know from from that because there's going to be a lot of people who  Who buy car who have more, you know, oftentimes have more disposable income  They're not going to buy those cars because they're just gonna be like, oh, I can just go get a but we hired the former head of iCloud

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What do you guys want?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And they're also apparently having uh, google like help them on that os

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And part of the google auto or something running underneath probably right?

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  No, it's gonna be something new but part of the deal is that hey, we'll help you out  But if are you gonna what kind of map are you going to be using in that?  You think it's going to be google maps. Oh, yeah there I think they already said it'll be google maps  I think they already said that so google services will be wired. It won't be android auto, but it will be so there's a  Yeah, it's it would be nice if you had the choice  Those of us who are aware enough to say look if I don't want to have google  As bad enough the gm is going to be monetizing all my telemetry off of this car  Do I have to have another huge company doing it as well or at least?  Apple's a two billion dollar two trillion dollar company  But I kind of trust them to only want to only want to be the only company that makes money off of me  And exploits me as opposed to helping other people to do that and I I have to admit I you know, I used to

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Immediately put google maps onto my phone and that's what that's just all I used  On the iphone I have gotten to the point where I actually like apple maps  I hate better than google maps like and I and it took a long time like I hate I I hesitate to say that  But you know because you get used to it because you hit the link and it pops open automatically and and you get you kind  Of used to it when I go back to google maps  I kind of feel like i'm going backwards now like I just feel like the display and some of the wonkiness that it has  When i'm trying to find something is the apple maps is actually  After years because I mean I didn't start using apple maps as a primary map thing until maybe six months

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like this last one. It's a function of where you are though alex don't use it in rome  Because really yeah  Lisa and I so had a little battle because I used apple maps because i'm using my watch as we we're not driving  We're walking and I wanted my watch to subtly say turn left here  Uh, and we kept getting lost and oh really going the wrong way and lisa finally just fed up  Started using google maps and so every day every day we'd go walk around rome for like hours  Lisa's going no turn left here. I said no, but the watch said turn right. No turn left  We were battling between maps and now maybe it was also my fault apple maps did do a cool thing where I could  I think it was apple maps hold up. Yeah, it was I could hold up the phone show it some buildings  And then it would put a giant arrow on the building saying go that way

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  But how often you're gonna do that google definitely does that google does it  I use it a hell of a lot in when i'm in new york  Yeah  Because the number of times where it's like i've been there long enough that I want to be one of those persons who knows  If i'm on 10th street, yes, i'm on 10th avenue turn left to go uptown and 11th avenue. It's like no  Okay, I okay. I just went two blocks in the wrong direction turn around new york's a good example because that's exactly where I

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Go  Rome and new york the two places where i'll go the wrong way for a few blocks  And at least it would never let me forgive never let me get over it

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  Apple's doing an amazing apple has been doing an amazing job  It really is the equal of apple of google maps for a lot of things it comes to it  It's it's the finer points that I think that google still has the advantage like  Okay, this is definitely the this is definitely the building. But where is the entrance to this building apple maps?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, apple does this apple starting in ios 15 did this  Um, and I used it a couple of times in rome  But the whole idea was I don't want to be a tourist holding up my phone saying where the hell am I?  I want my watch to subtly tell me which way I was going. I actually did a side-by-side test video in the car

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  So I had google maps and apple maps on two iphones side-by-side  And there were some parts apple maps the voice navigation. I actually preferred because it would say things like after the second light  Yes, turn right i agree. It had specific voice things  But I got a lot of comments on the video from international viewers that said it's just not usable

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It really depends where you are. I I think that's really the bottom line and and alex you're probably using it mostly in silicon valley  Where of course is very good. You're california

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  If the city is not more than is younger than 200 years old you're not playing this on esprat level  You have to go you have to go to boston at minimum to figure out that oh  Okay, thank you for turning left at the next corner. It's not a corner  There's a pointy bit and then there's three ways to go that way  And by the way, with them are no left turn. Oh no left turn so I can't go there

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Rome is even rome reminded me a lot of boston. It's of course a few thousand years older and it's  crazy  Well, but we were so one of the things about rome is  In the old city center, you can't dig  Because there's a ruin under there and as soon as you start to dig something  For that new building you're gonna be stopped and the archaeologists are gonna come in  So there's no high rises and the streets are pretty much the same layout that they were, you know, 2000 years ago  So, uh, but it was just horses or something  So it's crazy and there's a lot of cobblestones. So apple maps. I think even google maps  I think you know same thing in venice. They struggle a little bit with the weirdness, you know, it's hard to map that stuff

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  It really is you need it the biggest advantage is when you have a city  I'll change my answer a little bit that you need a city. That's had a huge  Horrific fire more recently than 110 years ago where they say okay guess this is horrible  It's gonna take us years to recover from this but at least we can finally do something sensible with the way we live san francisco

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Perfect example. It's a grid. It's easy go to go to boston

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  You can see that they filled they spent an entire century during the 19th century  Literally filling in the bay to create new real estate and you can tell because if you go to the top of the hancock tower  Like the the observatory at night you say wow  That's the only part of the city where all the street lights are like at in straight lines and angles and all the all the streets  They're like arlington boylston  colorinden  Are like named named in alphabetical order  It's like this is what we could have had had me just basically  Laid lay waste to the entire city in 1908 or something. I prefer it the boston way

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like walking around rome and getting lost and there's you know, as you say there's streets that go at all different angles

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  And uh, it's great. I love it cuts down to the street racing too because you know  That's right. You get you get you get that quad bike up to like  30 miles an hour before you really have to bang a hard right there

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  You're not going to have some fun with that I've I've been I have no experience of most cities driving because I I you know  In rome, I love to walk. I love to walk. I walk. Yeah, I walk before 9 a.m  Yep, and then after that I do smart go early. Yeah. Oh my rome's such a night night city  You go out right at daybreak. Um, and especially during the summer where you have a lot of and it's like two or three hours  I'm just walking around. There's nobody there and it's awesome. That's the time to do it because it's really crowded  Afternoon, that's really yeah. Oh man after about 10 a.m. I will not I just I go back because I'm usually there for work

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm usually working by then. Okay. I fell in love with it alex. I would go back in a heartbeat  I would move there in a heartbeat. I'm gonna I'm trying to talk to father robert see if I can be a priest  Or just dress like you go to restaurants

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Go to restaurants and you try to order something and the waiter will be like no  That's not what you're gonna order. You're gonna have this  Better much better mix this listen to him this with that

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He knows cappuccino afternoon, are you crazy? What are you nuts?  Let's see  Apple partner foxcon buying more land in india and vietnam

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Uh, of course, right this continues. I mean this is I mean everybody's talking  A lot of analysts now are asking companies how they're de-risking china, you know, like this has become you know, they're  Everybody's trying to move out and it's it's really feels it still feels like an  Unforced error both russia and china what they're doing what russia has done and what china is threatening to do  um just feels like you know  Most of the west is just like we would just do business with anybody that doesn't cause too much trouble  They're like not really that that, you know, um  They're not much of a high horse if you have to do this and this and this and uh  Now they're now they just can't be there, you know, and so so I think that that uh  India is obviously a big opportunity for apple. It's also room. Listen to this foxcon

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  bought a 13 million square foot parcel of land the equivalent of  50 manhattan city blocks near the uh, bengaluru bengaluru airport luru airport  37 million dollars  Nice great place to have a space perfect, right? I think that right

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah  And the problem for for china is this is a permanent thing like this isn't something that that happens like when people start buying that  Kind of land and building these factories. They're not coming back, you know, and and so it's not something that just zigzag now  There's obviously huge challenges around supply chains  um, you know, uh qualified personnel do it, I mean, you know shen shenzhen has an incredible  Workforce as well as a centralization of technology built up over years

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I imagine it wasn't so sophisticated when apple first started and it's taken

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean it but again and but I think everybody a lot of companies not just apple are trying to find their way  To at least be able to produce  a chunk of the products  um without yeah without that and that's why those services are so important for apple as well because that's your lifeline if uh,  If you can't sell hardware

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, let's take a little break and I have some pics of the week  Coming up from stephen robles. It's great to have you  Uh from apple insider and I didn't I neglected to mention beard  dot fm, which is  his uh his uh  YouTube podcast site. He does a lot of stuff

Okay, pick of the week time our special guest  steven  Robles, what do you got for us?

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  So this is a new ai tool. It's called galing  gling  Gling.i galing.ai  So if you make video content, you know, I do a lot of talking head videos obviously youtube creator content  This ai tool you upload your raw video file  And basically it transcribes the video and the powerful feature is galing will remove all silences  And your bad takes  So if you how do it know?  It's incredible like, you know, typically if you're doing talking hand content  You might have some false starts or you say the same thing multiple times  And usually it's the last take that you're wanting to actually use in the finished  And so this after you actually transcribe it transcribes a video  It will show everything that it cut out what it sees the silences and bad takes  You can just very quickly say actually no  I want to keep that take or cut more out you can even just cut individual words or whole sentences in the video  And so it does all of that. It does an incredible job and then you can export an xml file for final cut or  Resolver so you get an edit list. Oh nice  You know the reason why I didn't typically use a lot of these ai video editing tools is because I don't want to  Upload a video and then download a compressed video and then use that to edit with right and what I love about this tool is  You just download the xml file and when you import that into final cut, which is what I used to edit  It just has all the cuts and it's referencing my original video file the raw video  Automatically you can even download a multicam xml file because the way I film videos  I record on my sony mirrorless camera, but I record the audio separately  Uh to into a separate wave audio file and I typically put it together in a multicam clip  And you can do that with this gling ai tool. I download the multicam xml file  I can still add an angle put in my voiceover file  You know snap that or you know sync it to the the monitoring angle  And all my cuts are still in sync  You do have to be careful if you're doing that kind of multicam thing where you know your video file has to be longer  Than the audio. Otherwise, it'll like bump  In the multicam clip the the video file off and then all the cuts will be off  So you just have to make sure like hit record on the camera first and then record the audio  Stop the audio stop the camera kind of thing  But i've been using it for the past several days and it has saved me hours and hours of time  Have you compared it to descript.ai?  Which it seems similar. Yes. Yeah, but the script can remove filler words  But then it doesn't you know, you can download a compressed version, you know, you can do 1080p and whatever  But it doesn't I want something where I still edit in it doesn't give you the edl. I like that. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because this by the way if if uh  If this recommendation from steven has disappeared from the show you can thank our editors who do not want you to know about this product  They don't want me to know about this gling  Yeah, and ing

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Because my first step in the process whenever I edit is to just get the raw  Edit, you know, I cut out all the silences all the bad takes right and so this tool has now  Done that first step for me and that's usually a lot of the time consuming part  Then I can add whatever overlays or whatever and right now you can do it for free  With a video and it's not even there's no subscription and you can't even pay for it yet, which makes me a little nervous  I actually contacted them like let me pay you please let me pay you for this because I want this to keep being developed  Uh, but right now they just suggest five dollars a video, but it's like a tip jar like there's actually no official

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's pretty wild. It's very early. But even if they continue to charge five dollars  That's a good price. Okay, that's a great  And in a way that's better than the other pricing models because I don't know how much i'm gonna do in a month or what it's  Worth, but if i'm doing it per video, I know five bucks. Yeah, that's worth it. Yeah  And so now will it help me with the chapter markers in youtube because that's a constant issue

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  Not really, I mean you can see the time stamps, uh in in the gling of the video, but not really not really

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want something like that. Yeah  This is good. I'm gonna show this to our editors and they can throw stuff at me  Gling.ai  Andy did you want to say something about it? No. No, i'm looking i'm looking at the page

Speaker: Andy Ihnatko
Transcript:  I was giving examples of like edits that are it's as flagging. The only thing I don't understand is what is a  disfluency  Wait, what do you mean? Oh  Silence and um an adjusting camera. It's a mouth

Speaker: Stephen Robles

Transcript:  Uh apple has finally a whole bunch of new games in apple arcade right now. My favorite right now is what the car?  By the same studio as you might imagine that did what the golf and you think oh car so it is a driving game  Yes, it is a driving game in the same way that what the golf is a golfing game  It is first at first. It is a cartoony. Oh look fun  It's like you're driving in this little mountain pass with with bears like cheering you on and holding up signs  And then like instead of a car the car has like legs  For wheels which changes like how it handles the second time you run it and then oh  How about way too many legs and now it's got way too many legs and it's harder and it's different the way it goes  And then like the next level it's not even really levels. It's more like you're playing  different versions of  We're very very weird and increasingly drunk and demented driving game by the fourth version that it took me through was  There are two I think either beavers or bears  Standing on each side of the car wearing like traffic cones as hats. They're just carrying your car through the through the course  it's like  I keep screwing up because like oftentimes i'm just laughing at like what it is chosen to make me do with this car  it is the absolute opposite of thank goodness of of what I see in most racing games, which is like  You do one lap in your really wonderful f1 car and then it's the east  Hey congratulations, that was a great lap now here you want to upgrade the brakes  Maybe you want to do the the transmission of the differential like no  No, just let me drive another let me have fun driving this fake car through this fake area  And forget the burden of mortal existence and then unforgiving and uninterested god for just 10 minutes, please

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this actually absolutely does that I loved what the golf so I will be playing this that was it  It was so creative and very early arcade hit big hit for apple  Yeah, and I actually still pay for apple arcades because i'm doing an apple one even though I  Where I know really lose it. So go ahead. I'll be downloading that when we're done  I am downloading a new game from the folks at niantic. You know, they created pokemon go  And today released a game called para dot or is it perry doe?  It is a virtual  ar pet  Uh ios and android in fact, let me  My pet is named pookie  Let me just uh, let me just launch  pookie here  And uh, I will just show you there's pookie. Hey pookie and I can I can scratch her and she's purring  You probably can't tell but she's purring and we can play a game. I will uh, I will play fetch with pookie here  Let me just throw that ball pookie. She's running off. She's getting the ball. She's gonna come right back  And come back. Hi pookie  Good girl, what she's happy. She likes to play. There we go. You feed the pet  you uh  Oh, where did she go?  She's lost her. Oh there she is. Oh, you can't lose her  Uh, I could put that away  I can uh, I can do other I will eventually get other toys. I have to feed her. She's a tamagotchi  Actually, they showed it already on ios today. So if you want to see more game play  With rosemary, where is she? Oh, she's over there. Oh the tennis ball is about to break  Where'd she go? Where'd she go?  Um, this is it's you know, it's well done. It's a game. It's an ar game  Kind of like pokemon go. It's pretty well done kind of fun. She'll bug me. Uh, she's gonna sleep right now  um  But one interesting thing and I bet you uh, they talked about this already on ios today  What's that? What does she want that? What is that?  You can buy stuff of course, right? That's where the money is because the game's free  I'll use use the location stuff. You can buy stuff and you can get real stuff delivered by amazon  This is the first deal amazon has made  with a virtual  game  to order real  Stuff like t-shirts and things so it's a new business for amazon. It's kind of interesting  It's called peridot. It's free to play although  I'm guessing they're gonna kind of be pushing you to to buy stuff in there. I think niantic does really really good stuff  It's the first amazon anywhere game as well. So you'll be able to  Get peridot icon t-shirts  and uh pillows  and pop sockets  To let the world know you're in the peridot keeper  Society for real money  With real shipping because it's real merchandise interesting amazon  Mr. Alex lindsey your pick of the week

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  I thought I recommended this one before but I went through the macbook picks and couldn't find it  And so I felt like it was worth talking about. I I use this. I use a lot of plugins from isotope  isotope and uh  This is kind of a secret weapon that I was talking the reason I thought about  Talking about today as I was talking to  One of my producers yesterday and and I was like well I I have to I was having some trouble getting the license to work  I had changed computers and everything else and it took me a couple minutes and  It's like I can't really operate without it. So when you go into logic, these are all plugins that are  Isotopes, you know, they have rx and ozone and and you have you know, d-verb. So if someone's got too much  Uh reverberation in their room, you can take that out d s d plosive d  You know, you're mostly taking things away  To make those those work and they've a lot of different bundles  I paid 20 bucks a month like it's it is a subscription that I pay for  I don't know what I think it would cost a lot of money if it wasn't that way  But it's a 20 a month subscription and I have to admit I was trying to figure out which one I had  I don't know which one I have  In there so that's why I just said isotrope just check it out  but there's ones for vocal and for music and  And for a variety of other ones and you get these big bundle  Look at this big bundle of of tools and again the ones that I use mostly are you know  Someone talks a little bit into their mic and you take it out  um, and someone talks a little bit and and it  Really does a good job and everybody I know that does much audio work has it  It's just kind of like a like this is kind of like everybody you're you're just like well  Then I just use rx. What is this dialogue match do? That's interesting  It is designed. Um, I haven't used it that much because I don't worry about it that much  But if you're trying to if you have two dialogues from the same person or if you have I think it's also if you have two different people

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh like maybe if you're overdubbing in the same room, you want to change the word

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  But you want the the tonal quality to be the same, right?  I have you know  They have one called nectar which is supposed to kind of like analyze the and put in the plugins and I haven't been as excited  about that, um, but but the the d-verb deplosive ds is almost guaranteed if I start doing much work  I'm gonna put some of those in if there's any of those issues  Um that are that are there for um for my capacity show or other things that I work on with audio  You're doing a lot of audio these days. Yeah

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I z o t o p e isotope like an ice with a z. Oh you use it too steven

Speaker: Stephen Robles
Transcript:  I'd say yeah  I use the rx 10 suite from isotope and I use it for exactly one tool all the time, which is the breath remover  I breathe kind of loud  And so I just run my wav file  To remove all the breaths and it's amazing and then i'll take that audio and bring it into final cut  But all the tools amazing but breath remover
