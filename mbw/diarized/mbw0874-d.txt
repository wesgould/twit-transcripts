Transcript:  Out where the sun shines and the fog does not eclipse the summer in the South Bay.  It was so warm and nice in Cupertino other than it rained at one point and everybody at Apple  didn't know what to do basically. What do we do with this? There was a man with a squeegee  trying to wipe things down. It was very confusing. Did it rain during the event?  No, it rained at that time the next day. When I was sitting waiting for my Apple Vision Pro  hands-on experience, yeah, the sky just opened up and the man with the squeegee was trying to  squeegee the entrance to the special lounge where we were all sitting. He was like,  this is the squeegee. He just was never going to win that battle.  He's a human windshield wiper is what he is.

Transcript:  Hey there, ho there. I know we're all excited to hear Jason's first-hand reports of Vision Pro.  I'm already excited to see that there are no longer any red marks around his face where it met him.  So any worries that it causes an allergic reaction that would last at least a week,  absolutely dispelled today. We're on the board already.

Transcript:  I took it head on. They're right in the forehead. I could never get it to fit exactly right. I  came out of there feeling like I was... Really? It didn't sit nicely on your face?  That's happened with other VR headsets I've tried. They made the claim that they've got this one  piece that fits the light shield. There are going to be a lot of sizes of them, but they didn't have  that many sizes of them. For whatever reason, I could never really get comfortable with it.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  But if their plan is to have 15 sizes or 12 sizes at launch and they've only got four now,  then they scan my face, which they did do very much like Face ID. And then I guess they looked  at it and said, I don't know what to do here. Just, Bob, stick the media on. We'll see what happens.

Transcript:  There's also something interesting that's on social media pointed out that I missed in the  keynote. Some of the canned fake living room videos, they had a strap over the top of their

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  head. We all had that. You all had that? Absolutely. It was a Velcro top strap to help with stabilization.  It keeps the weight off too. Carrying the weight across your whole head.  They did have that and it was nice. I wonder why they didn't show that.  All the materials, you will be surprised to hear that the materials made in the headband and the  strap are of the highest quality. They're very, very well made. Made with the best lint picked  from the finest rags. It was fine Corinthian leather. Yes. Oculus Pro or whatever they call

Start time: 311.60
End time: 325.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  it, MetaQuest Pro has an optional top strap and I actually don't use it, but I don't wear it for  very long. So I think for lengthy periods of time, you might want to have that top strap. So that's  not an option. That's something that comes with it, it sounds like. I think so. We don't know.

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  I'm just saying that they got a lot of gambling. They got a lot riding on that. It's got either  work completely 100% non-goofy or let's just wait for it. Yeah. And then it must add a little bit to

Start time: 359.02
End time: 365.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  those lenticular screens must add a bit to the bill of materials. I'm sure it does. I mean,

Start time: 365.80
End time: 408.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  it's very clever. They've said, you can't just put a screen on it showing eyes because if you're off  axis, it looks like a screen showing eyes. They're following you or something. It's weird. So they  did this lenticular thing, but I will say again, nobody has seen that feature, right? It's in some  of those videos. I'm unclear whether they actually are even there. You don't see it in your demo.  Nobody saw it in person. The closest we got is that in the demo, we did get a FaceTime call from  somebody who was using a digital persona. Presumably the same technology that creates  the digital persona face creates the little eye area that gets put on that display. Those eyes

Start time: 408.74
End time: 414.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  aren't a picture of your eyes. They're a digital persona of your eyes. Yeah. Well, I mean, they're

Start time: 414.16
End time: 469.14
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  taking picture of your expressions from your eyes and using it to do it, but it's not a one-to-one  in the memoji fashion. Yeah. And they high think of a very, very high res memoji, although I'll say  like I had a very positive experience with the headset. I think that as a piece of technology,  the Vision Pro is remarkable. And that's the combination, the Apple combination of the  hardware and the software, incredibly impressive piece of technology. However, we can talk about  it or not, whatever you like, but I will say the one place where I went, whoa, now was the digital  persona, which during the keynote, I read it. I was more optimistic than some of the people around  me. I was sort of like, it might be okay. And other people were like, oh hell no, basically.  And then I saw it in the demo and I was like, oh no, no, no, no. It is the uncanniest of valleys.  It is, you know, the person I was talking to made a facial expression. I was like, no, no, you are,

Start time: 469.54
End time: 519.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you know, no, back Satan away. They made an interesting choice with FaceTime that FaceTime  would not be a legless immersive experience as in the meta experience. It would be FaceTime with a  screen, but then they still have this issue with there's no camera on you. So they have to fake you  and the fake you it sounds like is not very good. I'm going to say this, this really strikes me  as a concept car. You know how in Detroit Auto Show, they show this car that you go, that's  wonderful, but it never ships. And I think this is their concept car. And you now explain to me why  we never saw anybody Tim Cook on down wearing these. Because that's that feature doesn't even  get spooky eyes weren't there. I wonder if the spooky eyes work yet. Yeah. I don't, I mean,

Start time: 519.58
End time: 612.26
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  you're right. I think you're right. I think the question is, you know, how committed are they to  this hardware being final? They may be across that line, but, but you're right in spirit because  a lot of the stuff that's in here is very much beholden to Apple's concept of what this thing is.  Right. So the eyes are there. The eyesight thing is there because Apple is trying to send the  message that they want you present in the world, that this is an AR product and that if you can see  out, people can see in right. And that it's an indicator that they can see you. And like, I get  it. I get it entirely from a philosophical point of view, but I have with some of these features,  I wonder FaceTime is like this too. I wonder whether at some point the initial philosophy  will get overridden by user reaction and they'll realize, oh, like the dogma we went into when we  designed this product is actually not how users feel. And then they change the product. It may  be too late for this one, but that's undoubtedly going to happen. I think the FaceTime in a window  is a great example of that where I'm actually not convinced that that's the only way they're  going to do FaceTime. I'm convinced that's the only way they wanted to show FaceTime last week.  Right. Cause we're talking about a lot of time here. There are so many things that I'm sure that  they have very carefully omitted entirely because either they're not ready to show them  or they don't want people talking about them when they're talking about this product. And  you know, they've got, this is unusual for Apple in that they've got, you know, six plus months of  runway here so that they can be very picky in what they disclose now versus in six months.

Transcript:  I think the least compelling thing that they showed there and the most absurd, like it,  and it, and it, it's not like, I think there's a lot of things about the vision headset that work.  The moment I even saw it in the keynote, I was like, oh, it's going to be a bad idea.  Like that's going to really, it's, it was like polar express, you know, and, you know,  it's about, about the polar express level. And, and I think that they just, it's so hard to do.  I thought, I really thought that they were going to use Memojis. Like I thought that Memojis was  the answer to that. That's why they, and it's all building them. That's why they got it. And I bet  you that there's going to be an option. Sure. Yeah. And everyone's just going to go to, I'm  just going to use my Memoji and we're all going to be fine. And because everything about Memoji

Start time: 651.12
End time: 673.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  works. Yeah. They're just too proud of this. And so they don't want you to think about Memoji  because that's like the fallback. They're so proud of this thing. And I think either it's going to  have to get a lot better, or they're going to have to just say, well, yeah, it's, if you, if you find  this uncanny, you can just use your Memoji, which is, you know, because all the Memoji is also  reading your face and generating a facial expression based on it. It's just much less of an attempt for

Transcript:  it to be real. By lowering that resolution and making it not look exactly like you, you bought  your mind immediately. It's why, while you watch a Pixar, as soon as you get to the point where  you're real, the only folks that have, the only person that has figured this out in my opinion is  James Cameron and maybe Weta, you know, in the world with millions and millions of hundreds of  millions of dollars, they figured out how to get that to work. And not in real time. Right. And not

Start time: 698.26
End time: 785.46
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  in real time. It's not. And as the famous, as the famous Scott McCloud understanding comics, like  transition, where it's like, there's a point, there's a point between absolutely abstract,  smiley face and absolutely photographically real, where you're getting the best of both worlds,  where it's a cartoon version of somebody with just enough details, you absolutely emotionally  connect to it, not so much that it has to be now spot on. And I think that's, I got the, I mean,  I got the impression from that, from everybody's hands on experience that maybe Apple's real goal  this, with that release, excuse me, with, with that demo, with that, with that thing was to make  sure that the information comes back. These displays are incredible. I can read text at any  size, any distance. The 3d effect is impeccable. And not quite, and also not quite so many people  come back saying after half hour, I got nauseous or I got headaches because just, just like with  the Apple watch, so long as they get the hardware, right, they can, they can build the software,  they can fix the software, they can hold back software features until they're ready.  But the thing that will cause this to be an absolute utter first day failure is if people  put it on and say, my God, this isn't nearly half as good as my $500 quest. This isn't nearly,  I don't, I'm not going to put this on for more. I'm going to, I can see under having this for games,  but the Apple thinks I'm going to use this as my 4k Mac monitor and use this like all afternoon.

Start time: 785.78
End time: 883.36
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  No way. Yeah. They want to dazzle you with their tech prowess, right? That's number one thing they're  trying to do here is have everybody go, wow, look at Apple. They were capable of making this product,  which by the way, I admit to be dazzled, right? Like I think this is an incredibly impressive  product. Let's separate their two stories here, right? There's will it sell and do people want it?  And there's what is this product? And this product is amazing. It is an amazing work of technology  and also of user interface. The software in it is incredible. But like what we got last week was  one Apple showing you their tech skills and doing this thing. And then all of us who tried it could  see that it's got, it's incredibly, the refresh rate is amazing. It looks not like reality, but  like very close to reality when you're using pass through mode, all that stuff is impressive.  And then the other thing that we're trying to do is I think blunt criticism of the story that would  be Apple wants to cut you off from the world. So everything Apple did was like, no, no, we are  being humane here. The word I keep coming back to is humane. It's like the headband is soft woven  material. We can see your eyes when you can see us. Everything is a default to AR, not VR.  Everything defaults to you seeing everything around you. They had that ridiculous shot in  the promo video where somebody is packing their suitcase while wearing the headset, which is just  like it's bananas. But I know why it's there. It's there because they want to say, look,  you're in the world with this thing. And I think that literally was their number two goal with this  product is to stop people from saying Apple wants you to put a thing on your face where you never  see anybody ever again, because they don't want to be seen as being kind of a detriment to society.  And I think that that was what they were going for. I think, I think the part of it was just like,

Transcript:  Oh, these, oh my God, they're so comfortable and lightweight. I forgot I had them on. Yeah,  exactly. You know, they say they've integrated into my lifestyle completely. Yeah. They say a

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  camel is a horse designed by committee. I think Apple has created a camel here where  a lot of different inputs created or somebody else called it the Homer Simpson's car. They created  this, this thing and they, and they wanted to say, I want to show sweater. I want to show. And, and  I mean, it's a, it's a tough category when you're already, before you even release the product  saying, no, no, it's not like, it's not like what you think. It's a really tough category.  Yeah. I wonder if, so let's do some specifics. You were in glasses. Did they, did you get the

Start time: 933.40
End time: 1043.44
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Zeiss lenses put in and all that? They basically had a lens crafters on site. I mean, they had a  guy, they had a guy who took my glasses and scan them. And so they knew my prescription and they,  they then presumably had a bank of the magnetic snap in adjusters that they found the ones that  most closely matched it. And there was a, I mean, the way it worked is you walk in,  they scan your face, they scan your glasses, and then you sit in something that's very much like,  what do they scan your face with? They scan your face with a headset with an iPhone actually. And  this is going to be the way they're going to do it. When you buy this thing is that it's going to  be integrated with the Apple store app and they will actually, they scan it like face ID, you,  you know, you turn your face around and you'll have to get fitted at an Apple store to get this.  Well, you could do it in the Apple store app. If you don't want to go visit, they said they  anticipate most people will want to actually try this before they buy it. Go figure. But if you just  wanted to buy it sight unseen, you would scan with the Apple store app on your iPhone, on your,  on your iPhone at home. And it would send that data or it would send what you were,  what your size choice was. And that's for that light shield, I think more than anything.  And you would send them your prescription. Yeah. Yeah. And well, I think not them. If it's anything  like what Meta does, I think I used, I mean, I literally used an online glasses retailer.  So I sent them my prescription and they sent me the adjusters for my quest to,  so I imagine it would be like that. The people who buy this will have to be extremely motivated  to wear it. Yeah. I mean, if you need a glasses adjustment, you'll have to order that. And,  and then yeah, you have to do this. I mean, the sizing thing is probably not a big deal. Apple  said they figure about half of the addressable market is people who wear glasses. So,  if you're in that half, like I am then, I mean, all I did was literally forward the PDF of my  prescription to, you know, whatever eyeglasses discount, you know, whatever the one is that  Meta uses as their partner. I actually will do the same. I can put the Quest Pro on over my

Start time: 1043.56
End time: 1047.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 1048.02
End time: 1052.96
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  destroyed my glasses. It's not ideal. And so, and that's actually the primary reason I stopped

Start time: 1053.10
End time: 1056.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  using it. Yeah. Cause I'm not committed enough to buy lenses for my Meta Quest Pro.

Start time: 1057.84
End time: 1066.16
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  So what is the choice? And the fact that they didn't have it, you know, and I think that Apple,  I mean, I'm curious about this. So, so with Jason, it's a, it's a magnetic and just the lenses snap

Start time: 1066.32
End time: 1107.60
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  in, snap out. That's what they say. But again, the way this worked was they measured me that I sat in  the airport lounge while behind the scenes elves with an assembly line or putting them all together  for the rooms. Cause it's, remember it's like an individual demo. So there were just a bunch of  rooms and a door, you're led to a door and there are, there's a PR person and a product marketer  inside and the headset. So they, it was already set up for me about a time I was like, this is  Apple. It was, I don't know. I mean, I guess a little bit, like I said, I think it was more like  an airport lounge and then you led into a kind of fake living room. And it was very homey for a  temporary structure built on the soccer field at Apple park. It was very homey. How many demos do

Transcript:  you think they gave? It's, it really seemed like they were, it wasn't like the,  did they have an omelet station? That's what I want to know. It seems like there got as many people in it.  They got hundreds in, right? It looks like they're very light snacks. I would say that,

Start time: 1119.70
End time: 1174.16
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  that venue could probably do, it was a half hour actually in the room. There's probably a reset,  but let's ballpark it and say that maybe it was 25 and a, a 25 an hour. Nice. And they did it for  several, you know, at least two days, but still that there's a limit there. That's, that's whatever  that is. That's a few hundred. That's four or 500 people that at most, and maybe they had some other  stations elsewhere for developers that were not part of the PR queue that I went through, but like  it's a very small number because this was a super, I mean, literally every single person had a PR  handler and a product marketing person from vision pro. It was a two to one ratio college  students know that's pretty good. If you've got two instructors and one student, it was pretty  wild. Yeah. So they're, they're, they missed a bet. They should have had a severance,

Start time: 1174.68

Transcript:  realistic. It's just no apples. Apples is very, very good. And then that, and so they want your,  by default, your experiences are going to be in that, uh, augmented space. And then there's the  little dial, little digital crown that you can turn to, to shut yourself off from the world,  essentially. Um, but that, that is, yeah, I mean, the 3d was good. The pass through mode was very  impressive. The immersive stuff, like the sports, I know Alex and I have been talking a lot about  immersive sports on this thing. Like that slam dunk and that, that, uh, uh, it's an air fielding  error at Fenway park, uh, the word just spec. I wanted to reach out and pick up that baseball,  but it was in place. So I would have gotten in trouble. Um, it just really remarkable,  but I'll tell you the thing that impressed me maybe the most is the UI on it, that they,  it feels like Apple's best UI people spent five years on this because it felt like a natural  extension of a lot of things we've learned from iOS and iPad iOS, that the gestures seem very  natural. The fact that their eye tracking is so good that they are real. You know, we think about  the size of touch targets on an iPad or an iPhone because they got to be the size of your dumb  meaty finger, right? Um, well, it turns out our vision is way more precise than that. And they're  doing eye tracking and machine learning stuff to get it to be, uh, they know where you're looking  and it's really uncanny. Once you get it, you look at the close box and, and you know, tap your  fingers together and it's closed. That's it. You look at the move, a little move handle on the  bottom of the window and you pick up a window and you just move it somewhere and let it go. And  it all happens. It doesn't have, it doesn't have lag. Like they built a really nice computer user  interface. It's one of the reasons why I think they want to call this a spatial computer is that  they built a good computer UI for it that uses your gestures and your vision.

So you're saying, you know, the icon's fairly small. You're actually,  you can actually really tell that you're looking at that, not the one.

Transcript:  I mean, the app icons, the app icons aren't small, but the close box is quite small. It's a little  circle. And when you look at it, it turns into an X. It absolutely works. There's no laser beam,  coming out of your pointer or anything like that. You literally like, I didn't do this,  but a friend of mine, Mike Hurley, he took a, he took an image off of a webpage and literally  grabbed it and dragged it into another app and it just worked. You know, he grabbed it and it does  start to feel tactile. Like I'm literally moving this, this picture from place to place. So as a  computer UI and the eye tracking stuff in it, it's very, very good. They did a great job.

Transcript:  mostly. So you were able to stand up. There was a stand up component. So at the end,  they do this dinosaur thing where basically they draw a portal into the wall at the far end of the  room. So since it's augmented reality, they're able to basically layer their 3d content onto  a physical object. So it looks like a dinosaur is looking through a window in the, in the room.  And at that point they said, why don't you get up and interact with a dinosaur? And so I walked  over and the frame, honestly, the frame rates were good. I walked too far. So I walked into the  dinosaur and then it was like, they're like, you're going to step back, get out, get out of  the way of the dinosaur. What happened when you walked into it? It got, I think it kind of  grayed out and it was like, it was like, yeah, it was basically saying you have, you're occluding the  object. Basically, I, you know, I'll take, I'll take that one. I, I was too energetic.

Transcript:  And what I would say is that I think that the, the latency, like it was, I don't think people  are going to, I mean, somebody will, but I don't think people are going to get car sick with this  thing because the latency, the field of view was all very good. In fact, there was only one time  in the entire demo where I could actually see the system struggling. And at the beginning of that  dinosaur encounter, they had, there's a butterfly that flies into the room, into the room, right.  And they say, put your hand out and it's supposed to land on your hand. And it did land on my hand.  And then I moved my hand like, you know, back and forth a little bit and the butterfly lagged.  The butterfly was a little bit behind, but it struck me that that was the first time I'd had  the illusion broken in the entire half hour. So, you know, again, they put a lot of, there's a lot  of money in this thing. There's a lot of hardware in this thing. And that's why I think that it's  worth having those two conversations about like, will people buy it versus like, what is it as a  tech accomplishment? Because they spent so much time and money and through so many resources at  that. And I'll tell you that eye tracking, that moment where I realized that I need to stop looking  for the cursor because my looking was the cursor. That was when I went, oh, oh, I see. And then the  gestures are all, I mean, like you bring two fingers together to tap, you bring two fingers  together and move it left or right to swipe. You move them up and down to scroll. Like it's all  basically iOS gestures, really familiar. So yeah, as a, as a 3D computer, they really built a,  it's a remarkable user interface. I think they did a great job.

Start time: 1566.74
End time: 1617.84
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  No, it's with the, the dragging is with a gesture. In fact, my favorite,  my favorite thing was moving a window. I still, that's the one that I keep thinking of a week later  is moving a window where I look down at the, at the move, the move line. It's like the little  indicator at the bottom of an iPhone. And I looked at it and I grabbed it with, just by putting my  two fingers together, at which point I could just move it wherever I wanted with my hand,  but you use your hand. And then, and then I actually like moved it to the right. And then I  pushed it back a little bit further because I wanted it deeper into the room. And then you just  let go and it stays there. It's like you moved it physically. So you, you know, there are  accessibility stories here. There is a vision only mode you can use. If all you have is the  ability to point your eyes because you've got motor issues. There is a version of that. There's  they never showed Siri, but I have no doubt that you'll be able to use voice commands on this.  They just didn't want to talk about Siri. I wonder why.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah, I never, I never did that. And there's also a keyboard and the, and again, you can,  you can interact. You can stick your hand on something and interact with it. You could  probably stick it on Safari and like, like scroll it if you wanted to. It's, it's just that I don't  know if you'd want to for most things, because the way I've tried to describe it is if we think about  direct interaction with the iPhone where you're putting your finger on the software essentially,  and it's this, we don't need a cursor anymore. We've got direct interaction. This is like direct  interaction at a distance. It's almost like you've got magic where you can just be like, oh yeah,  scroll that. And you just move your hand and it scrolls it. You don't, you don't need to reach out  and scroll it. You can just sort of like do it in your lap. And, and once you get used to the fact  that you can just leave your hands down on your lap and you can still make all the gestures,  because it's, it knows it's looking down there and it knows when you're making the gestures.  That's all very effective. I mean, yeah, it's, they threw a lot into this.

Transcript:  That's another thing that I think is going to be really interesting to find out about like  the idea of having a completely virtual keyboard. Like are they literally going to say,  here is a completely fake one. We've projected on the surface. But the, and the other thing is  that like, I'm sure that anybody who was actually going to want to be doing like real typing  productivity is going to want to have like, you know, a stock keyboard, but wouldn't it be,  wouldn't it be great if like, if Apple, like you looked at it, oh, I know exactly what that is.  I'm going to give you a virtual one of your, you feel it even though it's not really there.

Start time: 1705.08

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  It may not even be so, I think you're right. They actually said, especially in the context of using  a Mac that you could just use a keyboard and a track pad and on the screen of the Mac and it will  work perfectly normally. And I think that that's, that's what they'll do. I know Meta does this,  I believe with the Quest Pro, this idea that it has object detection. So I believe with the Quest  Pro and correct me if I'm wrong, Leo, but it detects when you've got a keyboard and it actually like  does a breakthrough. So you can see the keyboard in reality. I have never tried that because the

Start time: 1740.98
End time: 1801.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  things and have meetings in the Quest Pro. I apologize. I should have. But that tech is,  because they are already doing the person breakthrough where if you're in a completely  immersive setting and somebody is looking at you and sort of leaning in, they sort of appear through  the mist so that you, so that you can see them, which I think is admirable. The idea that if  somebody wants to talk to you while you're using this thing, the system will show them to you and  say, Hey, Bob is over there. That's great. But I think they could absolutely do that. And I would  be surprised if they don't, that if you're in an immersive environment, it would show you the  keyboard. But I would also say they're probably layers of immersion where, you know, first off,  maybe you're not in an immersive environment at all. You're in your regular room and you're seeing  your keyboard, or maybe you're seeing sort of an immersive environment in front of you, but not all  the way around. And when you look down, you see your keyboard. But I would, I think that Apple will  absolutely do that sort of thing. So if you want to use a physical input device, instead of  reaching out and tapping on the virtual keys, which I am very skeptical of, I think that you'll be

This is Apple trying a lot of things and seeing what the  reaction is, what sticks, what sticks, seeing what people like. Even if they ship this concept car,

And that's why, again, we were listing their reasons, the ways they  wanted us, the takeaways they wanted from last week, right? They wanted the takeaway to be the  tech is impressive, they're humane. And I think the other one of the takeaways was this is a  computer, judge it as a computer, which is weird and interesting. But I get it, having used it,  I get it that that's a place they're comfortable. And the idea that they're trying to sell at least  somewhat a productivity story to say this basically it runs iPhone apps, it runs iPad apps.  If you look at your Mac, it pops up a 4K virtual window of your Mac and you can control it.  And they're good. They're good at computer interfaces, right? In a way,  it's the metaphor that they understand the most. So of course, they're leaning on it.

Transcript:  All I can say is that one of the things is interesting. I'd spent a lot of the weekend  watching WWC sessions to kind of get my head around that, by the way, so much nicer to watch  pre recorded WWC sessions than the ones on stage. I mean, the audio is better, the presentation is  better. You can move through it at speed. And so anyway, so I think that a lot of the vision ones  are really good. The interesting thing that I found was number one is their concepts of the space. So  you have windows, you have volumes, you have spaces. And they kind of define those for you.  Okay, you're going to have a bunch of windows and this is how they work. Then they have these  volumes that are the objects that you're going to be using or things that you can move around.  And then the space is the thing you're inside of. And it's just a really nice way to and a lot of  things all feed around those three concepts. And it's just what it showed was really, we think of  it that way, but I've never seen anybody describe it with such clarity. You know, like for developers,  understanding this is how you're going to do these things. The other thing is that it's not just the  fit and finish that they put on the end interface. It's the fit and finish of the developer tools.  I mean, the developer tools are very well developed. And I mean, down to, I mean, so I used to  help develop a nodal compositor and I've worked on lots and lots of nodal systems.  A nodal compositing of course is, you know, nodal systems are, you know, you have boxes and you  tie them together with little noodles and you build things out. Well, Reality Composer Pro uses a  nodal compositing system or nodal system to drive it. It is the nicest nodal system I've ever seen.  And I know that seems like a really odd thing, but to go down to the developer tool and make it  the most functional version of that concept that I've ever seen was kind of amazing to look at.  And it was just, and so there are so many things about it and the way that reality composer pro  works, the way that they're thinking about video, like video is so many of these things are not  big steps for the developers. If you're already an iOS developer, there's so much of this and this  is what's missing. I mean, I've developed apps for Oculus. It's not that way. It's not like, you know,  it is like building a cabin in the forest being attacked by bears, you know? And so,  so the, you know, like, and so the thing is, is that, is that you're constantly trying to figure  this stuff out. And so, and there's no native platform like this that's built for the developers  to put those things together, which I thought, you know, they've really done that, that exceptionally  well. The video stuff is just, it's just HLS and oh right, we built a whole new format. That's the  one little glitch that we have right now is the MVHEBC is their new video format. I mean, we were  wrong last week, by the way, or I was wrong. It's not 83 frames a second. It's 90 frames a second.  And it is 96 frames a second for film. And the reason they do that, of course, is so that they  can equally show all the frames and they're not doing some kind of weird round off.  It's a multiple of 24. Yeah, it's four times. And so, so the, so anyway, so the,  I got math and math. Thank you, Alex.  Yeah. So, so the, so great frame rates and then, but also the funny thing about it for us that are  doing live, I think we're, we don't know, a bunch of us are talking to me like, how do we do 90  frames a second? Like there's no systems that do that, you know? And so it'll probably be 60 for  a little while. But anyway, but the point is, is that all these platforms, as I watched it,  what I can see is that they didn't, they don't make you learn something completely new if you're  an already an Apple developer. They're just adding on little bits and pieces and then they're doing  those add-ons in a very, very clear way. So, so anyway, did you watch the track on Unity? How,

Start time: 2111.28

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 2113.60

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  going to have to use Unity. Yeah. I think that, I mean, I think that, I mean, you can use, I mean,  I think that the misguided attack that Epic fired off has now, has now fired, you know, has now  shown itself, which is none of us knew whether they were going to keep on building their own  stuff or whether we're going to Unity. Unity is a solid platform. Is it as good as Unreal? I don't,  I don't think so. Not right now, but it now has a huge shot in the arm from Apple that it didn't  have a week ago. And so it's not so much that Unity is going to take over Unreal or Epic's  in any kind of trouble whatsoever. They've got a great platform. A lot of people are using it.  It's just that it, it, it emboldens their chief competitor a lot and will flow a lot of money into  what, what they're doing. And so it's just, it's not, it's not an end, you know, it's not a huge  mistake, but it's going to cost Epic billions, you know, as this goes forward. So by the way,

Transcript:  speaking of things Apple didn't talk about last week that they don't want us talking about in  context with this product for the next six months, games is actually one of them. The only game  context they talked about in the keynote was you can play like an iPad game with a controller in  a virtual like what? But, but clearly there are, so there's the shared space that multiple apps  can run in. There's the equivalent of full screen mode, which is you can, apps can be all alone in  an AR space and then there's immersive. And of course you can play fully immersive games in this  thing. There's a question about whether the hand tracking that Apple's doing is going to be so  precise or whether you're going to have to buy an add on controller for certain kinds of games.  I'm sure it's Beat Saber, it's probably going to be able to do it or something like that, but like  it's absolutely going to do that. You can see it in the sessions that it's going to be able to do  that. It's just not what Apple wanted to emphasize. I think that's kind of interesting that every other  VR system has been talked about in the context of immersive gaming and Apple's like, like  privately, they're like, yeah, it does that, but we're not talking about it right now. It's

Start time: 2232.26
End time: 2519.20
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  fascinating. I want to get more of your subjective points of view, especially about the field of  vision, things like that field of view. We're going to take a little break. Jason Snell  has tried it on and we're talking about Vision Pro. Last week, Jason, just FYI, we debated whether  anybody buy this. And so we're not going to talk about that. We did that. Yeah. And I think the  jury's out on that point, right? I don't know. We don't know. Or even what this is, because I  think there's a lot of things that could change in the next six to eight months, but we at least  know what they showed. And the other thing, and I had said this before the event was we want to  listen very carefully to how Apple positions it. So I want to go more into that. You started that  conversation. I think that's really interesting. Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.  Would you ever forget to mute yourself on Zoom and then, I don't know, say or do something your  coworkers probably don't want to hear? Yeah, you probably have. Using the internet without  ExpressVPN is like that. You're out in the world and you forgot to mute. Yeah, sure. It's just a  bit of harmless banter, but when the boss overhears, well, it could end badly. People need a VPN  for several reasons, but a big one is to protect your privacy. Internet service providers, your  carrier, your home ISP, they know exactly what you're doing, every website you visit,  and they can sell completely legally that information to the data brokers, to ad companies  who then use your data to target you. It's happening all the time. It happens on your TV set.  We were talking over the weekend about what TV streamer to use. The truth is that data,  what shows you're watching for how long and when, and in many TV sets because they have cameras,  whether you're actually in the room, all of that gets sent back to the home office unless  you're using ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN routes your network traffic through a secure encrypted tunnel.  When you do emerge, you emerge with an IP address that's associated with ExpressVPN, not you.  So no one knows what you're up to. Of course, it protects your security when you're at open  Wi-Fi access points. They can't use that Wi-Fi pineapple to attack you. It also lets you have,  you choose your geographic location because you appear on the internet wherever that ExpressVPN  server is, and because they have servers all over the world, that can pretty much be anywhere.  Easy to use, works on iOS, works on Mac, Android, Windows, Linux. You can buy a router from ExpressVPN.  They actually have very good routers with ExpressVPN built in that protects your whole house.  You can, yes, you can put it on your TV in many cases. I mean, it's really a powerful solution.  Very easy to use. You fire it up, you click the button, and it will choose the fastest,  nearest server automatically. I should tell you for your security, and just to reassure you,  ExpressVPN says in their privacy policy, we do know logging. They have that privacy policy vetted  by an independent third party on a regular basis, but they go the extra mile. They've created this  trusted server technology that runs in RAM. It's sandbox, cannot write to the drive, and it's just  for you. So when you open it, that's your server, that's your trusted server running in RAM. When  you close it, it's gone with no trace of you left behind. And as if that weren't enough, they use a  custom Debian distribution on all their servers that wipes the drive and starts over every reboot  every single day. Again, all of that has been verified by independent third parties. It's fast  because they invest in the network fast enough that you can watch HD streams from anywhere in  the world. They're all over the world. As you see, 94 countries. CNET and TechRadar, both  ExpressVPN. Number one, it's the only one I use. It works everywhere. This is the way. Protect your  online privacy by visiting expressvpn.com slash macbreak. When you do that, you'll get an extra  three months with a one-year package. Brings it down below seven bucks a month. And you do want  to pay because they invest it back into the infrastructure, into speed, into rotating IP  addresses, all the things you want from the best VPN there is expressvpn.com slash macbreak.  Try it today. And when you do, please use that address so they know you saw it. They know that  you saw it here. I even wonder, Jason, if Apple's thinking this form factor, we're not tied to this

Start time: 2519.30
End time: 2615.02
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  form factor, right? Oh yeah. I'm a firm believer. I know we've said this because we've been talking  about this product for six months or a year before we even knew what it was. One of the things that  I really do believe is that Apple is playing a long game, an extremely long game here. And like  this one, like you said, Leo, it's kind of the concept car they're going to put on sale, but it's  going to sell in small numbers for a high price, but they're going to learn a lot. And I think  that within Apple, I just get the sense that they are going to do kind of what they did with the  Apple watch and say, we're going to learn how people use it and what people want and what turns  people off. And what expensive piece of hardware have we built into this thing, anticipating that  people would use it and then it is not used and we can just dump it because we've reconceived of  this. And then I would be very surprised if in four years or five years, the vision OS category,  whatever it looks like at Apple doesn't look remarkably different than this. Cause this is  the product of Apple internally. And remember they don't do market research and stuff like that.  It's Apple all in black boxes inside Cupertino spending five years envisioning this product.  And now it meets the real world. Now the fun begins. Right. And I think that people,  even people inside Apple who are like, I don't know about this feature. I'm not so sure. Pick  your favorite, pick your least favorite feature, whether it's the eyesight or it's the digital  persona or something else. And undoubtedly there were disagreements, right. And then this is where  reality hits the product. And somebody inside Cupertino is going to be like, ah, I told you so.  And things will change. Yeah. This is Apple's horse designed by a committee. It really is. Andy,

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  absolutely true. I think this, I think Jason was absolutely 100% correct. If this is like,  even with the, even with the iPhone as revolutionary as it was, they had to deal  with the fact that, okay, we know, we know how to make this thing fail hard. Let's not do any of  those things. Whereas this is, there is no market for this. We are really free to decide an,  an absolutely optimal product because as I, I'm sort of disappointed by a lot of the conversation  about saying, oh yeah, but that's, they said, they said that they, that the iPhone would never sell.  They never said, said, okay, well the, what people need to understand is that at the time,  in the months before the iPhone launched, there had been 830 million cell phones sold in history.  Whereas today there are 65, only 65 million users of AR, not just like people who have bought these,  just people that are considered by market analysts to have used it. That means that as we've been  saying all along, we don't know exactly what people are going to use this for, but that,  if Apple, Apple is the one of those few companies that has the ability to treat this like an  opportunity that says, look, we can, we can, we can basically do the chess move where we keep our  finger on the, on the piece. See, we haven't gone yet. We haven't moved yet. It doesn't count  because they know they have five years to really figure out like what are people are  even marginally interested in buying. So they really have five years. I know they can afford,

So they're  going to give them all the rope they need for this. But Andy, I agree with Andy. I think also that  some markets will present itself fairly quickly. I've already heard from several people who went  through that demo experience like me, who said they think that 3d movies and immersive video at  sporting events and concerts and things like that will sell headsets on its own. Plus you talk about  you go to an event and wear it or people wear it at home. No, you wear it at home and you're there  and you're completely immersed like, like a sporting event or a concert. And then also the  travel like road warrior kind of thing where you're like, you're in hotels and you can bring,  you've essentially got an iPad with you with a giant screen. And if you open up a Mac,  now the Mac is controlling it too. You can have multiple windows up and all of those things. Like  will somebody want to work eight hours on this thing? I don't know. I mean, honestly,  you were half an hour and half an hour worse in any way. No, no, it hurt from the beginning  till the end. But that was just, like I said, I kept adjusting it and it just was right here.  So it didn't get worse. I think that's a positive that it didn't get worse, but I did not have a  good fit. Anyway, I think there will be some markets that we will be surprised by where  somebody will be like, well, wait a second. I'll just, I'll just buy it to watch those movies.

Transcript:  This was a conversation that I had with some people last week, which is there's probably a price  between watching it on TV and buying a Taylor Swift ticket that gets you the immersive Taylor  Swift concert experience after the fact on the headset in 3D. It's a lot like the Quest. It  sounds good, but it's speakers right over your ears. So if you were really wanting to block out  the world or have the best sound, you would pair it with some, some AirPods, but it, it,  can you know, again, yes you can. But philosophically, again, what Apple wanted to show is  you're hearing the world around you and you're seeing the world around you. They didn't want to  isolate you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. They want to have both of those things going in there,  but you totally can do that and put in some AirPods and have it be noise canceling and

Start time: 2862.80

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  completely immersive that way too. Sure. Yeah. And I think that, I think there's probably going  to be a version of this that is the form factor that we see now for quite some time. And it's  going, there'll be other versions that are lighter, other versions that are less expensive,  that'll all come out, but this is the pro version. This is like the cheese grater.  And this is going to continue to be there because they're not going to be able to,  they're just going to keep increasing their performance. They're going to create,  they're going to probably get a little lighter. I'm guessing that within two or three versions,  you'll see it be 25% lighter, but not significantly less. And then there'll be a light version.  There'll be an A-bar version. There might be, you know, all these other things that they've done  with everything else that they do. But there is a, I think there's people who are going to want to  have the higher performance. I mean, this is good performance. It's not incredible performance for  a headset. It's the best performance in a publicly available headset, but getting to six to eight K  per eye, 120 frames per second is going to be probably within two versions of this.  And at that point, it's pretty compelling. And the people who use that one aren't going to want to  use the little ones. So I don't think that, and I think that what Apple did that the other companies  haven't done is take away the cost constraint. There was so many conversations related to these  headsets of how do we make it $300 or $500 or $1,500 or whatever it is. And they take things out.  And they also aren't chip designers. So they weren't able to, you know, do it at the level  that Apple was doing it at. And so I don't think Apple has to go crazy. And this one, I think,  is still going to sell again next year. They'll sell as many as they can make. I don't think that

Start time: 2959.18
End time: 2976.09
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  They said, I think I found the original article, but they basically, there was an analyst that  was saying that Sony will probably not, the number of screens they will be able to ship in  any one year is in the hundreds of thousands, not close to the million. So that will be probably the  big limiter on how many of these they can sell. Yeah. 900,000 a year, according to display daily.

Start time: 2978.26
End time: 2982.25
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  And so that's, if Apple bought every single one, that's 450,000 a year at this point. And I mean,

Start time: 2986.44
End time: 2993.58
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  honestly, this is 100,000, 200,000. The story is also from the elect that Apple  asked them to be able to make more. And so he said, no.

Start time: 2995.52
End time: 3053.00
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know, Apple gets what it wants eventually, but this is one of those things  where how do you create a market for a display like this? Well, one, you do this, you make a  product that requires it and you go from there and Apple and Sony will either be good partners or  Apple. You know, it wouldn't surprise me if we're reading that story that Apple has already got a  different partner for a future version. And they're, and you know, it is, Apple is not likely to be  denied, but because they've got all the money and they'll find a way. But yeah, I would imagine this  thing is going to be supply constraint. Honestly, that may be one of the reasons it costs what it  does. Not just that it's made out of extremely expensive components, but because you know,  if they know how many they're going to be able to get, you should price it. So,  you know, you, you limit demand, right? Because you can't sell, they could price it for 2000.  And that would be great. And they can sell 2 million of them, but they can't make 2 million  of them. So why would you price it that way? Yeah, exactly. I think that they will,

Start time: 3053.28
End time: 3088.78
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  they would sell the exactly the same number next year at 3,500 or at a thousand, because  at 3,500, they're still going to max out the number of the number that they can make. And so to your  point, you know, I think that that was a better situation for them. And I think it also gives  them some cover like, Hey, we're making, we're selling them as fast as we can make them.  Oh yeah. They'll say that on the analyst call, right? We were, we sold out.  We were doing the best we can. It's a new, it's a new vertical and we're still working out some of  the kinks, but we're selling every one that we make. And that's, you know, for an analyst call,  that's pretty, it's pretty good signal. It's expected they'll make a hundred thousand. Sony says

Start time: 3089.28
End time: 3115.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  we can make 800,000 screens a year. That's 400,000 devices at max a year. If they buy all of Sony's  supply, um, 50,000 to a hundred thousand 50, so 50,000 to a hundred thousand devices per quarter,  according to the elect. So a hundred thousand is not unreasonable amount. It's not enough to move  the needle. I mean, this really is a developer tool. Well, that's when Andy mentioned pro,

Start time: 3115.76

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  one of the, one of the pros that are going to be using this product, Andy and Alex both touched on  it. It's developers, right? Like the, one of the things that's happened. And I know David Smith,  who's an iOS developer, wrote a really nice essay this week about, um, about why he's very  excited about developing for this platform. It is, you know, if, if this is going to be big,  eventually one of the things that Apple has as an advantage is the app store and it's app developers  and people who are familiar with its platforms developing software for it. And I would imagine  that a lot of the sales of this thing, there will be a developer edition. Apparently this is something  that's come out that there will be a developer kit that will be available to approved. They'll need  to do that because they want to reserve a certain number and make sure developers get them. Absolutely.  Yeah. So they are going to ship some of these hardware, whether it's the final or a semi-final  version. I think that later this year, developers will be able to ask Apple and they'll look at  their track record and then they'll approve them individually and someone will come to the house.  And who knows how that will work. So Halide will get one. That's what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah.  I think David Smith will get one right for his now that he's written that essay and he's proven  himself with with Widget Smith and a bunch of other, his popular apps. I think he will do it,  but that's the other role this product plays is it is going to get this in the hands of developers  to write the software. And now's the time to stop complaining about the store and start saying how  great Apple is if you want to get your tip. Yeah. It'll be a year or two before they complain about  the vision OS app store and what the rules are there. And the interesting thing is, is that it

Start time: 3208.28
End time: 3250.12
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  is, you know, for developers, it's a pretty, it's pretty green field because you're going to have a  bunch of people who, let's say tens or hundreds of thousands of people who had the money to buy a  $3,500 headset and we'll buy most of the apps that are developed for us just to see what's going on.  Yeah. You know, like they're just going to be doing research. They just want to see what's going on.  They want to see the next thing. And so for a developer, you know, to push into that market,  the risk is actually lower than it seems, just because you have people with money that are ready  to spend money and, and neat and want to know if there are other developers, if they're going to  want to see how everybody's doing everything. You can almost guarantee you'll sell 50,000 units  for sure. At some point. Yeah. If you write it reasonably well, if you follow the guidelines and

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  yes, everybody is pretty good. So I guess really I've been asking the, I've been saying the wrong  thing and asking the wrong question. It's not really what the public reception for this is at all. Not  yet. It's how much Apple's willing, how, how long Apple's willing to go, how many years,  how many versions are they willing to develop to get it to the point where people do want it?

You know,  it's another place to be to do your work. And, and I think that, and you know, do work,  do everything you're doing. You know, it's not, it's not a place to play games or a place to  disappear. You're going to, you know, a lot of people are going to, yeah. And so I think that  they're, they're looking at that as a, you know, if you look back at the 1.2 million iPhones that  were sold, that was a good start. Right. Compared to what they, what they did now, what they do now.

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Leo, I think it would take a complete rejection of the product, right? Like if they can't find a  market for it, if everybody, like nobody buys it and everybody looks at it and says, this isn't  good for watching sports. It isn't good for watching movies. It isn't good for doing video  conference. Like if there is a complete utter rejection of it, that people just like all their  assumptions were wrong. I could see a scenario where they walk away in a few years, but I think  it feels to me like it's going to take years to even find out if that's true. So they're in,  they're not going to walk. They're not after doing seven years of work on this, they're not going to  walk away in the short run. I think it's going to take an extended belly flop for them to get there.  And honestly, I think it might take so long because I really do believe that in the back of their  minds, what they're thinking is eventually we're going to get glasses. People can wear out in the  world that augment reality. And that's the prize at the end of this. It's kind of like waiting for

Transcript:  It's going to be big when it happens though. I wonder if the other thing that might happen is  if the vision transmogrifies, I mean, spatial, I'm kind of of the opinion that there isn't really a  market for a computer you strap to your face, that that's really not the form factor anybody wants.  So I'm wondering though, maybe you could, maybe spatial computing could be expressed  in some other form. Maybe you could project screens without wearing it, project them,  and I could still use the gestures in the eye. There might be other forms that you could do  without having this strapped to your face, which I don't really, and maybe it's just me because I  just have a visceral reaction every time I do this. I just don't like it. I had a conversation

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  last week with somebody who said the exact same thing, Leo, the idea that what if this tech has  other ramifications that we haven't really talked about? I'll just throw one out there. What if you  had a big screen in front of your Mac and it had a sensor display on it and that you were able to  actually move the windows and gesture and scroll and do all sorts of stuff with your hands instead  of using a track pad? That would be interesting, right? And they have the technology to do that.

Transcript:  They bought the company that does that. What was the name of that thing? I had it. I still have it  somewhere. A little brick you'd put in front of your computer and you could gesture with it.  And then they bought the company. So they own this technology. Or a Tom Cruise and Minority Report  where he's going like this and he's got the screens. I think it's just as likely-

Transcript:  Yeah. I'm still on the fence on that term. I don't know how much this is. I'm very,  very impressed with- especially after watching all the videos from Developer Week about how well  they've thought out the idea of what does an interface that exists in three dimensions look  like. I've seen this from Apple in a way that I haven't seen from any other maker. Nonetheless,  they are the king of spin. They are the kings of managing perception.  And I'm trying to figure out if they're just trying to bamboozle people into thinking that,  no, no, no, we're not competing with anybody because they're just doing virtual screens.  We're doing an entirely new paradigm for computing. And you don't want to be fooled.  You don't want to be a boob. Well, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't think they're competing.

Although his vision, he said, we're all about connecting people. I'm like,  really? Also in the end, Facebook's like, we have values. And I'm like,  really? Facebook, you have values and you're about connecting people. I mean, Apple's whole  presentation was actually about being present in the world and not cutting yourself off by default.  But what Mark Zuckerberg means is we think that you should be little Memoji teeter totter action  figures in a virtual meeting somewhere in a virtual office. And their visions are very different.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  initially, I'd say the good news is there's no kind of magical solution that they have to any  of the constraints on the laws of physics that our teams haven't already explored and thought of.  There you have it. They went with a higher resolution display. And between that and all  the technology they put in there to power it, it cost seven times more than our low end product  that we just pre-announced. Our cheap product. And that requires so much energy. You need a battery  and a wire attached to it to use it. They made that design trade-off and it might make sense  for the cases they're going for. But look, I think that their announcement really showcases  the difference in the values and the vision that our companies bring to this. You know, that's fine  though. I mean, you should compete if this category is going to succeed.

And he compares it to the hastily  pre-announced Quest 3 rather than their pro product, which was originally $1,500, which is,  I'll grant you half. I will say my friend, Mike Hurley, who I do a podcast with every week,  he tried it. He also owns a Quest Pro and has used it extensively, including in meetings.  And he said, you know, it's not just two or three times better than the Quest Pro. It's like 10  times better than the Quest Pro. Well, it has to be. That's the old story is that I can't remember

Transcript:  move. The issue is also is that when you talk about your employees, one of the reasons you  got to keep on pumping up your employees is that employees, you know, it doesn't really matter how  many headsets they work on. It's how cool the project is, especially for programmers and  developers. And I guarantee that everybody at Meta working on Oculus is looking at the schedule on  their stock options. They're just looking at like, am I in year three or am I in year four? Am I in  year one? When is the, you know, what's the quarterly, you know, because, you know, Apple's  going to, if this, as this starts to turn, Apple's going to turn into a huge Hoover machine looking  for the best developers and they're going to start poaching everybody. There's another angle on it,

Start time: 3793.04
End time: 3806.46
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  which is that arguably Meta's vision has failed, that this is not a success. And I mean, I don't  think it is. And I bought them and I bought the first Oculus Rift, the one that was on the

Start time: 3806.58
End time: 3869.24
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  Kickstarter. I bought pretty much all of them. This is very much a Facebook sort of perspective  where they're not a hardware company. Their hardware exists to get you into using their  service. So their perspective is going to be, let's make this as affordable as possible so that as  many people can get these as they can. So that once they get, once they learn that, oh, I've got all  my core friends are basically getting together in this Facebook VR sort of thing, Meta VR,  Hey, I want to get on that too. So it's, and it's the, we're doing it collectively, not just the  people in this conversation, but we're doing, we're doing this reaction, which is a very American  thing where there's a winner and then everyone else are losers. It's going to be very, very possible  that it could be just like the phone market where there's the iPhone and then there are people for  whom the iPhone is, and other thousand dollar smartphones are dramatic overkill for what they  want to do with it. And they're going to be the ones who buy the $400, $500 headsets because they  just want to game or they just want to have these entertainment experiences. So there could be a lot  of different interpretations of this. This is why the next five years are going to be so interesting.

Transcript:  Well, and it's, and it's so important for Apple for that to exist because that is what's kept  Apple out of an enormous amount of trouble up until now is Android. Android has been a gift to  Apple, even though Steve Jobs took it really badly. Android is a huge gift to Apple because it, it,  it really blunts a lot of the antitrust stuff because they, there is another market that is  actually bigger than, than Apple's market. And so, so I think that, that it, it is, it's very  important for Apple for those others to succeed, for Facebook and others to, or Meta and others to  succeed. I think that it is, but I, you know, I, I do think that it's going to be something like,  you know, when it, the hard part is, is that this is a real contrast between move fast and break  things and fit and finish. Like, and I think that that, you know, and I think Apple couldn't  come out with anything less than high fit and finish. When they, when they did this, they,  they had to do the Apple version of this and they couldn't put something out early. That said,  they had to put something out eventually because, you know, no plan ever, you know, no plan ever  survives meeting reality. And so they could do as much as they could and show that they can do  something great, but they have to have people interact with it, have them see it. And so,  and they don't, I don't think that they need more than a couple of hundred thousand people to buy  it for the first couple of years. I don't think this is, yeah, I definitely don't think this is  the product that they envisioned when they, seven years ago, when they started it. I think this is  the product that, that they knew they could get to probably five years ago. I think, you know, like,

Transcript:  I think the essential thing was making sure they got developers on board as quickly as possible.  And that wasn't just getting the hardware out. That's showing off what they did last week,  which is just my goodness. I mean, I've written just a handful of Swift apps, but it got me,  and just basically test apps, just to get used to like writing an iPad apps and thinking that,  I mean, I was watching videos thinking that, gee, I don't think it would take me more than a day  to adapt like the three apps that I built like for VR and not just this lame, oh, instead of having  an iPad app, now you've got the, the, you've got the ornaments that are hanging from the bottom.  Like, no, I could see how well, if I wanted to, if I wanted to actually add this feature that I  thought was kind of interesting, I don't think it would be, it would take very long because I  already know the Swift, I already know this app, this app is already running on iPad. And they've  seemed to have outlined very, very easily how the skills that I already have are easily transferable  to basically enhancing these things. That was part of the most powerful part of last week's  announcements was just simply convincing even people like me that who are not professional  developers that, Hey, look, creating really good VR apps is accessible to you and get you excited

Go on over and there goes John Ashley. We lost him. Our show today. Oh, I hope you had a good  lunch because what I'm about to do is going to make you very, very hungry. Our show today brought  to you by HelloFresh. Oh man, I love our HelloFresh box. It takes the work out of eating well.  You can reach your goals. They have a variety of choices like their calorie smart and protein  smart lunch and dinner options. They've got new vegan recipes too, which is awesome.  What I like about HelloFresh is the quality of the ingredients, farm to table quality.  I, you know, it's funny. I, I'm now disappointed when I go to the grocery store. I said, but that  pepper isn't as nice as the HelloFresh pepper was. Those snap peas don't snap.

When we were there,  though, Jason, are you sitting through the computer announcements thinking, we were thinking,  we were sitting here thinking, are they going to, it was almost what an hour and a half in,  are they going to, are they going to do the Vision Pro or whatever they're going to call it? We

I think the fact that they announced a new MacBook Air,  lowered the price on their most popular computer, introduced a new Apple Silicon chip, updated the  Mac Studio and finally ended the Apple Silicon transition with the new Apple Silicon Mac Pro,  and they did that in 13 minutes. I thought, oh yeah, there's going to be a headset. Yeah,

Start time: 4371.38

Start time: 4382.42

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I agree. I mean, not only do we get the map for like the future of their operating systems for  the next year, which is always a big news, but the Mac announcements, which didn't,  they weren't necessary. They just had them ready to go. So I guess they fired them off  in 13 minutes, but like, they're not, like I said, like this is the first appearance of the M2 Ultra.  They finally closed the transition by doing a Mac Pro. They brought back the Mac Studio for M2,  which was an open question about whether that product was going to get updated for M2.  And then I think the most important things they did is they took their most popular product on  the Mac side, the MacBook Air M2, and they cut the price by a hundred dollars, which I did not  have on my bingo card, and did that 15 inch laptop that we've been discussing that's been  in the works for a while now. And Mark Gurman from Bloomberg reported over the weekend that  they had originally planned on that to come out last summer. And they just, they basically  delayed it until now. They wanted to ship it with the 13 and next time they revise these,  they'll probably ship together. But like that 15 inch laptop, it used to cost, it used to cost  $1,200 to get a laptop over 15 inches on the Mac side because you had to get a MacBook Pro.  And most people do not need all the features of a MacBook Pro. And now for $200 more, and it's  actually 100 if they're configured the same way, because that 1099 MacBook Air is like,  it's got two fewer GPUs and it's got the low power power brick. And like it is not,  like it is, it is decontented as the car people say. So it's really like a hundred dollar price  Delta to get the bigger screen. I mean, I think that's the, I honestly think that's the biggest  impact news of the whole week in terms of like immediate real impact is that Apple's bestselling  Mac is a hundred dollars cheaper. And now there's a 15 inch option. Like that's huge. It's huge.

It'll have to be windows on arm, but it runs pretty well on my 13 inch  MacBook Air. I think it'll run just fine on the 15. There is nothing there. I mean, this is big.  And then the PC market, by the way, in including the max has been going down after COVID by  significant amounts and it's hurt HP. It's hurt Intel. It's hurt Dell. So offering a laptop that

Transcript:  makes people's mouth water is probably not a bad idea. I don't know if it's just a laptop either.  I mean, you're talking about a group of computers. Apple is no longer making something that's $60,000  or no longer really making that part of what they're doing. But you're looking at a group  of computers that the value for the, for, except for some specific verticals, for most people,  the money you pay for the power that you get is very high. I think this is a computer very  hard to reproduce on a PC. And that's from $12,000 all the way down to $600. There is  an incredibly great value for desktop. There's an incredibly great value for mobile. So I think that  it's, it's a real, they're really making that environment difficult for a lot of PC manufacturers.

Start time: 4612.58

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I love the Mac studio too. In terms of value, the power of the low end model, which is the,  it's the max chip for $2,000. Like I bought one last year and I'm one model and like, I love it.  And it's very powerful, but, but the power price combination, I think was reasonable. And that  ultra, I think the beauty of the M2 ultra Mac studio really is that it's exactly the same speed  as the Mac pro. Like you don't have to buy a Mac pro and spend that kind of money in order to get  the fastest Mac that Apple makes, which I think is awesome. And then if you need the expansion and  the extra IO, like you can buy a Mac pro and people will, some people who have lots of PCI  cards, they need to put in it. But like everybody else, like you just don't need it. You can just  get the Mac studio and you've got all that CPU and GPU power. Just the same. It's literally,  cause I talked to them about this when I was down there, it's literally identical in terms of  performance and they are not, there's nothing in the Mac pro because they both have enough cooling  that they run unconstrained. There is nothing in the Mac pro that makes it go faster. It's all just

Start time: 4673.92
End time: 4717.84
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  about ports and slots. I love that too. And I love the fact that they're just saying, hey,  if you need the PCI, like I'm a person that is probably going to get one because I need the PCI  in a slot. So I need more, more of the thunderbolts. But if you need eight lanes of Thunderbolt,  you need a bunch of, a bunch of cards for a little bit more money, you can buy that. But otherwise  it's the same. And I think that, I think maybe they learned that a little bit. I think that we're  seeing that with the phone as well, where they're taking, they're not like holding back features  from the smaller version of it. You know, you can get a big version or a small version, but they're  both largely the same. And I think that that, I think we're, you know, I think it's going down,  I think that's the right direction. If you want those extra features, you can pay a little bit  more for them. And there will be people who need them. I mean, we have just stacks and stacks of  the sonic boxes because I don't have anywhere to put a card. So that's what I'm looking forward

Start time: 4717.90
End time: 4732.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to those cards. So you, so that's interesting that the Mac pro is no more performant than the M2  ultra Mac studio with a 24 core CPU, 76 core GPU, but it is a thousand bucks more for the slots.

Start time: 4733.08
End time: 4763.84
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Basically. Yeah. Well, yeah. Cause you got, and then there's some extra ports too,  because there's obviously there's more that the ultra is capable than, than it is on the  Mac studios port grid. But yeah, basically performance wise. Look, what we've learned  with Apple silicon is that a chip is a chip is a chip. I keep saying like literally an M2  in the 15 inch air, the 13 inch air, the iPad pro, the Mac, the Mac mini is the same. They're all  exactly the same in terms of performance. I honestly think that's a chip is a chip.

Start time: 4764.02
End time: 4800.06
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a selling point because you look at the AMD and the Intel product grid, it's baffling.  It's crazy. There's low power for mobile. There's high power for desktop. There's all sorts of,  you know, weird features and it's just, it's very, I mean, it's confusing. I think for  normal consumers, maybe gamers and pro users can figure out what they want, but it really is  straightforward with the Mac. It's like, yeah, here's your choice. I don't feel like my M1  studio is slow though. I have no desire to upgrade at this point. No, I did. So I did a review of

Start time: 4800.20
End time: 4852.12
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  both these systems, which is funny because there's not a lot to say. There's really,  it's other than the M2 ultra, which is a new chip, everything else we've seen before, but even,  even sent, I mean, it's, it's also the same story going from M1 to M2, which is it's incrementally  faster and that's great, but the audience for it is people who are still back on Intel,  who maybe want to change chip classes. If you've got an M1 of anything, you don't really need the  M2 unless like MacBook Air, at least the physical characteristics change, but the Mac studio,  all it is, is a slightly faster chip. So the people who should buy the Mac studio are people  who are on Intel or who bottle up like a MacBook pro, but spend most of it attached to a display.  And maybe the studio would be better or maybe they got a Mac mini and they're like,  ah, maybe I'll go with a little more power and get the Mac studio. But like  M1 to M2 fundamentally, you know, it's only this incremental update.

Mark Gurman says that the next Air isn't going to come until  early next year. So it may really be more of like an 18 month-ish cadence for the chip generations.

Start time: 4903.22

Transcript:  Yeah. So for you, just because of the slots, a pro makes sense.

Start time: 4910.04
End time: 4990.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, you know, being able to put a lot of IO in there is definitely things. That's something  that I do. So we use cards with what we're doing a lot. So being able to put in, you know, I can,  you know, we have, when we want key fill outputs, we want to get a whole bunch of like, for instance,  for zoom ISO, we can take, you know, in the current situation, we can do it with the little ones,  but it's nice to have a box that you could slide in that, Oh, I can have a bunch of storage. I can  have much more RAM. I could also output, you know, 16 zoom ISOs or maybe even eventually 32. You know,  if I was feeding those into some kind of, you know, display system, you know, so I think that  there's a lot of opportunity, you know, for that to expand a lot. So, so I think that it's going to  be, you know, we were already talking about the fact that not the bandwidth wouldn't allow us to  do this with zoom ISO, but at some point it'd be great to be able to push 48, 48 outputs of zoom ISO,  which may seem like a crazy thing to do, but if you're doing, if you're doing an event,  like a hybrid event, you want to put a whole bunch of people on the screen. Right now,  what that was is an army of small laptops with sonnet boxes, you know, that we're all,  and people have done this, having one computer with just a bunch of SDI coming out of the back of it  would be, you know, super useful. And so that, you know, so there'll be people who buy it just

So the Austin facility, the Texas facility is still going to  do final assembly. I don't understand why they say it's a product of Thailand. Does that mean  everything's made in Thailand and they just screw it together in Austin? I think that's probably

Start time: 5067.92
End time: 5115.92
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  You know, I was in a briefing where somebody asked that question and they, they basically said  a non-answer cause they can't talk about future products, but they were very supportive of the  iMac. I think based on Mark Gurman's reporting on this, that the truth is that they just decided  that the M1 iMac was good enough and that they had other products they needed to build and that  they would come back to it with M3. So I think I am a hundred percent confident that there will be  an M3 iMac and that was a bigger screen. I don't know about that. I think, I think they're very  happy with that. And now that they've got the, the studio display, do they need a 27 inch iMac? And  I've, I've, I've heard that there's a debate inside Apple about that. Mark Gurman has reported  that they've talked about building a larger one, but it was not a priority. And given that the 24  inch model wasn't a priority enough that it didn't make it to M2, I would be surprised if

Start time: 5117.10
End time: 5163.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  there were a bigger iMac than the 24. Yeah. They probably have done research or whatever that is  Apple does instead of market research to, and found that the audience for the iMac, the home  audience is really happy with 24. They don't want a bigger screen or the, or the, or the MacBook Air.  So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause so, so Lisa has that, you know, the probably a 5k iMac, the 27  inch, uh, and it's kind of on its last legs. I, I guess I wouldn't replace it. She says, I want  another iMac. I said, honey, it's 24 inches. I think she was screen real estate is important to  her. So I guess she's really going to be a Mac mini with a bigger screen. Yeah. That makes sense.  And it's fine. Who should get a Mac mini versus a studio? Is there a clear demarcation there?

Start time: 5164.74
End time: 5240.20
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  I think there is. Um, I mean, the beauty of those two models is they encompass Apple's entire chip  range. So it's M2, M2 pro, M2 max and M2 ultra. Um, and the truth is, you know, it's going to be  what's it worth to you to have performance, but that is a pretty nice, um, rising amount of power  based on what you want power memory, you know, graphics, all of those things. And then the price  goes up as you go up there. So I think there's something for everybody there. I've talked to  people for whom base Mac mini is all they need. I've talked to people who are like, no, no, that  Mac, the M2 pro is like the sweet spot. It's like, it's a Mac mini, but it's got more power and it  does. It's, it's nice. It's, it's a, basically an M2 max chip with some of the course turned off,  basically. So it's, it's pretty powerful for me because I do a lot of podcasts and video where  I'm doing like denoising and video encoding and stuff like that. For me, the max was the choice  that I thought was like the best fit for me. And if you're a really high end user that has high end  needs, that ultra is Mac pro full on Mac pro power. So like, I think there's a pretty good,  I think with the Mac studio coupled with the mini Apple's got a really nice ramp there that they  didn't use to have where it's like, take your pick compact desktop max. We got them all.

Start time: 5240.46

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. And, and, and I think that it's an, it's the best lineup they've ever had. I mean, they,  they say that all the time, but it's really the cleanest lineup where you have this gradient that  starts at $600 and goes to 12,000. And there is something there that you can just kind of  place into it inside the desktop, inside of the, the, the laptops. And I think it does have  partially have to do with the fact that they are no longer constrained to somebody else's chips.  You know, like they're, they're now, you know, we're, we're, we're seeing this kind of chaotic  start of all these chips in all these different places and they're getting them done as they can  get them done. And I think that it'll settle into, you know, this year we're having, you know,  I think it will settle eventually into the M three is in one year, the M fours and another year.  And everything is very similar all the way through to the phone and the iPad.  And it just really makes them much, much more efficient and it's easier to code for it's easier  to, you know, there's so many things that, that this makes efficient and it makes it again,

Transcript:  And I don't think that, again, I think that there's a vision pro. I think the next one will be the  vision, you know, or there might be even another vision pro before the vision comes out, because  I think that they're, this felt like, I mean, for all the stuff that we know about video production  and video and constraints and so on and so forth, this felt like a great step forward.  That's a huge jump over where, where everybody else is. And like half a step short of what we  know is kind of where a lot of people are going to land, which is the one 26 K or eight K per eye.  And so, so we know that there it's a little short. I think the pro will probably close that gap  either completely or partially on the next version to do that.

Start time: 5355.10

Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  Yeah. I think it's going to be interesting to see if they, if they decide to, if they decide  to plan these things out the same way that they've done, like the Mac books where yes,  they could be making five, six, seven, $800 Mac books. They've decided that they never have to  sell a Mac book for less than a thousand bucks or ideally, and the sweet spot will be 11 or 12.  And that will be the floor for like what the technology is. Or if they decide that  it would behoove them to have a consumption only version of this that costs like that would be like  the iPad version of this where no, it's not really going to be for, yeah, you can use it as a 4k  display for your Mac, but it really isn't for like running its own apps. It really is just for being  in full virtualized experiences. Like Jason said, that they've got three different kinds of like  basic apps that run one of them. This would be not the one that gives you a fully immersive  environment running apps and virtual screens in front of you. This would be only for the kinds  where, Hey, watch this movie in 3d or Hey, play this game in 3d.

Transcript:  I've heard it described that way and people worried about nausea again, like all I can tell you is,  it seems to me that Apple, I mean, they've designed an entire real time operating system layer and a  real time processor in order to make sure that there's very little latency and that I guess the  chip is right on the back of the, of the displays in order to reduce latency there. Like I,  I didn't experience anything that I would say was like a red flag about it. It all seemed really,  really, really good to me. That said, if you're super sensitive, I think the long, in the long  run, you're going to have to go to an Apple store and, and, and try it out to see, but it seemed  like they nailed that experience.

Most people think it's somewhere between,  in the mid nineties. So the mid, so the 96 frame, you know, so most people think that that's where  it becomes hard for most people to distinguish it, but there are definitely like everything else.  There's people who can hear further out. There's people who are more perceptive to those things.  And so, so, but, but what we, what people find is that when they say it feels like real  at a high enough resolution, it's about, it's in that 92, 96, 98 frames. So they're very close  at 120. They're going to, at 120, they're going to be over what most people perceive as,  as real time. There's a lot of idiosyncrasies about 120 frames a second that we're still  trying to work out, but there's, but at that rate, at that frame rate, which is what every monitor  that you have, your phones, everything's kind of moving towards that, that frame rate.  The, you know, that's, that's where we really feel like it, it looks, it feels very fluid,  but again, some people will say that people can perceive it even up to 480 frames a second,  but most people aren't, aren't conscious to it after somewhere in the mid nineties.

Transcript:  I think this is, this is why I was really, really pleased that there were so many people out,  got demos and so like hundred, if, if it's true that hundreds of people got these demos,  that's a very, very wide spectrum. Like Joanna Stern of Wall Street Journal is one of them,  has one of them, had one of the most valuable write-ups and she didn't have a great time with  it. I mean, she didn't, she didn't, like, she wasn't blowing chumps or anything like that,  but she was kind of glad to take it off at the end for exactly that reason. And I'll have to,  I'll have to update my, my knowledge about frame rate. The last time I really looked at like  research papers when they're doing, it was a, there were a couple of studies that did like,  Hey, we're going to be putting a high definition, high frame rate monitor next in one, in some  rooms we're going to be putting a window in other rooms. We're going to see who figures out that  they're looking at a monitor and not, and not at a window. And that magic number was in the  three hundreds, but that's, that could have been a completely different set of, a set of constraints.  It could have been, and also I don't, I don't think if I remember correctly that it wasn't,  they weren't trying to say, well, let's keep reducing the frame rate to see like,  to the level that you're talking about. So I'll have to update my knowledge.

So  you know, it's not necessarily that's, that's why some people are saying you might need 480  frames to be absolutely to hand, hander, but 99% of your perception at 120 frames per second is  handled. And the amount of technical lift to go from 120 to anything higher, the amount of  technical lift to get to 120 is a big deal for everybody right now. So, so I think that it's,  I think that there, a lot of folks are looking at, you know, again, most people think that the,  that that base rate of really people feeling like it's fluid is not in the mid nineties.

That is, that is the, the Ironman triathlon of this kind of technology  where if it's, if it's good enough for two hours, it might absolutely be unbearable for three or four

I will say that  Apple actually suggested in their presentations that you could wear it all day and do work.  And I find that fascinating and it seemed like a wild claim to me. And it makes me think that  there are people at Apple who use it all day and are fine. So, right? Like, and maybe those people  are outliers. I don't know, but I was surprised that they actually seem to say, yeah, that's a  use case. Use it all day for computing. Adam Backer

Transcript:  I mean, it's my job too, but I'll tell you after that 3D experience, if they've got lots of good  3D and immersive content, I would buy one anyway, because I am one of those people who would be  like, oh my God, like I watched, I have watched movies on the meta quest too. And it's, it's  display is terrible, but the 3D movie experience is actually pretty good. And if I could do that,  and then there's their share play, if I have friends who've got it and like, I can see a use  case there. If they do a sports thing, if I can watch a baseball game every week in that immersive  3D environment, it's going to be tough for me to say no to, but it's also my job. So I, the business  will buy it and I'll write it off. Adam Backer

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  Jason Kass Well, that actually, that's, I think that's  an important point. It's absolutely true that these are solitary experiences. I, the movie  watching, the problem with the movie watching thing is that I watch almost every movie I watch  with my wife and we're not going to have two headsets and I'm not going to watch it. So,  right. And so like, how much of this conception is people who are alone? And what are the use  cases? And the truth is, and this is the thing is if I had one, it's more likely I would use it for  work than for pleasure only because I'm sitting at my desk all by myself all day working. And so  if it was a productivity boost for that, you know, I just push my display away and use that instead,  that would be fine. If I could, if it worked for a lot of ifs there, if you're somebody who,  you know, maybe it is when you're watching on a plane or something like that, or I have a friend  who watches most of his TV shows at night in bed after his wife has fallen asleep, right? Like,  it's just a thing. Like I could see scenarios, but you do have to kind of come up with solitary

Start time: 5879.38
End time: 5930.52
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  scenarios for this stuff. And that's weird. I did think that it was interesting that  I suddenly realized, oh my goodness, they did the whole prehistoric thing in 3D. Like when they did  that, I was like, that whole series is all going to be like, they're going to have experiences that  are going to and to go through the amount of expense that it took to make that. If they,  in knowing, knowing what they know now, I suddenly realized a lot of things that they built may have  not necessarily all the video stuff, but a lot of the CG stuff that they've done could potentially  be done in, you know, it could be re-rendered or is already rendered in a stereo environment.  And that we, it is interesting that Apple TV is, is something that because Apple's spending money  on that as well, you know, building stuff for this headset is much more seamless than it is for Meta.  You know, like it, it is, you know, like, oh, we can just shoot this, you know, because you can

Start time: 5936.22
End time: 6079.68
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, so for the, the level that they're doing it at, the real challenge you get into is  that you need a lot of control over the cameras. It's a lot more complicated than putting the  cameras next to each other because you have to manage both the, you have to manage the  interocular distance. That's the distance between the eyes. And then you also have to manage  convergence. So, and that is where the cameras, if they're sitting right butted up against each  other, you can't manage the convergence properly, which means that, because when we look at things,  you know, if you look at something really close, you'll see your cross-eyed because your eyes are  converging on that, on that point. And so the issue is it's not straight out. It is converged on a  piece. And so you have some pretty complex systems. So what we tend to do is we have one camera  looking through a, basically a teleprompter and, you know, a mirrored glass and another one looking  up. And so then you have to build all the gears and so that they all work. It's kind of, it's a  very, you know, you reverse all of those. And so, so now you have these two cameras that are looking  at it and they're in the right place. And now you can manage your focus, your zoom and also your  convergence. And all of that is pretty complicated. Now you can, for 2D, end up delivering just one of  those eyes, left eye typically. But the, but so you can do that, that 2D delivery, which,  what's interesting is Apple's new video format is designed. The MVHVAC is designed to, if you only  have a 2D display and they talk about it a couple of times in their, in their delivery, they want to  make sure that you're going to deliver one eye, you know, when, you know, when you're, when you're  doing those things, if you don't have stereo. So the stereo, it's a big rig, but you have to remember  that we're not shooting live and there's lots of smaller rigs. So there's going to be an experience,  the Canon R5 with its stereo stick, the Canon R5 has a stereo lens. That's 180 that works really,  really well for doing VR. And I think you're going to see a lot of little stuff done that way.  We have to remember that Apple did, you know, so the 180 experiences are a different thing than  movies. And the other thing is, is you have to really decide whether movies are the right thing  for someone to watch because in full VR, lots of cuts and big camera moves is, goes back to what  we were talking about earlier. So frame rate is one thing, moving the camera a lot is another.  You can make people feel pretty sick pretty quickly if you're not careful.

Transcript:  Right. Without wearing it. The virtual movie theater reduces that, right? You actually put it  on a screen and you're in a frame, you can see seats around you, there's a reflection on the  ceiling of the lighting from the, like you do that and it feels okay. But Apple actually built  their own rig to do those 180 immersives, which is interesting, but everybody's going to want to  start exploring with that. It'll be interesting to see how that goes. And then a footnote for  what Alex said is if that sounds complicated and all that, that's why most Hollywood movies are  shot in 2D and then there's a 3D production house that creates a 3D version. It's not as good,  right? It's not really not as good. It's not as good. It's like those 3D comic books we used to  see where there's like, they're just planes of depth instead of it being truly, but if you look  at a movie that shot in proper 3D, it looks amazing. Does it look like this pizza coming out?

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  toppings? And the big question is what they do with these, you know, the big question will be  what do they do with these two lenses that are at the top and do they either computationally match  them or do they actually make another lens here so that the phone can generate 3D? And if the phone  can generate, if you can pick up a phone and go like this, and while this is much closer than  inner ocular distance, the thing to remember is that the hydrogen, the red hydrogen was even closer  than these two lenses are. And so what that, you know, so that whole silliness of, I mean,  not silly, but whole silliness of putting something on to shoot something on a birthday  is less silly if someone just picks up their phone and shoots stereo for the headset,  sends it to their friends and they're able to put that on and feel like they were there is a much  different. It's got to be coming, right? I mean, that's Apple. Apple doesn't announce future products,

Start time: 6195.94

Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  but that was screaming. We are going to do 3D capture on a future iPhone, if not this fall,

Start time: 6201.64
End time: 6261.64
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  the next fall. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it feels like it's going to be such a bummer if they,  you know, being able to have this phone right before the headset comes out and being able to  generate all that content, it feels like a really missed opportunity if it doesn't come out this year,  but it'll definitely, as you said, definitely by next year, you'll see. But you could do it  in this form factor, you think? You could, you could do it in that form factor. You wouldn't  have to put it so that I, again, I shot, or do you put a second camera bump on the other end of the  phone? I would love, I would strongly prefer the second camera further apart because the 3D is  way better, but with computational photography, with the LIDAR, with a lot of other things,  you can, you can, they can do a lot of work on that. That feels pretty good. I think that,  I do think that they might need a fourth sensor only because I think that they're going to want  to have those two sensors. I think it's going to be really hard to make those two sensors work  perfectly together. You really want them to both be the same focal length. The 1X is,  is both of those are the 0.5 or whatever one they pick is there's two of them and they shoot stereo

Start time: 6261.86

Start time: 6276.28
End time: 6325.04
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  I don't think that's terribly silly either because I could, I could see having a native 3D capture  via, via two sensors as part of the pro phone line. But now you're getting into how much would  it cost to have that extra lens array and that extra sensor into every phone that they're expecting  everybody to buy. And are they going to, is that going to be what gets people to say, you know what,  I don't want to buy the pro, I'll buy the normal one. And there's also, and there's also, by the way,  I read another paper about an idea for using camera. Like there's a number of, there's some  actual like, you know, unavoidable jitter, like when you're actually holding a phone and trying  to shoot, there is an idea for an algorithm that would be able to essentially use that jitter to  capture like acceptable 3D from a single lens. I would love to see an AI solution to that. Like

Start time: 6325.04
End time: 6370.78
Speaker: Jason Snell
Transcript:  something that builds a nerve. Don't forget they have the LiDAR sensor on everyone. So they've got  full depth data. They could do a, they could do a fake 3D based on the depth data. They just wouldn't  be capturing sort of like behind the corners for the parallax, but they could definitely do it.  I would say Andy, yeah, I mean, I can imagine them doing a 3D photos display on the iPhone as well.  So the people who don't have a headset can still sort of like do that thing where you, you can kind  of like tilt it a little bit and get that 3D almost lenticular kind of style effect. I could  see them doing that as part of it. And that would be right, because if it's this limited product and  then they put this feature in the iPhone and you're like, well, yeah, but if I don't have that  headset, but if you've got other ways to display it that are like cool enough, you can get away with

Start time: 6371.22
End time: 6404.02
Speaker: Andy Inhatko
Transcript:  it. I think people are going to, I'm sorry, just quickly that I think that this is part of the  halo effect of the, of the vision pro that people are going to be capturing with these $3,500 devices  that they already have all kinds of really cool content that Apple's going to want to figure out  a way to give people on the ground, so to speak, the same experience with their phones that will  get people to think, Oh wow, I could be shooting video like this, or I could get, I could be seeing  this much better than just simply sliding this just like what the, what the Google cardboard used  to be where here's a series of, here's a headset, just slide your phone into the back of it and we

Start time: 6404.18
End time: 6511.74
Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  will fake it for you. Yeah. I think that if they put another lens in, which the hard part is, is that  all the computational stuff looks okay. Even Apple's computational stuff looks okay, you know, and  I think that they want to make sure that that experience on the headset is amazing. And I think  that, and I don't think they'll put it in all the phones. I think this is the pro version.  So you put basically in the pro version is a 3d shooting option and the other versions are not.  So, so I think that that's where you'd put it. You know, the, the, I don't, I couldn't find my  headsets out in the garage. I'm not going to go get it, but what I did is I built, I printed this,  these two pieces. I printed a piece that had, you know, if you think about having the phone here  and after some iterations, I learned, you know, so you have the two, the two here,  what you have to do is line these up. So then I had another one that was like this  and then I had the other phone like that. You rotated it. So I had to rotate it around,  which we're fine. And so I just had a big, that looks pretty funny and goat rock up and up in  Bodega Bay with someone walking around with this rig. People, I got a lot of attention anyway,  but, but I was shooting some stuff here and it worked, it worked exceptionally well.  It, you know, as far as stereo goes, cause I got, these were, when I printed them, I made them in  interocular distance. So they, they, they did what they needed to do. The problem is again,  gets back into the finer things of convergence. So they're both going straight and getting both  cameras to start at the same time was hard because they don't sync together. So you have to kind of  hit them and then you have to find the frame and you would put your hand out in front and snap.  And then you'd go back and everything else. And so it's not, it's, you can jerry-rig it,  but it's, it's not a, but Apple could obviously, I think when I started, when I started playing  with it in stereo, I was like, Oh, this would be really nice. I wonder how many, I wonder if the

Start time: 6518.36

Speaker: Alex Lindsay
Transcript:  or something. I think you have to really decide you're going to do it. I think that they would,  and I think that it's a huge advantage for Apple to own the broadcast rights for MLS.  There is so much every time you start, it is massive. Like that buy, that purchase  makes a ton of sense. Because the thing is, is that being able to say, I mean,  the amount of infrastructure that you have to deal with, with broadcasters, because their job is not  your job. They don't care about you. Like I've done tons of 360 and stereo at concerts at,  you know, these things. And the fact that Apple can say, I have a piece of content  that is paying for itself in some other way. And I can, and I still also control it. So  me saying, I'm going to do an Ed Sheeran show, let's say, and I'm going to pay for it. And it's  going to get distributed on Apple plus comes out of that budget. But, Oh, I have the ability to put  the cameras exactly where I want them because I own the space is massive, you know, for, for Apple  to be able to not have to deal with all the other things that we deal with when we're trying to  shoot these, because people are like, well, you can only put the camera over here and you can only  put, don't, don't put it in the way of here. And people can't see if you put the camera there. All  those things go away with Apple money and Apple infrastructure. And so the ability to generate some  of this content is going to be, it's going to be pretty, they have a much better chance of building  compelling content because they have more control. I'm going to defer a conversation much needed

There is a couple of Apple  TV plus stories though. There is a reason to finally finish watching season one of foundation  because season two is a minute. They've just released the, uh, the, uh, I don't know if I will,  uh, they just released the trailer for the new season, uh, today. Uh, I'm going to stick with,  uh, to be honest with you, uh, the, um, what do they call it? I want to call it a hole,  but it's really silo. I'm going to stick with silo and there is a note, uh, good job. And Pruitt,  he has snagged Hugh Howey, the author of the novels that silos based on, uh, wool. Uh, and so,  uh, he will be on our, for the club members, he will be on a special, uh, club twit, uh, event  on June 29th, 1 PM. So towards the end of this month, Hugh Howey, you see how we  joins Ant Pruitt in conversation. If you're a silo fan or a wolf fan, June 29th at 1 PM,  that's a good reason to join club twit. These are, uh, this is, and as the community manager  there and he's been charged with making it exciting to hang out and club to it. And I think he's done a  really fantastic job. We've got a bunch of events coming up besides that June 29th one, uh, Sean  Powers fireside chat. He's the one of the hosts of floss weekly will be a Thursday at 9 AM, uh,  the fall June 29th, Thursday, uh, the Terraformers Stacey's book club and immediately, not immediately,  but shortly after on the same day, the fireside chat with Hugh Howey and the, uh, booze fueled  inside twit after hours, July 14th, Rod Pyle will do a fireside chat on the 27th. What do you get  with club twit? Let me tell you, you get ad free versions of all of our shows. You get shows that  we don't put out, uh, for anybody, but club twit members like that Hugh Howey interview, uh, hands  on a Mac with Micah Sargent home theater geeks with Scott Wilkinson, hands on windows with Paul  Thurot on title Linux show and go on and on. Uh, those are shows that eventually we hope will become  public like this week in space. It started in the club. The reason we can do that is club members  subsidize it. They, uh, they pay their seven bucks a month. Uh, they also get access to the  discord, which is really fantastic. A great community where you can chat about the shows,  but you can also chat about other topics of interest to our audience, uh, which is a lot of fun.  John is not going to be a booze fueled. You say, no, all right. Well, I,  maybe like 10%, 10%. Okay. Fine. Some of you will be booze fueled.  And is bringing the, uh, if you're not a member, we would sure appreciate it. If you join club  twit, twit.tv slash club twit. I don't know if you've heard, but the podcast advertising  environment has gotten tougher and tougher and tougher. And, uh, we see a time where Spotify,  Ihard, Apple, Amazon will eat up the podcasting space and all the advertising, but we want to keep  doing these shows. I just would like to keep doing this. So, uh, it looks like the way forward  really is going to be club membership. So please twit.tv slash club twit. It's a great way to get  some, a lot of extra content, a lot of extra fun, but also support what we do going forward. Thank  you in advance.

Then, you know, you've got,  you're in good hands, right? A good doctor makes you feel heard, makes you feel at ease,  helps you feel better. But not everybody wants the same kind of doctor. Some people want doctors  that, that are, uh, you know, give you all the options. Some people say, don't I just tell me  what to do doc. I don't have, I can't absorb all of that. Well, you can find the right doctor fast  with Zocdoc. Zocdoc is a free app, the only free app that lets you find and book doctors. But this  is the most important part, who are patient reviewed. So you can see exactly how that doctor  operates from actual patients. Also, you can search for a doctor that takes your insurance.  It has openings when you need them, treats almost every condition under the sun. It's not just  MDs, all cadentists, uh, chiropractors. I was looking for a gerontologist for my mother-in-law.  It's fast. It's easy. You find the person that takes the insurance. No more Dr. Roulette.  And you, by the way, no more going out on the internet and looking for questionable reviews.  These are reviews that are vetted, actual customers, actual patients of the doctors.

Transcript:  If, if, so if you're using mid journey, remember that you can just set AR dash dash AR. And the  only reason I said this is that I had like one, uh, lock screen or two or three lock screens  on my phone. And now I, I don't know what got me into doing it. So, so if you look at this,  let's see here, let me, let me show you. This is like, I'll just show you some examples. I just  started experimenting with it. So here you have like this one, like these little pictures,  little pictures, you know, like this is like, this is all mid journey. All of these are mid  journey. You know, like you have these little, um, uh, I was playing with octopuses for some  reason. This is some more, you know, once, uh, there's, there's my, uh, that's a fit. Then you  have a shark, the shark and these go together, I guess anyway, so, but, but it even does the little  thing where it cuts the little bit of the nose out of the, out of the, um, out of the, uh,  Oh, look at that. So it's below the clock. Yeah. Yeah. So, so it's, uh, and then there's a couple  more of these and the, and what's interesting about it. And then I, I got into these, all these  geeky ones and then my, my, I made some for my wife. Give me a prompt so I can enter it here.  So it's AR. Um, well you just do whatever you want. So what happened was I was getting,  I don't know. Um, Oh, it's just dash dash AR space, nine colon 16, nine colon 16. I'm entering it in

Transcript:  uh, you know, I think that this, you know, a bunch of these, oh, and by the way, this,  to take it one step further, I was experimenting. I haven't gotten working yet, but this is the  little square underneath the, the, that's made by Photoshop. So, so I said, I just, I selected that  area and I said, produce an LCD screen, uh, that, you know, produce an LCD screen inside.  So I use generative AI and Photoshop to put a screen into the, which is easier than trying to  get it to work. This, this was like a macro shot of, um, you know, a Mac overhead macro shot,  steampunk circuit board. And then I gave it, I think I said something like a seven S three,  you know, or, you know, just gave it, you know, gave it some lenses and things. And that's what  I ended up with, you know, and, um, but, uh, here's like, oh, I like, you know, gears and scales. I  love, I love like these little things like this. And so it's, what's, what's interesting about it  is, is of course, it's not just that it's a photo or it feels like a photo. It's that it, it is,  um, it fits. So it's actually building the photo for the aspect ratio that you're, um, you know,  that you're doing. And so it's, you know, and for having fun, like in all of these, if you look at  these, you know, all of these are like, that is a perfectly framed for my phone. They're all,  they're all framed. They're all like, they're composed for that aspect ratio. It's not just  cutting something out of a photo. It is actually being, you know, it's composing the photo,  you know, for the, you know, for the frame that it has, you know, so anyway, it was one of those  things that I, I don't know how I did it or I mean, why I did it at first, but now it's kind of like,  I'm sitting in line somewhere. I'm waiting for something. I'm like, I'm going to wonder what an  octopus would look like under water. So anyway, it's, it, it, I went from having none to maiming  lots and then sending friends, some of them like, Hey, this one, you probably like on your phone,

Transcript:  A very quick one. I I'm a sucker for every single organization outlining note-staking tool that I  ever have never heard of. I just discovered one last week called bike and it's made by the same  guy who did a task paper. So really what I liked about it is really, really clean. It's not like  Omnioutliner, which tries to be, it could be anything you want it to be. If it involves  organizing information, this really is a straightforward outliner. But the payoff for that  is that it's very, very clean, very, very fast. I love that there's little animations that take  you through the outline as you go. Very, very scriptable, very, very workflow-able. And I've  only used it for a week. So it's basically on my radar. But if there are times where I've recommended  Omnioutliner to people, because it is, I think, one of the greatest apps I have ever used since I  was a child. And in terms of this has transformed what I do, outliners kind of do that. I think that  Omnioutliner is kind of the tops in all of that. However, it could be a bit much for some new users.  And so if you're just looking for an outliner that is better than just simply markdown hyphens,  this is worth looking at. It's licensed. You get a three-day free trial, or I think two weeks free  trial if you're downloading it through the App Store. And it's 30 bucks a month. Excuse me,  month. 30 bucks a year. So it's also less expensive than Omnioutliner Pro. Not more expensive than the  basic version, but less expensive than the Omnioutliner Pro. It's a bicycle for your mind.

Yeah, this is a great little tool. Bike  outliner. Bike outliner. Have you ever tried LogSeek? No. Oh, I'm going to recommend this.  I'll give you a little quick recommendation. It's very similar. It's an outliner,  but it stores as markdown on your hard drive. Well, let me open LogSeek and I'll show you how I use it.  It's the same kind of thing. It's not as pretty. You know, you've got the animations, but you,  you know, this is line one. Then you can do it in line two. I'll show you what I did during the  Apple event. I did the outline here and I was able to put in the feature quilts as we're talking,  paste them in and so forth. It's a really, this is not web-based. This is local on my hard drive.  It's an open source project though. So it's free, although I pay, I actually contribute back to it  so that I can do this sync. So it runs on everything I have. Thanks. Yeah. Multi-platform  beyond Apple. Is it also like Linux, Windows, iOS? It's got a very, Android's got a very good  mobile. So that's the, that's the chief advantage to me. You know, I'm very cross-platform, so I  have to be able to use, I can't use anything else. I got to say Ulysses, Ulysses text editor is getting

Transcript:  Libby has, has been picked here before Adam Inks by My Records picked it in 2018.  He was just recycling Andy's pick from 2018, but I'm going to, I'm going to, it's been too long for  me to tell people cause you should know about Libby because it matters for all of you. So Libby  is an iPhone app, iPhone to iPad app that is a front end to overdrive, which is the system that  most public libraries use to let you borrow eBooks. And this is a thing. A lot of people don't even  know that, you know, they're like, Oh, I only read eBooks. My library is irrelevant. It's not. Most  libraries have the support for overdrive, which means you can check out a book. You can get in  line and audio books. I might add. And yes, not only can you check out a book and send it to your  e-reader, but it's got audio books too. And you just, it's an audio book player, full featured  audio book player. So you can play it in the car or when you're taking a walk or wherever you listen  to audio books. The experience in the U S it's actually really great because it's got a send a  Kindle. If you're using a Kindle, I use Kobo e-readers. They work all over the world with Libby  because they, they're integrated with overdrive. They're like a part of it. Yeah. Yeah. My  understanding is that, and they used to be the same company. Kindle, I think integration is only  in the U S so be warned, but if you have a Kobo, Kobo's are awesome. By the way, I got a Kobo is  for Libby. Yeah. And a Sonoma County library card. And the other thing I'll point out is you, even if  you go to your local library and you're disappointed, they don't have overdrive or whatever,  you would be surprised. Check around other libraries in your area. Because for example,  if you're a resident of the state of Massachusetts, you can get a Boston public library card.  If you're a resident of the state of California, you can get a San Francisco public library card.  You may be able to get, and also your library may have reciprocal arrangements with other libraries  that you can put into Libby and search through those and find the book wherever it's available  or available the soonest anyway. And it's got a nice interface where you basically, if, if you're,  you have to get in line, it sends you a push notification when your book is ready. You can  defer if you're like, Oh no, I'm already reading something. You can say, you know, let me know in  20 days. And then you just, you stay at the head of the line, which is really nice. A lot of good  stuff. Great for audio books. Highly recommend. If you are a reader or a listener, your local library  is going to give you access to stuff that you had no idea existed in Libya is Libya is a great way  to do it. So check it out. It's free from overdrive. Very good. I love it. And it has  dramatically increased my, my wife is a librarian. She's always like, you want me to bring you a  paper book home? And I'm like, no, no, I I'm done with that. I've moved on in my life, but now I use  Libby all the time and I'm reading lots of library books on my Kobo. It worked for me. I agree with

And then finally, we're kicking off our  disabilities, our disability or accessibility focused series. So it'll be seven weeks of  talking about disability awareness and etiquette is the first one.

So you'll see us putting  ASL into the, into the show and we're going to be working with captions and working with a lot  of other things. So we're using it as kind of a lab on how to actually produce a show that is  fully accessible, as well as talking about those subject matters. And, you know, it's usually when  we do education, education takes the summer off, the teachers take the summer off. And so we,  so we're moving to accessibility for the next seven weeks.
