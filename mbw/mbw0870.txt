[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Jason Snell's back. Andy Inacos here. Alex Lindsey to Apple says we stopped billions of dollars of fraud in the App Store.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:20.280]   Maybe there's a little subtext there. We'll examine that. TSMC is now completely bought up by Apple. 90% of their capacity for the year.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:28.400]   We'll talk about that and what that portends for June 5th and WWDC. That a lot more coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show we cover the latest news from Apple as we get prepared for
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.400]   WWDC just a few weeks off. All we've got is rumors, cavilles and tremors.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.600]   Mr. Jason Snell visiting from his home in beautiful Marin.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.840]   Do you have a nice time with mom on Mother's Day?
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.960]   I did. It was well for her birthday. She is the unlucky type who has her birthday right around
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.480]   Mother's Day. She always gets the two fur, but it's nice. Yeah, we had a nice time course.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.240]   Apple announced Final Cut as you know, Final Cut and Logic for the iPad on her birthday. Happy
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.600]   birthday, mom. I had to explain to her what those were. Did you have to write a whole bunch of stuff
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.840]   that day? I wrote about 2000 words that day, but it was while she was doing something else.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.720]   So it worked out. I feel like Leah, the log jam is breaking a little bit. This week was a
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.640]   clear the next week for Apple, where I was like, "Let's get some stuff out there that we're not
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.800]   going to spend any time on in June." So that's nice to have a little bit of news, at least.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Yeah. Well, we'll get to that in a moment. Welcome back, Jason. We missed you.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.000]   Thank you. You don't have to talk about the iPad version of Final Cut. We did that for you.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.360]   Thank you. Andy, not go here from WGB,
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.000]   Agent Boston, from his home in New England. Hello there, New England.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.400]   Hey there. Hi there, Hoe there. Yeah. As soon as I saw the news that dropped this morning,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.000]   I was like, "Oh, some product manager probably bought a new shirt or something or new shoes,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.200]   because they were in the keynote up until three days ago. And then, yeah, you know what,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.520]   you got cut. We're going to do you as a press release on Tuesday. Hey, but if you stay in your
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.320]   office, we'll let you do like a day's worth of briefings with the media."
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:32.840]   Also here from the beautiful office hours.global and 090.media. Alex,
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.200]   thanks. Hello, Alex. Good to see you. Good to see you.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.920]   So I'm sorry. Did Apple drop some news this morning? You scared me, Andy.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.880]   A little bit. Yeah, it was more of a flex. They dropped a press release. Actually, there are two
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:56.040]   things. The one that I'll mention is that a press release mentioning, "Hey, we say we prevented over
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.600]   $2 billion worth of fraud on the App Store." Gosh, I wonder if the fact that you can't sideload apps
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.160]   has anything to do with the fact that we're able to prevent people from being victims of fraud in
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.440]   the oil. That's not for me to say, I'm sure. But hey, no, it would be a shame if you would have to
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.360]   let that fraud go through. They also terminated 428,000 developer accounts for potentially
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.800]   fraudulent activity. 105 million fraudulent developer account creations blocked.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:37.480]   282 million fraudulent customer accounts deactivated. And 1.7 million app submissions turned down.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.360]   Some of them is probably not fraudulent, but just exactly the number.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.040]   We don't like about it. So 400,000 app submissions rejected for privacy violations. Okay. 150,000
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.840]   app submissions rejected for spam. Copycats are misleading users. Copycat can include copying
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.080]   software that Apple provides. And nearly 29,000 app submissions rejected for containing hidden
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.760]   or undocumented features. For the most part, I'm sure that's good. Sure. That, by the way,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.560]   does not add up to 1.7 million. There's still more than a million apps that we don't know why they
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.560]   were rejected. And that's kind of the state of the app store. All right, good for you, Apple.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.840]   You're right. It is a little bit of a hey, you know, they are going to have to though this summer,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.160]   they're going to have to do what the EU wants them to do. And the EU, at least, they'll have to
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.520]   offer sideloading, right? I mean, that's not a that's not it's the end of the year, isn't it?
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.680]   Or is it the summer? Yeah, it's the end of the year. Okay.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.400]   But it's not stories or that they're they're building it into the US, but it won't be anything
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.120]   they announced yet. They're just working on it behind the scenes. Yeah, I'm sure they've got crews
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:54.680]   of engineers working around the clock to make sure they've got exactly a compliance without
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.360]   creating a feature that anybody would ever want to bother to actually use. Yep, that takes finesse,
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.760]   and I'm sure they're investing all the manpower. I'll be honest, they should just go ahead and do
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.200]   it because, yes, no matter what they do, people at 99% are just going to keep using the app store.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   Yeah. Most people are not going to sit, you know, and so what are they worried about Epic or
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:20.600]   somebody saying, Hey, it's good. Well, I mean, as the as again, as the advocate for the user,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.800]   I would say that the thing that I'm concerned about is that you have a Facebook or you have
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.000]   somebody else or someone says, we're only going to release stuff on this new one,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.200]   which means that as a user, I now have to jump out if I want to use it. It's large companies going
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.680]   down the path suicide for almost anybody, but the most committed user to something like face.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.760]   Do we really think that Facebook, because keep in mind, Apple is going to make everybody jump
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.880]   through a bunch of hoops and have that dialogue box that comes up that says, if you do this,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.400]   you may die. And then you say, yes, just to get Facebook, I don't, I can see it for maybe for
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.120]   something like steam or the Epic store or something like that, that they might be able to talk people
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.160]   through it. But most people are going to get to that wall and they're going to be like, no,
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.520]   I'm not going to put steam on my iOS devices. That's a good, that's a good example. And I think
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.160]   steam users would probably do that, right? Because they want steam, regardless of what hoop
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.520]   sample provides. Is that a huge detriment to Apple? I mean, is that like, Oh my God,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.400]   this is the end of the world for Apple. If the steam stores on Apple, I guess the biggest hope
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.160]   will be whether they fork it or not. If they just fork it and say, if you're in the EU, you can
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.280]   only, that's that'll devastate the store. And you will never get a much on the side loading.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.520]   If Apple says, well, the EU said we had to do this. And so we'll only do it on EU
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.800]   phones. I don't agree. That'll be the end of it.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.000]   Because once they engineer it and it's known to exist, you've provided a template, I keep thinking
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.320]   about this. And I think the way it works is if they do is something, because that's the story that
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.840]   we've, I think talked about before, that they may be readying this with some very specific system
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.280]   features that basically detect where you're from and only enable it in certain circumstances.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.480]   But I will say, once it happens there, every other regulator can look at that and say,
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.960]   Oh, you've got this thing that you built for the EU. Now you need to turn it on for us.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.600]   And then it's your question is if you buy another another two years.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.360]   Yeah, you do. That's, I mean, you buy another two years in the United States,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.640]   you have a problem because you have a court system, you know, so, so that, you know, that
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.120]   which they, yeah, but I'm just saying that a court system that right now would probably not
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.640]   support doing the regulation that they're trying to do. So, so the, so the, so the, I think it would
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.320]   be probably a pretty uphill battle, you know, in the United States to get it done. And without
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.240]   the United States market, the side loading is kind of dead in the water. I guess I'm still asking
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.760]   though, why bother doing this? Just let it happen because nobody's going to use it.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   Because Apple does not like to be told what to do when it's something that they don't want to do.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.160]   That's catch a little. That's a 10 year old. That's Apple. That's that's the magic of Apple.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.040]   You know, that's, I'm not, I'm not joking about that.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.520]   So they're doing it out of excellence or no other reason.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.800]   I just don't, I don't think so. I think that they're really doing it out of the concerns that
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.960]   I'm putting out, you know, like that. Nobody's going to use it, Alex. If you have that as an
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.200]   option, you're not going to use it. Nobody's going to use it. People, the, it's the tyranny of the
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:15.160]   default. We know this already. People use Microsoft's Edge browser in a great majority of windows.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.720]   People are not going to sideload and a story. The only people will be gamers maybe for Steam.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:28.040]   Even then, that's only because you can't get it otherwise. Right? If Apple would just let
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.560]   everybody put their stuff on the main store, then nobody would use it, a sideloading thing.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.800]   You know, I'd love to see the stats from Google because Google does allow that on Android.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.840]   And I suspect that's a very tiny minority of people use it. Right.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.400]   To Alex's point two, I mean, one thing the EU thing, if it does happen might show is
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.520]   like Apple has said it's a Pandora's box. Well, we'll see. Right? And that could be very interesting
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:02.040]   because it may be that Alex has proven right and that it is a Pandora's box and that nobody else is
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.880]   going to open it. It could also be that Leo has proven right and it turns out to not be that big
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.440]   a deal and Apple is like, oh, I guess we shouldn't be that worried about it. Or maybe, you know,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.360]   maybe we'll be in the future. We have a data point though. We have a data point. We know from
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:20.280]   Android. We know from Google. Yeah. Maybe. I mean, it's a different platform. I mean,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.640]   and so the the it's an even more likely to use sideloading platform. If you ask me,
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.240]   then Apple users, Apple users love their warm, you know, gated community and are, I think,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.840]   even less likely to sideload. So I think if there's no sites, I wonder if we could get some stats on
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.280]   sideloading on Android. I think I think I go just just just just quick, quick sidebar here that the
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   remember that China does not have access to the Google Play Store. So it is a it is a market that
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:55.400]   has huge Android penetration where almost everything is sideloaded from like China only app stores.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.760]   So it's it's I just don't think it'll be that big video. I think I think that Apple is going to
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.760]   is going to limit it to just the countries where they absolutely have to do it. Remember that there
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.920]   was a rumor was just a few weeks ago about Apple reshuffling some fundamental architecture about
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:17.480]   the about back OS to be able to turn features on and off via where based on where the phone is
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.600]   registered or where the phone is actually located or where the where the phone number is registered to.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.120]   So that that does seem like they're trying to make this into a turnkey system where
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.200]   if if a log gets passed on Tuesday, they can comply on Wednesday as opposed to trying to
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.640]   figure out all this holistic stuff and seeing what what's going to bring.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:41.560]   And the thing is what they'll I still think they're just going to fork the EU and then any problem
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.400]   that occurs anybody that gets defrauded anything that goes wrong will be you know,
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.680]   press with more of these there'll be more of these self-serving press releases in the app store.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.200]   But I'm not including the fraud that including the fraud that already happens on the app store.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Yeah. And I think that's my fundamental thing.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   Two years ago, but this is but this this one now it's really a problem.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.440]   Now it's because of that's because of sideloading.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.920]   I think my argument fundamentally though is that they are not a majority holder in the market
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.200]   and the and that the EU probably shouldn't be doing this at all.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.040]   Like you know, it's not it's not their business.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.520]   You can make a philosophical argument.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.640]   Agree. It's 90.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.920]   It's 90% of the market.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.160]   For a really practical point of view, it's meaningless in the long run.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.080]   And Apple should stop being petulant and say fine, whatever you want.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.280]   I don't think it's not going to change the right to do what it's doing unless it does.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.760]   And I don't think Apple has the requirement to do any more than they have to because it's a dumb idea.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   You know, like it's a dumb it's it's dumb to.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.720]   Let's really disagree.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.920]   I think it's meaningless.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.720]   It's wrong. It's not it's not dumb. It's wrong.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.920]   You know, that's that's that's that's the 10 year old one of you like,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.880]   Oh, I'm not going to do this in your wrong philosophically,
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.680]   whether it's meaningful practically is to me more.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.640]   When someone tells me to do something that I think is wrong,
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.120]   I do with a minimum requirement, minimum effort.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.720]   MVP is if you tell me that I that I should do something that I think is wrong,
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.280]   there's another phrase that's called malicious compliance.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.840]   Yeah. I've done that since I was, you know, younger than 10.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.680]   Yeah, that's what that's what teenagers do.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.760]   But you don't know, you know, everybody does.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.400]   I mean, that's almost everybody does when they're forced to do something.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.360]   They don't think it's a good idea.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.280]   You'll you'll meet everybody does that.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.960]   Like all the time is minimum minimum requirement.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.320]   When you're forced to do something that you this that is something you don't want to do,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.760]   but but sometimes you are wrong.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.680]   It's I'm not you, not you specifically.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.840]   I'm saying that there are people who like, you know what?
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.120]   We have small small claims court said that you definitely owe me $680 to repair
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.840]   this dent that you put in my car with my my security camera saw you do as my next door neighbor.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.760]   So guess what? You're going to come by and you're going to give me 68,000 pennies,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.840]   like in bags dumped on my driveway.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.600]   Like that doesn't mean you're right.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.520]   That means that you're being a jerk about it.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.040]   That means that it's what you have to accept this reality and say that, okay,
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.000]   this is the world that I live in.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.880]   I fought the good fight.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.720]   And now we have to now.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.840]   We have to be the best of what we have.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.000]   And the EU has standing.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.760]   I mean, let's face it.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.000]   Right.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.040]   So they have standing.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:06.840]   So they can say that.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.160]   They Apple can say that.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.080]   I mean, the EU can say that.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.000]   And Apple can be philosophically saying, we don't think you should be able to do that.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.840]   And we're not going to give you any more than you asked for.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.440]   And I think that's what Apple's going to do.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.200]   I don't doubt that in the least.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.320]   And it's what I would do.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.720]   But we'll see what makes any difference.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.480]   Absolutely give you the one, not one millimeter more than what you asked for.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.080]   Apple also launched new concert discovery features on Apple, Apple Music and Apple Maps.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.640]   So now you can look at the map and see a concert near you.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.600]   This is, they already had this in the Photos app.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.080]   If you look at your historic photos, if you've been to any concerts,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   they actually have this built in where they know the location and they know the time.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.640]   And they actually have that database of live events.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.000]   And they will say, this is the so-and-so concert at this event.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.240]   It's pretty, the first time you see it, you're like, whoa, how does it know?
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.760]   And they're trying to extend that, which is smart, extend that to other places.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.920]   This is a very small thing to announce.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.440]   I wonder what, like, I guess this was part of their--
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.720]   This is keynote stuff, right?
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.680]   And then--
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.880]   Turn OS cycle and they need to make good on it before the next OS cycle begins.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.720]   This is an old thing though.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.240]   I mean, I remember many social networks, probably Apple's own ping network doing this kind of
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.080]   thing, Spotify and other music playing things.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.200]   We'll say, oh, I see you like Sam Brown.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.800]   He's going to be performing down the road.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.680]   I've-- so I guess it's good to incorporate in Zappal Music and Apple Maps.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.440]   I mean, I've used bands in town to do the same thing.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.320]   Yeah, bands in town.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:33.800]   That's it.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.040]   That's been around for decades.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.760]   But it's hard to figure out--
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   No, here's the thing that this solves is that bands in town doesn't give you a map.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:49.960]   At least that I knew of.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.760]   Literally, when I travel, I'm going to be like, I wonder if Code the Wet's Rocket is playing
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.120]   somewhere nearby or something like that and be able to see that.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.000]   That'd be awesome.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Bands in town has been doing it since 2007.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.720]   So it's-- anyway, it's good.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.080]   Yeah, it's built into the iPhone.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.760]   It's great.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.560]   That's fine.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.200]   B.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:08.840]   Woo-hoo.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.520]   Do you think this is--
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.120]   These are all things that Apple was going to announce at WWDC or--
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.760]   I don't know if that one would have raised high enough to end up in WWDC.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.600]   Here's one that's actually timely, which it was Accessibility Day.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.920]   When is Accessibility Day?
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.400]   Today.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:25.880]   Today.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.280]   I'll leave.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.560]   Happy Accessibility Day.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:35.240]   Apple in celebration or commemoration introduces new features for cognitive accessibility,
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.120]   along with live speech, personal voice, and point and speak in magnifier.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.320]   What's the cognitive one?
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.200]   That's interesting.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   Yeah, so there's like--
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.360]   So they've done this for the last--
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.400]   They definitely did it last year.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.600]   I think they've done it for the last few.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.360]   And essentially, what's interesting about it is they are pulling forward features from the
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.840]   next OS cycle that they're going to announce in June.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.320]   But they're pulling these forward to highlight,
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.240]   and they're not going to be the only accessibility features,
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.280]   but they like to pull some highlights forward because Apple
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.160]   has talked a lot about being committed to accessibility features.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.360]   So for this day, they decided to do this again.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.440]   And you have a cognitive one.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.920]   It sounds like there are a lot of things that are like being able to react with a basic emoji
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.480]   set if you can't use the typing system.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.960]   They've tried to do-- there's a lot of stuff in here.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   It's like a simplified launcher where you can set a certain limited number of apps with big buttons
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.400]   to basically make it so that there aren't multiple layers of interface,
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.440]   that everything's sort of on a single layer of interface.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.680]   And the argument there is that may be for very young or very old people who cannot--
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   Yes, Samsung has long offered on its Android devices and easy mode.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.360]   That is big, simple.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.560]   And of course, there's been phones for seniors for years like the jitterbug,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.720]   that have big buttons and things like this.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.680]   This is what Apple says, "Assistive access uses innovations in design to distill apps and
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.960]   experiences to their essential features in order to lighten cognitive load,
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.600]   the feature reflects feedback from people with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.720]   focusing on activities they enjoy and that are foundational to iPhone and iPad connecting
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.600]   with loved ones capturing enjoying photos and listening to music.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.200]   My mom who's 90 and is cognitively slowing down her memories really gone.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.960]   That's the first thing to go to a short term memory.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:29.640]   I had already digitized all the family slides and I made a slideshow on her Amazon Echo.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.520]   She loves it.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.360]   That's exactly the kind of thing.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.200]   She wants to see slides from the good old days.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.160]   And that's the kind of thing Apple's doing.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.080]   Here's some pictures of this simplified interface, the photos interface.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.960]   Very simple.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.800]   I actually like that interface.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.160]   Yeah, I mean, not all of us.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.680]   We are all suffering from cognitive overload, to be honest.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.600]   I got really relaxed just looking at it.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.240]   Isn't that pretty?
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.280]   The pictures they chose?
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.080]   I don't know.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.640]   Nice.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.160]   And then here's the camera.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.760]   It's got a big button that says, "Take photo."
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.520]   That's good.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.160]   Don't see any problem with that.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.800]   Here's a common--
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.640]   You can see an accessibility feature that says, "Never let any app"
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.120]   "sides wipe."
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.480]   Well, so I'm looking at that and I'm wondering what the UI is for this photo.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.160]   I guess you could just scroll up and down, right?
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.120]   I think that's it.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.600]   They said specifically, they're trying to get rid of lots of hierarchy because,
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.840]   apparently, big surprise, hierarchy is a little bit confusing for all of us.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.400]   Not just people with cognitive disabilities.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.840]   And if you live long enough, you're going to need accessibility features, right?
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.800]   That's the bottom line.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.560]   And you don't-- I mean, accessibility features are some of the best features.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.520]   Absolutely.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.080]   That's great.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.480]   Absolutely.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.360]   We all will.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.480]   Here's-- this is fun.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.880]   I love the-- this is to dispel the notion that people with cognitive issues
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.520]   are somehow boring slugs.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.480]   Dance party.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.200]   Dance party.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.400]   Dance party, baby.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.200]   And it's very simple.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.520]   It's got a play button and a pause button.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.200]   And it just puts dance music on.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.240]   And you know what?
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.920]   That actually-- my mom would love that.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.720]   Here's a simplified emoji list with big, big, big, big ones.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   So mom can just-- you know, I will do this for my mom for sure.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.600]   I think this is great.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.600]   That's a great idea.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.040]   This--
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.440]   Go ahead.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.400]   No, I was going to say that they also had this feature that they actually specifically
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.000]   said was of use for ALS, although I'm sure there are other uses for it.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.640]   But it's such a cool idea, which is that they will let you build a voice.
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:27.960]   It's a computer text-to-speech voice, but it builds on device using an algorithm on device.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.080]   They interview you.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.560]   You basically have to say a bunch of words.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.680]   So you can't use a canned voice of somebody else,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.000]   because it's asking for very specific words.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.640]   And that's their way to sort of make sure that you've got approval for using the voice.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.520]   But the idea here is that people with some conditions,
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.040]   they lose the ability to speak.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.720]   I was actually thinking about Andy's old friend Roger Ebert,
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.680]   where this happened to him.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.280]   And they tried to build him a voice.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.480]   Technology has gone to the point now where if you know that you're in a situation
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.280]   where you may lose your voice, you can go through this step.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:03.000]   And then after you lose your voice, you can use the speech text feature
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.960]   on your iPhone to communicate and it comes out in your voice.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.600]   I think it's really that I think it's just a cool, amazing feature for people who are
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.120]   potentially in that terrible condition of not being able to speak.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.160]   I actually did this.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.280]   There's a company already doing this called Acapella.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.720]   And it's exactly as you said, Jason, you record
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.400]   a bunch of, it was two for me, it was 215 phrases, things like
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   I'm typing this, so please be patient.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   And then you read all of those and then I have to find the email from them.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.200]   Let me see, because they sent me my voice, because I spent quite a while
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.920]   doing this.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.040]   Let's see.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.000]   MOV, here it is.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.440]   I'm going to go to the website.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.160]   Yeah, no.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.040]   That's one way to prevent abuse, is it actually requires a long time.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.440]   It's a lot.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.080]   Yeah, and you can add what's nice, you can add custom messages.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.560]   I could say, Jason, I need to go to the toilet now.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:11.640]   And then you would have to respond.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.360]   Let me just log in real quickly to my voice.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   It's not perfect, but you know what?
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:22.440]   It is, it's observably your voice, which will, for caretakers,
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.760]   this would make a huge difference.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.400]   Here, let me play a little bit of my, what would you like me to say?
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.680]   Let's try this one, Jason.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.320]   Can you open a window, please?
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.800]   And here's my voice.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.680]   Oh, it generates it and then I have to play it.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.560]   You don't have my sound on.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.520]   Would you like to turn on my sound and we'll try again?
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.040]   Can you open a window, please?
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.400]   That's pretty good.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.800]   Jason, can you open a window, please?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.640]   Okay, Leo, I usually do Mac and not Windows, but I'll do it for you.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:03.400]   So this actually, they have apps on iOS and Android.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.080]   They have a variety of ways.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.920]   So what you would do is you'd record your voice.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.400]   You get three months free access, the acapella move app on iOS and Android,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.480]   or the TD Talk app on iOS.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.880]   So that's basically what Apples do.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.720]   I wonder if Apples' voices will sound better.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.400]   Yeah, I wonder what tech they're using for it.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.320]   And when I saw 15 minutes, I was like, well, where's the 20-hour version?
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.280]   Like, I would love to map it completely and have me just read lots and lots and lots of things
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.320]   to give it what it needs to really map it as opposed.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.120]   I mean, I feel like 15 minutes is great, but for those of us who want to turn it up to 11.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:45.000]   And also just being able to preserve that part of yourself and keep that part of your identity.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.240]   And it's no small thing.
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.360]   Let me play it one more.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.600]   Roger, this is longer.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.200]   Welcome to "Mack Break Weekly" and the show that is full of rumors,
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.640]   cabbles, and tremors.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.000]   That's pretty close.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.520]   I mean, you could tell it's me, right?
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.880]   Did Roger use something like this?
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.320]   No, no.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.400]   Because Stephen Hawking's voice did, it's kind of very mechanical, right?
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:05.960]   And American.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.400]   But also, but this really gets into what we're talking about here.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.600]   Stephen Hawking had the ability to have a much, much better voice model than the one that he was
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.320]   using on his chair.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.560]   It is a very, very old, basic voice model.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.040]   But number one, the voice that it trained it was one of his friends,
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.920]   he ons ago.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.480]   And secondly, he did regard that as his voice.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.120]   He did come to think of it as, well, why would I change my voice?
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.560]   Just like you wouldn't change your voice.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:38.120]   Roger actually, I can't remember which one it was, but he picked up the standard Macintosh
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.600]   voices.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.760]   He picked the one that had the, he said made me sound like Sir Lawrence Olivier.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.440]   And that was like, that that was one of the ones he always stuck to.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.840]   But he had that there was a company in Ireland that was because he was Roger
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:58.680]   Ebert and because he had resources and because also he had, he was a professional broadcaster
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.400]   and he had thousands of hours of recordings of his voice.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.600]   They were able to create a synthetic version of his voice that even 15 years ago was
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.080]   absolutely recognizable as him.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.600]   There was something off about it, of course, but it was definitely recognizably him.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:19.560]   And now, I mean, Google just, Google research just showed off a paper three months ago about
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.880]   a model that requires minimal training.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:27.560]   Like Alex said, there's a, if you have five seconds of voice, it can get something that is,
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.600]   okay, I recognize the identity of this person.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:36.200]   If you can give the model two to five minutes of voice, you can give something that's good enough
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.000]   for phone.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.800]   And if you give them 10 to 15 minutes, then it's probably good enough for ongoing conversation.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.480]   And then the more data you give it, but the thing is you even starting with just five
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.080]   five seconds to a couple of minutes is enough.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.480]   So how many people have voicemails that they've sort of kept on their device?
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:59.640]   We're getting this is something that I really enjoy the thought of about what technology can do
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.360]   that think about when you lose a loved one unexpectedly.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.640]   And our morning, everyone has a different kind of morning process.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.520]   And a lot of our traditions are objectively weird.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:15.720]   Okay. And so if, if I decided that, you know what, I really, I'm missing my mom, something terrible.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.880]   I, but I have a whole bunch of her voicemails to me.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.320]   I'm going to build like a two minute voice model of her so that whenever I ask about the weather,
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.120]   about for my smart speaker, I know it's not her, but I will be, I'll be hearing her voice like
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.000]   every single day. And that'll sort of help me get through this process.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And a year later, I'll switch to something else probably, but this is the sort of,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.480]   these are sort of problems that technology could never have predicted they could solve.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.600]   But now we have the opportunity to see why, where does that fit in our rehabilitation when we lose
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.920]   our voice? Where does this fit when again, we're grieving for a loved one? And these things are
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.720]   not questions that we can actively ask ourselves because we have solutions.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:58.600]   Yeah, I, they've been using 11 labs to do the virtual Leo doctor do in our,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.040]   IRC is mentioning that he had posted something in our massive, which I missed, Dr. Dwayne. I
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:13.800]   apologize about this. But the one that we use from 11 labs isn't, isn't perfect.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:20.280]   I think they're getting better. I really do. Roger used, according to scooter X,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.800]   syraprock.com back. But that was in 2009. Yeah, I actually, I actually wrote him like for the,
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.200]   for his first few months, a piece of software that every time there's something that he wanted
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.560]   it to do, he'd like email me like at 1 a.m. And then I tried to, I tried to get him a rev by like
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.280]   three or four in the morning. And that's, and that's another thing. I mean, these tools that are
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:50.360]   designed to be one, one size fits all, but you have peculiar, in peculiar uses and peculiar needs,
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.000]   some things that you really, really want to be able to say immediately and quickly. I mean,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.400]   again, hanging out with Roger after he lost his voice, part of the adjustment that people around
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.520]   him had to make was that I think everybody who listens to the show understands the idea of,
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.080]   we're waiting for each other to finish their thought and then, but we have something we really
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.400]   want to say. And unfortunately, it was really hard to get those cues from Roger. And I'm not
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.760]   going to keep talking until I'm really tuned into his expressions to see, is there something that
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.760]   he wants the, he wants the focus because he wants to actually type something and say something
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.440]   or write something out and hand the note for someone else to say. These are the things that
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:35.240]   technology should be working on. We shouldn't be gadget watches are nice. And like fake photos of
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:41.480]   squirrels running for Congress also fun. But this is, it's not that these things are wastes of time,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:47.000]   but there are opportunities for technology to fundamentally improve lives and collectively,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.960]   as society, we should never just stand by and let the pitch go by.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:56.760]   Yes, Dr. do says that his partner lost her mom last summer. So he took old videos,
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:03.720]   synthesized them at 11 labs and have her, had her mom's voice read a favorite poem for her.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:11.640]   And apparently it was quite moving. Here's the 11 labs, Leo voice, which I am not moved by.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.240]   Jason, I need to go to the toilet now. Actually, pretty good.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:23.080]   It's got, well, it's got better, it's got better intonation, but does, but sounds less like you,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:29.400]   personally, Jason, I need to go to the toilet now. No, that's me. Okay, just go in the chair.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.160]   That's why it's a bucket seat, Leo. Next week, we'll get you extra diapers.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:42.520]   So this is what Apple is saying about, they call it, live speech and personal voice advanced
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.640]   speech accessibility. With live speech and iPhone, iPad and Mac, users can type what they want to
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:54.680]   say to have it be spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls, as well as in-person conversations.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.920]   So I guess some people have it's easier for them to type than it is to, yeah, I guess that makes
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:06.680]   sense to speak, like Stephen Hawkam. Users can also save commonly used phrases to chime in quickly
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.720]   during lively conversation with family, friends and colleagues. Here's the example. You weren't
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:17.080]   kidding about the view. Or Jason, I need to go to the toilet. Live speech has been designed to
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.480]   support millions of people globally who are unable to speak or have lost their speech over time.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.840]   This is fantastic. I mean, God bless Apple. Well, I mean, this is great.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:30.120]   I think that where I see this going, if enough people sign up for it, is that you get the texts
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.680]   and when it plays out the text, it's in the person's voice.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:38.920]   This is how it starts. A lot of Apple stuff starts with accessibility and then becomes
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.440]   a general feature. So you started off with, "Okay, we're going to do this because there's
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.080]   this is a great place to test it. This is the first people that will need it."
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:55.240]   But I could definitely see any text that comes in. Just if there's a voice connected to that text,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.800]   I get to hear it.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.880]   Just think this is exactly this is so fascinating because this is part of what
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.320]   Google was showing off last year, the year before with their one-to-one
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:12.760]   conferencing system where it's not just you feel as though there's a pane of glass between
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.480]   yourself and the person you're speaking with across the country. And it's not just because
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.200]   it's high definition. It's not just because the frame rate is very high. It's because
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:27.720]   it is the system is literally creating a 3D model of the person you're speaking to
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:34.600]   and putting that in the screen next to you so that it works. If you change your viewing angle,
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:41.080]   the 3D model changes as well as though it's a 3D object that you're now seeing the other side of.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.560]   I mean, we worry about one of the longest questions about increased resolution,
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.520]   increased frame rate, increased virtual reality stuff has been, "Yes, but how are we going to get
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:56.680]   like 4K, 60, 120 frame per second video with surround sound getting pumped through
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:04.040]   pumped through like an average home broadband?" And the answer is you don't, you just send the
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:11.800]   actual data. There's a 30 second delay in setting up the call in which an avatar and a voice model
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:18.840]   are sent to your screen so that it can just simply get the text that someone is saying
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:25.800]   and get like the movement data from that simple like HD camera and then tell the puppet at the
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.440]   other end, "Here is how Andy should look when he's doing exactly this at this moment."
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:35.960]   That's really quite interesting and that's one of the things that makes VR and augmented reality
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:42.680]   more interesting than just hovering directional arrows and a cartoon fox that waves at you to
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:50.440]   tell you that you have a call coming in. Here's the poem Dr. Duke posted it in our Discord that he got
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:57.480]   synthesized for his wife, his partner. "My life is warmth and light, your smile, your laugh,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.360]   your gentle touch are the treasures that I cherish much. I remember the day you came home,
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.920]   a bundle of joy so lovely." That's pretty good. And as I showed you, that's 11 labs. I mean,
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.720]   I don't know what her mom's sound like in real and it's a little robotic but still
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.080]   probably good enough. The other thing that he points out, which is really cool,
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.640]   you can also do it in foreign languages in your voice. So suddenly I could speak French or Spanish
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:26.600]   or German. It's not perfect, they say, but so this is what the interface will be. It does look a
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.440]   lot like a cappella. It even reminds me of a cappella. I wonder if Apple's licensing it.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:36.200]   So you'll be reading 150 phrases like grabbing a cup of coffee this afternoon sounds great.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   That doesn't mean that's the only thing you could say but they have a bunch of them like that
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:44.920]   and a cappella that you might want but that they can also synthesize your voice from.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:51.720]   This is great. Now, when is this available? Did they say? Next to Wes revision.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:58.520]   This is 16 or is this 15 point? No, I think it's going to be 16.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.280]   Later this year, something is brought. Later this year is what they say but yeah, it's probably
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.640]   September. It's the next iOS in other words. Another feature. So my friend, Shelley Brisbane,
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.360]   who has low vision, wrote about this story on six colors. She's really,
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   she pointed out something that's a very cool idea. They've got this door detection. Any device
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.320]   with LIDAR, there's door detection and person detection and they've added this new feature
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:32.040]   as a part of this wave that's called point and speak. The way she described it is,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:36.200]   if you're a low vision or blind person standing at a vending machine, it won't just tell you that
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:41.000]   it's a vending machine. If you hold the phone up and put your finger on a button, it'll say that's
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.280]   the Coke. The next one, it'll say that's Pepsi. It'll actually read or a microwave. It'll be
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.680]   like that's the power button, that's the one. It'll actually tell you what button your finger is
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:59.160]   hovering over so that you can control a button interface in the real world if you're blind to
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:06.120]   low vision. Just another, they're just building more of this stuff on top. You can imagine
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.160]   how it unlocks possibilities that weren't there before. It's pretty cool.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:15.000]   Shelley also mentions in that article at six colors.com that made for iPhone
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.720]   hearing aids are coming later this year. This is something Apple, I expected Apple to kind of
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:24.680]   jump on with the advent of over-the-counter hearing aids. I was at the audiologist the other day.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.720]   He said, "Well, this is the latest. He showed me a pair from Starkey." I said, "Try this for a
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:37.960]   week." I did and it was improved. $6,000, please. I said, "I'm going to wait and see what else
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:43.640]   comes along." This would probably be a bad time to buy traditional hearing aids, I would think.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.920]   There's something about to happen. Feels like an innovation inflection point.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:53.400]   There's some MFI hearing aids before, but the Mac didn't support it. Now it's going to be on the
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:59.640]   Mac. I get it. I have resounds with your MFI. There's a list on the Apple.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:07.160]   I get it. It does feel like my iPhone. For instance, a little weird. I can answer calls and
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.760]   just talk like this. People say, "Well, how are you hearing this? Well, it's coming through my ears.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:17.960]   My hearing aid." There are quite a few manufacturers that are making those for the iOS platform.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.880]   But Mac, that would be nice. Sure. I was an audio on my Mac.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.080]   It does feel like we are on the precipice. I think OTC.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:32.600]   Revolution in terms of over-the-counter computer hearing aid/headphone/whatever.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:38.360]   For not just people who need hearing aids, but for everybody to hear better and different
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:45.960]   situations. I think augmented hearing at a persistent augmented hearing, I think, is just on its way.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.600]   For everybody, not just us hard of having time. You decide when you want to hear, when you don't
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.800]   want to hear what you're listening to in the background. I think that there's going to be a
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:37:01.480]   point where we just put things on their ears and they filter the world as they want to.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.560]   Well, the fact that everybody's wearing AirPods these days makes it more socially acceptable,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:11.080]   too. There's a real resistance. I get a lot of stuff from my audiologist when I visited.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.720]   He said only one in five people who need hearing aids wear them because of the stigma.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:23.560]   The problem, if you don't wear them, is cognitive decline. The universe starts to get dialed out.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:32.840]   And there's a direct correlation between not wearing hearing aids and cognitive decline,
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.280]   which explains a lot from me personally.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:45.880]   And speaking of stigma, some of these technologies actually are enhanced by the use of a camera.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:52.040]   Like a lot of the technologies that Google is putting out with, it can focus in on individual
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.480]   speakers because it's matching sounds to lip movements that it sees.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:01.080]   So we could find ourselves in a bit of a pickle soon where here is an adaptive technology
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:10.920]   that a segment of the population almost absolutely needs in order to be able to hold a conversation
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:17.240]   in the general world. But you have to be okay with the fact that you have to not freak out by
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.480]   the fact that there is a camera that's pointed at you. All this person is using this technology.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.680]   And if it's a company like Google that's doing it, oh boy, do they have to
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.200]   contortionize themselves to say, here are all the reasons why there's no possible way
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:37.880]   we can get access to what's the camera is. It's all being done on a device. We turn it all into
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:44.280]   German so that even we can't understand it. All this sort of stuff. I mean, there's so much
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.040]   adaptation the society has to make with every piece of technology. And a lot of it is just
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:53.800]   getting deciding what abstract fear is now important enough that it's worth.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.240]   We're going to be cyborgs. Let's face it. Remember the MIT guy?
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.560]   Or is his name that walked around and he had like a man, Dr. Man, he had all this stuff around
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.440]   him. And everybody thought, yeah, that's cute. But I think that that I mean, it won't look so clumsy,
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.520]   but that's coming. And I think just the fact that so many people wear air pods,
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.480]   you don't know if they're just listening to music or they're using it for augmented hearing.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.080]   I mean, the thing that I wear the most is the open calm, you know, the open calm.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.560]   I love that open bone. I bought that because bone conduction.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.120]   And I have a lot. I have one a lot.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.720]   Yeah, at least it is too. She's got her aftershucks on all the time.
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.680]   Because I can hear everything and I'm just doing my thing and I put my little head set back and
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.520]   it turns off. And so then I, you know, but if someone calls, I just swing it down and start talking.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.080]   And it's a, but I can listen to stuff. I listen to a lot of audiobooks on it.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.040]   And it's just great to have, but it doesn't, what's interesting about it is it doesn't feel like
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.480]   I'm cutting the whole world out. It's just like, it's just this other thing that's going on while
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:55.080]   I'm doing my thing. Well, enjoy accessibility day. It's a, it's probably something we should all be
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.040]   looking into since, as you said, Jason, we're all headed that way one way or the other.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.520]   Just because of the timing, I just, we're going to do, we're, you know, we're,
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.360]   we're office hours is going to do accessibility for seven weeks over the summer.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:08.920]   Oh, good.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.320]   So every Saturday, we're going to take our education day, the educators take the summer off.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:20.120]   And so we're going to turn that into accessibility day or six accessibility Saturdays for starting
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.320]   in June.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:26.280]   It's actually May 18th is global accessibility awareness day or GAD.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.360]   And if you go to accessibility.day, you can see.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.240]   So today it's just global Apple press releases come out on Tuesday is day.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.360]   Yes. That's right.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.560]   It is the best day though. Tuesday is the best day.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.040]   Like we've been on my point of view. It gives us a show.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.720]   Cause I was someone asked me like, why does everyone put out things at Tuesday? I'm like,
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.880]   it gives you a day to prep it on. So you don't have to work the weekend on Monday.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.920]   And then it is otherwise it's maximum distribution across a week,
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.600]   the set of weekdays before you go to the weekend. Everyone forgets what you were talking about.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.480]   But that's why it's long.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:05.000]   And I do, this is one press release. I would, you know, read it's apple.com/newsroom.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.720]   Especially this detection mode that Shelley was talking about at six colors.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.680]   Because it's really an interesting use of all the technologies, not just the camera,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.480]   but the camera, the LiDAR, as you said, Jason, the LiDAR scanner on device machine learning
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.240]   to announce the text on each button as users move their fingers across it.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:29.800]   And what it really, it gives you basically a voice interface to any device.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.520]   You know, blind users are used to having screen readers, but this is like having a screen reader
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.160]   for anything you point out. For reality, yeah. Reality.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.680]   I wonder if a headset, like an inside out headset would be,
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:49.640]   could actually be useful for someone who's low sight, not using it as the headset,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.120]   but they have it on their head and then just looking around and pointing at things.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.720]   Because it's got cameras, it's got LiDAR, it's got all those things.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:00.120]   What are the odds apple mentions this when they release the VR headset?
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.040]   Like, which has cameras pointing out by the...
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.600]   Solid 50/50. Solid.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.960]   There are going to be throwing a lot of darts in the vague direction of where the dart is.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.000]   Right. And it'll do this, you know, and this and this.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.880]   Glenn Fleischman and I have a little bit of a bet going on on Massadon on Twitter.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.680]   Social, because Glenn says, this isn't going to be for sale, they're going to talk about it,
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   but they're going to maybe do a lending program, but this isn't going to be for sale.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.120]   And he says, if it is, it won't be told later this year, which is probably accurate.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.440]   Right.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:39.560]   But I think Apple, but his contention essentially is they would never release anything this clunky.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.600]   And my contention is, yeah, maybe the design team didn't want them to, but they were overruled.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.200]   That's what seems to be humorous.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:55.880]   We're getting reports from the parts chain, basically saying that an immense number of components
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.920]   that would support millions of these headsets is being basically moved to Apple.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.640]   So yeah, I think they're making them.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.960]   I don't think they're hoping for they think an iPhone like success is possible,
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.680]   but I do think it's more than, hey, we're going to make 100,000 basically at cost to make
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:19.000]   sure that we put them in the hands of the developers and the forward thinkers who absolutely need
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.080]   to have a head start. It's like, no, we, there are a lot of people who'll give us two to three
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:27.800]   thousand dollars for one of these. And we're going to make a couple of million for those people who
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.960]   will give us two to three thousand dollars for them.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:36.440]   There was a Wall Street Journal report, which I don't know, my sort of Apple plant bell rang
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.400]   there where I'm like, where it feels like, because I think Apple does sometimes go to the
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:46.520]   journal and has historically, but whether it's an Apple initiated thing or not, it felt very much
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.400]   like doing the work that Apple wants people to do right now, which is set the bar where it is,
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.520]   right? Don't get excited.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.840]   It's going to be very expensive. There aren't going to be very many units just trying to
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:03.080]   manage expectations, because what they don't want is to have that day arrive in June and have them
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.800]   unveil this thing and have everybody in the world be like super disappointed because it's not what
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:13.320]   they expected. And when you put a story in the Wall Street Journal that details low sales
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   expectations for the first round and a high price and all of that, it feels very much like that's
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.640]   exactly the story Apple wants everybody to know going in. So they don't think because they're
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.600]   already going to think it's the next iPhone, right? They're like, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:32.120]   no, calm it down. This is the first step in a much longer journey because yeah, this is anybody
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.760]   because I disagree with Leo's pessimism about the long term here, I think, but the truth is,
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.960]   yeah, this product by all accounts, there's no way that it's going to be the hit that blows
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:47.480]   people away. It's it really at most, it's going to be step one on a much longer journey. I think
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:52.440]   they're best to hope for. In fact, is for everybody to be totally blown away with the technology and
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:58.360]   say, well, this is great, but it needs to cost a third as much for us to use it. And you know,
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:04.760]   the watch was a pretty expensive watch when it came out and it was a pretty niche market that
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.960]   was, you know, starting it and then it was now the, you know, that's what you see everywhere. Yeah,
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.320]   this is going to be like that, the more extreme, right? They're not going to sell as many of these
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.240]   as they sold watches in year one, right? And so, and so, and so, and so,
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:22.600]   Palmer Lucky, the guy who created Oculus Rift sold its Facebook and then went off the deep end,
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:29.080]   but that's another story. Tweeted, tweeted a couple of days ago, the Apple headset is so good.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:34.440]   I'm a little like, why would they show it to Palmer Lucky? Like, I don't know.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.000]   Last guy you would show it to, right? But maybe I just, and then Jason Calicanis goes on Twitter
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.720]   saying, if anybody has one, I will gladly give you something I can't remember.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:49.560]   Oh boy. I don't gladly pay you Tuesday for an Apple headset today.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.840]   Well, yeah, what, how would Palmer Lucky know? You think this is just him trying to pretend,
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:59.880]   to these, and I think so. If you, if you've, if you've seen a headset,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.680]   there is no way in hell you're talking about it. Yeah.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:10.280]   I've seen, I think most of the people's conversation have had hardware early,
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:14.040]   and even on simple things that are just, hey, here's the next version of something we've been
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:20.680]   making for five years, the amount of, of the amount of arm twisting they put you under to make sure
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.960]   you understand exactly when you're, you're allowed to say anything about this and what the definition
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:31.400]   of anything is, if anybody has seen something that is that Apple's not shipped yet, and they're
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.960]   saying talking anything about it, that's, that, you know, there's an easier way to make sure that
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.320]   Apple never talks to you ever again. You can just simply not answer the, into the phone.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:46.040]   Here's Glenn Fleischman's, uh, toot Apple rarely ships in elegant products. Everything leaked
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:51.880]   makes it sound ridiculous. So if all the rumors are wrong, the actual thing has to be legendary.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.000]   And I think it defies some of the laws of physics, hence my disbelief.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.240]   So my personal disbelief, which obviously, Jason, you have your right to your wrong
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:07.000]   opinion. But my personal disbelief is this sub, this category is already dead that like,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.080]   meta has already moved on the whole thing. Certainly possible. And Apple is late to the party,
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.760]   and it turns out everybody left already. Certainly possible.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:23.320]   I can, I can just say from having headsets that aren't publicly available, that when it works,
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:28.760]   it really works. Yeah. Like, you know, so, so the thing is, is that it's at, you know,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:35.800]   once you cr, once you crest over about 96 frames a second and about a six K per I,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.560]   you get into a different world that is pretty, pretty slick. I will,
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.480]   I don't know. Hello, fresh box that you are wrong.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.680]   I won't be able to get it for five years.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.600]   That's how wrong I take for this picture.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.080]   What a troll.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.760]   So, I'm going to put this back and let it roll over you. You're watching magic.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:58.920]   I'll send you a hello, fresh box just because you deserve to eat some delicious

[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.920]   which was pork sausage and bell pepper risotto made from scratch. It was so much fun.

[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:58.760]   it's wonderful. Hello, fresh. Anyway, I'll send you a box if I'm wrong.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:09.640]   I you know, I haven't been as committal in this as I feel like I ought to be so before WWDC,
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:18.920]   I'm going to go out on a limb and say VR as as demonstrated by Facebook's Oculus demonstrated by
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   the HTC Vive, which I think was better than the Oculus is a dead dead is a doornail product category.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.000]   Apple is not only late to the party. Everybody's already left. I'm going to say that I'm saying
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:37.320]   it's a recording. Make a mark, take it, put it somewhere. And then in six months, you all can
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:42.840]   laugh at me. But I feel strongly this is having I haven't used that special thing you've used,
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.000]   but I've used the magic leap and Alex. I've used a lot of this stuff and it's not an
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.560]   HoloLens very underwhelmed. Leo, there would be a much bolder statement had you not demonstrated
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:59.320]   that you have access to voice synthesis technology and that you can basically edit whatever it is.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:05.480]   Anthony, make sure you have a variety statements here. I'll give you another one.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.680]   This is going to be the hottest product category since the iPhone.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:15.240]   More? You need more? Apple had a good idea, but they fumbled in delivery.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.640]   I can't believe our state senator is a cockatoo.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   That's a good one. Who knew that all this time Atari was developing the killer headset?
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:33.400]   You have a few choices you can work with. I just got my Intellivision Amico and it's awesome.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:48.360]   Apple has snurfed up 90% of TSMC's three nanometer capacity for the year 2023. 90%. This is
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:56.840]   according to digit times. So sorry, everybody else. Holy cow. This is, of course, the process that
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:05.480]   I just m3. Who got the 10? Exactly. Who got fired at Apple because they left anything on the table?
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:11.080]   I love the thing that we don't talk about, I think, enough just in general, not us in particular,
[00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:16.200]   but in general is Apple scale. This is a game they've been playing for more than a decade now.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:23.480]   Remember when they bought all the RAM at a set price for the next three years and they bought
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.640]   all the capacity and then everybody else is like, we need memory. And they're like, sorry, we sold
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:34.120]   it all to Apple for a price that's way lower than you would pay now anyway because they ordered it
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:41.240]   in advance. This is Apple like the scale of the iPhone, especially the money that Apple has to spend
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:46.840]   the money they've got in the bank so that they can spend billions of dollars now for you to build
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:51.160]   that factory for the chip that they're designing that you're going to need to fab in four years.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:55:00.280]   Right? All of this is the... I don't want to say it's the Tim Cook secret sauce, but it kind of is,
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:08.040]   they have so much market power and so much money that they can define what's available
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:13.160]   and then take most of it for themselves. And it's one of the reasons that the Apple Silicon
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:20.520]   story is so powerful is that they have that scale. It's another reason why Apple is so valuable
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.720]   in their culture that they make plans, they can make long distance plans and they know what they're
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.680]   going to go after and then they can execute on those plans. It's not a, well, maybe we'll try this
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:37.000]   or maybe we'll do this as an experiment. It's like, no, they're the fact that they're doing VR goggles
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.080]   means that they know where it's going to be in five years and what they intend to ship in five
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:46.280]   years. The fact that they need to book all this, they can commit all of this money towards three
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:51.320]   nanometer manufacturing means that they know exactly what the roadmap is, not just for this
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:56.360]   Apple Silicon, but the device is going to go into for the next several years. And that's not something
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:01.320]   that it's not unfair at all that they book this, book this all out. They've got the money and they're
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:06.200]   making the commitment. Other companies, they just, for a lot of reasons, they don't have enough control
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.440]   over their market to be able to say, this is what we're going to be doing in three years. They can
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:14.760]   say, this is what we hope we're going to be able to be doing in three years. It depends on how the
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.440]   market responds to the next two years of stuff that we planned three years ago.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:23.560]   Yeah, there's a, there's a, this is one of my favorite sayings is from Omar, General Omar Bradley,
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.200]   the, you know, amateur's talk about strategy and professionals talk about logistics and Apple is a
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:35.000]   master of logistics. Yep. And that's the, you know, that's what we see here in Andy. Andy makes the
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.920]   point to, this has shifted into a higher gear now with Apple Silicon because Apple designs their
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:46.680]   chips. So they know exactly, it used to be, they took stuff off the shelf, right? Like we took an
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:51.560]   Intel part from here and whatever Intel made it, they could choose what Intel part they wanted,
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:56.760]   but they were choosing based on Intel's choices about what goes into chip A and chip B and chip
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:02.360]   C. And now not only, and they were privy to some of Intel's roadmap, right? But now it's like they
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:07.000]   make the roadmap and not only do they know what the chip is going to be, but as Andy said,
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.880]   they know exactly what computers it's going to be in, right? Like they know that going in three
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.880]   years in advance. And as you see all those chips slowly unify, you know, where there's, you know,
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:21.160]   where we're coming together, where they're making the same type of chip, or this, and eventually
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:26.440]   maybe even the same chip, you know, in some cases, the same chip across all of the platforms that
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:31.000]   it gives it just an entirely different scale than it had in the past. So the iPhone,
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:39.560]   what is this? The numbers are all confusing. 14 Pro Max has the A15 chip. Is that right?
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:47.720]   I'm so confused. Glad it's not just me. I thought I was having cognitive difficulties.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:54.120]   Okay. The numbers are confusing. But the next generation. The 14 Pro has the A16.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:58:02.200]   The 15 is in the 14. Nothing. And so the next one, the 15 will have the 17,
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:10.120]   which is the 17, a three nanometer. I know the 16 is not, right?
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:16.840]   No, they're they're not there. It's their enhanced five nanometer. It's not the real three nanometer
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.960]   process. This new wave is going to be the three nanometer. And that will be iPhone 15.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:30.040]   This is running an A 17 and I was 18. Yeah, I know. I know. And then but also so Mark Gurman says,
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:34.760]   and I was all I was really hoping because there were rumors floating around and I hate rumors,
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.960]   but there were rumors floating around that maybe this 15 inch MacBook Air that Apple's
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:44.920]   supposedly going to announce in a couple of weeks at the WWDC would have an M3.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:49.960]   Now Gurman saying no, no, the first M3s may launch by the end of the year.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:55.560]   Yeah, he says that although that story history is peculiar because he's really just talking about
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:59:02.120]   notes about the configurations in an M3 Pro chip and then extrapolating. And I don't know if the M3
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:07.640]   Pro can really be attached to the M3, right? Presumably the M3 will come earlier. So when he
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:12.920]   talks about the M3s at the end of the year in a story where it's all about the M3 Pro being
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:19.000]   spotted by some third party app developers, I'm not sure he actually means the M3 as a whole product
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.560]   line by the end of the year, or if he means the M3 Pro itself that he's writing about by the end
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:28.360]   of the year, and he leaves it kind of unclear himself, which marks a pro. I suspect that means
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:34.040]   that he's not sure and he's not going to say anything, claim anything that he doesn't know for sure.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:40.600]   So it may be the M3 could come sooner. Remember the M2 MacBook Air came last summer. So an M3
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:48.280]   MacBook Air in a year later fall is yeah, or 18 months later is not unreasonable. But his detail
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:53.720]   here is about spotting an M3 Pro in the wild. The company has begun. This is a quote from his
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.520]   power on newsletter. The company has begun putting next generation Max with the M3 chips
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.480]   through their paces, testing them with third party apps to ensure compatibility with its software
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:10.600]   ecosystem. That's pretty close to a release, I would imagine. Maybe not. He does double down on
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:17.480]   the fact that the 15 inch will have an M2 chip in it. Yeah, I do think it's interesting. The only
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:22.120]   news from the street that I've seen is that Costco is selling an enormous number of
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:28.200]   studio hosts and Mac Minis for very discounted. The discounts and also M1's.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:34.600]   M1 Mac. The M1 Mac was selling for like $2.99 or something. $2.99 or $3.99 in Costco. And the
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.440]   studio was selling the base studio, whatever was selling for $14.99 less than the Mac Mini Pro
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:51.960]   at Costco. It just feels like the timing is odd. It's not the kind of machine we're expecting,
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.760]   but it just does seem like they're dumping a lot of hardware out.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.960]   Yeah, it's not the same message. I would not be surprised if they announced that
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:03.800]   MacBook Air next Tuesday. I would not be surprised if they announced it in late June.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.840]   Really? Like the only thing you want. Because it's a nice idea. I think it would sell really well,
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:20.360]   but is it part of the message of WWDC? It is not, right? It's not that same message. So
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.560]   you could give it its own little stage some other time. So maybe they will.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.160]   M1 Mac. Do we expect they'll have an answer? And that's wait for every Tuesday from now to WWDC.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.960]   We're going to hear some little tidbits. This is all with stuff.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.640]   Yeah. So there's three weeks. It's probably in rehearsal going, "Yeah, let's cut that out."
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.720]   And then it comes to a Tuesday. We're finding it now. Let's make that a Tuesday.
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:49.800]   So the 22nd and the 29th, some stuff will leak out. And then June 5th, of course, is WWDC. That's
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   a Monday, which is unusual, isn't it? Normally they do. No, not for WWDC.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.400]   That's a Monday, right? That's normally Monday through Friday. Okay. So Monday, June 5th,
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.760]   we will, of course, cover the keynote because there'll be a lot of interest in what Apple
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:10.520]   does announce whatever it is. Do you guys want to do predictions or do you care?
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:16.280]   It's kind of silly to do predictions, I guess. But I'm saving up my pennies for something.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:23.640]   I have an M2 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. I'm very happy with 14-inch, I guess.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.200]   But I wouldn't mind a 15. What is it? It's 1213-14, I can't.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.960]   I'll make a prediction, which is that they won't announce any hardware that's shipping anytime soon.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:42.120]   And that the only hardware there that I would expect to see would be maybe a Mac
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:48.760]   Pro announcement that it's coming later, much later, and the headset. And I think otherwise,
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:53.800]   they're going to be talking. Because traditionally it's an OS event, right? It's all about researching
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.000]   the OS platforms. Plus, we expect them to be really pushing the VR headset.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.160]   VR headset. They want to have a lot of space for that, I presume.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.840]   And what is it? XROS? What is the OS?
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:13.960]   Well, reality OS or XROS. Yeah. But since it is an operating system showcase, it will be
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.920]   interesting to see how detailed they get about the hardware if they unveil it. Because they may
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.880]   be a little bit vagar than they might be if it was shipping. Because they're going to be talking
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.400]   about it in the context of getting also getting developers excited about developing for it as a
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:35.080]   platform. So it's almost like it's hardware inside a software platform as an announcement.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.440]   And then whenever they get closer to shipping, like they did with the Apple Watch, they will
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.560]   reiterate maybe at the iPhone event what the hardware details are. And they might not even give
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.360]   a price out in June, right? Because it's not time yet. It's not going to ship anytime soon.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.480]   Yeah. I think that I'd be surprised if they show any hardware other than the headset.
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:00.280]   And I'd also be surprised that they show much of anything other than AR and VR.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:05.240]   You know, like I think that the whole keynote is this is their big coming out party. You know,
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:12.120]   like they're going to be showing this at scale. And they've been working on this for probably
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.840]   five or six or eight years. So I think that it's, you know, so I think that this is going to be a,
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.080]   I don't think they're going to have, they want anything to be a distraction. So I wouldn't be
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.600]   surprised that we see a couple more releases coming out before then just dumping things into
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:32.760]   the system that they can kind of mention. But I also think that we may see the office tools,
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.320]   you know, start to support USDZ. I think people noticed in the screen captures in Final Cut that
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:42.440]   there was another tab that said models. You know, like that were in the, in the tab.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:48.600]   So, you know, so those are the three D models, not in yeah, 3D models. Yeah. So so I think that
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:55.480]   I think I would be, I, you know, we'll see, but I'd be surprised if we see if it's not at least,
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:03.960]   if not half 75 to 80% AR, you know, in the keynote. Yeah, I agree with that. I think that I think
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.680]   that the other big thing they're going to be talking about is going to be more refinements to the
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:15.080]   iPad to bring it up to the level of a $1,000 computer, which is pretty much what they're selling these
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:20.920]   things for these days. I'd love to see them also talk about refinements to stage manager,
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:27.000]   which if they, if we, if we hear nothing about stage manager, I would then be concerned for the
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.160]   future of future development of that feature. I would not, I would not be suspicious at all
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:38.120]   if at the very beginning, they thought, okay, we got stage manager, we love it here inside the
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.760]   spaceship. Now we got to cross our fingers and see how the people react to it. And we will pay
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.400]   close attention to what they say positive and negatively. And that will help us actually get
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.960]   this where it needs to be within the next two or three years. So if they say, Hey, we've, we,
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:59.880]   our customers love stage manager. And now we're happy to announce we're making it even better.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:05.720]   I hope that if we don't see for refinements to stage manager, that would auger poorly for the
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.600]   feature, I think. There have been some reports that that that's in the works. And I've also heard
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.840]   sort of through the grapevine that the stage, it seems like the stage manager team sort of never
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:20.360]   stopped working on stage manager. If you've noticed every iOS revision that comes out has stage
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.600]   manager updates in it, like they keep tweaking it. Sometimes it's frustrating. You're like, okay,
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.120]   now I know how stage management works. And they're like, no, no, it looks, it works different now.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.560]   But I think they are. So I think they've just kept on the treadmill there. And I'm with you, Andy,
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:40.920]   so much of what Apple does, you just want them to not ship it and walk away. Because that's a bad
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.400]   habit that Apple got into. And they need to get out of, which is, you know, shipping is the start
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:49.480]   of the story and not the end of it. And Apple, a lot of times was like, look, we gave you a thing.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.760]   Goodbye. And it's like, but it doesn't work. And there's a bug. And then they're like,
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:59.320]   see you later. So I hope stage manager just keeps improving because it needs it, right? And they
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.520]   need to not walk away from it. That would be delusional. Yeah. I'm really interested to see
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:06.120]   also with the with the law. I think we talked about this last week, but the logic and final cut
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:11.160]   as to whether they use the they use the iPad as a development tool. So the iPad's great,
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.040]   because you could pick it up. If they are potentially VR, you can move it around and simulate what
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:20.600]   you'd have in the headset. You know, so if you were developing something in Final Cut or Logic and
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:26.440]   being surround sound, you could simulate a lot of that stuff inside of your iPad. And it feels like
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:31.000]   the timing of when you when they release the Final Cut and logic could be kind of like, you
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.920]   already know that it's out shipping starting next week. But here's how you here's how you use it with
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.880]   as a development tool for for the AR experience. Speaking of that, it's an interesting question
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:48.760]   about remember that when the iPad was released, they allow Xcode could could simulate an iPad. So
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:53.720]   you can target it as a developer without ever having been seated with one. You think that there's
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:08:00.200]   going to be some sort of simulator so that people developers can at least try to start to get a
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:05.800]   handle on what it would be like to target apps and code for that device. I don't know how they
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.320]   I don't know how necessary would work. But it was seems like too easy thing too easy an opportunity.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.400]   You make it out of cardboard. Yeah, that was great. I love it. I love it.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.160]   We'll go down one. Yeah, I know. But it was so good. I feel like stage manager is akin to
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:26.360]   Microsoft's release of Windows eight, where they attempted.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:34.200]   Flippy. Now, Windows eight was an attempt to add touch to Windows. It was widely reviled
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:40.280]   by users. They hated it. And in the long run, what Microsoft did is just kind of
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:46.760]   like Homer Simpson fading into the Ivy. They just faded it back into the poochy went back to his
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.760]   own point. Yeah, but it's still all there. It's just kind of it's kind of recessed into the operating
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.640]   system. I bet you that's what Apple does with stage manager was too forefront. It's it's too
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:03.000]   different. I'm surprised. Do you still use it, Jason? You I guess you feel like you have to to cover
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.440]   I mean, I know I turned it off on the Mac as soon as I was done with my review on the iPad.
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:14.920]   I do use it sometimes because there's some context in which the iPad is better with it on. But the
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:21.560]   truth is I don't use stage manager on on my iPad as the default. It's off by default. I think there's
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:26.040]   something I'll be like now I'll turn it on. I guess what I'm saying is there's good ideas there.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.720]   And I understand what they're trying to do. And it's kind of what Andy's talking about,
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:35.480]   which is to make the iPad more useful as a computing platform. But but it but it's failed, I think
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:41.240]   in terms of its affordances and its usability. So I think what they're going to do is what
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.600]   Microsoft did, which is fade into the Ivy, but keep the afford keep the you know, get rid of
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.960]   some of those affordances, but keep some of the underlying functionality. I think I just think
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.800]   it was kind of too big of a swing because if there was ever a type of computer that justified
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.240]   and kind of celebrates a tiled window interface, it really is the iPad. I don't I don't have to
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.480]   worry about moving something out of the way because I've just created a new workspace or
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.800]   created a new project and now something's covering up an essential part of another window. I really
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:18.360]   do like the fact that I can just pick up a window pick up a pick up an app app window,
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.280]   slide it in and suddenly I've got two equal pains or I've got a two thirds one third sort of layout.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:30.040]   I really wouldn't mind if Apple decided to go another step further from there and basically
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.880]   let me split vertical pains to have a top and a bottom or to have three in three in one screen.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:41.000]   Obviously you can go nuts with that and there's a there's a hard limit, but the fact
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.480]   matter is I'm like Jason. I'm the only times I use a stage manager are when I really am.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:53.160]   This really is the only the only alternative I have available to me to get a certain project done.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.640]   Like again, I'm in I'm in Boston for the entire day. The only machine I brought with me was my
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:01.800]   iPad Pro and the keyboard cover and it turns out that there is something a little bit more
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:06.920]   complicated that I anticipated and then I will reactivate stage manager just so I can have more
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:13.320]   windows of more things exactly from more disparate apps at the same time.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.440]   I just wish that it was so nice that just like slide over and those other basic features they
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.880]   added a couple of years ago, it became part of how I use my iPad and just isn't unfortunately.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.840]   I don't think they've given up on it yet and I do think like with the touch bar,
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.120]   I think we'll know when they've given up on it, but I don't think they have yet.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:36.600]   Also, there are some rumblings that stage manager, the reason we look at stage manager on the
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.240]   Mac and the iPad and are like, "Well, that's kind of weird, but okay."
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.920]   Is that stage manager is also the metaphor they're using on the headset?
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:49.560]   So I don't know. They may be really motivated. Boy, that's just going to make Leo like the
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.280]   stage manager stuff even worse if it's all about the VR headset too. But like I think they,
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:58.280]   I think like Andy said, I think it's worth another crack because I don't, I think they took a big
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:02.840]   swing and they didn't quite get it, but they've put in a lot of work and they haven't even during
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.160]   this cycle, they haven't given up. And I think there are some advantages to it. Also,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.600]   I don't know what you guys talked about last week, but I looked at the Final Cut Pro running on the
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:18.440]   iPad and my immediate thought was, "Oh, you need a bigger iPad now." And if you have a bigger iPad
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.440]   or you have an iPad on an external display and there were some rumors out there that it might even,
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.280]   you might be able to even do that and run it lid closed, which would be really nice and attach it
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.080]   to a big display. Once you get in situations like that, you've got to have stage manager and it needs
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.480]   to work better, but like they just need, they need to take some more shots at it because
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.080]   this ain't it, right? Like it's not quite there.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:42.040]   Time for the lunch pad, lunch tray iPad.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:48.280]   I think Jason has spare CPU cycles because while he's having this conversation here,
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.720]   there's also an excellent conversation going on in the club to a Discord.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:58.600]   Members get more, and it's, and I don't want it to slide by the wayside because it's actually a
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:07.160]   very good conversation. Your position on the Macbook Pro or sorry, the Mac Pro,
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.560]   well, Knox Harrington started it off by saying, "I find myself wondering how the Mac Pro works
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:17.240]   with the all-in-one nature of silicon, Apple Silicon. It's unexpandable." And then you
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:23.640]   reply, "It's a real head scratcher. Mac Pro needs are kind of antithetical to the entire premise of
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:31.160]   Apple Silicon to which Dragon Slayer throws in. They're going to have to drop Apple Silicon.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:37.160]   That closed architecture will be a limitation," which I disagree with, but it is a conundrum.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.440]   It is a head scratcher. What does Apple go with the Mac Pro?
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.880]   I think part of the premise there too is that like when you really think about it,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:47.800]   what devices does Apple sell? Almost every device Apple sells is a mobile device.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.360]   It's an iPhone, it's an iPad, or it's a MacBook. Three quarters of the Macs that are sold are
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.240]   MacBooks, right? At least, if not more. Last time they reported that, they were in the three quarters
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:02.840]   range. So the Apple Silicon strategy makes sense for Apple's product line as a whole.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.560]   When you start talking about high-end Pro hardware, that's where you're like, "Oh,
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:13.720]   all of the everything that works for the bulk of Apple's business doesn't quite do it." So the
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.240]   question and the truth is you're like, "Well, they can just make a variation." It's like,
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:22.040]   "Do you take your chip team? Do you take your entire philosophy that the chip team excels at?"
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:28.360]   And then say, "For this little tiny product that is very important to certain users but sells nothing
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.800]   in the grand scheme of things, let's fork our chip strategy or change our chip strategy."
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.920]   Maybe they do, right? Maybe they do, but that's a hard... I'm glad I'm not making that decision
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:46.280]   because I think that there's a real strong argument that above a certain point, Apple just won't go.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:53.560]   And that if you can't take the M-whatever Ultra, that level of performance,
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:58.680]   if you need more than that, Apple doesn't have a platform for you because the alternative is
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:05.000]   they will have to build this parallel universe chip platform for Apple Silicon on just the Mac
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:11.960]   Pro. You weren't here last week, but we had this almost identical conversation when we were
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:18.360]   talking about Final Cut Pro for the iPad. Alex, you made, I think, what was the absolute
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:22.600]   definitive point, which is that Apple is going to... Well, I don't want to put words in your mouth,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.280]   but my sense of it or my feeling is Apple will abandon that pro market in favor of the creator
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.880]   market, and that's what they've done with Final Cut. Am I misstating your point?
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:37.400]   No, 100%. I think that Apple has lost... They've lost Hollywood. They're not going to get that
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:42.920]   back. It's mostly locked up in Avid. There's some premiere in between that, and the only
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.960]   thing that's really taking ground is resolve. Traditional editors are not going towards Final Cut,
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.880]   but in the creator market, in the educator market, Final Cut, that's a big deal because they're not
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.120]   getting paid by the hour, and they want to get things done quickly. They don't have to go through
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.920]   a colorist and have 10 editors working on it and all the other things that happen there.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:08.920]   It just makes a lot of sense for Apple to really focus on the market that makes sense because
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.160]   editors are going to ask for a bunch of quirky little things that then they're not going to
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.760]   change anyway. I tell you, this is what I need to switch from Avid and then they're not going
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:22.600]   to change from Avid. There's no ROI for Apple there, but what I will say is that there is...
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:27.240]   The one thing I would distinguish is that I think that there's still a market for the Mac Pro,
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:32.120]   because right now we have nothing that lets us put cards in our computer other than the Intel
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:39.000]   one. I think that they don't even have to make the Pro some kind of crazy beefy machine. It's just
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.160]   having an enclosure that I can put cards in would be really useful because right now,
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.880]   it's a really good business for Sonnet and OWC because we're buying all these enclosures for
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:54.040]   all the cards that we need. It just feels like they're having something that lets you put
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:01.160]   three, four, five, six cards in it. Along with, you put a couple of ultra's in there at the same time,
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.840]   you do a bunch of other things there. I think that you end up with it. I do think that there's
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:12.520]   an aspirational benefit to Apple of people having a really beefed up machine. There's a reason to
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:18.520]   have an F1 machine that is pushing the outer envelope of what's possible. I think that that
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:25.320]   is still... I think it's still important to Apple for people to have that scale because there was a
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:34.600]   point where I was very clear. Before the M1 came out, I was pretty sure that my time using Mac as a
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:42.200]   professional platform was almost over. I'm buying more and more PCs and more and more Linux boxes,
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.080]   and I'm putting four GPUs in them and I'm doing all this other stuff. Before the M1 came out,
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.360]   I figured, "Ah, I got another two or three years." Then after that, my home computer,
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.000]   and I'll be answering email on a Mac, but everything else will be a PC or Linux box.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.200]   The M1 changed that, but I do think that there's a... You don't want people to think that I'm going
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:06.600]   to get to the end of the yellow brick road and just end. There has to... I think that the existence
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:12.680]   of that high-end machine that will do all the things that I may scale to, I think it's pretty
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:17.160]   important to have because I think it affects the intake on the other end as well. When you're buying
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:21.240]   into the machines, knowing that you can get there, I think is important.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.880]   I think the question is, how does Apple define that top end? I think you're right, Alex, but I think
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:32.120]   that I suspect what we'll see is, what are the limits that you can do within the Apple Silicon
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:37.960]   paradigm instead of it being, "Okay, we broke out the RAM and we broke..." Because that breaks
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.880]   sort of what Apple's trying to do. I don't think that cards would be helpful.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:49.080]   Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe even like RAM, a cache and lots of storage with fast lanes,
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.960]   but without... Because I think some people really expect that it's going to look like a traditional
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:01.400]   computer like the Intel Mac Pro. I think you're right on, which is it will have capacity and all of that,
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:07.880]   but it will otherwise look a lot like that high-end Mac studio. It's going to be as much
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:12.920]   performance as you could possibly get out of an Apple Silicon paradigm plus all this stuff around
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   it. We broke Apple Silicon just for you, Mac Pro. No, no, I don't think they should do that.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.720]   I don't think they're going to do it yet. We're going to add some extensibility. We're going to have
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:27.080]   a ton of IO. We're going to have a ton of... We're going to have... I don't know, six or four or six
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.400]   or eight lanes of Thunderbolt that are going through it. We're going to have no cards.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.360]   It's very no expense, right? Yeah, and I don't think it has to be a $60,000 machine. I think it can be
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:43.400]   a $20 machine or a $15,000 machine, but I do think a lot of lanes that you can do stuff with,
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:49.080]   I think that it helps show off the chips as well. I definitely agree with you that I don't think
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.520]   that they need to break anything. There's no reason to break that stuff out. I think that they,
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:57.320]   if anything, I would take two ultra... I don't know, what? Pancakes that have all those things and
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.440]   stick them in there or have up to four of them. You could put up four of them in the Runemall
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.880]   parallel and let them do a bunch of things. That would be interesting.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:10.120]   Yeah, for me, the thing that pushed my belief system about Apple's attitudes towards the
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:16.120]   pro market was during the earnings call, the Q&A, when I think it was the first time I'd heard Tim
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:25.080]   Cook say explicitly the phrase that we're primarily a consumer company, not a pro company.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:32.600]   Jason might have some other thoughts about this, but I can't remember a time when
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:37.480]   those words specifically, "Hey, we are a consumer-oriented company." And then the
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:42.600]   implication being that, "Yeah, and of course, we build enough powerful stuff that we can make a top-end
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:50.600]   creator or research-level Mac, but essentially, when you come to the classic form factor of a Mac,
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:55.720]   essentially, the hot plate form factor is where the most powerful Macs we intend to make,
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:01.000]   and we're not intending to make big boxes with slots of them that cost upwards of $12,000 as a base."
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:07.080]   And what a pro is has changed over time. What pro markets, like Alex said, some pro markets are gone,
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:13.480]   and that's okay because there are other markets. Apple now talks, Apple's number one pro market
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.840]   is people making iPhone apps. That's their number one pro market. It's developers. And then
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:24.760]   there are lots of other professional-level people, and the power of the Apple Silicon platform for
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:31.160]   Mac users at the high end is actually very impressive. But the markets change, and your targets change,
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:39.160]   and over the years, I have written a lot of stories about very angry people who are understandably
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:46.440]   angry that Apple has decided or the market has decided for Apple, that their personal area is not
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.160]   going to be a place where Apple is particularly strong, and they get really irate about it. And
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:57.320]   it's like, "I understand why they're irate, but that does happen. Sometimes markets change,
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.880]   and Apple will be like, 'You know, if that's what's required to hold onto that market,
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.440]   we're just not going to do it.' And nobody wants to hear that they're abandoning your market.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.440]   Apple has said that when they dropped computer from the company name,
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.360]   they kind of acknowledged that what we really are is a consumer electronics company.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:20.200]   And I think that in the market, if we figure it out, that's a really good niche. They're almost a
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:26.200]   $3 trillion company. And $2 billion in cash and social securities on hand.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:31.240]   And they don't have to do everything. In fact, I think is a very important thing that Steve Jobs
[01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:37.320]   taught them, is you should say no to most things. And I don't have a problem with that. I understand
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.160]   how if you're a Mac lover, you want to do that. But there's PCs.
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.280]   My only way to do anything you want.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:42.280]   Anything you want.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.720]   With PCs, and you can put Linux on them if you want, and the sky's the limit.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.840]   So it's still there.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.920]   But my only regret was that I didn't buy as big a studio as I would have bought.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.800]   You know, like I don't really need the Mac Pro, but I was going to get one. I was like,
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.000]   I'm going to save money and get one.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:55.800]   You're holding off.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.880]   So I held back and then it didn't.
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:58.280]   Nothing happened.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:58.840]   Yeah, but honestly.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.200]   That would have bought a bigger machine.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:04.920]   Even with your photogrammetry, probably the Mac studio you got is probably pretty sufficient.
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:05.320]   Yes.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.200]   Oh, I can't bump it.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:12.920]   I could use more. I mean, the ultra with some more RAM would have done better.
[01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.520]   You know, like it's definitely not.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.640]   It's probably somewhere in my future.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:20.120]   If Apple definitively says we're not going to get a Mac, we're not going to do a Mac Pro.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.120]   I'd probably be in the market for the M3.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.760]   Yeah. Wait and see the M3. The M3 Ultra.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.320]   Because the M3, three nanometers, there's a lot.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:32.120]   I think it's credible to believe that the M1 and M2 were not so different,
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:36.520]   but the M1 and M2 jump to M3 is going to be significant.
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.720]   And that is really going to be the one you want anyway.
[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.680]   Yeah, quite possibly.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.640]   And so I do think that Apple's going down the right path.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.920]   I mean, the creator market, the education market, the corporate market,
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.360]   all of those markets are far bigger.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.840]   In fact, I think their biggest problem is not so much, and they do a pretty good job of it,
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.640]   but it's not so much the hardware, the software, it's just the wetware.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:02.680]   I think Apple could lean a lot harder into training to make sure that people are taking
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.360]   full advantage of it. Because I think that they do some training there,
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.600]   but I think that they could spend a lot more money there to make sure that people are actually
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.680]   using their products at the full capacity.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.560]   Do they have to? Clearly what Apple is doing now is looking for the next 10 poll.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.800]   Do they have to look at cars? Do they have to look at VR? Do they have to look at health?
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:28.200]   Do they have to look for a new 10 poll? Or could they just say, "Hey, we're doing great"?
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:33.240]   I think it's risky. You know, like Nokia and Blackberry, there's a whole
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.080]   whole movie. I watch the trailer for that one.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.760]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.080]   You can get into a vertical or a couple of verticals and think that you own the world,
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.520]   and then suddenly it's gone.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.520]   That's clearly what they're worried about.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:49.800]   I think Apple worries about 1997 every day.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.200]   Look, I think they think about it all the time.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:25:00.120]   And I think that they could do a lot of things.
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:05.560]   I mean, I look at lots of products in my house going, "I really wish Apple would just build one of
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:08.920]   these so that I didn't have to do it." It's tough because it's not happy with it.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.200]   You do want to also not spread yourself too thin.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.960]   You do want it. Exactly. You don't want to.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.000]   But when you're that big, you're like, "Can't you just hire 100 engineers?"
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.120]   I don't think it's... You've said this before. It's not that easy, is it?
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:24.120]   It isn't easy, but as Andy has said before, but you have the money.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.360]   You have the money, but it's harder now because they're trying to get everybody to come back.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.360]   They're trying to get everybody to show up and they keep on losing people because they have to
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.640]   come to work.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.760]   One other thing German talks about, I think it's very interesting, is the pending war
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:44.920]   between Apple and Meta. He uses as his sole data point the fact that Meta is pulling the
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:51.800]   messenger app from the Apple Watch and then launches WhatsApp for Wear OS.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:59.560]   Does not say whether WhatsApp will come to Apple Watch OS, but he is pointing out one thing that
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:05.960]   is perhaps reasonable, which is Meta wants to own the mixed reality headset market and Apple's
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:09.240]   coming on strong, presumably, in that market.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:15.000]   Even there, isn't it? If Apple comes in and succeeds, isn't that a validation of their focus on that
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   market? There's also, at one more data point, Meta hates ATT, the app tracking, and they claim
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.120]   it costs some billions. This feels like one of the flimsier market. This is low down in his...
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.320]   He's a huge winner, right? I like it, though.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.720]   I like it. He does great work, but this one, I'm like, "Can we connect those
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:39.800]   data points?" And they go, "No, they took this Watch app away and they're adding this Watch app
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:45.480]   on Wear OS and they're for... This means war." And I'm like, "Yeah, except if there are places where...
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:51.000]   Meta never put Instagram on the iPad." I mean, that's true.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.120]   It's true. I do think... I mean, it's a little like talking about Sherlocking.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.960]   It's like, Sherlocking is not Apple comes in and your product is dead. It's actually,
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:04.600]   it can be an opportunity because Apple very rarely does everything that's in those apps.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.200]   This is a little like that, too, which is like, "You know, I know it's scary. I mean,
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.480]   I know I'm basically saying welcome Apple. Seriously, you are, right?" But that...
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:19.320]   Mark Zuckerberg has spent so much money trying to validate this. If Apple comes in and has a product,
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:25.400]   that people are like, "Whoa, maybe this is the future?" That's good for Meta in the sense that
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.880]   it will show that they did not throw all that money away. Now, if Apple throws its money away,
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:33.720]   then maybe Meta says, "See, it wasn't just us." And then they run away. I don't know.
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:39.960]   The thing that will hurt is if Apple comes in at $3,000 and sells more units than Meta sold
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:46.520]   at $1,500 or $300, that'll be brutal because it's so much work to get these headsets down into the
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:53.000]   down into a consumer level cost. There is so much going on in the headsets that,
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.280]   I think $3,000 is completely reasonable if you have a high performance headset.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:04.840]   It's kind of, to be honest with you, miraculous. $3,000 is a miraculous number for headset to do
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:10.360]   if it's high performance. And we haven't seen high performance yet because everyone's trying
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:16.120]   to fit into $300 or $600 or $1,500. And that's not miraculous. That's impossible.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:24.120]   So I think that it's going to be really hard for Meta if Apple pushes really big numbers of...
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:30.360]   Might say really big numbers, just more than Meta in the same category at twice or,
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.440]   in some cases, six times the cost.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:39.000]   Just a little bit of history in case you were wondering what Jason was talking about. In 1981,
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.440]   when IBM entered the PC industry, Apple famously, Steve Jobs famously bought a full-page ad in
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:49.560]   the Wall Street Journal saying, "Welcome IBM, seriously. Welcome to the most exciting and important
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:55.720]   marketplace since the computer revolution began 35 years ago." And of course, the PC and PC
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:02.200]   compatible almost immediately ate Apple's lunch. So it's something like Mission accomplished.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.800]   It's just one of those things you never forget.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.440]   It's not.
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:12.600]   All I'm saying is I hope that Meta doesn't decide to make a cardboard Apple headset and roll it out
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.920]   on a coffin. Work out for Microsoft.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.160]   For the iPhone, right? They had a FU, mock funeral for the iPhone. Was it the iPhone?
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.080]   Yeah. Foolish.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.360]   You know, that's a few minutes.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.680]   I still have a Zoom around somewhere. This is a Zoom around somewhere in my...
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.640]   No, Hubris. The Greek's near.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:36.280]   And it's been true ever since. Let's take a little break and then we will talk about
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:41.640]   Apple TV plus and a big executive departure. But first, I want to tell you about
[01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:46.600]   a tool we've been using, Miro. It's hard for me to describe what Miro is because it can be
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:54.600]   anything you want it to be. So here's the problem that almost every team, every group that's working
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:00.840]   on a project, whether it's your high school science project or you're developing the next
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:08.040]   great consumer product, you and your team are going from tab to tab, from tool to tool.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:14.040]   And in that process, the context, which is this is natural ideas, just go, "Woo, they disappear.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:20.200]   They disappear." Information goes, "Woo, with Miro, M-I-R-O, that doesn't have to happen."
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.960]   Because now you have a collaborative visual platform that everything goes into.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:30.040]   All your great work goes in, no matter where you are, no matter what time zone team members are in,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:36.200]   no matter what tools they use. In fact, we use, for instance, in our Miro board, we use a Zapier
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:45.080]   and Google Docs. But the information gets put into one spot. I don't know how to describe this
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:49.720]   because it could be anything you want. It's completely plastic. It's completely, whether you're
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:58.120]   working from home in a hybrid workspace, it's something that everyone can use to collaborate,
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:05.400]   to brainstorm. Miro's infinite shared boards give product teams a perpetual space, a single source
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:10.840]   of truth. They just drag and drop insights and data imported from any tool. Nothing is lost,
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:17.320]   nothing is forgotten. It's not a notebook. It's not a whiteboard. It's everything. It's more than
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:22.600]   both. It's a synergy. It covers a breadth of use cases so you can build, it's very visual.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.400]   So you can build visual assets. It texts, works great in Miro. You can present findings. You can
[01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.760]   run brainstorms with cross-functional teams. You can zoom in to get the detail. You can zoom out
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:38.120]   to get the overview. You can build out your product vision on a Miro board by brainstorming with
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:44.920]   sticky notes, with comments, with live reactions. There's a voting tool. I love the timer. So if
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:50.680]   you're in a meeting or in a Zoom call, you can come to consensus quickly. You can express yourself,
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:55.240]   of course, in creative ways and bring the whole group together around one idea, whether it's a
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:00.680]   wireframe. You could draw with a pen tool. Forget napkins. You've got Miro putting images and mockups
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:06.200]   on the Miro board, kind of a dream board, a vision board. Miro users report saving up to 80 hours
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:11.960]   per user per year. That's like two weeks of vacation a year just by streamlining conversations
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:18.520]   and cutting down meetings. And don't we all want to do that? My strongest recommendation is you go
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:26.760]   to the Miroverse. When you go to Miro.com/podcast, you don't even have to log in. Although I'm
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.840]   going to tell you right now, you can create your first three boards free. So you can't, I would
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.160]   suggest you do that. Miro.com/podcast, create the account, get the three boards, then go to the
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:41.400]   Miroverse because this is an amazing collection of things people have created with Miro. And it'll
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:49.240]   give you a much better idea of what you can do with Miro. A mind map, a retro, a SWOT analysis,
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:56.520]   what a Harry Potter retrospective. That's from the UK government. All's anything, right?
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:03.400]   It takes over from if you've been using Visio, other visual tools like that, it could do all of that.
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:11.800]   You can sketch with the pen. You can, it's, so I can't really describe what Miro could be to you
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:18.600]   because I don't know, but you can find out if you go to Miro.com/podcast. Your first three boards
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:24.680]   are free. Here's a, something WebEx posted, a post-meeting summary after your WebEx meeting.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:36.040]   Just some great stuff. Pitch decks, brainstorming. Miro.com/podcast, your first three boards are free.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:41.400]   Your team will always stay connected with real-time information. It gives project managers and
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.120]   product leads a bird's eye view of the whole project. Nothing slips through the cracks.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:52.360]   It's so successful, they have more than a million monthly active users. That gives you some idea.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:57.160]   It's a tool you will want to use. Get your first three boards for free. Start working better.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:07.000]   Miro, M-I-R-O.com/podcast. Miro.com/podcast. We thank you so much for their support of
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.440]   Mac Break Weekly. I can give a little testimonial for that. Do you use it?
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:21.480]   Amazing. I built an app with WWT from World Wide Tech and other spots are of ours.
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:28.920]   We built an app together and they built everything inside of Miro. I spent days,
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:35.160]   days worth of time in Miro with them, thinking through the whole process and methodically laying
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:39.240]   out everything we're going to do and the timelines and all the bits and pieces and all the ideas
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:43.400]   and all the things it has to do and all the bits and pieces. It came out great.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:51.160]   It's so good to test one of them. I don't even know how we would have done it without Miro.
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:57.240]   That's the challenge. Working on an app together, your ideas and then the developers have to
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:01.720]   implement it. They're asking questions and then we're color coding things and then we're tying
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.560]   things together and we're grouping them over. This is the stuff that's good to have. This is
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:13.560]   the stuff that we have to have. This is the good to have and then it just disappears and rolls off
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:22.600]   the end. It's somewhere on the board. You keep a corral of that information. It was super, super
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:33.320]   powerful. You were not here when the six color charts came out. Last week with the Apple results,
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:38.200]   we used them though, Jason. Thank you very much. Thank you. I appreciate that.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:45.000]   One of the things that stood out was growth in services. This has been very profitable for Apple.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:52.040]   Much of it's the App Store. I wonder if Apple TV+ is part of this. They're losing
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:36:02.120]   an executive in charge of TV+ and sports. It's not so creative though. It's the business guy at the
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:07.800]   top. It's interesting because they say that he's being, basically he's got people who
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:12.200]   report to them. There's a guy who's in charge of sports and then there's an open position that
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:18.600]   they've created. It sort of almost sounds like he was in charge of, he was like a roll up guy
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:23.000]   and now they're just going to have a person in charge of sports and a person in charge of the
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:29.800]   business side of TV. He came from Hulu 10 years ago. He wanted to help build this, I guess.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:36.920]   Is there a lot of departures as noted in that report in the services area. I do wonder if there's
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:43.960]   a succession style intrigue going on around Eddy Q. Is Eddy Q planning on retiring and they're
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.760]   going to the mattresses and they're settling all debts? Or is it really just the natural thing that
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:52.280]   happens at Apple, which is you work at Apple for a while, you make a lot of money and then you go
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.800]   somewhere else? I don't know. You collect your stock and then you go back to GM.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:07.560]   I think things are changing. At Apple, maybe a little succession happening.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:15.400]   Who else left? This is the third major exit from Apple's Services Organization, Vice President
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:21.400]   Peter Stern and Michael Abbott. Stern ran services businesses and was Distad's boss.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:28.360]   This does lend itself to that succession theory. Abbott, meanwhile oversaw Apple's Cloud Services
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:34.680]   group. Abbott's the guy who's going to GM to help them design their good luck GM,
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:45.720]   their Apple CarPlay replacement. Good luck GM. You think Eddy is retiring? What's the theory here?
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:49.880]   You got it. I don't know. When you see all that movement, you wonder if something else is going
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.320]   on there. I really don't want to start a rumor that Eddy Q is retiring or something.
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.920]   But I see this as something's going on. I don't know whether it's because it seems unlikely that
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:05.080]   all of these things are random. It could be, but I'd say it's unlikely. There's more that there
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:10.120]   is something going on there. It may not involve somebody like Eddy leaving. It may be more like,
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:15.880]   our services business now is not what it looked like eight years ago. It doesn't like the sports
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.440]   and TV thing is a great example. We had the one guy in charge of sports and TV and now they're
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:24.360]   going to have two people. The guy who's in charge of sports and somebody they're going to hire and
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:30.440]   charge a TV. It may be that too, which is just like, we're going to do a reorg. We're going to give
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:35.000]   people new responsibilities. Some people are going to take that as an opportunity to step off
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:42.840]   and cash out. Other people get to step up. It may simply be that because that business really
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:47.960]   has changed enormously in the last decade. Services now, as you point out, 20% of Apple's
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:54.040]   revenue, one fifth of Apple's revenue. It's a big deal. Again, it's not TV necessarily,
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:59.880]   but TV is a part of it. Apple has big ambitions with TV between major league baseball and soccer.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:04.680]   It is getting started again. We were talking on Sunday, Amy Webb said, repeated the thing I've
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:12.840]   said before, which is something's missing from Apple's shows. It's just a little too overproduced.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:20.520]   Yeah. Too many notes. Now, I'm starting to enjoy. I'm starting to sever some things.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:23.560]   There's some great shows. Severance was great. Slow horses was amazing.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:30.440]   I'm really enjoying Silo. Silo, for me, the jury's out on that. We've only seen three episodes.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:39.080]   I'm getting hooked. I got hooked. Did you read the books? No. I don't read fiction because then
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:43.400]   it would ruin the show. I don't want to know what I'm missing. I just want to enjoy the show as it is.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:50.360]   My trick is to read books that are unadaptable. Then you're fine. You can read those books. They'll
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:59.640]   never make a movie out of watchmen. Surely. They don't have a game of thrones yet, do they?
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.600]   But then nobody does. Everybody's struggling to find that game of thrones.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:06.920]   I think Ted Lasso is the closest big hit that they've had so far.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:16.360]   Yeah. To be fair, I have to say that my preconception of Apple TV was always that
[01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:24.040]   it's about their exclusive content and they haven't been really doing much to build a catalog.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:29.400]   But now they've got a couple TV shows that they've been meaning to catch up on. They got marooned,
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:36.360]   which that Gene Hackman Gregory Peck of NASA astronauts being stranded in space,
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:43.160]   being rescued by the rescues in 1970. Mr. Science 33,000 did a little. Are they making it or they
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:51.240]   have the actual money? No, they have it. That's such an esoteric, cool movie that would get my
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:41:00.040]   attention on any service. Oh, look, another true crime podcast turned into a five episode streaming.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:06.280]   Okay, we are hearing that severance has been hampered by the writer's strike that they were
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:12.520]   working on and they've had a stop. Well, some some stuff's done, right? So some stuff is done
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:15.880]   by the problem is then some stuff says, Oh, we're just going to go shoot. Well, the writers are
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:21.160]   part of that kind of the right of all every they're sitting there shooting your their rewriting
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:28.280]   in every day while they're on set. It's like Apple stuff. I feel Apple stuff lacks edge a little bit.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.240]   I don't know what added to it. It goes through one too many rounds of polish. Like that's the,
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:37.080]   like to me, that's the problem with even even with Silo, which I'm enjoying,
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.840]   it just feels like it went through one, you know, it went through the polisher. There's just no,
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:45.800]   there's just a couple sharp edges that are missing somewhere there that it just goes through it.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:49.880]   And it's beautiful. I mean, like I, as a production person, I look at it and go,
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.120]   well, that was really expensive. You know, like that was one of the really nice car, you know,
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:42:00.680]   and so, but, but I still feel like everything I watch there just feels like it's one, they could
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:04.440]   afford one more round where, you know, because we always say in production, you know, you don't
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:09.240]   finish any project. You just run out of time. Like, you know, you submit what you had and there's
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:12.600]   a certain edge to it. And it just feels like they did finish every project.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:17.720]   When it works, I'd say it works because I do sort of agree with you. There's a look and a feel to
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:24.120]   them. I think when it works is when it's either fantastical or dreamlike sort of intentionally.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:29.960]   So like severance, I think works because it's so polished, it's uncanny. And that's what they're
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:35.480]   going for. And it's a good fit of material to style. I think for all mankind, sometimes when it
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:39.640]   really works well, it's the same kind of thing where it is meant to be this sort of fantastical
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:46.040]   thing. I think maybe even Ted Lasso, arguably, is a golden glow of happy, you know, it's not really
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:50.840]   realistic. But then there's Schmigadoon, right? You can go too far in that direction as well.
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:55.080]   I don't know. I kind of like, I kind of like Schmigadoon. I thought it was funny.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:58.920]   And I liked that, you know, the kind of offhand references to Munich musicals, but
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:05.800]   Ghosted was god awful. Slow horses is interesting because it's actually out of there. They have a
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.840]   UK production executive. Yeah. And so it's out of a different part of, you're right,
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:15.560]   with a different sensibility in a lot of ways. Slow horses was a very non-evil TV plus.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.680]   In fact, at first I looked at it, I said, oh, they bought this. They didn't make this.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:22.360]   Yeah. But they didn't. They hired a BBC executive to head off their Europe.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:25.240]   You know, Tetris was pretty good. Did you like Tetris?
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.080]   Tetris was really good. I really enjoyed Tetris. I really enjoyed it. I don't think it's a very
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:32.680]   good movie, but I didn't care because I really enjoyed it. Maybe that's why I liked it. You're
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:37.960]   right. Yeah. There were some structural issues with it. Luck, which should have been a huge success,
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:46.920]   fell on its face, even though they had Pixar's disgraced John, John Lasseter.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:47.320]   John Lasseter.
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:53.160]   Lasseter had the magic touch at Pissed Pixar, but maybe something had an
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:54.520]   example. I got fired because he...
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:44:00.840]   Well, I know John pretty well. He was a hugger. He hugged me. Might have squeezed my buttocks.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:06.600]   I don't remember, but I don't think it was personal. He was a hugger. That was his thing.
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:12.200]   I don't know what happened. I don't know him, but yeah.
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.400]   I like John Lasseter.
[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:17.880]   And he's very talented, but he couldn't make Luck a success, which is interesting.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:21.080]   Although Luck was...
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:21.720]   Luck was...
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.000]   Luck was going through a slump, I think.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:29.400]   Luck was a success in the sense. There was an argument to be made because of somebody I do a
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:35.000]   podcast with, another podcast in a different place. Julia Alexander from Parent Research,
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:42.520]   she says that Luck actually did okay for Apple. Like, based on Apple's size of its audience and
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:46.760]   the fact that they want more children's and family-friendly programming, that Luck kind of
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.000]   did what it was intended to do. And Luck on Apple TV is never going to do the same kind of
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.560]   number that Luck on Amazon or on Netflix is going to do, but that it sort of like did
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:45:01.000]   its job. It did not break through and become a thing that everybody signed up for Apple TV for,
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.480]   but that in the context of Apple's service, it did its job of providing that content.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:09.400]   So it depends on... I think the challenge here is Apple really does want...
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:14.840]   What's the biggest that an Apple TV+ show can be? Is it Ted Lasso? Is that as big as it will ever get?
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.560]   I think so. Yeah.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:23.000]   And the morning show was a flop, right? They put all their eggs in that basket, big cast, big money,
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:30.760]   and flop. You know, I noticed that the Will Smith vehicle, Emancipation,
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:34.040]   is no longer on their front page on their website.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.920]   Oh. Yeah. You know, and at that time...
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.200]   And the hardest... You play really hard foundation I didn't even make through.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.600]   No. And they've brought it back by, they've renewed it.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:49.880]   So you can not watch a second season now. Yeah, exactly. But even like, you know, there's
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:55.160]   huge risk. I mean, I think that HBO guy and I got into a mode where they figured this out,
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.560]   even though I don't know if they'll continue to figure that out, but they,
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:05.800]   with... They had a lot of things that did well. But like with the one ring from Amazon is, you know,
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:07.160]   flop, okay. Yeah.
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.920]   They spent so much money on that.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:12.520]   Yeah. Well, just acquiring the rights spent like a quarter billion dollars for the rights.
[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:16.440]   But they spent all the monies on that on that. And so I think that trying to,
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:20.200]   you know, knock something out of the park, I think Apple needs to continue to do...
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:23.320]   I do think that they're... I'm seeing... I guess I'm finding myself
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.080]   watching it more often than I did before. Like that was the...
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:30.920]   Because like me and I have a... You know, if I see that there's a pile of
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:34.440]   shoulds somewhere in a... Oh, this is going to be a big pile of shoulds.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:39.160]   I won't watch it. Like if I see any should... Well, you know, they spent a lot of money on
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.440]   extrapolations, right? This was a very preachy climate change
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:51.640]   a show with big budget stars, including Meryl Streep and Bigg Budget writing and not so hot.
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:57.240]   I just think I don't preach it. My problem is I want to sit down and I want to relax,
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:59.080]   which is the only time I want to watch TV.
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.520]   You don't want to see the end of the world.
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.080]   I just don't want any shoulds. Like I just want to watch a show and have it be a show.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.040]   They should all over you.
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:13.080]   And so the thing is that 90% of Apple's stuff has been, you know, should ridden.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.840]   Do not watch Ghost, you know, and it looks like it's going to be a great popcorn.
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:17.400]   I did watch Ghost.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:17.880]   What did you say?
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.440]   It was horrible.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:19.400]   It was horrible.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:20.200]   I didn't even finish it.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.040]   It's like the perfect popcorn movie.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:22.840]   My great cast...
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.320]   Here's the funny thing is my family enjoyed it.
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.840]   And of all people, my daughter enjoyed it.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.800]   And she's not like that kind of like she just thought it was fun.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:37.160]   And but I was like, it gets into that whole thing I was talking about where it felt like it,
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:40.440]   every sharp edge had been worn off.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:40.920]   There's no.
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.840]   You know, and it was just like this.
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:46.440]   It was like the perfectly produced action film that had no soul.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:47.160]   Like just not seen.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.680]   So completely seared about.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:53.400]   That you, you know, and it was, you know, it had it was like we put all the ingredients in,
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.520]   but there's just three.
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:54.840]   I don't know.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:55.320]   There's nothing.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:56.280]   There's no oven to it.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.000]   No burner.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.280]   And you kind of said this.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:47:59.800]   This is true across the board.
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.520]   Streaming networks are all kind of fumbling.
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.440]   You just described the Netflix movie too.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:05.240]   Right.
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:07.400]   This should have been an Netflix movie actually.
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:09.800]   At least, at least it's properly compressed.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.600]   I mean, it looks good on your 4K OLED.
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:15.160]   That's for sure.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:15.560]   I watched it.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:20.760]   What did I, I just watched the the the J-Lo vehicle.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.200]   I just can't think of the name of it right now.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:22.520]   Mother.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:23.480]   The mother.
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:24.120]   We watched that.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.640]   I mean, you know, it was just Saturday night.
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.440]   We figured we'd watch it.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.480]   Mother's Day.
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.360]   It's got J-Lo.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.080]   Same kind of, not kind of soulless.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.040]   You know, and but the, but the, it was okay.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:34.920]   I mean, it was, it was okay.
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:36.200]   I'll tell you, here's the hazard.
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.400]   But it was horribly compressed.
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.040]   Like it was like.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:38.840]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.200]   It looks so bad.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.000]   It looks bad.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.960]   And I was like, only you noticed that by the way, Alex.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.240]   Netflix compression falls apart on the Apple TV.
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.560]   It seems to be only, it literally seems to be what they're doing.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.360]   There's something about the manifest that they're using inside the Apple TV.
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:56.280]   But on the Apple TV, I got a wired connection, a one gig connection.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.320]   I got, you know, like there's no reason for this to be low quality.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:01.480]   And it falls apart in the dark scenes.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:05.560]   So if you see a movie like Greyman or like the mother, which are,
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.320]   you know, a lot of dark scenes, you're just looking at it.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:12.440]   Like my, when my kids ask what is happening to the image,
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:16.200]   then I know that, you know, we're now getting into the land of it's not working.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:16.600]   So it's.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.360]   The hazard of having a movie like Ghosted,
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.240]   which has so much promise and then falls on its faces.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:23.640]   So much.
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:28.040]   I feel less likely to try to sample an Apple TV show.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.520]   Now I'm going to, you know, by the way, because I'm an Apple one subscriber,
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.160]   I'm going to be getting every, you know, this is, you know, this comes along with the package.
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.040]   But I'm much, much less likely to sample.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:38.920]   I'll look at something.
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:42.680]   I'll go boy, that, you know, invasion now.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:43.640]   That looks interesting.
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:47.240]   And then it breaks my heart and I don't want to take another chance again.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:50.280]   You know, there's too much other stuff that you can watch out there.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:55.160]   I just don't know of any streaming service that I've been exposed to where
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.640]   it really justifies a month to month.
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:58.920]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:01.640]   I mean, I've got, I've got Netflix because that's my baseline.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:03.640]   I don't, I don't know what I want to watch.
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:07.480]   Let's see what's available on X, but Hulu is mostly there.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.480]   So I can watch Bob's burgers and archer.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:13.320]   Like basically, basically Fox network, like animation,
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.080]   without having necessarily recorded on my Plex server.
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.000]   And everything else is like Disney plus it's fine, but I'm going to,
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.840]   I'm going to subscribe to it for a month.
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.840]   I'm going to have like almost marked on the calendar.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:28.520]   I'm here the, here are the five, six, seven things I want to watch in this month.
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:34.360]   And then as soon as I'm done, boom, cancel apple TV plus once Ted Lasso is off after this,
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:35.080]   the third season.
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.080]   Again, it's, I'm like you, I'm going to continue to subscribe to it
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.800]   because it's part of this package that kind of makes financial sense.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:47.000]   But it's, it's disappointing as a lifelong Apple fan to think that the only reason why
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.520]   I have this Apple product is because it's a, it's a, like keeping a fluorescent light fixture on.
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:58.120]   It costs less money to just have it or, or, or my, or my, my landline with my cable package is like,
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.160]   it's, I don't need it.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:00.040]   I don't use it.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:02.680]   I have nothing connected to it, but my package is cheaper.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.600]   If I have this, you don't have this thing.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:09.320]   Well, and, and I think that one of the big scary things for a lot of the streaming companies
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:12.280]   is that Apple and Amazon don't have to make money at it.
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:14.680]   Like they don't, they're playing a different, it's kind of,
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:15.880]   yeah, we've talked about that.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:16.520]   That's right.
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:19.320]   And, and so that's the thing that as, as this gets more competitive,
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:22.760]   because I know that for me, like, um, now we need like, maybe I want to watch
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.160]   Paramount because the Picard thing looked really good,
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.720]   but I haven't, but like Paramount and Peacock came out too late.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.800]   And I was like, I've already subscribed to too much content.
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.680]   I don't want any more.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:34.680]   And so, and so, but I, but if I buy another one, I'm going to get rid of one.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:37.880]   And I think that now that people are starting to shift and figure out that I don't know
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:41.640]   if I need to keep on paying for all of these Apple and Amazon are the ones that are most likely
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.920]   to just keep those subscribers because it's part of a larger package.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.200]   It's kind of a Kaiser Soze model.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.440]   You know, they're always paying more than the job.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:52.360]   I don't care how much Max costs I'm going to buy it for succession.
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.680]   But I admit succession only has two more episodes.
[01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:57.320]   And then I don't know, then I don't know what happens.
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:01.480]   It's, it's, it still just makes financial sense for me to, if they,
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:06.440]   if they make the mistake of making these series like available for purchase on iTunes or available
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.680]   for purchase on the Google Play Store or anywhere else, rather than subscribe,
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:14.520]   I'll, once I find myself getting hooked on something, I will just buy and fire season.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:15.960]   And then I've got it.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.680]   I don't worry about it.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:17.880]   Yeah.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:20.600]   And, and you have it for, and you have it for, you have to be patient.
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.720]   That's the forever ish dish.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:22.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:27.160]   Uh, that's why I guess one of the reasons these networks are looking at sports, right?
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.360]   Because that's the kind of thing.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:29.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.160]   That builds, uh, loyalty.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:31.800]   The big one.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:32.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.000]   Sports is the big one.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.960]   It's the, it's the only thing that you might, you know, and not only do you sit there,
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:39.240]   you'll sit there through the ads because you're, you know, you're in a live experience.
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:39.720]   You have to.
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:46.040]   But in fact, this is, this was a big week for, for that because Peacock, uh, got an NFL playoff
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.040]   game exclusive to Peacock.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:48.440]   Oh my God.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:52.840]   So one of the NFL playoff games will be available, except in the home markets,
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:57.160]   a playoff game for the first time will be available only on streaming.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:52:58.520]   Really interesting, right?
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.320]   That's so dystopian.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.160]   That and cocaine bear, you got me.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:03.640]   You had me.
[01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.880]   That, that seems like a way to educate.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:08.280]   To educate the populace on how to pirate your content.
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.280]   Exactly.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:10.760]   Honestly.
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:11.720]   Wow.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:16.600]   I, I, I figured out how to get the, I, I was using, I was using my VPN to watch your
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:21.240]   vision because I did, I was not going to subscribe to Paramount Plus just to watch your
[01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:25.000]   vision for, to, as totally worth it as it would have been.
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.880]   It's like, if I, if I could just flip, uh, select this pop up menu in my VPN and pretend to
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:38.040]   be Irish on Saturday and get to see the, see the final versus sign up for this channel that has
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:39.640]   only this one thing that I'm interested in.
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:40.760]   You know what?
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.200]   I'm going to do the paralegal thing.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:45.320]   I'm going to hold my nose and pretend that God is looking the other way.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:48.360]   God's always watching you, Andy.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:48.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:51.640]   God, God, God created your vision.
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:51.800]   Okay.
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.800]   That's the kind of God that I believe in.
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.480]   The God that created your vision.
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:59.720]   I think that he, she or whatever would have, what are you, are you happy with the, uh,
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.480]   the outcome of this year's Eurovision?
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:07.320]   It was that seating insane and I loved every moment of it.
[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:07.640]   Okay.
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:10.280]   I think, to me, it's the pre-semi final ones.
[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:14.760]   It's the no spoilers, but the, the, the, it's only like my second year really pig attention to it.
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:15.800]   I never watched it before.
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:18.760]   I knew about it because of ABBA and whatever, 76.
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:26.520]   And the, but, but I watched it this time and it was like, oh, it's, it's, it's, it's, there's a,
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:30.280]   there's a video, there's a video that all, that I'll share to you like later on,
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:34.280]   because it just, it's this beautiful explanation of why people,
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.440]   why Europeans love Eurovision, explained by a French, French lady.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.800]   Cause yes, it is extra.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:40.840]   Yes, it is over the top.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:47.080]   It is just explosion of joy and happiness that gets us through, you know, another son.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.920]   Let's enjoy really well.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:49.640]   Okay.
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:54.920]   I actually, I thought France was robbed personally, but that's, it was, it's, it's, it's, it's a hell
[01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.760]   of a lot of entertainment and there's no end.
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:02.920]   And because it's not American, they didn't try to make us care about anybody in this competition.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:05.160]   That's probably why it was so much.
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:06.120]   It's not bio.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:11.400]   So it's, it's, Deborah, you've been, you, you, you sacrificed a lot to be here Eurovision.
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:11.560]   Yes.
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.160]   My, my grandmother.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:13.640]   I know.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.600]   She, she swallowed the horse.
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.560]   Her art is actually.
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.760]   Is that uniquely American?
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:17.800]   Is that the story there?
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:17.960]   Cause.
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:18.520]   Oh my God.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:19.000]   Lisa.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:19.000]   Lisa.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.960]   Well, it's, Lisa watches both idle and the voice, right?
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.040]   The two big American, uh, cooking, singing competitions.
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:30.360]   And she will, she skips all of that, you know, tear, jerk and drama.
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:31.640]   In between the, the Olympics.
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:32.120]   Singing.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.400]   None of the Olympics is like, I don't need to, you know,
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.400]   I should be in chemotherapy right now, but I think the spirit of music is going to kill my,
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:40.760]   kill my pancreatic cancer.
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:44.680]   You go, Gloria, you speak for all of us.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:45.560]   Like, oh, God.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.080]   So she's not going to good singer.
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:52.360]   By the way, we were mentioning the Leo, have you seen the, for the ABBA thing, have you seen the
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:55.320]   Stockholm syndrome on, this is music on Netflix?
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.280]   No.
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:57.320]   Is it about ABBA?
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:01.160]   So this is, this is music is one of the best series on Netflix, in my opinion.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:05.160]   And it's all about like, it has one whole episode on auto tune and one whole episode.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:05.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:05.640]   Wow.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:06.520]   What's that?
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:10.440]   And, and, um, but one of them is the, they call it the Stockholm syndrome.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.720]   And it shows how ABBA.
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:13.000]   Oh, that's a factory.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:19.160]   But ABBA, um, first got, uh, made it pop, you know, suddenly made,
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.920]   that's how Britney Spears is created.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.880]   She went to Stockholm and they produced the hell of it.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:24.520]   All out of it.
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:28.360]   But it showed all the, out of them came all of these sweet producers.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.280]   And then out of that, and you know, yeah.
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:36.600]   There is this the, uh, the story of fire saga on Netflix.
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.000]   Is this the one you're, is this the one you're talking about?
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.640]   The, uh, back, back story of a little,
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.520]   feral movie.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:43.400]   The will, feral.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:43.960]   No.
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:45.640]   Will, well, Pharaoh, at your vision.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.760]   Is this what you're talking about?
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:47.720]   No, I'm not.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:51.720]   This is to me, this is exactly what your vision looked like.
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:52.520]   I thought.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:52.760]   So.
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:57.960]   So, especially before like the semi-finals, the country center like,
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.320]   look, if we win this, we have to host it next year.
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:02.600]   And we don't want to do that.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:03.880]   We are just going to be.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:04.680]   Absolutely.
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:10.440]   Crazy and be fun and create, create such a wonderful show that nobody will think
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.800]   we're taking it seriously.
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:14.600]   And we will know, we will not be on the hook for this year vision.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.880]   The whole thing is all so pre-produced that the edit is automatic.
[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:21.400]   Like the edit is pre-programmed, you know, for the live show.
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.800]   So it's literally, there's a software that I saw at IBC that just does the
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.480]   Eurovision edit for each one of these performances.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.240]   Because they know exactly when it begins.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:30.440]   They rehearse it.
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:33.400]   All the camera operators know exactly where they need to be.
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:35.240]   The artists, you know, rehearse it.
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:36.200]   They get it all.
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:41.080]   They figure it all out so that the edit, that's why the edit looks so clean and pre-edited.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:44.680]   It's live, but it's basically pre-edited.
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:45.160]   They don't.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.040]   That's an amazing thing.
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:47.800]   It's an amazing use of technology.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.400]   The only thing that's live is the vocals.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:50.600]   All the instruments have to be.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:53.160]   It has to be less than three minutes.
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.320]   And all of the performances can only be vocal.
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:56.920]   This is what I like about it.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.120]   It's like, where's the band?
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.720]   It's a recording?
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:03.480]   The vocals are live for a lot of reasons.
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:07.480]   They're like, no, he can't have like an 80 piece orchestra that's playing for, I don't know.
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.560]   Again, there's a, I just put it in the discord.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:12.920]   YouTuber called it Eurovision.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:17.800]   And it will make you into a fan just like it made me into a fan last year.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.640]   From Hizariel Kastumes.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.640]   How to Eurovision?
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:22.040]   I'm just fine.
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:24.040]   I actually, you, has a wonderful, fun chat.
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:26.440]   And she is very, very excited about Eurovision.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:26.920]   All right.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.280]   I'm willing to get into it.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:28.760]   I am.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:28.760]   I am.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:32.760]   So apparently, I didn't know this.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:34.760]   There have been significant outages.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:38.840]   You know, App Store, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts.
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:43.320]   Not showing on the system's status page.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.840]   Even this was yesterday.
[01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:48.120]   I hadn't, I hadn't experienced this.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:50.120]   And this is not the first time this has happened.
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:51.080]   What's going on?
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:55.000]   It's been, it's been happening kind of routinely.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.880]   Like weather was down for a long time.
[01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:59.000]   Services are spotty.
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.520]   Even the Apple card stuff is occasionally down.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:05.560]   And the, is it article 95 map?
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:07.640]   There's still an issue on weather, by the way,
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.960]   of course, on the Apple, I'm looking at the Apple status page.
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:11.640]   There's still an issue on weather.
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:15.560]   And so they have a rundown January 19th, February 20th, 23rd,
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:19.160]   April 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th, 15th, 24th,
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:23.560]   May 2nd, 5th, 9th, 11th, May 11th, Apple ID services,
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:26.760]   currently down for many users, unable to log in or make payments.
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:29.400]   Apple weather not working for some users,
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:32.120]   third time in this month, Apple Music down for some users,
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:34.360]   and plus Apple card and Apple support.
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:38.680]   Yeah, I mean, that's just, I agree with the headline in 95 Mac.
[01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:42.040]   It's just like, that's, these outages are an unacceptable level.
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:45.160]   That's, it basically shows that I'm glad,
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.960]   it's, Apple has put a lot of investment of their future
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:52.280]   into expanding their services business, but if they don't have it right,
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:55.080]   if they don't have something, if services they've been running for years now,
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:59.400]   are not rock solid, oh boy, they've got a lot of explaining to do.
[01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:03.160]   All cloud services have outages once in a while,
[02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:05.640]   but this seems like an abnormal number.
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:07.240]   It's, Alex, do you have any insight?
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:09.320]   I mean, you know about how this stuff works.
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.560]   I don't, I think they're probably making a bunch of changes for WWDC.
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:12.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.360]   I think that's my guess is the third.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:14.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.760]   They're updating a bunch of things and they are,
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:19.960]   and they're, yeah, I think that's the-
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.480]   Not an excuse though.
[02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.200]   That's not an excuse.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.880]   I'm just saying that I think that there's just,
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:26.680]   they're probably making some significant changes for WWDC.
[02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:29.720]   Yeah, that's when these happen on every cloud service.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:33.960]   You know, oh, we pushed a new configuration and it broke everything.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:38.040]   Hey, hey, I'm sorry that you couldn't pay for dinner
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.720]   on your, on Mother's Day, because we had some server problems
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:43.960]   and we couldn't process your Apple card.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:46.920]   That, that's where stuff is like, no, I don't, I don't,
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:50.440]   you're not my best friend and I'm not, I'm not encouraging you to pivot
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:53.960]   from a job you don't like into this wonderful new dream of running a cloud service.
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:57.720]   You are a two trillion dollar company that is, I've paid for services from,
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:00.440]   they should be reliable, a random outage every now and then.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.200]   That's just the luck of the draw.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.520]   But again, when you have two or three months in which
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:08.600]   I'm almost, I'm almost every time, every time that this comes up to one of my news feeds
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:10.600]   or someone talks, tells me about it.
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.640]   I have to figure out, was it, was this something new today?
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.800]   Are they talking about the thing from two days ago?
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:17.800]   Are they talking about the thing from last week?
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:18.760]   That's bad, man.
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.360]   Yeah, that's bad, isn't it?
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:26.440]   Here's the down detector snapshot from May 12th, a couple of days ago.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:29.880]   And that, that really, those, those flat lines, that's flatlined.
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:31.640]   Not good.
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:33.160]   Not good.
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:35.080]   Yeah, I wonder what they're up to.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.840]   It does feel like they're, they're doing something.
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.560]   Maybe this is a prelude to being much more reliable.
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:45.480]   Let's cross our fingers anyway.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:51.240]   Maybe they're moving from, from Amazon to, to Google Cloud servers.
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:52.120]   Maybe that's what they're doing.
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:53.560]   There was a leak.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:59.720]   This is from nine to five Mac that claims Apple uses a multi-step sting operation to
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:04.280]   identify and fire leakers ahead of WWDC.
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.600]   And, you know, they leave out commas, they put in commas.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:14.600]   On Wednesday, this is, this story was from May 10th.
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:20.120]   So on last Wednesday morning, the leaker account that was on Twitter claiming to
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:24.360]   know a broad range of details of Apple's upcoming software releases went silent.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.840]   Source posted an update in which they claimed Apple identified their source and
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:31.880]   fired her through a multi-step sting operation.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:38.760]   The leaker analyst 941, I guess, had a single source inside of Apple.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:40.840]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:47.000]   And he was, and he broke, he was leaking information about the release of Final Cut Pro for iPad.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.880]   And of course, the day, this, this, this story about his source being fired from Apple and being
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:58.280]   targeted by a sting operation came, like the day over the day after that was released,
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:01.080]   because that was the, the canary that Apple was using.
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:08.280]   They, they, they released, released information for new versus the Final Cut Mac and the Final Cut
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:13.160]   for, for iPad, different release dates for each person who was suspected of being the source of
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:13.720]   the leak.
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:19.560]   And so when the leaker basically said, hey, we're not seeing this until 2024, we're
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:24.040]   not going to see Final Cut for, for iPad until later this year, essentially that was, yep,
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.600]   that was the cubicle eight.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.720]   Plicky, come to the office and bring everything in your office with you.
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:30.840]   Yeah.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:39.160]   And also, analyst 941 kind of blew it by saying, it's my sister and she's working in with Craig
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:39.800]   Federighi.
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.720]   That was, that's pretty much going to narrow it down there.
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:44.440]   Yeah.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:51.080]   995 Mac decided to follow that up by talking about, well, yeah, this is, this is why when we get
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:55.160]   information, like we don't just simply cut and paste because there can be this, these
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:58.680]   are techniques that we've been hearing about, not just from Apple from other companies elsewhere.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:03:59.240]   Oh, sure.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:07.240]   You can have, you can have a, anc codes that are 19 spaces, but they only actually display one of
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:12.200]   them. There can be like certain language that could be the placement of a comma in press material.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.040]   Something is a certain shade of blue.
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:18.360]   Again, all of these combined together that if someone is foolish enough to simply copy,
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:23.160]   copy, paste or quote directly, it allows a company that's suspicious of eight people to figure out
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:27.800]   which of the eight was doing it. And this, this, this person, oh boy, I don't, I don't know what
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:31.560]   they do for a living, but it's not, it's not reporting or, and if it is reporting, it's not
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:37.560]   something that they were counting on doing for more than, for more than like eight mortgage payments
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:39.800]   because that's not, you're not, you're not going to last that way.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:48.200]   Can't smell her writing a 9 to 5 Mac says the entire story leaks of lot, reeks of lies and saving
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:53.800]   face. But you know, I can remember back to Steve Jobs where they would have differing.
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.720]   There was a, you know, the way about this, Alex, don't you?
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:03.320]   When, because it used to be, I mean, Apple, you didn't, you didn't even have to be your,
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.960]   beer board them. Beer boarding is, you know, you take everybody out to drink.
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:12.200]   Some people break down and, and you didn't eat Apple employees back in the 90s. You could just
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:15.240]   get all kind, you didn't know what the next year or two is going to have, is going to be.
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:20.680]   And then suddenly, I mean, it felt like a week. It was just like, nope, nobody's talking. And
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:26.120]   I asked somebody about that that might know. And they were like, well, Steve, Steve gave out a code.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:33.880]   He gave out a product name to three executives, just saying this is what's coming up and,
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:41.000]   and he said, you know, don't, if this leaks out, you know, no one's going to, you're,
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.840]   all three of you're getting fired. And it leaked out. And it wasn't even the right product name.
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:47.960]   It was a different product name, but all three of them got fired. Like he didn't care.
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:52.040]   Then they were pretty relatively high up and they all got fired that week. And no one,
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:57.000]   everyone stopped talking. Yeah. A lot of apricot orchards in the Apple campus,
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000]   a lot of secrets get buried in those apricot orchards. But that was it. That was the,
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:07.400]   that was the story. The story was three people took, took the hit and some people had said that
[02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:10.760]   they weren't even sure if it wasn't Steve that linked it himself so that he could just make the point.
[02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:15.240]   I learned that from Game of Thrones. Always a good idea to put the heads of your enemies on
[02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:19.320]   spikes on your outer walls just to let them know. Yeah, exactly. So that was a little spike. But
[02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:23.240]   it was like, it felt like, and again, it felt like it was just night and day. I don't know,
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:28.520]   Jason remembered it changing the weather changing so quickly, but we weren't, and Andy,
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:33.000]   we weren't using in this, you know, secret sources back then because that was the,
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.360]   it was actually Mac week, which was there. That was their whole thing. And yeah, the apple,
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:42.680]   yeah, in the 90s leak. But the fact is the apple leaks today, mostly it's from the supply chain,
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:48.680]   but it still does happen. It's these, you know, yeah, I mean, 95 max point is good. And Mark German
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:54.520]   makes the same kind of argument that the, you know, they're trying to give the information that
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:59.240]   they feel good about, but not play the game where they're so precise that their sources can be
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:07.320]   identified. And we have this now phenomenon of random leakers appearing on Twitter or in forums
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:11.800]   and they could be liars or they could be true. You could actually set up like five different
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:17.160]   accounts, each of which makes a guess and the one that's right. You say, see this person's reliable,
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:23.080]   and then you can play that game. But at the same time, they're playing a professional game and
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:27.560]   they're amateurs and they can get burned. So it's possible that this really happened.
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:32.760]   Who knows? But like, this is also why the professionals sound like apple doesn't leak,
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:38.840]   but they keep it, you know, slow horse for the details of dead drops and other
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:44.840]   sec ops because you really got to study that stuff. Yeah, I know it's saying this is this is
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:50.280]   why like some people have access and some for years and years and years and some people don't,
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:55.720]   because the people who they have sources that they know that I'm not going to, the information
[02:07:55.720 --> 02:08:00.040]   I'm going to give is going to be used in this context. This person is not a bozo. They have
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:03.560]   never burned me or the other people that I know who've spoken to this person before.
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:07.880]   I mean, that means that you're not going to be the first person to say, hey, here's the
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:12.360]   official. It's an orange, but it's sort of a tangerine orange, but they're not calling it tangerine.
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:20.040]   They're calling it mofo go lo, Joe, lo. And like, so you're not going to be the person who breaks
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:24.680]   the story, but it does mean that you are the person who when they speculate about if there
[02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:29.800]   might be new colors, they happen to take a lot of guesses that happen to turn out to be.
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:35.160]   I will defend the presses, you know, constant desire to know and the and the
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.720]   and the right. That's our job to know. I will defend that. But on the other hand, having watched
[02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:46.120]   now a really dull Google event and a really dull Samsung event, all the air was let out of the
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:50.680]   balloon by prior leaks. I kind of understand Apple's design. I mean, we're still talking about what
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:56.360]   are they going to say at WWDC and we will right up to June 4th. It does almost does that to the
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:01.240]   what we think. And I will say, like, as a as an example of all these leaks and all the other
[02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:06.440]   talks, if Apple doesn't come out with a headset in June, like all of us are going to be kind of
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:12.200]   like, what? Well, that's the other thing. We serve the right not to, right? Yeah, by not announcing,
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:18.520]   by not teasing, they can always stop at any point. There's lots of stories that of Apple killing
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:24.200]   products days before, like just taking it taking that section out of the, you know, out of the
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:28.280]   keynote, like, we're not ready to talk about that or the presentation wasn't as good as it could be
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:33.880]   or whatever. And so, you know, they have all that freedom without managing without having to manage
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:40.120]   expectations in that area. But what's interesting is in a lot of companies like Apple, a lot of
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:43.960]   people are willfully not interested. Like they are, they do not want to know what the other
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:49.240]   silo is doing because them having that in their head can get them in trouble, you know, like, and
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.760]   so you can always tell when people have been there for a long time, been at places like that in a
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:56.760]   very long time is because someone starts talking around them about something new and they just
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.600]   go somewhere else, change the subject. Like, I don't want to, I don't want to be, I don't want
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:07.160]   to even know what's happening. It is a Darwinian career track where the people who cannot survive
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:12.440]   in that environment emotionally don't don't stay there very long. I mean, it's really, really
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:19.240]   difficult. You can be a really important research researcher in audio technology. And you were
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.720]   competitive, they were companies were competitive about hiring you and you got a glorious
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:30.040]   offer from Apple. And now you find yourself, we want you to develop an algorithm for this,
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.840]   like, okay, but it'll help for no, is it for phones? You don't need to know that just an algorithm for
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:41.480]   shaping this with this sort of resources. And it can really get you down that I, it's one thing,
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:46.280]   if I'm creating a transistor that could be used for anything, it's another thing if you tell me
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:51.960]   that by the way, we got the contract to do a lot of the circuit logic for the lunar lander.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:58.840]   So we are building something that will hopefully put Americans on the moon by the end of 1969.
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:03.160]   That's the sort of thing that gets you up early in the morning and gives, it gives you your
[02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:08.600]   your greatest job satisfaction. And I think that this compartmentalization of Apple,
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:14.200]   it helps the secrecy ball growing. And that's valuable. But sometimes they're not, it's not every
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:18.280]   worker who wants to work on those circumstances.
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:25.720]   Um, what else should we talk about? I think, oh, one more thing has happened to me this week.
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:32.440]   It was kind of sad. My iPhone said, I'm not going to tell you about any more COVID-19 exposures.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:38.600]   So just forget about it. April, you may remember back to April 2020 in the throws,
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:44.600]   the first throws of the pandemic, Google and Apple got together and proposed a exposure
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:50.440]   notification system that would require cooperation from the states. California was one,
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:56.200]   Washington state was another, and I had them turned on both. Never got any. I think I got
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:03.160]   one from Washington state like three weeks after I got COVID. But it wasn't a system that was
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:08.360]   destined to work for a variety of reasons. But they have now turned it off. It's over.
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:14.200]   States have turned off the COVID-19 exposure notifications now that the public
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:21.320]   emergency is over. It was pretty exciting though, how quickly that system got put together
[02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:29.960]   and with two companies like Apple and Google. Did anybody else have a, not a, not a, a, a
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:35.240]   shiver of excitement? But oh my God, I'm seeing a combined Google and Apple logo. It's, it's like
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:41.400]   I'm in an alternate universe where Apple fell on hard times or Google fell on hard times and
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:49.880]   a check was written. And now they're both the same company. Yeah. Apparently 26 of the 52 states
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:54.520]   released apps. We met 52. That's the number of deck cards in a deck. 50 states.
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:01.800]   Less a little more than half of the states released apps to make full use of notifications. 36 million
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:06.040]   Americans. That's all installed in app or enabled exposure notifications. Remember,
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:11.560]   exposure notifications first had to be an app from the state and then Apple and Google allowed
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:15.320]   you to turn it on in the settings, which I did because I wanted to be a good person.
[02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:23.000]   I'm only 36 million other people did. There is some evidence that the, according to end gadget,
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.200]   the tech prevented cases. Washington state's app may have prevented 50 500 cases in its first
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:33.960]   four months, even though most of the population wasn't using it. California's Department of Public
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:38.520]   Health says is still studying the benefits of the state's apps. Certainly that would be an
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:43.240]   appropriate thing to look into. This isn't the last time we're going to have a pandemic.
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:47.880]   It might be a good thing to know, you know, is this the way to do it or are there other ways
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:54.280]   to do it? It's a gadget says, don't be surprised if health agencies and tech companies are better
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:14:02.120]   prepared going forward. Oh, no, I will be surprised. I will be very surprised. I expect nothing but
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:08.920]   incompetence. Depends on such state for the next major federal election. Yes. If it's in people's
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:16.120]   good best interest to actually save lives, great. Otherwise, yeah. Yeah. Let me take a little break
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:22.040]   and then if you would, my friends prepare your picks of the week, just a moment of first, though,
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:30.280]   a little plug from my dear friends, the people who are club twit members. Patrick, how many club
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:36.200]   twit members do we have now? Yes, he can do a little Elroy will tell you, I think, do we know?
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:47.640]   7,500? 7,050. That's very nice. Thank you to you. Those people are paying seven bucks a month or
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:55.160]   more to get ad free versions of all of our shows to get access to the club twit discord, which is
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:04.280]   a blast 7,337 says Patrick. That's kind of late. Isn't it? It's late. Is that accurate?
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:13.240]   It's actually teat, but that's close enough. Thank you to all of you who are members,
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:20.120]   access to the club twit discord, I think is part of the fun. You also get the shows that we put out
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:24.520]   in the club, but don't put out in public. We do a lot of events. Thanks to our community manager,
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:29.640]   Aunt Pruitt. He does a great job. In fact, we've got five events upcoming, a fireside chat with
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.440]   Sean Powers, the host of Floss Weekly, the home theater geeks. We do every Thursday.
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:39.960]   We went some months like that. We went some months on Thursday, June 15th, the next one.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:45.800]   That's an example of a show that we did for a while. Couldn't generate enough ad support or
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.760]   listener support to continue. So we canceled it, but we brought it back in the club. Club
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:55.560]   members are paying for it. And you know, if it grows and generates an audience and advertising,
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:00.600]   we'll put it out in public. Stacey's book clubs coming up in the next month, The Terror of Formors,
[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:07.880]   Annalie Newitz's newest book. John, John, Jim, be a little nervous about this on July 14th.
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:16.120]   It'll be an after hours inside twit with whiskey and fun for all. And then a fireside chat with
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:20.600]   Rod Pyle and other success story out of the club this week in space launched, if you will,
[02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:25.560]   in the club and now as public. We also do the hands on Mac show, hands on windows,
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:31.800]   untitled Linux show, the Gizfiz. And as I said, Scott Wilkinson's home theater keeks in the club
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:36.680]   and if your club member, you get to hear all of those shows plus ad free versions of everything.
[02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:40.920]   You wouldn't even hear this promo. So really, there's no point in me thanking club twit members
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:47.400]   because they're not hearing this. Nevertheless, we are very grateful is a huge portion of our
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:53.960]   budget to this point. And with 7000 plus members, that's wonderful. And we're hoping to make it
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:17:01.960]   even more. I'd love to see 7000 is about 1% of our total audience are monthly active listeners
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:09.320]   monthly listeners. I'd love to see it get to 5%. That would really help us kind of solidify our
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:16.520]   future. You want to join please twit.tv/club twit. There's family plans, there's corporate plans
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:25.320]   and individual plans as well. Twit.tv/club twit. Thank you. Thank you. Alex Lindsay, I don't
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:28.360]   usually start with you on the pick of the week because I'm always scared that I'm going to be
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:33.480]   spending a lot of money. Not too expensive this time. I'm going to try to save everybody a little
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:38.280]   time. So I'm trying to build like a little camera system with these little cameras. These are the,
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:43.720]   I've already talked about these. These are the Insta360 links. So yeah, these are little PTC
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:48.440]   cameras. And I'm trying to build, I want to be able to send a kit out so that someone can like just
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:52.760]   plug them all into the Mac mini and I use a zoom room to just pull all the individual feeds back
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:57.320]   to me so that they can show how to use a, how they're using a product or do a cooking. We've
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:02.280]   been talking about doing cooking stuff. The hard part is how do you get long cables to these that
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:08.120]   actually work? They're a 4k camera. They require some power. And man, have I gone through a lot of
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:12.680]   cables? Like I think I've bought six USB-C cables right now. And I finally found one that worked.
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:17.800]   So I tell everyone so you don't, if you ever decide you need long USB cables, the longest I've
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:22.920]   been able to get to work is 10 feet. And otherwise they just turn on and turn off. But in those
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:29.560]   cables, these, I don't even know how to say it. Anope, A-Nope. It's a Kia. It's a Neo-Lojism from a
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:34.520]   Chinese company that doesn't speak English. So you pronounce it really where you want to.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:41.240]   But I will tell you that I cannot find other ones that work reliably. These ones so far.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:45.160]   And so if you're looking for trying to put cameras in a couple places, 10 feet is as far as I've
[02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:51.560]   gotten so far. I've gotten ones that the key is is that they have to be minimum version 3.2
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:59.320]   Gen 2. So these are 10 gig, 100 watt. But there's other ones that have listed that they say they
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:03.800]   do that and they don't. So and these are the other thing that's important about these is that they
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:10.200]   have a right turn on it. And that becomes important. Because you plug that into the camera end?
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.880]   When you put it in the camera end, you want it to go to the side. Otherwise it just spins out.
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:15.800]   I'll pull the camera. Something else. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:20.360]   Yeah. With it. So anyway, I'll show more when we get it closer because it's kind of,
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:25.880]   I think it'll be a fun little kit. But but it has been a lot of, I've got a lot of capabilities.
[02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:34.040]   Is that the best webcam? There's two that we're looking at. So the webcam that Obsbot makes a
[02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:38.360]   4K version, we haven't gotten it yet because it's in prerelease. The only reason that we
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:44.120]   potentially want to use it more than the Insta360 is because it supports OSC open sound control,
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:49.320]   which means that we can control all the aspects of the camera through programs like Isadora and
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.960]   other things like that. So we're interested in in the Obsbot, but we haven't used it as far as
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:20:01.000]   what I've used. This is the best webcam I've used. So this is this is a the the Insta360 link.
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.720]   It's about 300 bucks. It is definitely the best webcam we've used.
[02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:11.080]   Is it as good as using your iPhone with Camo or with the Mac OS?
[02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:15.720]   It's different. So I will tell you that the color looks better on the camera on the on the
[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:20.200]   iPhone camera, but you can get out of the gate, but this has full on tele control.
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:24.600]   Oh, okay. And it's a PTC. You can so you can hang it upside down also and have it be a product
[02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:29.640]   camera. You can put it, you know, it's got a it's got a built into it a quarter 20 on the bottom.
[02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:35.400]   It also will open up to go on to a monitor. So it's it's a it's really small. And and so and
[02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:39.800]   it doesn't. It's easy to say that you want to use a phone, but constantly connecting your phone
[02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:46.680]   to your computer. Not so fun. Like so I know like in a pinch. Fine, but it's not what you build
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:51.320]   around. You know, and so it's also not a replacement for the camera that I'm using, which is a Sony
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:21:00.040]   FX 30, but but as a as a travel camera and also again, what we're looking at is how do you have a
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:04.360]   digital event where someone's showing you a product or showing you something on a desk.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:10.120]   And these PTCs become super powerful. If you, you know, any kind of PTC, but right now the
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:15.560]   ABAS bot is one we're looking at. If Insta360 added OSC, we'd stop. Is the ABAS bot the new
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:22.360]   tiny two? Is that what you want to? I think it's the new tiny 4K. It's for the it's the tiny
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:26.600]   two. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And it has OSC support. It's got a great it looks like it has a really
[02:21:26.600 --> 02:21:32.200]   nice chip on it. And but we haven't we haven't tested yet because it's in pre it was in pre
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:36.760]   order. I have as last week, maybe it's still pre order. Yeah. And so it's in pre order. And so we
[02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:41.480]   haven't and I haven't gotten early release or anything else. And so I have like four of these guys
[02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:46.120]   and I've been really happy with them. We use them for a lot of stuff. I mean, you can, you know,
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:51.560]   one of the what we're, you know, what we're doing is using a Mac mini pro and putting all four cameras
[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:56.200]   into into that Mac mini. And then not trying to cut on the ship, not trying to cut on the Mac
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:22:00.520]   mini, just sending all feeds back into zoom and then using zoom ISO on the other end to grab all
[02:22:00.520 --> 02:22:05.320]   those feeds and put them back into our back and STI sending them back to us. So.
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:10.520]   Well, and the point is, of course, that the pick is not the camera. The pick is the cable,
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:14.520]   the cable, which turns out to be harder to find than the camera.
[02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:18.840]   Pretty easy. I was like, Oh, I ordered one of them. But it has been like a week and a half of
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:24.120]   me ordering cables, you know, and downloading them and then going, Oh, sorry. Hello. But
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:30.360]   my screen saver turned on on my other computer is keyed over and it's on a draw. So anyway,
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:31.960]   I forgot to turn that off.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:38.600]   Hey, I in O P E A nope, which is the only one on name. It's a terrible name, but it's the only
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:44.440]   one on AI. No, maybe it's AI. No, maybe they're making a statement about AI. Yeah, exactly.
[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:49.720]   I think they're making a statement about me. It's about you. I feel very very.
[02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:56.840]   And he and I go no, no, no, no, fine. Andy and I don't know that much.
[02:22:56.840 --> 02:23:00.520]   I think you think of me proper.
[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:04.600]   Elephants, elephants, egg yolks.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:14.120]   Well, if you forget the name now, you're really not trying too hard. It's on Amazon, about 18
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:22.040]   bucks, 19 bucks, 1899, the A nope, USBC. They actually have a six foot as well. But
[02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:26.360]   the challenge, all the six foots work. So if you're looking for a long one,
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:30.680]   like the six foots all work. That's not a problem. It's the long ones that the 10 feet
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:35.800]   and above. And again, the only reason I made it a pick was because I've put so much work into it.
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:38.600]   And it was just like, well, I don't want everybody to have to put so much work into it.
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:41.560]   Oh, this is this is an infrastructure pick. It's very important.
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:46.280]   Yeah. Yeah. And I'm giving everyone a break. I promise next week will be scary again.
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:51.800]   Oh, thank you. This is why I started with you this week. Andy and I go pick of the week.
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:56.840]   This is something really, really handy that's been around for five years that I only discovered
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:24:01.960]   three days ago. That's how some sometimes these things happen. Google registry, they control a
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:06.520]   whole bunch of really bananas top level domains. And they're doing something really interesting with
[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:15.000]   the dot new TLD dot and E w. They're using it as a bunch of shortcuts that like if you have a web
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:22.360]   app like like eBay or Google Docs or Microsoft Office suite, you can register
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:30.600]   a very simple. I can type. If I want to create a new Google Doc, I can go docs.google.com,
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:35.880]   click a button to say create a new document, or I can just type docs.new in the address of my
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:41.880]   browser. And immediately it just opens Google Docs creates a brand new document. This is cool.
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:48.520]   Yeah. If I type Excel dot new, I get a brand new Excel, the cell sheet. If I type post.new,
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:55.560]   I get a brand new post to my WordPress blog. There are like dozens and dozens of these. A lot of these
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:01.560]   are borderline useless, not totally useless. You could see you would put it in the useless category.
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:08.680]   You mean like blockchain dot new? Like create a new, there are some of these like
[02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:13.400]   cellists created. I don't even want to say it was but like all these these productivity apps where
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:18.200]   it's like this thing that you would probably take three days planning and you don't mind clicking
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:24.840]   three buttons to make this happen. Yeah. But but this is loan dot new with Bank West. Yeah. That's
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:29.080]   useful. Sure. This might be in trouble if you need a shortcut for getting new loans. That's
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:34.200]   you've got supply chain issues. You've got cash issues. Adobe's using it though. Create that new
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:38.840]   spark dot new and stories dot new. That's and the thing is if you find one thing that you do all the
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:43.640]   time for me, the number of times where I create a brand new Google Doc, whether it is for a project
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:49.160]   like for a show notes for something that I'm for my Google podcast or whatever, or it's just I need
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:54.440]   a blank document that I can then dump notes into and be able to access everywhere. The number of
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:59.240]   times that I've done that like five step process to create a new Google Doc and just be able to
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:05.800]   talk type docs dot new or or even just create a create a a bookmark in my bookmarks bar and just
[02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:09.640]   be able to click this one button to make that happen. That's pretty darn cool. It's again,
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:14.520]   this is brown for five years and that's good. So many people use it. In fact, our sponsor
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:19.960]   Miro uses it. So you could do Miro dot new to create a new a new collaborative whiteboard. So
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.680]   that's cool. And it's free of course. And because of Google, they might kill it at any moment. But
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:29.240]   for for now, for now, if something cool, there is a little controversy because Google, you know,
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:37.560]   they have a lot of crazy TLDs is is now planning on dot zip and and dot mp4 and like a lot of like
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:43.320]   file name extensions that would make it really, really easy for a bad actor to exactly to create
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:49.000]   like a malicious website that people think are just here is an actual plan. Let's unzip a file.
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:57.000]   Yeah. Yeah, I hope Google recants on that because that is security researchers are freaked out about
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.040]   dot zip. In fact, there is if you if you're curious about it, there's a somebody's put together a
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:08.360]   demo where you go to let me say, find it where you go to a you type in your browser dot something
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:13.320]   dot zip and it will download a file and open it from from a from a from a you know, it's not a
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:19.240]   malicious website. It's a proof of concept. But scary. But who could have foreseen such an abuse
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:26.120]   of such a simple thing? Certainly not a quaint little fudge company like Google. They make fudge
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:31.480]   caramel popcorn. They have pies that are seasonal. Really. Oh, they're already doing it.
[02:27:31.480 --> 02:27:36.600]   We're seeing this get up to speed with that zip starting at $15 a year. So if you are a, you know,
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:43.400]   Malefactor, here's your opportunity. Mr. Jason Snell, pick of the week.
[02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:48.520]   Last year, sometime I talked about one of my favorite all time iOS games, which is all toze
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:54.600]   adventure. Love it. Which is the the beautiful soundtrack beautiful art style left to right.
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:28:00.360]   It's essentially an endless runner where you're snowboarding or sand surfing peaceful calm kind
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:05.720]   of Zen, but also challenging if you want it to be. Well, I love that game so much. And yet if you
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:10.600]   would come to me and said, well, what if you did all those adventure, but instead of flying around
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:17.400]   or surfing around a 2D space essentially from left to right, you are in a giant 3D open world.
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.320]   And that game is called Leia's Horizon.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:26.040]   You're going to say Zelda tears of the kingdom. Well, you can do that. But if you don't want it
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:32.120]   to go there, you can you can fly around the island in Leia's Horizon from Snowman, the same people who
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:39.320]   brought us alto's adventure. It is available. What's the price you say? Free for Netflix members.
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:43.800]   It's a Netflix game. So you got to log in with your Netflix account. It's available in the app
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:50.360]   store and the play store. I've been playing it for the last week. It's so good. It is so good. It is
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:55.880]   the same art style, the same kind of vibe, the same kind of chill background music.
[02:28:55.880 --> 02:29:01.240]   But in and there are a lot of little references that are in there. But instead of being in this 2D
[02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:05.720]   left to right, you are a character with these little flying capes and you have different missions
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:11.720]   that you get to do that involve flying around and discovering this enormous volcanic island with
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:16.920]   its full of villages and people and you can do races with other flyers. And it's kind of uncanny
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:23.800]   how much this looks like Zelda. It is like a super chill iPad Zelda. So if you want to do that,
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:28.680]   like there's no fighting or anything. It's all about like fly here or do this or fly over there.
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:35.960]   But it is I could I honestly cannot believe that this game exists because I loved alto so much. But
[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:41.640]   the idea of it being this three dimensional flying version. But that's what it is. So if you're an
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:48.120]   Netflix subscriber, you just get this on your device. Try it out. The tutorial is really well
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:53.400]   done because you got it's basically just two thumbs on your touchscreen to do all the flying
[02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:58.280]   behaviors. So they have a really nice tutorial that walks you through the various gestures in
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:02.520]   order to fly. And then you just start getting little simple missions and you've and you learn to fly
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:06.920]   and you get to fly better and you get more missions. It's really a beautiful thing. Well done. So
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:11.720]   well done by Snowman. Why is it? Why is our eyes? You know, we mocked it when Netflix said we're
[02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:17.000]   going to get into gaming. Hmm. They got some good games. There are there are a few good
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:23.480]   Netflix games out there already. Very, very interesting. I mean, this is not a pick, but
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:30.280]   I have to give some credit to Mike Asargent. We were talking about gaming and he recommended a game
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:40.520]   on Steam called Timberborn in which you play a beaver. And you build a little beaver community.
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:45.560]   It's kind of like a one of these top down real time strategy games like Age of Empires
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:53.640]   without any combat. So if you so now this will be a whole theme combat free versions of games.
[02:30:54.280 --> 02:31:00.920]   It looks so cute. It's really cute. You get to be a beaver and you build dams. You get pretty
[02:31:00.920 --> 02:31:04.920]   angry. You might have angry beavers, but there's no there's no foes except by the
[02:31:04.920 --> 02:31:10.840]   snowman previous game, which is not does not look like all toast, but it's actually also a very
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:16.280]   entertaining game. It's called Lucky Luna, and it is also a Netflix game. So nice. There are some
