[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.840]   Harry McCracken is here.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.040]   We're going to get Gary Harry to explain the story of the 1981 basic program he wrote
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.120]   that had a bug that he finally fixed 40 years later that we'll talk about the Apple iPhone
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   announcements and what to expect and what not to expect.
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.960]   Plus Microsoft Surface announcements.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.520]   Will there be anything exciting coming this Wednesday?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.400]   There's a lot to talk about and I've got some great people to do it.

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:21.040]   It's time for Twit.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   This week in Tech.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.720]   The show we cover the week's Tech News.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.640]   I thought I'd bring in the senior accomplished journalist for this one because there's nothing
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.520]   to talk about except Apple.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.080]   So we got some heavy hitters.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.880]   Devendra Harderwar joins us.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.000]   He is senior editor at Engadget now in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.640]   Hi, hello, Devendra.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   Hello.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.760]   I'm right outside of Atlanta, but I can reach it.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   It's really close.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.240]   Just an arm's length from Atlanta.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.880]   And Devendra is always a welcome guest now in his new Atlanta basement.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   Yes.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.520]   It's nice to have a basement better than a two bedroom apartment in Brooklyn.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.920]   This is the first because I think normally we have people in Brooklyn, you know, usually
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.960]   have two or three people in Brooklyn.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.200]   So first time we have two people in the Southeast because joining us from Louisville, Kentucky,
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.160]   Jason Heiner, he is editorial director.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.160]   It's seen.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.160]   Hi, Jason.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   Hey.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.240]   So since we're all seniors, do we get like a 20% discount?
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.720]   I don't mean seniors at age.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.160]   I mean senior journalists.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   You're all.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   Important.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.160]   Right.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   Important people now.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.160]   Well, we can't.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   Lindsay Turin time won't come on anymore.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.760]   She says, I don't do journalism anymore.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.240]   I'm all administrative.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.040]   So at some point you get, you know, it's the Peter principle.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.240]   You're going to get pushed upstairs to a managing role.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   And then we're going to have to lose you.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.760]   But for now, still a senior journalist.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   Thank you.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   Thank goodness.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   Thank goodness.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.280]   And also Harry McCracken is here.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.400]   He is a senior technology editor at Fast Company.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Hi, Harry.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.560]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.640]   The technologizer.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.480]   I still call you that because I've known you for so long.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.760]   I enjoy hearing you say that.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.520]   I have to mention we've been talking about before the show, but there are two stories
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.400]   about Harry that were kind of outside your normal beat at Fast Company.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   But I love them.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   Your blog has a story about the Bullwinkle statue in Los Angeles called The Moose and
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.160]   the Showgirl.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.320]   I love this.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.120]   This is on your regular blog, Harry McCracken.com.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120]   This moose.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.000]   The first thing I've written on my own site in years.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.160]   Moose and Squittle.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.680]   I didn't know you were a Bullwinkle fan.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.680]   I am a huge Bullwinkle fan.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.640]   Huge cartoons in general and Bullwinkle in particular.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.680]   See, I'm not a huge cartoon fan.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.720]   Although I admit when I was a kid, my parents would take me to...
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.000]   That was a professor of Brown and the students would have late night showings of roadrunner
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.760]   cartoons.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.520]   I think it was somewhat subversive.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.680]   We would go watch the roadrunner cartoons.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.080]   I think that gave me a taste for subversive cartoons.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.480]   But I've always loved Rocky and Bullwinkle.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.760]   I'm mostly because of the voices.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.200]   The Great Paul Freeze was bought as bednough.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.520]   And June Ferre was Natasha and Rocky.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   And such...
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   - Nel Fenwick.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   - Nel Fenwick?
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   Was he Bullwinkle?
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   - Nel Fenwick.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.360]   June Ferre was Nel Fenwick and the W.E.D.R.T. cartoons.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   She's Nel.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   - Oh, Nel.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   Oh, yes, Nel.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.160]   - Bill Scott, who was also the co-producer and the head writer, was Bullwinkle and Mr.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.880]   Peabody and Dudley Duhre.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.400]   - Wow.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400]   Wow.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400]   Such great cartoons.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.440]   Is there a giant bullwinkle in Los Angeles, however, is the big...
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.560]   - Yeah, well, 60 years ago tomorrow, the Bullwinkle show premiered in primetime.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.920]   It had been a kid show up until then.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.120]   And the Flintstones created this big demand for more adult primetime animation, sort of
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   like the Simpsons did a long time after that.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.800]   So when Bullwinkle came to primetime, Jay Ward wanted to promote it.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.400]   So he built the statue and he hired Jane Mansfield to unveil it.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.600]   And he had this huge party on the sunset strip that shut down the strip and several thousand
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.000]   people showed up.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.200]   And the statue just hung around for years, sort of slowly rotting away.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.360]   And in just the last few years, it was nicely restored and it was moved to city property
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.120]   in West Hollywood.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.920]   And it's about a mile away from where it was.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.320]   But it's been there almost under interrupted, except for the time when it was being restored
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.120]   since 60 years ago.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.400]   - Your article is really a love story to that area of sunset strip.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.560]   There's the Bullwinkle statue and the Sahara girl for the Las Vegas Sahara Hotel, the show
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.600]   girl with a giant rotating sombrero.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.320]   And just a wonderful...
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   Look at that.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.560]   - The Bullwinkle statue was a take off on her.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.960]   She was across the street and was kind of a symbol of the strip back then.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.840]   So instead of holding a sombrero, Bullwinkle's holding Rocky.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   - Exactly.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.960]   - But he's kind of got the same come hither post.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.560]   - And he's wearing a bathing suit.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.720]   - There she is in the background.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   That's a...
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.920]   - They were synchronized.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.960]   They circled around at exactly the same time.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.120]   - Did you ever see it?
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.240]   - The Sahara figure...
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.840]   There were all kinds of things for the story.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.000]   They had to research and what's out there was often incorrect.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.240]   But the Sahara figure shut down.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.320]   They took it down in, I think, 1967.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.560]   So I did not see that.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.320]   I visited the Bullwinkle statue a whole bunch of times though at its old location at the
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   former studio.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.160]   - Here are the two of them rotating synchrony.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.520]   It's a great article.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.440]   Go to harrymacracken.com to read about it.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.680]   And then I have to mention, and I'm sorry guys, we'll get to you in a bit.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.360]   But I have to mention, Harry wrote, "When How old were you in 1981?"
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.840]   - I was 17.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.880]   - When you were a teenager, a basic adventure, as many of us did on these early computers,
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   right?
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.960]   You ended up renting your own software, saving it out to cassette tape.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.760]   You wrote an adventure called Arctic Adventure.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.840]   And this is Arctic81.com, if you want to know more.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:25.200]   It was kind of discovered, it was published in a book called the Captain, Captain, what?
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   - Captain 80.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.360]   - Captain 80, book of basic adventures.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   - For QRS-80.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.600]   - And you would type it in, right?
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.760]   I mean, this was a book of source code that you would type in.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.000]   - Which people did back then?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.160]   - Yeah, I did a lot of that from Compute Magazine.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.080]   You type in this, because it was where you got software.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.560]   But there was a typo in the book.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.000]   No one knew about all these years.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.720]   It never worked.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.960]   - Somebody back then said something up to me about it, but didn't really provide any
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   details.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.880]   And I'm still not sure whether it's my bug or if I somehow introduced into the program,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.520]   because, yeah, the program did not work at all.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.880]   So if anybody had checked this code that was published, they would not have been able
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880]   to play the game.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   We wouldn't understand any commands.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.920]   - I don't know if it's more of a comment on this, the number of people who bought the
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.640]   book or the number of people who actually typed the code in.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.440]   The fact that you only got one bug report and almost used is kind of amazing.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   You fixed it, though.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   - I fixed that.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.560]   I fixed some other bugs.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.720]   I fixed the new bugs I introduced while typing it in.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.320]   I added some stuff, anything I didn't like.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.520]   40 years later, I switched around.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.320]   I had this other, I had also been a slot machine game, and I inserted my slot machine
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.160]   code and my adventure code.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.480]   So now in the architect, you can play a slot machine.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.800]   - Wow.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.680]   So can I, do I still have to type it in or can I tell?
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.960]   - In fact, you've been playing in your browser.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.600]   You not only don't need a TRS80, you don't even need to have like a TRS80 emulator.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.800]   It works in your browser.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.360]   - You are in an igloo.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.440]   Obvious exits out.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.200]   You see a shovel, warm coat.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.680]   Get shovel.
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   It's thinking.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   You see a warm coat.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.080]   Get that warm coat.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.080]   You notice I'm typing warm after me.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.680]   I may not understand that because of the warm.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.680]   Let's see.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   - I don't know what coat me.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.680]   Okay, get coat.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.840]   - One thing I learned is back then, people played so many of these games.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.680]   They sort of intuitively understood stuff like you should just say get coat.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.680]   - Yeah.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.880]   - And I actually made a number of changes based on having people who did not remember
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.440]   this whole world play the game and some stuff that was obvious back then is confusing.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.800]   - It's very cold.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   Obvious exits.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   West and South.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   You see a small igloo.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.280]   Can I just type W?
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   Yes, I can.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   You see an ice flow ocean.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   It's still cold.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.560]   So I think that's enough of Arctic adventure, but you get the idea.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.000]   Harry McCracken's code from 40 years ago.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Holy cow.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   - That's so great.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I read the story, Harry.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.360]   I loved just seeing this whole thing come together, but it also makes me want everybody
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.840]   to do the digital archival work of the stuff that you did.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.280]   I have stuff from the mid '90s.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   I put online.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.000]   I don't know where it is now.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.400]   My friend Charles, who was my friend in high school and was my friend today, updated his
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.880]   adventure from back then.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.680]   That's also an Arctic 81.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.680]   - That's amazing.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.520]   - And then we added references to each other's adventure games so that there's his last ship
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.080]   adventure and I had a ship.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.200]   So I made my ship his last ship.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.920]   So we created a mini universe of 1980s TRSAD adventure games.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:38.960]   - I think it's really a lost generation and the lost, I mean, kids today.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.040]   Anybody today who wasn't around back then really doesn't know anything about this whole
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.040]   era.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.320]   I'm glad that you kind of kept it alive and for us old timers, it's really fun to see.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.560]   So I just wanted to mention both of those articles.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.520]   Read Harry's blog, Harry McCracken.com and arctic81.com.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.400]   You can actually play the Arctic adventure.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.360]   That's not the big story of the week.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.200]   - It is not fun.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.640]   - It's bad to tune in for iPhone stuff and you're playing a text adventure game.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.320]   - It's the lead story.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.000]   No, the big story of course is Apple had an event this week.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.520]   And I'll tell you right up.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.680]   I don't want to color your opinions, gentlemen, but I'll tell you right up front, this is
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.360]   the first iPhone since 2007 that I'm not going to buy.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.760]   - Really?
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.480]   - So Davenray, you don't have a review unit yet.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   Have you been briefed?
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   - No.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   - No, nothing.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   - People who do have reviews can't say they do, so that's another thing.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.040]   But no, I don't have any sort of unit.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.080]   - I've talked to people who do, you know, it's cool.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.600]   - I ordered one, I got up, yeah, 5am on Friday and ordered one for my wife because she says
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   I have to have a new iPhone.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   I said, it's fine.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   She said, you should buy one.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:56.240]   I am in a very unusual position where my wife is urging me to buy a new iPhone.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   I'm saying no.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.960]   - The only man in America whose wife is urging him to buy an iPhone.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.680]   - I don't want a new iPhone.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.520]   I did get the, so they announced the base model iPad has been upgraded.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.200]   They announced a new mini with the same A15 chip, which is cool.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   - The mini looks fantastic.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   - That's, I'll talk about that.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   - I confess I did order that even though I have no use at all.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.640]   But I just like the, I thought maybe this is my new phone is not the phone, but I'll
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.680]   put some software on the mini and I got the LTE version and I could use that as a phone.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.480]   It's not like I make phone calls anymore.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.480]   - Very good.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.120]   Like that mini just looks like it could be both your mini tablet, your e-reader, your
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.040]   little gaming machine, like a little like notepad device when you're out and about like, I
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.560]   foresee a lot of use with that thing.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.160]   - So those were both available if you ordered on Friday.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.840]   I actually could order on the Tuesday.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.400]   It took me off guard.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.760]   Apple actually put the order up on Tuesday.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   I said, what?
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   I could buy it.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.760]   - I could be free.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   It's a pre pre-order.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.760]   - Free pre-order.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.280]   - You get, you put all your details in and then on Friday you just hit the like, the
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   button.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.600]   Ideally it didn't actually work that way.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.000]   - That was for the phone.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.960]   For the mini you could actually buy it.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   - Oh for the tablet.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   You're right.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   I'm sorry, Lee.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   - Yeah.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.920]   Which I mean, I was, I thought, oh my God, I've missed out.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:19.200]   Have not by the way, I don't know if Apple's supply chains worked out or the ordering isn't
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.840]   quite as brisk, but it wasn't so hard to get either one of these.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.720]   One thing you won't be able to get is the new Apple Watch, which they said, yeah, you
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   can get it later this year.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.200]   - We won't say anything about it delayed.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   - Yeah.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.040]   - Yeah, sometimes this fall.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:42.800]   Apple did not mention a whole bunch of other things that probably we didn't expect, would
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:50.080]   have mentioned, but the Epic, Apple Epic store decision didn't say a word about that.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.360]   Didn't mention employee unrest, hashtag Apple too.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:01.160]   They just, they're very focused and they've now earned 15 minutes on their new hardware,
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:06.240]   nor did they mention it new AirPods, which the rumor said they might, nor did they mention
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.080]   Mac in any form or fashion.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080]   - Yeah.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.800]   We'll probably have another Mac event in the month or two.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.440]   - I don't even think they mentioned that the iOS 15 comes out tomorrow.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.440]   - Nope.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.760]   - No, that was like an oppressor release.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.160]   They're very focused.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.560]   Those guys at Apple.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.200]   They did, the star of the show was not the iPhone, it was California, which I thought
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.600]   was kind of interesting.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.880]   - Those drone shots, those drone shots were really beautiful and something.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.080]   - I wonder if it's a little tone deaf though, because I don't think the rest of the country
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.960]   really likes California very much right now.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.240]   - I'm serious.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.800]   - A lot of people are jealous.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.480]   Like I'll be honest, like living, there's always the New York, LA rivalry, right?
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.840]   And I love New York when I was there.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.320]   But I imagine the weather in LA and the natural beauty you guys get throughout California,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   there's a lot of envy going on.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.920]   - Is it envy or just, we hate you guys?
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.920]   (laughs)
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   - No, it's not hate.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.040]   I think the South gets South in Florida, gets more hate, I think.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   Bye everybody.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.240]   - Is that your sense too, in Kentucky, Jason, is the California...
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.240]   - Yeah.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:24.880]   - It used to be Hollywood, the Golden West, but I think of late, it's not quite that.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.960]   That's how Apple portrayed it as, the magical state.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960]   - Yeah.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:35.000]   No, I mean, look, it's lost a little bit of its luster for sure, for whatever reason,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.440]   but some of it is just, also California, for as long as there's been a California, it's
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.360]   been a boom and bust cycle, right?
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.040]   Like it goes through these periods where everybody wants to be in California and then it's
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.760]   like everybody's leaving California.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.240]   Now it's everybody wants to be in California again.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.240]   And we're in one of these, like, everybody's leaving in California, why would you want
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.680]   to be in California at sort of periods, which are usually the people in California that
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.160]   live there, friends of mine tell me, like, "Don't that's the best time to live there,"
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160]   because like the traffic's better.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.160]   - We hope everybody leaves.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.160]   - We hope everybody leaves.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.160]   - These are a little lower.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.160]   - These are all of those things.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.200]   - Move to Florida, move to Texas.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.400]   Please be my guest, yeah.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   - Yeah.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   - 'Cause traffic's terrible.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.720]   And of course, we have wildfires.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.360]   We have homelessness.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.640]   - We have earthquakes.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   - We have earthquakes.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640]   - Not a problem.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.160]   - Yeah, so anyway, I don't know.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.680]   I just thought it was an interesting thing.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   I think that--
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.280]   - Maybe it was an art of, sorry, go ahead.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   - Go ahead, no, please, Harry.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.520]   - I was gonna say it seems like maybe it was an artifact of the fact that they're not doing
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:35.080]   these events in person, so they have the opportunity to go places and pick interesting
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.400]   spots to do the demos from.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.360]   And given that Apple is in California and there are lots of interesting places here.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.920]   It's a logical move to make.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.000]   And if you're gonna go to those places, you're probably gonna talk about how great
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.880]   California is because Apple has done that for a long time and all their products have
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.600]   the little teeny tiny type bragging about the fact it was designed in California.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.600]   - That's true.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   - That's true.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   - I don't see anything.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   - They had to move on.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   - Go ahead.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.440]   - I don't suppose next time they'll do it from China.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.800]   - We're not gonna talk.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.640]   - Go ahead, defender.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:13.720]   - I was gonna say the last couple of events they've had basically showed off the UFO headquarters,
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   right?
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.960]   - People on the roof.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.840]   They had people in the courtyard.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   They had people in glass rooms and stuff.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.320]   And I think after a certain point, they're like, "We gotta do more than this.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.880]   There's more we can show than our office."
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.640]   - One reaction Alex Lindsey had on Macbreak Weekly on Tuesday was this proves that Apple
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.720]   is gonna continue to do pre-recorded events because they've realized that they have such
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.240]   skill and production.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.040]   The production value is so high that it makes it a much more interesting event.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.640]   And I actually would hope that they would expand it to the rest of the US next time.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.880]   And I think it's a mistake just to make it California.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   But I do think it's--
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   - Production value.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.400]   - The production value is incredible, right?
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.400]   - Yeah.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.760]   - I'm going away by some of those shots.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.840]   Sorry, go ahead Terry.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.720]   - I just wanna say I imagine that even if they do bring back an in-person element, you
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.440]   will see more of the stuff rather than at all these stuff that works best.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.760]   If you happen to be there in person, I'm biased.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.360]   'Cause sometimes I get to go in person.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:23.760]   So I vote for going back to in person, but for both Apple and almost everybody in the
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.280]   world except for tech journalists, there are a lot of arguments for continuing to do with
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.280]   this.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.200]   - Well, I mean, let's face it, these events are just big ads.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.600]   I mean, that's really what they've become.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.400]   But they draw a big audience, not just journalists, but Apple fans and people who are interested
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   in the technology.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.840]   So it's a great opportunity for Apple.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.640]   In fact, they took the advantage of that starting the thing, talking about Apple TV Plus, which
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.600]   basically an ad for all the shows that are coming in the fall and stuff.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.520]   So it is something Apple will obviously continue to do.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:58.560]   And I think that they're aware of people coming to the events.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.240]   And I think for people like you, Harry and Devindra and Jason, there's a hands-on element
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.680]   that's nice for journalists to be able to, after they're talking about it, go and play
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.080]   with this stuff.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.440]   But it's a very limited audience.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:20.080]   And I think Apple realizes that the real value of this is a 90-minute hour ad.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.080]   - Yeah.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.400]   And also showing things in action, showing people using things not just on stage, but
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.120]   in a real world environment, I think there's going to be more benefit of that.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.880]   I almost wonder, I'm surprised Apple doesn't do things around its stores.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.000]   I haven't been to an Apple store during an event time, but do they do anything to be like,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.280]   do they show the events as are happening in a store?
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.600]   Because that would be kind of cool to get the local hardcore fans into.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.080]   - I don't know, do they?
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.240]   They should, shouldn't they?
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.640]   - I've always thought that too, Devindra.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:55.240]   I think it's a great point because these stores, sometimes there was one time when I
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.880]   can't remember I had an appointment or something and it was overlapping part of the event or
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.880]   right before.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.680]   And I was like, when in the store, nobody here realizes there's an Apple event going on?
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.680]   This is crazy.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   This is amazing.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   This was a wild.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:14.640]   - For a long time these events were almost Christmas for geeks, right?
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.360]   I think those days are kind of gone.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.400]   I mean, the expectation that Apple is going to announce something that will take your
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.640]   breath away or that you've never thought of before.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.800]   Partly means because the leak industry is so successful and powerful despite everything
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.760]   Apple does, that there aren't usually big surprises, but also partly because we're a
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   peak phone.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:40.280]   I mean, there's not a lot of innovation that you can do when Apple announces AR glasses
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.520]   or an Apple car.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.240]   Maybe that'll be an event where we get this is exciting.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.800]   At this point, maybe I'm jaded, but it's really just a long ad for why you should buy
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.280]   the new phone.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.800]   And in this case, I don't think they made a very compelling case for it, which is why
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   I think-
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   - They made the last phone too good.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   - Maybe that's it.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.600]   And we haven't yet seen benchmarks.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.840]   Apple did not say faster than the old phone.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.400]   They said faster than the competition.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   The early-
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400]   - It has to be faster.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.160]   - A little, it's an A15 chip, but the benchmarks on Geekbench seem to be about 10% faster,
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.720]   which is barely noticeable.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.360]   And by the way, when's the last time you said your iPhone's too slow?
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360]   - Never.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.800]   It's got like a super computer in there now.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.720]   And it looks like they put most of the energy not into making it 25% faster, but making
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.920]   it a little faster, but much better battery life.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   Because I think it's like the Pro Max they're saying is like two and a half hours better
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   battery life.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.040]   And especially for the many, the many really took it on the chin a lot last year because
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.160]   the people who had it, they were not experiencing good battery life.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.240]   Lots of people talking about not making it through the day.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.440]   So that one specifically, if they were going to keep that product in the line, it needed
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.760]   to have better battery life.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.040]   And it looks like that's where they've directed most of the improvements on the chip not to
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:14.080]   making it faster to your point, Leo, that it didn't necessarily need to be a lot faster.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:20.400]   But they put that those advantages toward better battery life, which is probably pretty
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   smart in this case.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.880]   I mean, if you're going to buy it, you would buy it because it has an hour or more better
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.440]   battery life than last year's model, which is significant.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.960]   The batteries are bigger.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.600]   So maybe they finally are using the space vacated by the headphone jack.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   But yes, an item is bigger.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.280]   It's a screen is heavier.
[00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   It's heavier.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.000]   The better in any way.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.320]   I mean, it was 120 Hertz.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   So I guess that's better.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   It's really better.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.320]   I think you're right.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.200]   I think the I think the battery is the biggest improvement.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.480]   They did talk a lot about that.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.080]   And I would love to know for sure.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.920]   Yes, it's a little heavier because of the battery.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:04.000]   I'd love to know for sure what the average age of an iPhone is because most people would
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.400]   not even consider buying an iPhone a year after they bought a new iPhone.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.480]   If you have one that's a few years older, these start to look way more compelling.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.480]   And better battery life is boring, but it's also probably one of the very best attributes
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.000]   a new phone can have.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.720]   Well, maybe, I mean, in the days when they couldn't make it through a day, but Apple's
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.320]   been able to make it through a day for some time now.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   I don't.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.280]   A normal day at least.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.720]   Do any of you have battery anxiety with your iPhones?
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.160]   I mean, super busy day sometimes.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.560]   Maybe if you're traveling, maybe.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.600]   Working from home is made it harder because I know because now if I do Zoom calls like
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.560]   on my phone and even if I'm just listening and I take a walk and I'm listening on Zoom
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:53.240]   call, I'm like over the past year, I've had started having battery anxiety maybe for
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.980]   the first time in a while because if I'm on a call for a long time, then I end up on
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.680]   a Zoom, then end up another call, then I'm watching a video all of a sudden, like that
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.120]   starts to drain the battery.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.160]   And I'd say over the past year, I've gotten to the point where I've had to charge sometimes
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.240]   in the middle of the day for the first time in several years.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.120]   And you will welcome this improvement.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.120]   I do.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   I go on long bike rides.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.800]   Bike rides are a time when I could use more battery life sometimes.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.640]   I guess because of COVID, I don't really.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.600]   Maybe that's the problem is that I've been locked down.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:30.400]   So I don't have much occasion to run out of battery, but there must be a market because
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.440]   Apple sells a lot of those extended battery packs.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.000]   Other companies do as well.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.400]   So maybe there's a feature that people want.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.160]   We've all had smartphones for a while too and people have come up with their solutions
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.040]   for like, okay, in my desk, I'll have like a little cable or something for me that just
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   charge a little while I'm sitting down.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.520]   The big thing I do is in my car when I'm driving around, I just, you know, I'll plug it in.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.440]   And hey, that gives me more juice throughout the day too.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.160]   So more batteries always better, but I don't know how much like the people are really feeling
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.360]   that burn right now.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:04.120]   I think you're right though, that people aren't buying a new phone every year by far.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.920]   In fact, to Apple's credit, you could put iOS 15 on even a 6S going all the way back
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.280]   to a 6S.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.600]   So people with older iPhones are not going to feel left out of the future.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.000]   And they'll certainly still be secure as secure as you can be with an iPhone.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.800]   Yeah, over the past year, the lifespan of the iPhone has increased pretty dramatically.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.840]   Actually, I believe it's been the last two years.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:34.160]   It's gone from almost two and a half years of how long people are keeping it to now over
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   three.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.560]   So really, this was not an advertisement for iPhone 12 owners.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.320]   This is an advertisement for iPhone 10.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   iPhone 11.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   Yes.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.840]   iPhone 10 are iPhone eight, you know, and if you're coming from one of those devices,
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.520]   you're going to be, you're going to be pretty stoked, I think, with the 13th.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.600]   This is my favorite moment.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.920]   I want to show this in the, in the event right at the beginning.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.200]   You know, we've been watching a concert in the redwoods, on the ocean, all the instrumentalists
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.680]   spread all over the state.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.360]   And then suddenly we're in the desert and it looks like Tim Cook and his trademark black
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:19.240]   high tops and jeans is walking through the desert and then kind of miraculously he transitions
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.880]   and he's in the Apple campus.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.040]   I thought that was nicely done.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.160]   A lot of really beautiful video on this.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.320]   It is a, they're good at, they're good at the advert of this.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:34.800]   And they're also very good at meaningless numbers.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.480]   Like two times faster, faster than the competition.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.300]   One thing they didn't say this time is it's the thinnest iPhone we've ever made or the
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.320]   thinnest iPad we've ever made or the thinnest Apple watch we've ever made.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.960]   In fact, the Apple watches a little bit bigger than ever before.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.760]   Seems like they're kind of over that and I don't know if that is.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   Johnny's gone.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.400]   Johnny's no longer overseeing it.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.840]   Because it was always Johnny I've left every year.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840]   It's gotten thicker.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:08.320]   I mean, if you look at it, the iPhone, I believe that's true that every year since Johnny I've
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.400]   left the iPhones gotten thicker.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.840]   That's thicker, bigger batteries, better battery life.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.800]   Johnny Ives voice is the thinnest iPhone we've ever made.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.440]   I hear him saying that.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:26.040]   So without him saying that, there's no reason to.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.200]   I think the big thing, and I think at this point, because we are at peak phone, you're
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.760]   not talking about the phone battery, I guess you're talking about the screen is incrementally
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   better.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.200]   But what you're really always looking for from Apple is tell us about the cameras.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:48.840]   And this time they do have some features that almost persuaded me it might be worth spending
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   a thousand or more dollars for a brand new phone.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.640]   You want that sensor shift, Leo?
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   Come on.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.360]   Sensor shift, optical image stabilization, which is really cool.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.840]   I'm glad that that is out on every model now, because last year it was only on the Pro Max.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.080]   And that thing is always it was way too heavy for me.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.320]   So I would never go to that.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.280]   You had to have the which I have, by the way, you had to have the Pro Max.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:15.000]   In fact, that's why I bought the Pro Max is for that optical image stabilization and the
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.320]   sensor shift.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:22.560]   They've also added a new, you wrote about this cinematic mode for video making.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.240]   I don't do people make a lot of videos with their iPhones.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.720]   I take a lot of pictures.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.440]   I always forget to make videos is I guess with TikTok and and you two things.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.440]   There's parents.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.280]   I know like I have a three almost three year old now and like that that's why I try to
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.080]   get the bigger storage and the better cameras because I want to capture as much as I can.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.120]   I do think some Mac mode, it looks like a really cool way of making us rethink the way
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.480]   focus works for mobile video.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.520]   So I know you've always wanted to be careful.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.400]   I can focus for your videos of your three year old.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.680]   No, the video is getting right.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.040]   It's cool stuff.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.400]   I think about all the videos I never took that I wish I had with my kids when they were
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   living.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.160]   Because you'll be glad you have them.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:16.800]   I have one video that I took with my first digital cameras in Olympus in 2004.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.320]   No 2001, I think it was of my son the first time he ever read to me.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.880]   It's only five or six seconds.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   It is a cherished clip.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.080]   I mean, if I had his first step, I would be through or my daughter's first step.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.960]   I would be thrilled.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.600]   But I was too.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.120]   And I think a lot of people want to get like an action camera or something too.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.360]   Like I also have a GoPro in my dream is like to have her vacations and walks and stuff
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.360]   to just capture.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.120]   But, you know, it's a I got a warm.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.280]   So Mac mode looks cool.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   It got to the point where both my kids would say, Dad, stop taking pictures.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   Stop.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.280]   Put their hand up.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.720]   I have a lot of pictures of my kids with their hands.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.480]   I got a bunch of these.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   Stop.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   That's why you're amazing.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.160]   Get those new Facebook glasses.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.840]   You could take all the pictures you want.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.880]   So at the time you're three year old as a teenager, the vendor, you'll be in good shape
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.600]   because they'll be like all these, you know, these glasses out or you'll just be able
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.720]   to like blink your eyes three times and then it starts recording.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   I don't want to live in that world.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.560]   That's going to be dad recording all the time.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.040]   So Apple made not one but two movies.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.840]   They made a cinematic whodunit to demonstrate rack focus.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.880]   Now first of all, and Devinder, you've you wrote the article about this.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.280]   So I don't think they're actually changing focus, are they?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   It does.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   I mean, we do.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.640]   I haven't seen a full technical deep dive in this, but it does look like the sensor is
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.520]   big enough to focus on something in the foreground and then shift that focus all the way to
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.360]   the back as if you were using a film, you know, or a digital.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.040]   There's some debate about whether they're changing focus optically or whether they're
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.360]   blurring.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   It could be.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.760]   It could just be a blur, but at the end of the day, what does it matter?
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   Right?
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.960]   Like I think portrait mode is simulated.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   Portrait mode is blur.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.360]   It's not real booking.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.760]   It's a blur.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.760]   We don't know.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.800]   I guess we won't know until we get the phones or to the embargoes are lifted.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.520]   My understanding is that with this, so I think this was post produced because what they
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.760]   said is you can take that video and then in post, you can change the focus.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.320]   So I think that's not, I probably tries to do it dynamically, but like this one we saw
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:38.000]   where it's perfect, I think that in post, they were switching, you know, and fine tuning
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   the focus.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.920]   Computational photography.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.320]   And that's why I think it is just blurring because you couldn't, you wouldn't be able
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.720]   to record enough information.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   I mean, that was what the LITRO did, right?
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.720]   LITRO.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   The ray tracing came.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:59.840]   They recorded enough information that could have a varying focal planes, but that's not
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.120]   what the iPhone is doing.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.120]   I don't think.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.120]   No.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.720]   It's not a ray tracing.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.400]   Functionally, if you get a good blur and you can mimic some of these features, it will
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.560]   still look pretty cool.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.080]   They did show off one thing that was like a smart version of this where a character can
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.080]   look away.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.240]   And I believe it can automatically shift focus.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.320]   Yes, based on that, they cladded AI was being used to determine what the point of focus
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.120]   was and to automatically rack focus.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.120]   So you can do it manually by tapping, but they claim that their AI is smart enough to
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.120]   know, oh, you looked away.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   What are you looking at?
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.760]   Oh, let's focus on that.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   Okay.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.040]   I think we have to see this to really.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   It's interesting.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.760]   It is limited and they didn't say this in the presentation.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   It is limited to 1080p 30 FPS.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.000]   So a lot of us are used to doing 4K 60 on our iPhones at this point.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.240]   So then you have to start making that choice.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.400]   Do I want this to do like a cool cinematic staging for this video or do I want to get
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.160]   the best quality I can get?
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.920]   That's a good catch.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   That's not good.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   Okay.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.920]   I do feel like I would keep it on 4K.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.920]   4K 60.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   I'm not dig.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   I want Dolby vision, baby.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.920]   Go ahead, Harry.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.960]   At this point, I'm kind of used to Apple doing these events where they show these unbelievably
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.720]   gorgeous still photos.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.360]   And now these incredible videos and my own still photos and videos are not improving
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.080]   in quality at the same pace as apples are.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.960]   And I'm always curious who's taking these incredible photos and are they really in the
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   kind of the same environments?
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.080]   I completely agree.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.840]   And I always remind myself there is this.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.200]   There's still is a reality distortion field because Apple's very good at creating this environment
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   where you go.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.880]   Oh, that's beautiful.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.440]   So I always have to remind myself those photos are taken by professional photographers using
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.520]   studio lights.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.200]   So don't this not natural light in most cases in very controlled circumstance and these
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.040]   guys know exactly what the capabilities of the camera are and are playing to it.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.040]   So yes, your photos are never going to look like that.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.520]   On the other hand, and it's not just Apple.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.560]   I mean, you could say the same thing about the latest Samsung phones and I'm sure the
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.200]   Pixel 6 when it comes out.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.160]   You could say the same thing, but does it?
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.840]   Yeah, you could take really good photos.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.760]   Good photos, even when it's not.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   Good photos.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.440]   I'm talking about like the advertising of them, like in terms of showing off what their
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.440]   devices can do.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.480]   Samsung is totally doing what Apple does, but kind of does the commercial aspect of it
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   worse.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.640]   So it's just kind of funny to see everything kind of there.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   Didn't they get, didn't it?
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.520]   Was it Samsung or the one plus it got busted because they were using SLRs to shoot the
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   photos?
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.720]   What about them do it over and over again?
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.760]   Yeah, they don't stop.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:50.320]   The Samsung events and Samsung's putting out some pretty crazy quality products too, but
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.960]   the Samsung events feel more like a commercial.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:59.600]   Apple somehow, the art of it is that it is absolutely a commercial that feels a little
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.000]   less like a commercial and feels a little more lifestyle-y.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.280]   It's a TED Talk.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.840]   It's so many things.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.040]   It's there is a terabyte iPhone now, Leo.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.200]   So you have terabyte option.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.120]   That's another nice upgrade for some people.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.280]   I am the idiot.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.520]   And one of the reasons I'm not buying the iPhones because I'm the idiot that bought the
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.920]   terabyte M1 based iPad Pro.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.360]   Like what the hell am I going to do with all of that?
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.000]   But my theory about it too, too terabyte one.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.200]   I think I did.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   I maxed it out.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   Whatever the max was.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   I think I got the two terabyte.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   It's a laptop.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.600]   In fact, it was a laptop price.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.280]   It was 2,500 bucks.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.760]   I don't know what I was thinking.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.920]   I was drugged by the Apple reality distortion field.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.880]   But I have to say, looking at what Apple's doing now, this is a long way from the days
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:51.720]   when even Steve Jobs as great as he was would stand on the stage and go through the demo
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   and all that.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.000]   This is a whole different kettle of fish apples producing here.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.200]   These are program length ads that are gorgeous.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:07.200]   And I don't think Apple's going back to the Steve Jobs Theater and the static presentations.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.080]   They control this too tightly.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.720]   They're able to make these look gorgeous.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.080]   And since COVID, they've gotten better and better.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.440]   This one was dramatically better than previous ones.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:22.920]   They also realized that the world doesn't want to see the same two or three white guys
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.600]   doing all the demos and every event.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.800]   So they cram in all kinds of people.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.280]   It's just kind of way more interesting based on the fact you get to see a lot of faces
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.080]   you would not have seen in the past.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.500]   But none of those people dominate in the way that Steve Jobs once dominated or even Phil
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   Schiller.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.720]   And he did a lot of the stuff dominated those events.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.320]   No, no, but look, Steve was the best presenter of all time and actually set the standard that
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.480]   Apple has been trying to live up to ever since.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.840]   It was interesting though to see Phil Schiller's replacement, Greg Jazwiak on stage and COO
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.520]   Jeff Williams on stage.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:01.200]   These are two very high level executives almost as high as Tim Cook.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.440]   So Apple is putting senior leadership up on the stage.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:13.720]   And I think that that facetime is meaningful and important for succession planning.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.960]   Just for positioning the company, it's not Tim Cook's company in the way it was Steve
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.960]   Jobs' company.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:28.240]   And they have a deep bullpen of people of color and of women that they can put up on
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.200]   stage and show C where we're a diverse company.
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.800]   And I'm glad to see it, absolutely.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.760]   It's nice to see, again, like you mentioned, they didn't talk about the stuff about employee
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.760]   unrest and whatnot.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.320]   And I do feel like these ads are a way of saying, like, hey, look, we're inclusive.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   Okay.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.360]   We're very inclusive compared to most companies.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.120]   So it is funny to see the image Apple is projecting out there versus some of the stuff
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.640]   we're hearing on background from people.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.800]   I'm really, I want to take a break and we'll come back because I'm really conflicted about
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.120]   this Apple II story.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.720]   We don't normally cover it because it's a labor issue.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.880]   And one of the problems with covering labor issues is there's two sides to the story,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:17.480]   but often the company can't say anything because of labor law.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.080]   And so they can't really actively defend themselves.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.880]   And so it's very hard to know what's really going on.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.040]   There seems to be unrest at Apple, but Apple's a very, very big company.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.840]   And if it's a hundred people that might, I don't know what to say.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   I don't know what to think about it.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:37.200]   So I'm going to let you guys get in trouble instead of me in just a little bit.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.240]   It's good to have you all here.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.640]   Devindra Hardewar from Engadget, Jason Heiner from CNET.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.080]   Are you sister, your sisters now, your sister publications now?
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   Is that right?
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.000]   No, I can't figure out who the hell owns anybody anymore.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.600]   They're owned by Red Ventures, right, Jason?
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.920]   That's right.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.600]   And Engadget is owned by Verizon still?
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   Nope.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.280]   Who the hell owns you now?
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.280]   We...
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.280]   Apollo?
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.280]   It's Apollo.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   Apollo.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.440]   We just changed corporate naming is back to Yahoo.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.240]   Yeah, I thought that was hysterical.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.560]   So it was Yahoo.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.360]   Then it became Oath.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.920]   Then it became Yahoo Media.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.400]   It wasn't, it was AOL.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   It was AOL.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.920]   And then AOL merged with Yahoo.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   And that was Oath.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.640]   And yeah, yeah.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.560]   And then it went to something media.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.000]   Now it's back to Yahoo.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.720]   And the CEO of Tinder's running the company.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.720]   Sure.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.560]   It's on by Apollo.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   I love Yahoo.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.960]   We're all practicing our Yodles right now.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.960]   Yahoo.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   Bring back the Sun.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   Now is also our former CEO to Jim Lanzone.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   Oh, was it?
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   I didn't know that.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   Who's now?
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.960]   Who's now?
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.960]   There's CEO.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   Cool.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   I didn't realize.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   So I know that's what I wanted to know.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.960]   You know, I'm not sure.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   I'm not sure.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   I'm sure that's what I wanted to know.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   I'm sure that's what I wanted to know.
