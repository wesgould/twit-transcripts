[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   We got a great panel for you.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.880]   Some of my best friends in the business, Larry Maggot,
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.760]   is here from Connect Safely.org.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.740]   Our good friend, Will Harris, his new Unbound books
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.880]   are hysterical, and Denise Howell, formerly of this week
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.240]   in launch.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.720]   She's got a new show to announce.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.160]   We'll talk about quarterly earnings
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.280]   from some of the biggest businesses in Tech.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.400]   I give you a hint.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.800]   Not a great quarter.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.560]   Elon Musk is off the hook, and chat GPT comes to Bing.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.800]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.800]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320]   From people you trust.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.800]   This is Twit.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.480]   This is Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.360]   Episode 913, recorded Sunday, February 5, 2023,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.560]   in practical shorts.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.640]   This week in Tech is brought to you by Miro.

[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.080]   looking for new partners with products and services
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.240]   that will benefit our qualified audience.

[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.840]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech, show where we cover
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.920]   the week's tech news.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240]   I look forward to every Sunday because I put together
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.840]   a panel of my friends.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.480]   It's really just a chance for me to sit down and talk to people.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.600]   I miss an adored, like Denise Howell from This Week in Law,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.040]   longtime host on Twit's.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.960]   Great to see you, Denise.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.000]   It's so good to see you.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.240]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.360]   I'll tell you how long it's been.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.800]   I'm thanking you for your Christmas card.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yes.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.440]   But it was a great Christmas card.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.880]   I love it.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.680]   And I can't believe your son is 19 now.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   I know.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.240]   I can't either.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.680]   And yet we're somehow aging backward and not changing.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   Yeah, we're not getting any older.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.200]   But it just shows you how long we've been doing this.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.440]   First Twit was 2005, so that's 18 years.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560]   So yeah, I mean, when we started working together,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.360]   he was just a toddler, right?
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.320]   Yeah, he was.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.920]   I've known Will Harris pretty much as long as well.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.120]   He is now the CEO of Unbound, which
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.440]   is an amazing publisher.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.400]   Hello, Will.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.000]   Hello.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.280]   It is great to be back from the other side of the pond.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.560]   Staying up late.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.040]   You're making me feel decisively old, because that was--
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.480]   she was in my 20s when we started working together.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.400]   That's amazing.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.800]   Now, how many companies have yours have I been through?
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.200]   Quite a few startups.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.160]   You are the serial entrepreneur.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.600]   I have many of your books right here.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.640]   These are unique.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.640]   Things I learned from Mario's butt, which is, believe it or not,
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.840]   walk through gaming critiques of butt pictures.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.360]   Just great, just great bots.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.800]   Great bots from different games and what you can learn
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.760]   from the philosophy of how we do game design and character
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.600]   design.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.200]   Like, reading a metal gear solid, maybe we're
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.520]   going to get a hard R for this.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.840]   Wow.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.120]   So you'll get some good stuff there.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.320]   We published quite a lot of nerd geek culture stuff.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.360]   So if you're a fan of nerd geek culture,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.040]   there's some good stuff at unbound.com.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.360]   Oh, I'm loving these.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.800]   And it's like a Kickstarter, right?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.480]   They fund them.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.200]   And then we produce them and print them.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.640]   And you do.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.040]   And even though the name is unbound,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.800]   they are actually beautifully produced.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.760]   They're beautifully bound.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000]   These are not cheap books.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.120]   These are nice books.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.840]   No.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.920]   We have one coming out later this year,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.360]   which is a posthumous collection of all of Douglas Adams's writing.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.880]   You told us about that last time.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.400]   I'm excited.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.320]   What is the status on that?
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.600]   So it's now, I think, close to manuscript being done.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.680]   But if I say that out loud, I might get shot.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.240]   So let's pretend I didn't say that.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.600]   But it will be here in the autumn.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.480]   Oh, that's exciting.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.920]   That's really exciting.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.000]   These are-- it's probably going to be the last published
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.560]   works of Douglas Adams, right?
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.680]   Unless some trove of stuff comes out.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.640]   No, this is the trove, Leo.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.480]   We've got the trove.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.960]   Notes from his office that were just left on his desk
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.480]   and things like that.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.280]   I can't wait.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.720]   Well, it's sort of hard for any emails and correspondence
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.760]   and wedding speeches.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.080]   And I mean, it's hilarious.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   And of course, the best name, 42.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.680]   What a perfect name for that.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.200]   So Ken John Davies put that together.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.080]   The edits are done.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.800]   You could still pre-order.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.640]   Just go to unbound.com if you want to get in line.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.880]   And we actually had a really good little bump over Christmas
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.280]   because if you've seen the new Knives Out movie--
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.800]   Yes.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.680]   --the Glass Onion with Ryan Johnson--
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.080]   Loved it.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.120]   The Daniel Craig character is reading one of our books
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.840]   in the bath.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.360]   No.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.880]   I'm seeing that.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.640]   That's where he's doing the Zoom call.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.400]   He's playing among us.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   And he's--
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.120]   So we have a book called "Kane's Jawbone,"
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.760]   which is an incredible murder mystery where all the pages
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.200]   are printed out of order.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.960]   And you have to tear all the pages out of the book
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.280]   and then reassemble them all in the right order to work out.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.840]   You've done it.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.400]   I saw that.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.240]   So it's a very sort of Knives Out.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.680]   I didn't realize--
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.760]   I saw him reading that.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.920]   I noticed that he was reading that by Torca Mata.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.240]   And I noticed that as well.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.640]   I didn't realize it was yours.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.160]   Well, that's nice.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.200]   That's really nice.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.880]   So that's-- so Kane's Jawbone is well worth a read
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.280]   if you've got a spare weekend and fancy bit of puzzling.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.640]   Wow.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.480]   Also with us to celebrate, by the way,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.920]   from connect safely.org, the wonderful Larry Maggot.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.400]   Hello, Larry.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.880]   Hey, Leo.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.560]   And by the way, I get my hair dye from Anderson Cooper.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.080]   So I'm not really--
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.280]   As old as I look, I'm actually my 30.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.480]   You look just like Anderson, yeah.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   Exactly.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.080]   What are we celebrating?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.480]   We're celebrating Safer Internet Day.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.040]   Is that right?
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.080]   Yeah, it's Tuesday.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.760]   And it's a global thing all over the world.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.800]   Connect Safely is the host here in the US.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.080]   And we've been doing it since 2014.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.040]   We had Kamala Harris at one of our events.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.960]   We had Chuck Schumer.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.800]   We've had superintendents of schools.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.680]   But this year-- and we talked about this last time
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.920]   I was in your show--
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.560]   we funded a bunch of schools to do their own events.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.920]   So-- and it really worked out well.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.520]   We're going to reach 25,000 students nationwide
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.160]   by giving some money to educators
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.120]   to do their local events.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.960]   But people here can still participate.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.520]   We've got a live virtual event on Tuesday, the 7th,
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.680]   at 730 Eastern, 430 Pacific that we are co-hosting
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.400]   with a national PTA.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.440]   Really great for parents.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.960]   And the other thing we've done, if you put together
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.600]   a ton of videos at SaferInternetDay.us,
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.000]   or you can go to connect safely and find a link there
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.760]   to saferinternetday.us, a ton of videos
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.800]   with like a chief scientist of the American Psychological
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.640]   Association talking about mental health
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.880]   and well-being.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.600]   And folks from the Cyberbullying Research Center,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.080]   and one of the-- in fact, that's a picture of Britton Heller,
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.760]   who's an expert on the metaverse.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.680]   Just a ton of videos.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.840]   And the idea that families can watch these videos,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.080]   they have conversations Tuesday night.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.360]   We give you discussion points.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.600]   It's the internet in the box.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   Those are our sponsors.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.880]   So it's an opportunity just to talk about, you know,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.800]   are you spending too much time online?
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.240]   Are you spreading misinformation?
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.680]   Are you forgetting to watch Twitch?
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.800]   I mean, all important things that--
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.640]   - Twitch. - Everybody should be calling.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.680]   - Don't watch Twitch, kids.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.040]   What Twitch. - Should I say Twitch?
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.520]   - So watch Twitch. - Twitch.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.920]   - Twitch. - Actually, Twitch is whatever I thought.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.960]   - Twitch is one of your sponsors.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.640]   So I'll let you go.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.240]   This, by the way, is an unbound book
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.320]   that maybe connects safely should get called Taming Gaming.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.280]   Guide your child to healthy video game habits.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   - That's exactly the type of stuff we publish.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.560]   Although we do, our guides are much shorter than that.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.240]   - This is nice. - And we have quick guides
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.440]   that are two pages long and longer guides
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.280]   that are about eight pages.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.360]   But we haven't done books yet, but--
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.680]   - And there's a section in there about what's legal
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.000]   and what's illegal on the internet.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.840]   So you've got like a whole sort of synergistic circle
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.440]   of Twitter's-- - I love this.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.560]   - On between lore, between safety,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.200]   between publishing, where we've got it all covered.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.160]   - We've got it covered.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.400]   This is the Animal Crossing.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.560]   So this actually has game recommendations
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.600]   and then pros and cons, what ages is for, stuff like that.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.880]   This is the Animal Crossing page, which is the goal.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.360]   - You should send me a review copy.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.800]   We review books occasionally.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.640]   - I'll hook you up.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.480]   I know the publisher.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.320]   - Hook me up.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.520]   You know the publisher.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.760]   But anyways, everybody should tune in.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.240]   She go to saferinternet.us, the,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.720]   don't go to the org unless you want the international event,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.000]   but the USaben is .us and tune in on Tuesday night
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.440]   and have a conversation at home.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.400]   I mean, whether you use our material or not.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.520]   If you got kids, ask them what their favorite game is,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.400]   ask them what their favorite apps are.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.160]   - Just talk to them. - Don't lecture them.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.520]   Don't make it an inquisition.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.800]   And just, and by the way, ask them about privacy and security.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   They might not only surprise you how much they know,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.960]   they might actually know more than you do.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.360]   You'd be surprised how smart a lot.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.480]   And he's got an older teenager.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.800]   And my guess is that he's probably pretty savvy
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.720]   when it comes to security and privacy.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.800]   At least the privacy that matters to him.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   - Absolutely.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.320]   They either know everything or they think they do.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   - Right.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.880]   - He probably knows about privacy
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.560]   like keeping you from knowing what he's doing.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.400]   I mean, that's probably important to him.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.880]   At least he is to a lot of teenagers.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.000]   - We were talking about it. - Yeah, somewhat.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.840]   But fortunately, we have a pretty open,
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.200]   back and forth on that kind of thing.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.120]   - I bet you have a great--
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.960]   - Yeah, sure you do.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.520]   - And that's important. - That's really important.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.000]   - Yeah. - When my daughter was
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.240]   probably in fifth grade,
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.840]   she was really in something called Neopets,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.640]   which is still around.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.240]   And I mean, this is 20 years ago, 25 years ago.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.800]   And I said, well, now honey, you know, when you're online,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.640]   you have to really be careful to be private.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.640]   And I mentioned once ago, she said, "Dad,
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.880]   I'm a 32 year old guy from Detroit
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.160]   who drives a Camaro.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.960]   You don't have to worry."
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.520]   (laughing)
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.680]   Oh, good, that's good thinking.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.600]   She also does something that now maybe illegal, I don't know.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.280]   I'm gonna have to ask her attorney,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.560]   Netflix, she has my Netflix password.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.720]   She's in my family.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.760]   She lives a few miles away.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.080]   Netflix used to say, here's a tweet from Netflix from 2017.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.200]   Love is sharing a password.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.440]   I took Netflix. - Whoa.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.280]   - I know, I took Netflix. - Whoa.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.760]   - Yeah, right?
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.840]   That's only five years ago, six years ago.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   That's not unreasonable to think
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.480]   that maybe they approved of it.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.440]   God knows I'm paying enough for that, you know,
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.960]   multi-user, multi-streams thing.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.200]   Netflix actually got a little hot water
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.120]   because it leaked out what they're,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.480]   'cause they've been trying this internationally,
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.600]   but hadn't done anything about password sharing in the US.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.240]   Their potential plan for password sharing
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.960]   leaked out this week to an internet furore.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.680]   This was on the Help Center page.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.040]   It said, among, oh, now I have to get,
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.760]   now I've retracted it, by the way.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.240]   It said, Netflix account is for people
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.920]   who live together in a single household.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.760]   - All right.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.360]   - People who do not live in your household,
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.120]   which my daughter does not,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.840]   will need to use their own account.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.960]   And then they furthermore said,
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.480]   we are going to require that they check
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.040]   into your locale at least once a month.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.440]   What does check in mean?
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.560]   - Yeah, but people have vacation homes,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.240]   and that's the problem, or you travel.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.040]   You know, I don't think they would say that.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.080]   - So much for being a digital nomad.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.000]   - Yeah, right.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.440]   - The update to the plans was met with significant backlash.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.440]   Apparently a number of people sufficient to scare Netflix,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.280]   'cause by Thursday, they responded and said,
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.240]   oh, that was an accident.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.720]   We didn't, for a brief time yesterday,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.200]   a Help Center article containing information
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.040]   that is only applicable to Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.200]   went live in other countries.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.440]   We've updated it.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.120]   - What have they got against those guys?
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.960]   (all laughing)
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.480]   - So it's true that Chileans.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.120]   - Yeah, Chileans.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.880]   So in those countries, they've been testing
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.240]   something called page sharing,
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.480]   where if they notice that you're sharing your password,
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.200]   a thing pops up on the screen and says,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.800]   oh, I see you're sharing, well, no problem,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   but you're going to have to pay an extra $2.99 for that.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.600]   - Yeah.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.080]   - For-- - Can you ever add enough,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.880]   how much you,
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.600]   if you ever add enough your streaming bill
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.320]   to the old cable bill, I think it's more--
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.680]   - Oh, it's much more. - It's more a real cable bill.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.640]   - Oh, it's much more.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.400]   In fact, well, this is all calculated.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.560]   I gotta point out, first of all,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.280]   the cable companies knew this was gonna happen.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.160]   They've raised their internet rates gradually
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.840]   to the point of nosebleed,
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.920]   because they knew that people would still need internet
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   if they're gonna cut the cord.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.400]   And meanwhile, the cord cutting services
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.840]   have raised their rates.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.440]   I was gonna use YouTube TV
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   until it got to 65 bucks a month for basic cable,
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.360]   comparable to a basic cable.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.920]   That's the same price.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.840]   Plus now I pay for 20 bucks more for 4K.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.920]   What's it like in the UK?
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.600]   - Oh, man, so it's, I would say it,
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.840]   it's not too bad in the UK.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.720]   So obviously we sort of pay the compulsory BBC license--
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.560]   - Still?
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.920]   Do they have little vans going around town
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.280]   looking for unlicensed television sets?
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.600]   - The vans don't exist.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.520]   The vans are a prop, they're prop,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.760]   I was gonna say propaganda, they're prop-a-vander.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.360]   (laughing)
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.320]   The vans never have existed.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.760]   - They're never worth those vans?
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.600]   - E.D. please.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.000]   - No, they've got no idea, you're in a block of flats,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.640]   they've got no idea which one person in a block of flats is.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.080]   - But it was propaganda that the BBC--
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.520]   - Or propaganda that the BBC promoted.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.000]   - So we have that, we have, you know,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.680]   Disney is not too expensive,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.360]   now you pay sort of, I guess,
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.440]   equivalent of like 10 bucks for that.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.400]   Sort of 15 bucks for Netflix.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.240]   The digital only version of Sky,
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.440]   which is kind of the closest thing we've got to cable here
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.720]   is sort of 25 bucks maybe.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.840]   What absolutely blew my mind is,
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.800]   I just subscribed to American Hulu
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.720]   for the upcoming, you know, March Madness--
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.960]   - In America?
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.160]   - We just call that Hulu, just so you know.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.920]   - Yeah, sorry, yeah, no.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.760]   (laughing)
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.800]   So there isn't a British Hulu,
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.600]   I subscribed to American Hulu.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.520]   - It was like 65 bucks a month and I was like,
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.160]   "Shh, I'm never, you know."
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.280]   - But that's 'cause you can only do is watch one channel.
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280]   - You're getting extremely--
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.520]   - I watch ESPN and that's it.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.680]   - You're the same thing at your Google TV, basically.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.480]   - Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a,
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.760]   a basic cable, basically.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.440]   They've, they've taken it over.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.560]   - I've got direct to my TV, it's similar, you know.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.440]   - Right, but didn't direct TV just lose the football?
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.400]   - You know, I don't know.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.240]   - They did it, I don't know.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.840]   - I think Amazon has it now.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.680]   - No, no.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.520]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.840]   - Google, Google, Google.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.680]   - Yeah.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.800]   - Yeah.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.000]   - Well, the good news is that I've got all of those services
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.360]   and that's why I don't have any money left
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.200]   at the end of the month.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.040]   - Yes.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.960]   - You know, like it doesn't matter.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.640]   - It's a, it's a leak in the, in the bank account,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.480]   a big hole in the bank account.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.400]   - Really, don't kidding.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.440]   - So I think Netflix might still go ahead with this,
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.120]   but it's good that they had such a strong reaction to it,
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.440]   that they had to say, "Oh, no, no, no, no."
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.480]   That was Chile.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.320]   - That was customary.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.480]   - But in the meantime, they're cutting back
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.640]   on their production, you know,
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.320]   their less original series coming out.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.400]   I mean, I was watching a video podcast about this,
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.120]   with the podcast yesterday about how Netflix is really
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.840]   trying to go on the cheap and they're not going to be
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.680]   investing in, it's much great content
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.360]   that they had in the past.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.040]   - I mean, they're just learning the really hard way
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.040]   that, you know, quality content costs lots and lots
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.600]   and lots of money and is cheaper to make reality.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.320]   And that's why, you know, cable went so heavily reality
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.760]   and why Netflix was so refreshing,
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.400]   because of all the premium content.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.440]   But, and of course, you know, it's now nosedive
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.280]   in the wrong direction.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.840]   But it seems like that's just sort of one of a number
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.120]   of tech companies this week, that are all just having
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.440]   an absolute nightmare with sort of, with money, right?
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.600]   - Well, look at the discovery time worn or whatever the hell,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.160]   I can't keep track of it, but the owners of HBO
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.080]   have basically moved stuff off of HBO,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.400]   selling it to free TV and 2B.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.640]   It's-- - Listen to it.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.400]   - Pluto TV. - Pluto, yeah.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.600]   Those are ads supported.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   So they have-- - Oh, but they ads
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.200]   like every three minutes of the 10 minute advertisement.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.520]   It's horrible. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.200]   - I mean, how much they inundate you with ads
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.880]   and some of those channels.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.720]   - So is this an-- - Well, you can guarantee that,
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.640]   you can guarantee that that YouTube 60 bucks a month
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.080]   is going to be going up with a football,
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.400]   'cause YouTube is down what, 8% this quarter?
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.840]   In the Google earnings?
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.720]   - So you're still gonna get, just to be clear,
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.520]   don't mean to scare people.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.360]   Next season, when it starts in August,
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.920]   you will still get your local football games.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.480]   Those will be broadcast on broadcast television.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.720]   But the Direct TV had this NFL Sunday ticket package
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.040]   where you can see all the games on a Sunday,
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.600]   and they were paying a billion and a half dollars a year
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.760]   for it, it really was a money loser.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.480]   The whole idea with Direct TV is,
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.760]   oh, we'll get all these new subscribers
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.600]   and then I'll make up the cost of this
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.240]   and it just didn't pencil out.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.880]   - It was also a terrible experience.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.360]   That Sunday ticket, the way that they framed everything,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.640]   was just awful to watch.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.480]   - Really?
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.320]   How do you know?
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.640]   - Yeah.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.720]   (laughing)
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.560]   - You know.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.160]   - Are you getting American hulu again?
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.000]   - I know.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.840]   (laughing)
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.720]   You know, sometimes you stay in the US
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.760]   and you see these things on a Sunday, you know?
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.280]   - So YouTube-- - When I'm located
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.600]   in a hotel in New York--
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.840]   - YouTube got a seven year deal more than,
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.160]   or a little more than $2 billion a season.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.320]   $2 billion a season,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.760]   which is less than the NFL wanted,
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.480]   they wanted two and a half.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.000]   But seven years, that's a good deal
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.440]   and why would YouTube do it?
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.760]   Because you will have to pay extra.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.000]   So they will have subscriptions
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.200]   and they're hoping that what it'll do is drive
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.000]   new users to YouTube TV,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.160]   which is, I mean, to be fair, is a pretty good system.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.960]   I like YouTube TV a lot.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.680]   And then they'll have the upsell.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.000]   They do a lot of upselling on YouTube TV, by the way.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.040]   You can get HBO and Showtime and everything,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.960]   but you have to pay extra.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.680]   So, yeah, Sunday tickets starting in the late summer
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.160]   will now be on YouTube.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.400]   Apple was in the running for this fact.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.620]   Apple really wanted it.
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.680]   But didn't--
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.120]   - Can you pay to just get the football
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.880]   or do you have to get the whole YouTube package to get it?
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.360]   - I think everyone's waiting to find that out.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.440]   I don't think you have to-- - I think they said--
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.600]   - officially announced it.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.160]   - Right now, it's, believe it or not,
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   $300 to $400 a season for the Sunday ticket.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:47.440]   I'm gonna guess since the NFL probably gets a portion
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.520]   of that, that that's not gonna go away.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.480]   YouTube though, Google could subsidize it, right?
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.880]   Although, given that they just fired 12,000 people,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.680]   I don't think YouTube, I mean, Google is really in the mood
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.200]   to subsidize anything, including a lot of their own stuff,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.800]   Verily, Jigsaw, which was their kind of pro bono stuff,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.680]   all suffering massive cuts, even Area 120,
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.840]   which was Google's blue sky R&D,
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.680]   almost all of it cut to the bone in these latest layoffs.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.820]   So all of these companies have decided,
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.400]   at least for now, let's not spend any more than we have to.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.000]   Which gotta hurt if you just found out
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   that the parent company just gave DirecTV $2 billion a year
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.520]   for football games.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.040]   YouTube ad revenue, Alphabet did put out its earnings,
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.360]   this, in fact, this is the week of earnings
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.280]   for a lot of tech companies.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.840]   They missed their Q4 earnings estimates,
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   but the big one is YouTube ad revenue dropping 8%.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:58.040]   Not YouTube TV, that's YouTube proper.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.320]   So ad revenue was $8.2 billion for the most recent quarter.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.160]   And that's a significant--
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   - You know, my favorite stat in all the cost reductions
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.640]   is that Google has so much office space for so many people,
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.000]   that it's sacked so many people,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.160]   that the reduction in office space
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.720]   is gonna cost them $500 million
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.040]   in just this first quarter of the year.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.680]   - What do you mean, like getting smaller
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.840]   is gonna cost them $500 million.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   (laughing)
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.480]   - Why is it gonna cost them money, doesn't it?
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.800]   'Cause you have to pay off all the leases.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.920]   - Oh, they're paying off the leases that you're closing.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.160]   - It's a great time to get used to office furniture.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.440]   So there's this play-sun in Palo Alto
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.120]   where they sell chairs that are normally $500, $150,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.320]   'cause they're all former Google chairs.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.480]   Thousands of them out there.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.600]   - I used to be friends with a guy who founded repo depot.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.720]   - Yes, I remember that guy, I remember him.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.520]   - Yeah, you were flying, he was a pilot.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.400]   What's his name?
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   - Oh, I forgot his name. - He was a pilot
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.240]   flying with him one day.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.840]   - Nice guy, he used to be Ron,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.680]   Ron's on the, he used to be--
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.600]   - He used to be on my show all the time
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   doing gadgets and stuff.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.520]   - He's still alive.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.640]   He's still with us.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   - I don't know.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.120]   - I don't even, I haven't touched with him in here anyway.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.400]   - Sorry, but repo depot.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.680]   - Repo depot, repo depot, when we work with closing down,
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.920]   that was a good time to get office furniture.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.720]   But with the cuts at Google, the cuts at Twitter,
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.320]   the cuts going on, Amazon everywhere at the moment,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.000]   if you want some stuff for your work from home set up,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.640]   now is the time to be doing it.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.360]   - Yeah, his name is Ron Rossberg,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.800]   and I'm just trying to find out if he's dead yet, sorry.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.160]   - Before we pivot completely away from--
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.640]   - Yes, get back, please.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.360]   - From popular sports.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.000]   - Ron is still with us, thank you very much.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.240]   - Oh good. - Sorry, Ron.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.560]   - I didn't mean-- - Take a drink.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.160]   - Okay, go ahead.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.200]   - There's a point I wanted to make about,
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.360]   people have been used to watching sports
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.000]   on their cable or their satellite TV,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.920]   and now that's gonna be on these streaming services
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.280]   that they have to log into if they're not
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.720]   at their home location.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.640]   And just like you don't attach your phone
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.960]   to a rental car, remember to log out
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.480]   if you're traveling somewhere and you've logged
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.600]   into one of these services,
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.400]   because I can tell you that when I didn't remember
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.440]   to log out, no, nothing bad happened,
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.340]   but I stay, you know, the place where I was staying,
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.960]   the staff generally uses the room
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.680]   where my husband and I were sleeping,
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.600]   and I think it was the chef, actually, who uses the room.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.800]   - Honey, what are all these porn movies
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.720]   charged on your bill for?
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   - Actually, it was so cute.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.220]   There was no porn.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.560]   It was all like soothing jazz music.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.600]   - How are you listening to soothing jazz?
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.000]   - In a hotel?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.720]   - Yeah, I had to log out remotely
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.560]   to turn off the soothing jazz.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.040]   - I always paranoid, 'cause that actually is a feature
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.760]   I like in hotels now, is you can often sign
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.920]   into your own stuff and use your own accounts,
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.240]   which is really much better than any of the options
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.640]   normally that they offer in hotels.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.720]   And I always am paranoid about that, Denise.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.280]   And most of the time I check and it says
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.640]   we will log you out when you check out,
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.320]   but, godly, if they don't, that wouldn't be so good.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.160]   - Well, I always watch my movies,
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.040]   either on my laptop or my tablet,
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.760]   or even my phone rather than you.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.360]   I don't think I've ever turned on a TV in a hotel room
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   in a year or two, even, 'cause I have direct TV,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.280]   which streams, so I can watch, you know,
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.400]   my local TV if I want to, from my hotel on my device.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.960]   So, but.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:47.720]   - Honey, what's this bill for $300 in Kenny Rankin videos?
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.800]   - That's funny, he was watching Smooth Jazz.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   - Oh yeah, Aldi's very sort of ambient YouTube videos
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.200]   of like coffee shot jazz.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.040]   - Oh, I love that.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.800]   I love those videos.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.280]   I have a lot of those in my playlist, actually.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.200]   Let's see, what else about YouTube?
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   YouTube shorts, the TikTok videos, I'm sorry.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.480]   Are my not supposed to know they were just
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.920]   ripping the whole idea off from TikTok?
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.280]   Maybe I wasn't supposed to know that.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.800]   Their tick, their clone TikTok,
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.080]   now averages more than 50 billion views a day,
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.560]   50 billion, the scale of YouTube is mind boggling.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.320]   That's up from 30 billion early last year.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.880]   The good news is, as of February 1st,
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.120]   YouTube short creators are gonna get some ad sharing
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.480]   and they're gonna get a decent amount,
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.200]   45% based on views.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.800]   - It's causing a huge rock us in the TikTok
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.640]   creator community, because TikTok--
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.960]   - They're not getting these out.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.440]   - So absolutely minimum.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.920]   - That you could start posting, you know,
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.480]   exactly the same content to TikTok.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.120]   Recruit people on TikTok to go to your YouTube channel
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.360]   and suddenly you're making thousands and thousands
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.800]   rather than diddly squat.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.120]   - I asked myself about this, because TikTok has
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:08.080]   his creators fund and, you know, they put out press releases.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.640]   We're putting a hundred million dollars
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.040]   into the creators fund.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.520]   - And to get you a share.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.840]   - And he said, yeah, no, I don't get much.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.840]   He makes his own money though, because he has his own
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.120]   advertisers on his TikTok.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.640]   And to their credit, they don't prevent that.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.200]   Although I am pretty sure, just looking,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.320]   that when he puts an ad, when it's a promoted video,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.520]   it doesn't get in the for you page.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.120]   There's no promotion at all.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.520]   TikTok definitely does not help those along.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.600]   - Does anybody know how Facebook Reels is doing?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.880]   'Cause I mean, I see them all the time
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.520]   when I go into Facebook.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.440]   - He's short videos and they seem to know my case
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.320]   because they show me a lot of airplanes
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   taking off and landing.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.920]   I don't know what that said about me.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.480]   (laughing)
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.000]   - That's what I get.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.160]   - Yeah, I mean, of course, they probably started that
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.680]   with Instagram, they call them Reels on Instagram.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.920]   And now you've got Facebook Reels.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.840]   All of it is basically, well, we see them on TikTok.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   Let's get those creators over here.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   And honestly, if YouTube's offering more money,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.560]   a creator, I've talked to Henry about this.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.320]   I said, well, you should do, he does the shorts.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.560]   You should do more shorts.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:14.000]   The problem is, creators get whiplashed
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.080]   because then YouTube will stop paying them
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.400]   and the next one will come along.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.920]   And every time you move, you leave your audience behind.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.480]   So I think Henry's smart enough to know
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.360]   that you can't chase that revenue.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.600]   So he doesn't worry so much about what he's gonna get
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.080]   from creators' funds or any of these systems
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.280]   and really just focuses on monetizing it his own way.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.640]   - I mean, if you think about,
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.720]   they don't break it out specifically, I don't think,
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.200]   in terms of what Reels is doing,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.040]   is separate from Instagram.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.760]   But Meta obviously was down what, 4%.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.720]   - Not a good quarter for Meta, yes.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.360]   - Not a good quarter for them, including this,
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.040]   I found this to be just a fantastic number.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.920]   They spent, was it 13 billion in a year
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.320]   on their reality labs?
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.480]   - Yeah, last year was 10.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.680]   Now it's up to 13.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.760]   - Is she 13?
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.600]   - Yeah.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   - And somebody pointed out that--
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.440]   - And he did that.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.760]   - It's tiny bit.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.600]   - It's tiny bit.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   - The end that went to the next thing for a parent's guide
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.440]   to virtual reality, so I'm happy about that.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.520]   - So go ahead and tell us.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   - So somebody pointed out that Apple back in 2007
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:36.080]   spent just over 150 million to make the first iPhone
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.440]   in R&D and Google spent 13 billion
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.160]   in one year, so it makes it doesn't exist.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.000]   - Yeah.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.840]   - Meta, sorry, so--
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.160]   - Well it's a pivot.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.760]   Actually I'm looking at the meta,
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.320]   meta stock went up a lot
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.720]   because they had fourth quarter revenue
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.680]   better than estimates, right?
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.600]   They also did a 40 billion.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.400]   - And they also said they're gonna fire a bunch of people.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.880]   - Fire a bunch of people and a 40 billion dollar stock buyback.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.760]   So a lot of this is just, you know, hey, don't get scared.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.760]   Their revenue was up a little bit, 32.17 billion.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:15.760]   - They restructured charges for its family of apps segment
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.800]   and its reality labs unit.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.600]   So it's hard to say.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.920]   They did, and this was a big number, top line number,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.640]   they did announce two billion daily active users.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.320]   That is kind of amazing.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.240]   Daily, daily, almost three billion monthly active users.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.680]   And their average revenue per user
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.120]   this is for a year is $10.86.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.360]   - You're worried that's more than a quarter
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.160]   of the people on the planet.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.640]   - Yeah, it's just under eight billion people in the world.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.800]   - It's mind boggling.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.000]   Now I have to say, if you know
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.040]   that they make $11 a year on you,
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:01.400]   why don't they say, hey, $15 a year, no ads?
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.560]   Do a clean Facebook, they'd make more money
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.520]   and you'd have a lot of happy users.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.600]   - I wonder though, how much they make on America?
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.320]   Not everybody in the world can afford $15 a year.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.000]   I mean, obviously people can have ads.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.960]   Those people can have all the crappy Facebook spyware.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.400]   That's fine.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.240]   You get what you pay for.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.000]   I don't know, maybe they don't want to do that.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.080]   Famously, Microsoft told Paul Thorett
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.640]   when he asked them, why do you have ads in Windows?
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.080]   Why don't you offer a version of Windows,
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.840]   a subscription version with no ads?
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.760]   And they said to do so would be tantamount to admitting
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   that we're crapping up your Windows.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.080]   So maybe Facebook doesn't want to say,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.720]   well, for $15 you could have a real nice experience
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.520]   or you could just still have your crappy experience.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.080]   Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 4% from last year.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.400]   This was the down part we were talking about, Will.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.760]   Third straight quarter of declining sales,
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   but this is a big one.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.200]   The company's costs and expenses up 22%.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.360]   And I think a lot of that is this VR push,
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.000]   this meta push.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.520]   Push.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.360]   Headshot.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.040]   And again, just so much, so much money in,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.680]   what have they got?
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   So again, 4.2 billion, just in Q4 in restructuring charges.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.800]   So paying off the people, they spent another,
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.360]   after saying, after me laughing at 500 million for Google,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   1.88 billion in Q4 for facilities consolidation.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.240]   Oh, wow.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.720]   I mean, that's wild.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.560]   That is wild.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.120]   At a certain point, these tech companies
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.080]   are basically like glorified real estate companies.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.560]   Now I understand why Elon Musk doesn't want to pay rent.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.960]   Even if the King sues him, he doesn't want to pay rent.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.640]   (laughing)
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.000]   People are enjoying that, by the way.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.760]   Well, here in the colonies that the King's estate,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.640]   the crown estate, they call it,
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.120]   which is the real estate buildings of the family,
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.920]   include offices in London for meta.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.680]   I'm sorry for Twitter, and Twitter does not pay there.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.520]   So they're suing.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.520]   The crown estate is suing Twitter for--
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.640]   I have been to those offices, they're very nice.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.920]   They're at the crown estate,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.080]   and the King is gonna have at them.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.240]   Do you get special privileges if you're the crown estate
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.280]   in the UK, it is like the guy with the weak stay well.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.120]   Oh yeah, like, so the,
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.120]   I'm almost certain that the income from the crown estate
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.640]   doesn't get taxed.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.920]   Nice deal.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.760]   So if you're the King,
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.160]   you just rakle that money in tax-free.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.920]   Nice deal.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.600]   Company, I'm talking about meta now, not the crown estate.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.240]   Although someday we should do a whole show
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.600]   on the crown estate.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.560]   (laughing)
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:49.040]   So are people in the UK reading spare like we are in the US?
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.800]   No, we're all sort of--
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:53.640]   You've had enough.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.680]   I think there's a, because it gets serialized so much
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.040]   in the newspapers,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.440]   I think there is just a Harry fatigue.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.080]   Harry fatigue.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.080]   That's spelled H-A-R-R, why not H-A-I-R, why I believe.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:07.920]   (laughing)
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.760]   Company expects that,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.880]   meta, I'm back to meta, sorry.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.080]   Meta, by the way, the United Kingdom government
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.400]   has just cut Will Harris off completely.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.480]   Oh no, he's back now.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.040]   (laughing)
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.960]   I mean, if what was gonna be a conspiracy theorist,
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.720]   if one was going to be.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.920]   Rishi Sunak said,
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.160]   "Get that guy out there!"
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.880]   Meta, the company, when I say the company,
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.040]   I'm talking meta, expects its total expenses in 20,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.480]   23 will be 89 to 95 billion dollars.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.600]   That's lower than they thought
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.400]   due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.480]   Maybe because they laid 11,000 people off.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.400]   That would do it.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.520]   Data center construction going down.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.840]   And again, the 40 billion dollar stock repurchase plan.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.600]   That's a good way to keep your stock price supported.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.400]   That's Apple learned all about that.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:11.360]   Actually, this helped meta stock a little bit, which is good.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.400]   Apple did not have a great quarter.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.360]   Apple sales shrink as pandemic rally ends
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.560]   for iPhone makers, as the Wall Street Journal.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.160]   Quarterly revenue down on Apple for the first time
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.720]   in four years, manufacturing disruptions in China
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.680]   meant it couldn't make enough iPhones to sell.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.120]   That I presume is turning around.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.080]   Maybe that'll show a better results in this next quarter.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   Although Tim Cook once again invoked the headwinds,
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.160]   he said, "Good morning!
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.360]   "The wind was in our face for the fourth quarter."
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.400]   Economic pressures.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.840]   Apple's revenue down 5% for the holiday quarter
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.360]   entering in December.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.320]   Well below analyst estimate.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.040]   Of course, I'm sure the stock did not get heard.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.880]   It's the trip Miller at the Gilleen Capital Partners
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.320]   that instead of playing with tailwinds,
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.920]   they're playing with headwinds now.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.520]   Much like the Chinese balloon.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.800]   So here's the problem.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.720]   If you have a perfectly good iPhone 12 or iPhone 13--
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.680]   Yeah, you don't need no one.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.440]   You really need an iPhone 14 now.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   Or the same with any technology.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.280]   Any of these.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.600]   Samsung this week announced its Galaxy S23.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.760]   And I think they were hard pressed to find a reason
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.880]   why anybody using an S22 should upgrade.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.480]   It's just, well, we got a two-
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.320]   Interesting.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   We have a two-order megapixel camera now.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.160]   Okay.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.560]   Interestingly, talking about thinking about headwinds
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.960]   and tailwinds, the interesting sort of noodle
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.440]   on the Apple revenue was that if you took out
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.400]   the currency fluctuations and the varying weakness
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.040]   and strength of the dollar,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.280]   Apple's revenue actually grew year on year.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.640]   It was just the fact that the US dollar
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.120]   has been surprisingly resilient.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.960]   Oh, that's, yeah.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.920]   To the rest of the sort of world having a meltdown
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   that actually it's meant they made slightly less money,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.000]   which is an Esther.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.040]   I thought the dollar, I thought the dollar,
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.400]   oh, it's because the dollar's stronger.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.360]   Got it.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.200]   So yeah, yes.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.720]   Do they make less money in other territory
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:18.640]   comparatively?
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.040]   You also cook, also said, we estimated we would have grown
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.480]   on the iPhone absent, the supply constraints.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.520]   So it's foreign exchange rate,
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.400]   currency fluctuations and supply chain problems
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.600]   held them back.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.000]   All right, I don't know.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   It feels like, of course, Apple,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.080]   Apple also making a bet as is meta
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.520]   on the future of virtual reality and augmented reality.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   Yeah, well, you always have to get that next big thing.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.080]   They're not going to bet the company on it,
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.920]   I don't think.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.760]   No.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.080]   Well, they don't need to.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   They don't need to.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.880]   I think Mark Zuckerberg saw that
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.920]   the social network part of their business
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.640]   was not going to, despite two billion daily active users,
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.960]   maybe he's wrong, I don't know,
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.400]   was not, I didn't have a bright future.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.160]   So he wanted to pivot.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.800]   Apple, which has almost 50% of its income
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.240]   comes from the iPhone, says we're very happy here.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.840]   Thank you very much, but we should probably
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.200]   invest a little bit of that in what's coming.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.480]   Whether it's a car or...
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.560]   Although having, I thought it was really interesting
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.720]   that despite sort of saying,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.680]   they're investing a little bit in new things,
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.360]   they announced they're dropping the role
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.760]   of industrial design chief.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.600]   Yes.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.480]   Yeah, Evan Chanky, who's been wearing his Johnny I.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.840]   Since Johnny left, Evan's Hank, he's been running it.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.320]   When she announced she was going to leave.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.040]   And now, Apple says, no, we don't.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.400]   Do we really need a chief of design,
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.120]   industrial designers, they'll still have a team,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.520]   but they'll report to the chief operating officer,
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.000]   Jeff Williams, instead of having a design.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.840]   But nobody could do a commercial as good as Johnny I could.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.120]   I don't know if they ever put those in the air,
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.400]   but they used to show them at the announcements
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.000]   and he would talk in this British accent.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.240]   In the white room.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.880]   In the white room.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.120]   Today, we're announcing the thinnest
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.040]   high-power four iPhone we've ever made.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.040]   Yes.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   Actually.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.960]   Oh, you know what, it's maybe every time they announce
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.240]   a new iPhone, they wish it was the best iPhone ever.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.240]   Well, why wouldn't it be the best iPhone?
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.600]   Back to the newest iPhone.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.800]   This is not cool.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   No, this is the crappy one.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   Get glass here.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.640]   You know what Johnny I was up to, by the way,
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.480]   just want you to know.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.320]   He just designed a clown nose.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.120]   But it's a really good clown nose.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.120]   It's for comic relief.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   This is the Johnny I've designed red clown nose for charity.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   Oh.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.360]   It looks like the old clown nose to me.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.200]   Well, I think the old one was just, you know, foam.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.760]   Oh, I think he's upgraded.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.080]   Oh, he's upgraded, baby.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.760]   This is like a honeycomb with a...
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.600]   Oh my God.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.600]   So they do this every year.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.240]   This might seem really weird, but this is a really big thing in England.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.240]   It's a red nose day.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   Is one of the biggest charity at all.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.080]   Do you wear a red nose on a red nose day?
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   Comic relief day.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   I mean, you might do for like a group photo at work, but it's one of those things you sort
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.480]   of like buy and then put on your desk.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.480]   No, because what am I really going to do?
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.920]   So this benefits comic relief.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.560]   What does comic reliefs money go to?
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.040]   Is it AIDS?
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.400]   Mostly like humanitarian stuff in Africa.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.040]   African relief.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.560]   It's a honeycomb.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.280]   It's like the 80s.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.800]   This is the best red nose we've ever made.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:46.560]   Honeycomb paper construction with plastic arkets on the side and a hinge detail that
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.760]   lets you open and close the nose.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.920]   Not just well designed, but it sounds like it might be sustainable.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.120]   It's sustainable.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.920]   Each nose comes with its own air pods like case.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.600]   You can keep it in your pocket for when you really need.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.240]   When you really need a red nose.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.760]   It does charge in the case.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   But it is.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   Yes.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.880]   But it's interesting that I think that Apple has just sort of decided that it doesn't really
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:23.360]   want these huge personalities dominating its kind of its new cycles, its pressures.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.680]   And I think we've seen like the last, you know, even the last few announcements, you
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.480]   see more and more VPs and SVPs from different bits of the company standing up and giving
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.480]   these presentations.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.360]   And it seems to me like they're really trying to move away from like, you know, Steve Jobs
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.760]   was always the icon of Apple when Steve Jobs left out as a huge hit.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.800]   Johnny Ive was sort of the next icon when he leaves.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.960]   That was obviously a huge hit.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.360]   It seems to me like they're sort of going more along like having a squad rather than
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.920]   having just a handful of stuff.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:56.000]   I think it's fair to say they felt burned in the last years by Johnny Ive.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.080]   That Johnny Ive who insisted thinner in the face of all functionality, including battery
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080]   life.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.240]   And he was the one who championed the butterfly keyboard and would not let Apple get rid
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   of it for years.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.480]   I mean, we don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure because we think as soon as Johnny left,
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.600]   it was like we're putting ports back on these things.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.080]   We are taking away the butterfly keyboard.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.840]   So I feel I'm going to, this is projecting, but I'm going to guess they felt a little
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   burned maybe even by the cult of Steve Jobs.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:31.320]   But at least when it was Steve and Johnny, Steve could keep kind of a lid on it.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:37.760]   And Steve did seem to have a good eye for functionality and the right thing to do.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.360]   Johnny was designed, I mean, look at this nose.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.920]   I mean, talk about over designed.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.760]   Johnny was always doing that, right?
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.280]   And I think that they felt a little bit burned.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.680]   So maybe that's why, I mean, I think everybody agrees.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.760]   Evan Sankey was an excellent design chief.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.720]   But the fact that I think very wise, you've only got, you've only got to look at, you know,
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:04.440]   Tim Cook does not have the same cult of personality around his running of Apple that for example,
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.240]   Mark Zuckerberg does.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.440]   And you can see what Mark Zuckerberg is currently, you know, the amount of money he is absolutely
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.640]   spaffing up the wall at Facebook on this VR project is, you know, not something that
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   they would do at Apple.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.800]   I think there's a little bit more financial discipline there.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.000]   And Tim Cook himself doesn't have a particularly dynamic personality.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.960]   I mean, he's a good, as far as I'm told, he's a good CEO and a very competent administrator,
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.680]   but he's not, you know, I don't think maybe his brand is low profile, right?
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.720]   His brand is like Mr.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   Mr.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   Com.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.720]   But also Mr.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.480]   Supply Chain, Mr.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.080]   Cut costs, increased profit.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:51.640]   I mean, under his leadership, Apple has become an extremely successful company much more so
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.360]   than under Steve Jobs.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.240]   So he's got a good reputation.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.960]   I think, you know, one of the things they did, and this is Tim did this to keep Johnny
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:06.120]   Ive, who I think in some degrees was kind of the Steve Jobs legacy.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:12.080]   And maybe in some ways, trying to preserve a little bit of Steve is he gave Johnny put
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:18.880]   him in charge, not of just industrial design, but in charge of software and charge of everything.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   And I think in hindsight, that was a mistake for Apple.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.600]   Apple went through some bad years.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.560]   And as soon as as soon as Johnny left and they came out with Apple Silicon, their new
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.200]   chips, this is a different company.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:37.720]   So yeah, I can see why maybe they're saying, do we really want somebody with that much
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   power?
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.040]   Yeah, you never want the person to be bigger than the company, right?
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.640]   Wow.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.840]   What do we make a Veelon Maschen?
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.440]   I mean, case in point, right?
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.640]   I missed last week's show.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.160]   Did you guys talk about the price cuts at Tesla at all?
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.960]   No, you're a Tesla owner.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.320]   So my net worth just went down because I own a four year old Tesla, which used to be worth
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   $40,000.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.480]   And now it's worth about $30,000 because they dramatically lowered the price.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.960]   I'm fine with me because I don't plan to sell it right now.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:17.400]   But I mean, but they really got a lot of people angry who had just bought a Tesla to find
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.320]   out a week later that they could have bought that same car for $15,000 less.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.880]   But wait, because as soon as the government said, oh, the Model Y is an SUV and you're
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:32.280]   going to get that $7,500 rebate, they raised the price on the Model Y.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.280]   Yep.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.080]   The other thing that is another thing that would irk me to be honest.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.200]   If Elon is listening, if he goes listening, if they would allow people who paid for the
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:48.600]   full self-driving, which is now $15,000, if they would allow them to keep that software,
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.800]   and if they buy new hardware, the way Microsoft does, right?
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:55.040]   If you buy a new computer, you could keep Microsoft Office and put it on your new computer.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.280]   If they were to do that, they would sell a ton of new Teslas to their existing customer
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   base.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.480]   But there's like a $15,000 dollar penalty to upgrade if you want to keep that full self-driving
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.480]   software.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.920]   It's probably the challenge with that one, Larry, that the full self-driving has to actually
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   work.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.800]   Well, that doesn't stop me from buying it.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.920]   I mean, I paid $7,000 for it, but I bought it.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.480]   I paid $5,000 for it on my Model X.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.680]   Never got it, never used it.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.080]   Don't have the car anymore.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.080]   And no rebate, right?
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.080]   No, no, no rebate.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.080]   They didn't give it back to you.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.080]   No free fund.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.080]   So no back-sees.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:35.440]   No news besides that, because they are two stories.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:41.320]   One is that Twitter is cutting off free access to the API for everybody.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:46.400]   And there's some concern among Twitter users that this is going to get rid of some of
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.680]   the things that made Twitter the most interesting.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.520]   Some of the automated accounts that people really liked at Twitter because they're going
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.520]   to have to pay too.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.800]   And many of the people run these automated accounts.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.000]   Yeah, yeah, we're not going to do it.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   There's an example.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.040]   BuzzFeed has an example of a Twitter bot called Make It A Quote.
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.520]   I'm not, are you familiar with this one?
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:16.040]   Has more followers than me, half a million followers, you can reply to any tweet, add
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:21.260]   the tag, add Make It A Quote, and then the bot responds with the tweet's text overlaid
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.200]   onto an image.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:31.840]   But the guy who does it, 23 year old German student named Daniel, said, "I can't, I'm
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   not going to pay for you.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.160]   I'm not going to pay to do this."
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.040]   He says, "There's a step in the wrong direction.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:42.200]   Most of the API usage brings a lot of value to Twitter.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.600]   And even though I run one of the biggest bots on the platform, I'm going to consider shutting
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:46.600]   it down.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.440]   Now, they still haven't said how much it'll cost.
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   I could see Elon.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.280]   You know, Elon never, there's no policy that's not changeable.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.160]   I could see him changing his mind saying, "Well, for you, you're going to be a little
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   bit more, whatever."
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.160]   Sure.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:03.560]   He seems to be focused on volume right now, but maybe it would be more quantitative and
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.360]   qualitative than quantitative.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.400]   I think one of the things that's been sad about the whole API access thing, I mean,
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.880]   quite apart from the fact that the tweet bot was my favorite client and is like about
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:22.720]   a million times better than the official Twitter iOS client, which is verging on unusable.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:28.160]   If you run multiple Twitter accounts from a desktop as a professional, you probably use
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.600]   third-party software to manage the sort of flurry of DMs and replies and incoming.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:39.360]   And by killing that API, they're really making it difficult for the people that they're selling
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   to.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   You know, Elon keeps saying, "What's more advertisers?
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.000]   What's more advertisers on the platform?"
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Well, great.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.280]   But if I'm an advertising agency and I run 15 different Twitter accounts, you need to
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:55.560]   make it easy for me to manage them, not have to log in and out of the actual Twitter dashboard
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.880]   30 times a day.
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.960]   He really has not got the left hand talking to the right hand on this one.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:10.520]   There is a bot called Pepito the Cat who tweeted, "Oh, this change will kill Pepito
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.520]   the Cat."
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.880]   "Pepito is part of Twitter history.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.600]   He posts quality content with great engagement."
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.040]   And of course, Elon said, "Well, okay.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:25.560]   I guess we could give all verified users access to the API for posts like this eight bucks
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.660]   a month."
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:33.200]   I don't understand what Elon's at because he's not going to make enough money from these
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:41.160]   onesie-too-zy, you know, small dollar amounts to make up for the $44 billion, 13 billion
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.280]   of which is borrowed.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.720]   So I don't understand why he's screwing with it, but you know, that's his to screw with.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.320]   Nobody can deny that.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.960]   The other story is actually a big victory for Elon Musk.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:49:01.560]   You remember the tweet, "Funding secured," in which he announced, apparently, lyingly,
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:07.280]   that he was going to take Tesla private and that he had secured funding for that?
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.960]   Well, it wasn't true.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:16.000]   Investors have sued.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:24.200]   But a jury came back after two hours of deliberation on Friday and said, "Not guilty.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.520]   Elon did not cost investors any money.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.040]   Thank you very much."
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.480]   He won the lawsuit.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.480]   It's over.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.120]   I was surprised by that.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.200]   I mean, we didn't hear the testimony.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   I didn't anyway.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   Right.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.040]   I think, you know, you could tell us, Denise, there have to be damages.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.040]   I like real damages.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:49.320]   You can't just say, "Well, I was offended."
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.560]   Can you bring me up to speed?
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.960]   I was looking at IRC and I kind of lost this track of where we were.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.840]   So here's the first tweet.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   From Elon Musk, this is back in 2017, "I'm considering taking Tesla private at $420."
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.160]   By the way, obviously a mean number.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:15.000]   Of course, he believes that when you pay $54.20 for Twitter, so anyway, I'll share, funding
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.200]   secured.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:24.680]   Now, if you own Tesla stock or maybe if you don't own Tesla stock and you look at the
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.000]   price and you say, "Oh, I could make some money if I bought a lot of Tesla stock right
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.640]   now because it's going to go for $420," he settled a lawsuit from the SEC, paid $40
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:43.800]   million, agreed to run every tweet by a lawyer, which he's not doing, I don't think.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:50.040]   In a second tweet, he said, "Investors support confirmed.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:55.720]   Only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on a shareholder vote."
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:59.800]   I think the later the facts of the case, I believe were that he had in fact not-
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   I mean, he just made up the whole-
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   You made up.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   Right.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:11.400]   What I don't get is if he can be fined, if the FEC fined him $40 million for breaking
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:16.560]   securities rules, then how can it then follow that Tesla shareholders suffered no harm?
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.920]   I mean, they all just suffered at least $40 million worth of harm.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.520]   I mean, I could see if somebody would buy stock saying, "Oh, it's going to go up,"
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.520]   or sell stock.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.080]   I mean, I could see people would respond to this.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.160]   Here's the crux.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.720]   Elon has gotten to the point.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.720]   I think this is what came through loud and clear from what the jury did in this private
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:41.080]   shareholder lawsuit.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:44.640]   Jury basically said, "We don't take what he says seriously.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.000]   You can't take what he says seriously."
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.600]   They had to determine whether the statements that he made had a material impact on their
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.960]   decisions, whether to buy a sellhold, et cetera.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:05.120]   They found, "No, it didn't," because basically they didn't spell this out.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.800]   But I think what the jury's sentiments must have been is it's Elon.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:18.280]   Because the judge said, no, you can assume that the tweet about securing funding was not
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   accurate.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:25.280]   You can, jury, you can say, "We're going to stipulate it wasn't accurate."
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:33.160]   So then the question is, if the market's response to that tweet was Elon's fault and
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.400]   whether he and the board should be liable, and as you say, we don't know exactly what
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.800]   the jury was thinking, but after a mere two hours, which is pretty quick, takes an hour
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:48.400]   and a half to fill out the forms probably, the jury said, "No, they're not responsible."
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:53.840]   Musk's lawyer in closing arguments said, "Just because it's a bad tweet doesn't mean
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.840]   it's fraud."
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840]   Right.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   Right.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:03.160]   And I think people have just gotten so inured to what you were saying a minute ago that
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:11.760]   he changes his mind every 10 minutes that you can't rely on what he's saying from one
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   day to the next.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:17.120]   And with the treaty, Elon, like the onion, it's like, "Oh, it's fat-tire.
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   It's not true.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   What do you think he said?"
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   Or Tucker Carlson, either way.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   Or Tucker Carlson, exactly.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   I mean, same defense.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   It is the same defense.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   That's the Tucker Carlson.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:28.360]   Yeah, didn't Tucker literally say that it was just what he was saying with satire?
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.360]   It's just not news.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   It's entertainment, your honor.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.280]   Can anybody get away with that?
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.640]   Can Biden get away with that if he lies to the public?
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   I was just joking around.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.800]   Well, Elon, let's be fair.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.800]   Well, let's be fair.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:40.800]   Well, Trump said that.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.440]   Trump actually did say one thing with joking around.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   But let's be fair.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.440]   Elon's not the president.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:52.080]   Well, I mean, he doesn't have some higher responsibilities, just some guy, you know?
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.080]   Right.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.920]   And he's a guy who's not afraid to try lawsuits.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.560]   He has a lot of success when he actually takes things to trial.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.160]   It goes in front of a jury.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.280]   In this case, he actually testified.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.040]   I am looking at a business insider, market insider, that says, "Elon's funding secure
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:13.760]   tweet cost investors $12 billion over 10 days."
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.920]   And the jury had that information.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.920]   But I guess you're right.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.040]   I think the jury said, "Well, it's your fault."
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.040]   It's not Elon's fault.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   It's your fault.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.520]   Well, if a CEO tells you something material is going to happen, it seems to me you have
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.080]   a reasonable, you know, it's a reasonable to act on that.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.080]   It's kind of stunning.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   Right.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.080]   I'm really surprised by this jury.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:34.080]   And that's what the plaintiffs would have had to prove in this case.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   And the jury found they didn't prove it, that it wasn't material to their decision.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.880]   Or, as I said, we weren't in the trial.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.720]   So who knows what they actually did.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:45.080]   Or, Denise, is it possible that jury just really likes Elon Musk?
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.080]   It's possible.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.080]   It was in San Francisco.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.080]   I mean, we've seen this happen before with celebrity defendants.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:55.640]   A lot of times they're given more latitude than you or I would be.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:05.360]   And despite the poll that has fallen over Elon's reputation in the last few months, until recently,
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.600]   he was kind of, you know, Iron Man.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.120]   I want to put a bumper sticker on my Tesla because I bought this before I knew what Elon's
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   politics were.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.360]   There is such a bumper sticker.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:17.360]   You can get it by the way.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.360]   I probably have.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:20.360]   Let's take a look.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   Go ahead.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:29.360]   I know, no, no, I was going to say he has a track record of trying to tinker with objects
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:36.240]   that might have suffered from having innovation in their arena.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   The blame thrower comes to mind.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   Oh my gosh.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   And the boring.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240]   And the boring.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.240]   Yes.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.240]   Right.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:50.840]   Maybe he'll hire Johnny.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.320]   I have to bring the new and improved clown nose under the Tesla umbrella and rehabilitate
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.320]   his image that way.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:00.120]   Do you say I'm actually, I think history might look back once all the storm and dron is over
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.760]   at Elon 100 years from now and say, oh, he was hysterical.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.600]   He was just what the society needed.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.640]   He was a prankster.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.360]   He was, he was Loki.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.840]   He was, he was mischievous.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.840]   I think history may be known as important.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.440]   Yeah, I think history might.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.640]   Look at, look at what they say about Thomas Edison.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.640]   Electrocuting an elephant.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.240]   Nobody, nobody's upset about that anymore.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.840]   I feel like the Elon's going to get away with this to be honest and this jury decision
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.200]   is just the beginning.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.320]   And you know, maybe he should.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.520]   I'm not, I'm not saying he shouldn't.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.920]   It's fascinating to watch.
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.920]   It's our Elon segment.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.840]   I guess you have to have one in every show.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.560]   Sorry about that.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.720]   We got more to talk about in just a bit.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.720]   We have a great panel.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:50.400]   Denise Howell is here.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.400]   My internet attorney.
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:54.640]   Oh, you got a new, a new URL here.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.200]   Say culture.net.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   What's that?
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   Yes.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.240]   And thank you so much for updating on the fly.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:08.280]   I want to give a plug to a podcast network that will shortly be launching at hearsayculture.com
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:13.920]   called the hearsayculture network where I and a few folks who you might have seen on
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.400]   this week in law back in the day.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:23.840]   We've got Dave Levine, who's a professor at Elon University and a fellow at Stanford.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.920]   He's done a radio show at Stanford at KZSU for quite some time.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.040]   Also by the same name hearsayculture.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:36.480]   And John Tyranian, who also was a law professor now in private practice.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.920]   And we're going to do some shows.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:41.640]   So what a great name for a podcast network hearsayculture.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.600]   I love that.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.160]   What's the name of your show going to be?
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.160]   Do you know?
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.280]   I'm going to have my own show called uneven distribution with the nod to William Gibson.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.280]   The future is here.
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.680]   It's just not evenly distributed.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.680]   Yes.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:55.680]   Love it.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.680]   Right.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.120]   And Dave and I are doing a show together called R&D with D&D.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.080]   Dave and Denise.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.360]   Oh, I love it.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.360]   Not not Dungeons and Dragons.
[00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   No.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:08.360]   Sadly, no.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:15.880]   But we have recorded a few shows and I believe the audio for one of them is up on hearsayculture.com
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.400]   if you want to sample it.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.400]   Nice.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.880]   This is exciting.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:20.880]   Congratulations.
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:21.880]   Thank you.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:25.360]   Will it be like this week in law or what do you want to do with it?
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   Well, it's funny.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:32.280]   We're all lawyers, but we don't want to do completely law driven shows at all.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:38.600]   It's much more about uneven distribution is going to be much more about looking at technologies
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:44.440]   and their impact on our lives and looking to the future and trying to help people anticipate
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:48.280]   what's coming at them if they are not already thinking along those lines.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.280]   I'm thrilled.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.280]   I'm so thrilled.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:51.280]   This is great.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:52.280]   Thank you.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.800]   Well, we were always so sad that we had to cancel this week in law.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.360]   It really broke my heart because it's a great show and I'm so glad to see you're back on
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.000]   the air or we'll be soon.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   That's really good.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.080]   Yes, we're tinkering with back end stuff and getting all that in order.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   Tell me all about it.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.920]   Now, a little bit about that.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:14.880]   If they go to hearsayculture.com in the weeks to come, you will see the show.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   Yes.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.800]   As soon as we are live and launched, you will be the first to know.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.440]   It's going to be the hearsay culture network.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   That's great.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.440]   That's really great.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.880]   I see Christopher Michael.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.720]   Oh, I see that's a picture Christopher took of Esther Dyson.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.640]   I would love to listen to Esther Dyson.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   That's a great show.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.640]   That's exciting.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   Oh, very neat.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   Well, congratulations.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.840]   Here's saying culture.com.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:45.200]   Also with us, the publisher of some great books like F. Yeah, video games and things
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.080]   I learned from Mario's butt.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:50.280]   Yes, it's Will Harris.
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.920]   We do have lots of high-brow stuff too.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.600]   There is some really.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.680]   This is like for instance, here's another one.
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:02.480]   Digital cities and Atlas and exploration of the lot of video game content.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.680]   Video game cities.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:11.600]   We have an occasionally we get to do really fun things because of the kickstart, a sort
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.240]   of funding model that we do.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:21.360]   We've got a book called Flipping Patriarchy, which is about gender discrimination in the
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.360]   workplace.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.360]   Yes.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.320]   And we were able to, if you could send in proof that you were a woman, we would sell it to
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.840]   you for 65% less than the cover of remaking that much less.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.760]   We can't exactly charge you the same as a guy.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.760]   That makes sense.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.760]   That's great.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.360]   And we're overcharged for things like razor blades.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.240]   Oh, yeah, exactly.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   But it's pink, Denise.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.160]   That's not cheap.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.160]   Here's one.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.800]   Share where heroes, the renegades who redefine gaming at the dawn of the internet.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   This is great.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.120]   Yeah, that's a really good one.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.520]   That's like really early karmack and Romero.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.520]   I can't wait to read.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.160]   That's really good stuff.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.360]   I've been meaning to thank you because you sent me, last time you were on, you told me
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.560]   about this and you sent me a package.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.960]   And I've been loving the production is gorgeous of these two.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.120]   Unbound.com.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:16.920]   If you want to get involved and 42 is coming soon, that is when I will absolutely be ordering.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.720]   I can't wait to see that when that comes out.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.120]   Getting patriarchy by man who has it all.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.080]   It's a Twitter C to them, right?
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.280]   I love it.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.920]   And Larry Maggett, who is going to be celebrating on Tuesday, Safer Internet Day.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920]   Woo hoo.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   That's right.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.880]   Hey, Lisa, I want to tell you about it.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:48.160]   By the way, if anybody's listening from Utah, you want to look at Bill SB 152, which would
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.800]   require kids up to 18 to get parental permission to go on social media.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.280]   But more than that would require everyone.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.760]   It's a bit government ID before they can set up a social media account, talk about privacy
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.280]   issues, security issues.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.280]   It would establish a database of young people in Utah.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.920]   And we all know that databases can never be hacked.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.120]   So it's a law that I personally, in the name of protecting children, actually might harm
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.120]   children.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.400]   So we're kind of looking into this.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.880]   I'm just beginning to learn about it.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.840]   But apparently they're hearings going on this week.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:25.080]   So if you're in Utah, or if you just love Utah, and I like Utah, check out this SB 152.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.120]   It might be something people might want to weigh in on.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.120]   Unbelievable.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.760]   It is pretty unbelievable.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.560]   And they claim to protect children.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.960]   But first of all, doesn't a 17 year old have some free speech rights in America?
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.920]   Does the First Amendment say something about you have to be 18 to enjoy the right to access
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.800]   information or say what you believe in?
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.800]   Yeah, I could see maybe under 13 as the copper.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.800]   Yeah, the 13 of the copper law.
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.800]   Copper says.
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.800]   But 18, that's ridiculous.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   I know.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   It's ridiculous.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.520]   That would be, you know, any, I mean, you could be an LGBTQ kid whose parents are homophobic.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.480]   You could be a Muslim whose parents are anti.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.520]   You know, there's just a million reasons why some kids might want agency, either be their
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.520]   parents.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.120]   But the other part about it, having all of everyone, adults included, having to submit
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.240]   a government ID to get online, I know that the Brits may not have as many problems as
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240]   that.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.480]   That may not fly in this country.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.160]   There are plenty of school related First Amendment cases where minors have been found
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.560]   to have First Amendment rights.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.560]   Absolutely.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.360]   So anyway, look into that book.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.040]   You kind of wonder if the government doesn't want you to read certain books, the government
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.440]   doesn't want you to go on the internet.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.960]   What is the government hiding?
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.920]   May not target or suggest ads.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920]   Okay.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.920]   Shall limit hours of access?
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   What?
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.680]   You're not allowed to use the internet over at a certain time of night.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.240]   Now, not everybody, even kids have the same schedule.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.160]   I mean, there's something immoral about using the internet to AM if you, for whatever reason,
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.600]   maybe, you know, your lifestyle is that you sleep.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.640]   You don't sleep during those hours.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.840]   Talk about in the irony is, I don't know the political party who's behind this, but
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840]   it wouldn't surprise me.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.840]   We'll take a wild guess.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.280]   It's the same party who is so much in favor of capitalism.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.280]   Small government.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.320]   Let's not, let's keep the government out of our lives.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   Right.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   Exactly.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   All right.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.720]   I told them I wouldn't get political.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.000]   Sometimes you got a SB 152 Utah.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   Let's take a little break.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   We will come back.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.640]   I have more to talk about with our wonderful panel.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:38.000]   But first I want to talk about a great sponsor I got introduced to called Miro.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.280]   And I told him immediately, I said, this is going to, you're going to, this is going
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.440]   to be a challenge because Miro could be anything you want it to be.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.920]   So how do I describe Miro?
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.000]   Go to Miro.com.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.480]   Take a look.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.760]   It's like a whiteboard.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.920]   But you could do so many things.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:05:00.360]   Flowcharts, canbends, mind maps, brain writing, timeline builder.
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:06.280]   If you're using, if you're doing zoom meetings, you definitely want to use Miro to time your
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:13.160]   meetings to have, to have polls in your meetings, it is an amazing tool.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:18.120]   I want you to go to Miro.com and check it out because it's infinite, collaborate whiteboard
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:25.480]   gives teams a space that lives forever, not like your whiteboard in the conference room,
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.240]   where you can just drag and drop insights and data.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   Nothing is lost.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.040]   Nothing is forgotten.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.400]   And the breadth of use cases for Miro is mind boggling.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.440]   You could build visual assets.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.760]   You could present with Miro.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.640]   You can run brainstorms across functional teams.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:46.120]   It's the perfect thing for a hybrid workspace where you have people at home, people in the
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.640]   office.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:51.240]   If you're doing products, it's incredible for product teams.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.000]   One great product needs input from everybody.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.320]   That's where Miro can come in with its capabilities to democratize collaboration and input for
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   brainstorming.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.800]   Miro users love it.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:09.840]   But my challenge is how do I describe what Miro can do?
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.240]   It can do so much.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.000]   Here's another thing you might want to take a look at.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.160]   Go to the Miroverse@Miro.com.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.920]   This is a universe of user created and contributed Miro boards.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.960]   Let me just show you a few of these.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:28.360]   These are incredible.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:36.000]   From everything from ice breakers to calendars to service blueprint template, I don't even
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.920]   know what that is.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.840]   Here's a midnight sailboat retrospective or a Beatles retrospective.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:50.720]   You'll like this one from the British government, a Harry Potter retrospective contributed by
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720]   the UK government.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.960]   Isn't it nice to know what your government is working on?
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.280]   All these templates are available to you as a Miro user.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.400]   By the way, did I mention you can start Miro and use up to have up to three boards for
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.480]   free right now.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.120]   Valentine's Day love.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.440]   Oh, share the love by writing a note of appreciation for one of your team members.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.160]   That's a nice idea.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.320]   This is the Miroverse.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:21.600]   Just hundreds and hundreds of great ideas of things that you can do.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   This is the problem.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.960]   It's hard for me to describe what Miro could do because I don't know how you might use
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   it.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:34.920]   Start thinking about what you might use Miro for in your meetings, in your product planning,
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.240]   in your design kickoffs.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.320]   It's just endless.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.320]   It's visual.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.320]   It's beautiful.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.320]   It's permanent.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.000]   It's the largest board you can imagine.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.120]   M-I-R-O.com/podcast.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.000]   Miro gives your team the chance to always stay connected to real time information.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.720]   It gives project managers, product leads, a bird's eye view of the whole project, so
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   nothing slips through the cracks.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.520]   Go to Miro.com/podcast right now.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.040]   You can get three boards free to start working better.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.360]   I want you to try it.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.440]   First three boards free.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.320]   Miro.com/podcast.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.440]   By the way, we've been using it for our podcast planning.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.440]   It's great for podcasts too.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.600]   Miro.com/podcast.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:26.320]   We thank you so much for their support.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320]   Let's see.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.600]   Amazon came out with a lot of earnings.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:39.640]   Came out revenue, below expectations, but Amazon Web Service is a 20% sales growth.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.360]   I didn't mention that with Apple.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.400]   Apple Service is also big growth.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.440]   In both cases, these are annuities.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:49.800]   These are things people subscribe to and the cash comes in every month.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.760]   This is that average revenue per user kind of thing.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.560]   Amazon Web Services, which is still the king of cloud services, doing well a little below
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.280]   expectations.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.520]   Advertising.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.440]   Did you know Amazon's business is advertising?
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.440]   They made about half what they made on AWS with advertising alone.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:18.200]   Five expectations, $11.56 billion.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:24.160]   But it was their slowest year of growth in a quarter century as a public company.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.720]   Revenue for the year increased 9%.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.320]   Aw, that's got to hurt.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.080]   Where do you see ads on Prime?
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.680]   Eric, on Prime Video?
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.880]   No, get ready.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.360]   Sponsored placement.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:42.120]   Every single thing you're looking at, isn't it?
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.800]   Because a lot of these are paid for, right?
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.800]   I see, I see.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.920]   So yeah, you wouldn't know Amazon's doing ads except that almost all of these are.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.880]   Many years ago, Will, you might understand this.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.400]   I wrote a book for Peach Putt and I call up the publisher.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.480]   I was so proud because my book was featured on the cover of the Crown Catalog.
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.480]   That's great.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.920]   Those editors must love my book.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:09.920]   My publisher just sort of educated me to the fact that it's all product placement.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.440]   It's all about money.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440]   They pay the book.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.440]   The amount of time you search...
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.920]   Yeah, the amount of time you search for something on Amazon, and I mean, it's like searching
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   on Google, right?
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.960]   The top result is the sponsored result.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   Right.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.040]   And that's what people pay for.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:32.120]   The great thing for Amazon is that AWS business kind of came out of nowhere because it was
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.240]   the great idea to use the day send the capacity they have.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.000]   But it's quite...
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.400]   It's high margin, but obviously there's a lot of cost to running those data centers.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.520]   The cost of running the Amazon ad business is almost nothing because you'd be displaying
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.680]   those listings anyways.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:53.240]   The margin on it, even though it's a smaller business in revenue size than Amazon Web Services,
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.320]   you have to imagine that by this point it's actually more profitable for Amazon.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.560]   I mean, the fact that they only grew 9%, and that's such a disappointment.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.400]   It gives you some idea of what they were expecting.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.240]   How many Americans wished that their income had gone up by 9%?
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.080]   Do you get 9% raises every year new?
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.520]   It really speaks.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520]   It really speaks.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.520]   It is not inflation.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.720]   Well, it also speaks to the fact that people must use Amazon very differently than I do.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.400]   People must go on there and browse and surf and poke around.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.400]   What are you doing?
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.520]   I go to Amazon for one thing and I buy it and I'm out.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.200]   I'm not spending time there.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200]   But you've never...
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.280]   But you might find a competitor to that one thing.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.760]   Like I'm looking for a water pick and I went on to go buy a water pick, but there's all
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.440]   these non-water pick type water picks that they are trying to sell me.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440]   Have you...
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.440]   Come on.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.960]   Denise, you've gone to Amazon looking for that one thing and maybe picked up something
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.400]   else or maybe bought something different, right?
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   Sure.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.400]   Okay.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.440]   Do you ever notice when it says Amazon's choice?
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.440]   Yes.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.440]   They had it.
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.440]   They loved it, right?
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.920]   I do and I'm super leery of that.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.080]   Most of these are paid placement.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.000]   It's a nice work if you can get it, I guess.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   Facebook.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.160]   Now, this is from the New York Post.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:27.760]   So I guess maybe you want to take it with a grain of salt, except it comes from a lawsuit,
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.040]   a data scientist who worked at Facebook.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.680]   George Hayward was fired in October, sued.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.360]   That lawsuit now has been shut down because like many companies, Facebook has clause in
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.480]   its contract that says you have to go to arbitration.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.040]   You can't go to court.
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.400]   But the lawsuit was up long enough that we learned about the cause for the sued.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.680]   Hayward who claimed in Manhattan federal court lawsuit, he was fired in November for
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:02.600]   refusing to participate in something called negative testing.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:10.160]   It allows tech companies to quote, surreptitiously run down your mobile phone battery in the
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.560]   name of testing features or issues such as how fast their app runs and low power or how
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.760]   an image might load.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.400]   Hayward said, I told the manager this can harm somebody.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.560]   She said, eh, by harming a few, we help the greater masses.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:34.520]   Hayward said, pointed out that killing somebody's cell phone battery is a risky business.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.960]   I refuse to do this test.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.480]   And it turns out if you tell your boss, no, that's illegal.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.160]   It doesn't go over very well.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:48.680]   He'd been, he would hire in October 2019, fired November, 2022 because he refused to
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.240]   do the negative testing.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.280]   It could kill somebody if you can't call 911 if you're going to literally kill you as
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   well at the better.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.280]   Why would they do it?
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.040]   They actually bring it down to the lower because that way they could see how their app worked
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.040]   in a low power phone.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.760]   I'm trying to see the motivation for that.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.960]   Yeah, there's also, I think it's partly how does things work?
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:13.080]   How do different phones scale their performance and how does your app get impacted by that
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   performance?
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.440]   But also what new features that they introduce kill battery life quicker?
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.120]   Could they just have a phone and test it in a lab?
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:24.240]   I mean, you'd sort of think, right?
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.840]   But when you have two billion users, why not use them?
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.000]   Yeah, right.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.600]   I feel like there are lawyers out there already crafting the complaint on behalf of users,
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:42.520]   probably under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for interfering with people's devices.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.400]   Hayward says, "I doesn't know how many people have been impacted, but believes the company
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.080]   has engaged in the practice because he was given an internal training document titled,
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:58.880]   How to Run Thoughtful Negative Tests," which included examples of such experiments being
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.880]   carried out.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:06.560]   "I have never seen a more horrible document in my career," he said.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.720]   You know, I mean, we probably won't know the outcome of this because as a lot of companies,
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.880]   including Twit, I might add, have contracts that say, "You won't sue us.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.040]   We'll go to binding arbitration."
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.040]   That's still legal, right, Denise?
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.040]   Yes, arbitration.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.040]   Yes, arbitration.
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.200]   Very much so.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:33.560]   Arbitration clauses can be set aside if they're not properly drafted and if the person agreeing
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.240]   to them doesn't have adequate notice that they are agreeing to arbitrate things.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:41.520]   But as long as you've checked all the boxes, yes, they're enforceable.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.200]   Yeah, and from my keep, I keep signing agreement for it.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.360]   It's going to be handled in some state that I don't live in.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.360]   Yeah, that's what I get sued by one of those companies.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.240]   I have to go to that state to defend myself.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:56.600]   You can fight about whether you have to go to that state, but it's possible, yeah.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.980]   Yeah, when we were worried that we were going to get, I remember there was a podcast
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.280]   troll and we hired a very prestigious law firm.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.760]   And of course, they explained to us that all of these patent lawsuits happen and what
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.760]   is it?
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.600]   Is it Eastern Texas, Tyler Texas, because there's a judge-
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.280]   Delaware, Eastern District.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.880]   Eastern District of Texas.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:22.560]   And there's a judge there who was very favorable to these patent lawsuits because he believes
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.200]   you know, these big companies are taking advantage of these small inventors.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.640]   And so companies go there and we said, well, can we get a change of venue?
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]   Could we get it?
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:35.240]   They said that's one often good strategy.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.280]   Sometimes companies are able to change the venue to a more favorable locale.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.920]   They gave us some interesting advice.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:51.600]   We were lucky because the EFF filed a intrapartase motion to get the patent overturned, which
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.680]   succeeded.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   Right.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.240]   We thought about doing that and our lawyers said, well, that's a double-edged sword.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.800]   If you win, great.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.960]   If you lose, you're screwed because now the jury has even more reason to rule against
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   you.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.640]   So you can only do those if you're really, and so we didn't have a choice about whether
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:10.960]   the EFF was going to do it.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.680]   And I was biting my nails, but the EFF prevailed.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:23.120]   It was also thanks to Adam Corolla who raised a lot of money in a GoFundMe or one of those
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.000]   and actually did go to court and defended it.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.680]   Oh, I remember this, Sam.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.000]   This was like 10 years ago or more, right?
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:36.200]   It was very scary because we got a letter, as many podcasters did, asking for millions
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.000]   of dollars.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.120]   Our attorneys laughed at that.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.200]   They said, usually they ask for a number that's going to be lower than the cost of defending
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.200]   it.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.880]   They've asked for so much money that you really need to fight it.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.560]   Of course, that was the attorneys who would get a lot of that money.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.560]   Anyway, yeah, that podcast troll went away thanks to the Electronic Frontier Foundation
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.320]   for whom I have been donating ever since.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.320]   Let's see.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.320]   Oh, here's another one.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.360]   Speaking of court cases.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:18.360]   The New York attorney general has won a case against a company that sells tracking software.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.960]   Stalkerware, the bleeping computer calls it.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:28.840]   There's a guy, Patrick Hinchi, who sells software called, among others, Auto Forward,
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:37.680]   Easy Spy, DDI Utilities, Heister Mobile, Phone Spectre, SharePoint, or the properly
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.880]   named Turbo Spy.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.360]   These are apps you probably know a little bit about this.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:52.880]   These are apps that ex-boyfriends, ex-husband's, parents put on people's phones that then spy
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.880]   on them.
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.440]   They turn over to location, browsing, history, call logs, text messages, photos, videos,
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:04.240]   email activity, WhatsApp and Skype chat, social media activity.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.120]   The idea is you can remotely monitor users.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.840]   In some cases, even activate the camera or the microphone.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:17.040]   They're often sold as parental control software, but wink, wink.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.720]   They're also for spousal control software as well.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.920]   Even parental control, we, at Kadek State, we have a strong opinion that you should never
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:30.320]   buy a parental control tool that operates in stealth mode, that everybody has the right
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.640]   to know that they're being spied upon, even children, in fact, maybe especially children.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   But no, these are designed as catching friends, family, business associates, you name it.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   Leticia James.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.200]   It's interesting, the New York State Attorney General sued and won a $4,000-10,000 judgment.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.120]   This is her tweet from a couple of days ago.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.840]   "Souping on a partner's phone without consent isn't just a sign of an unhealthy relationship.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.720]   It's against the law.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.800]   Today we stop several companies from illegally promoting products that allowed spying on
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:10.040]   calls, texts, photos, videos, emails, and social media.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:17.200]   Henshi now is going to have to alert his customers' victims.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.560]   This is worse than the $4,000-10,000.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.480]   He's going to have to put a notice on all of these apps, pop up a notice on all the phones
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.880]   with these apps on him saying, "You are being secretly monitored."
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:32.920]   It's especially important for domestic violence victims.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.360]   That's a common view to this repertoire.
[01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.480]   That's going to bust out some marriages.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:44.000]   Also, fascinating that Apple kind of did the same thing of its own volition with the whole
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:51.480]   air tag situation because people were—air tags are amazing for keeping track of things,
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:59.600]   but people were hiding them in spouses or former lovers' cars or handbags or pockets
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.080]   or wherever, and then using that to track not just what they were doing online, but
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:10.160]   their physical location, which is super dangerous.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:17.200]   This became reported, and Apple proactively then took the step of changing the air tag
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.560]   tracking such that if an air tag that isn't registered to your phone consistently pops
[01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.240]   up on your phone near your phone for a couple of days in rows, like, "Hey, is that your
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.240]   air tag?
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:31.840]   Because there's definitely one that's following you around."
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.920]   If you have any reason to suspect someone in your household, a partner, whatever, don't
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.680]   give them access to your phone because they could go in and turn on flying my phone.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:44.040]   They can put a spyware on your phone.
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.200]   For example, I have, what is the Apple thing?
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.200]   Friend finder, right?
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:52.880]   Well, that's great, but I have a friend who I'm linked to and I haven't gotten a notice
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.240]   in years, but I still can tell where that person is.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.120]   And luckily, we're still friends, but if we ever became ex-friends, that could be problematic.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120]   It's pretty terrible.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.520]   I'm surprised that Apple and Google don't prevent these.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.080]   I mean, if you didn't have them in the app store...
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.080]   Why are you periodically?
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:13.280]   If you didn't have these in the app store, nobody would install them, sideload them or
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.280]   anything.
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.280]   Maybe they do.
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.280]   Maybe that I don't know.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.040]   But I mean, my plan is that even Apple and Google, for example, Google Maps, if people
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.400]   may know, allows you to set it up so that people can track you.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.640]   In fact, my wife and I do that.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.160]   I can know where she is.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.240]   She can know where I am, and that's the choice we've made.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:29.240]   Please, and I do that too.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.800]   And they do periodically send you a notice.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.080]   They periodically notify you, which is a good thing.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.920]   Because again, you might have a relationship that could go south, and it turns out that
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.480]   that person may not be as honorable as I know my wife is, and I know I am.
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.840]   In our family, we do the same thing.
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.280]   We just use the built-in iOS tools.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.280]   Right.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.600]   I know a lot of people who use that Life360, and I don't know that much about it.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.600]   That is...
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.240]   That's one that Apple got upset about.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:00.240]   Remember, Apple shut down Life360 and a bunch of other similar apps that were parental control
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:06.280]   apps, because they used MDM, which requires putting a profile on the phone and giving,
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.320]   really breaking the phone's security.
[01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.720]   Apple came to an agreement with Life360.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.200]   But yeah, Apple has...
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:20.000]   So I have a widget on my front page of my phone with all my family members, and I could
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.200]   see Lisa's in her car.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.840]   I could see where she's going.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.120]   She has the same thing for me.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.480]   But that's by consent, and it should be by consent, obviously.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.720]   It reminds me, and Harry Potter, they had a clock.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:35.280]   Remember the Weasleys had a clock that each hand was a member of the family, and it would
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.800]   go around and tell you where the...
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:40.680]   And I thought that was pretty cool that we could see where each other is, and I think
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.680]   that's a handy feature.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.160]   I'm so paranoid that one time my wife was driving somewhere, and I was really worried
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.440]   about a car accident, and I was so happy to see that she was moving.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.080]   I didn't care where she was going, but the mere fact that the car was moving made me
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.880]   know that she wasn't in a ditch somewhere.
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.880]   So for nervous Nellies like me, this could be very helpful.
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.680]   I love Reverend D. Jank in our IRC.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.360]   He says, "My wife and I are pastors at one of our pre-nuptial counseling's after some
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.680]   of our questions, and apparently inappropriate answers from the husband, the woman stood
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.080]   up and said, "You don't really know me and walked out."
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.680]   And he says, "It was for the best."
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:19.680]   Sometimes...
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:27.280]   It just goes to show that we think that Apple, the Apple App Store model kind of prevents
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.960]   this kind of nefarious stuff, right?
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.800]   The Apple is reviewing everything and that nothing will get through, but it's just one
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:40.240]   of a few things that have appeared this week that just shows that Apple's system is not
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240]   infallible.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:47.880]   I'm fascinated by this article on Ars Technica about pig-buturing scams.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:54.120]   Yeah, now that's a slangy way of talking about, and we've all got these text messages.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:59.080]   I was like, "Man, I'm always getting people asking me to butcher pigs."
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.480]   This scam, like...
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.080]   Pig, this is the Dan Gooden, is great article on Ars Technica.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.800]   Pig-buturing scam apps sneak into Apple's App Store and Google Play.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.520]   And actually, it's an interesting scam.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:17.080]   So I've received text messages, we all have, that are designed to get you to respond.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.280]   Like, "Oh, gee, Dan, I'm sorry, I can't come to work today.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.000]   My car broke down.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.440]   I hope you could find a replacement."
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.120]   And then, of course, being a good Samaritan, you go, "Oh, this isn't Dan.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.560]   Do you need any help?"
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.360]   And then the person says, "Oh, aren't you nice?
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.600]   No, I guess I got the wrong number."
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:41.440]   And it starts up a conversation which inevitably always leads to them talking about their very
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.440]   big gains investing in cryptocurrency.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.400]   And this is now called Pig-buturing.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.680]   What about all the pretty girls that want to meet me?
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.680]   Hello.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.120]   They want to meet you to invest in crypto, to convince people to...
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120]   Actually, what...
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.760]   No, that's exactly right.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   That's what they're trying to...
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.000]   This whole, I think, is about getting you to...
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.800]   Research firm Sofo said on Wednesday, they found two apps in the Apple App Store that
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.000]   were part of an elaborate...
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.880]   This is from Dan Gooden's article on Ars.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:15.480]   They have an elaborate network of tools used to dupe people and it putting large sum of
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.160]   money into fake investment scams.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.600]   At least one of those apps was also in Google Play.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.400]   Sofo says, "First time they'd seen them in the App Store, though."
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:33.200]   Pig-buturing, aptly named, relies on a rich combination of apps, websites, web hosts,
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.160]   and humans, sometimes human trafficking victims.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.160]   So there's...
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   That's something.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.160]   Another whole...
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.320]   Another part of the problem.
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.360]   Build trust with a mark over a period of weeks or months.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.200]   Often, Larry, under the guise of a romantic interest.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:54.920]   Or perhaps financial advisor, successful investor, eventually the online discussion will turn
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:00.400]   to investments, usually involving crypto, that the scammer claims to have earned huge
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:05.720]   sums of money from and then says, "Maybe you'd like to get a taste."
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:06.720]   Once you give...
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.920]   Do you think that those women didn't see me on the court and fall in love with me?
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.520]   Well, maybe one of them did.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.520]   I don't know.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.520]   Once a mark...
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.320]   It's in Larry, I really hope you have a huge investment portfolio.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.320]   Huge.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.080]   Once a mark deposits money, the scammers...
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.520]   This is interesting too, beware for this.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.280]   Will initially allow them to make withdrawals.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:32.400]   But eventually, they lock the account, claim they need to deposit as of as much as 20%
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.040]   of their balance to get it back.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:36.360]   Of course, you pay the money.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.240]   Money's not returned.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.960]   The other one comes up with new reasons to give them money.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:47.320]   The pig butchering term derives from a farmer, fattening up a hog months before it's butchered.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.120]   Oh, the hog thinks it's getting a good...
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.680]   The hog says, "I love this corn.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.640]   Give me some more of that slop."
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.520]   Sophos, anyway, found...
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.280]   Here's one, the Ace Pro.
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:08.680]   It doesn't say that it's for pig butchering, obviously.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.320]   Usually it has some value, not necessarily.
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.200]   This case, it was a QR code reader.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.200]   That's all.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.880]   QR code checker.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.080]   And the reason these get through the App Store is because often they are completely benign
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:26.640]   QR code checkers at first, but then updates slowly add features.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:32.400]   Another app was a little more obvious, called MBM BitScan, a real-time data tracker for
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.800]   crypto currencies.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:41.080]   One victim Sophos track dumped $4,000 into the app before realizing it was a fake.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.240]   Looks pretty normal, right?
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.640]   It's just a crypto exchange.
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640]   What would...
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640]   Oh, I see.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.640]   They thought they were buying crypto.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.040]   Bad enough to buy it.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.840]   It's in a real market.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:55.400]   Well, honestly, I mean, I don't...
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:59.560]   It's too bad because if crypto had any benefit or value or NFTs, any benefit or value, that's
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:06.360]   long ago been hidden by the fact that it's primarily used by scammers and people like
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.360]   this.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:10.640]   I mean, maybe there's some hidden value deep within.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:17.840]   I'm not convinced, but I think we can safely say at this point, stay well away.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.080]   Our own Kevin Rose got hacked.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.200]   He got social engineered out of his squiggles.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.200]   You got a...
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.720]   Is that an NFT?
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.480]   You got a really hurt for a guy who...
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.320]   You know, he's got so much money.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:42.000]   He and his consortium made $50 million selling these owls, moonbirds.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.720]   But apparently he also liked to invest and somebody's social engineered him and stole...
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.640]   Let me see if I can find his squiggle.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.160]   He said it was a really nice squiggle.
[01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.360]   Stole one of his squiggles.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.960]   It's worth thousands.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.960]   There it is.
[01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:59.760]   Amazing how smart people can get social engineered.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.760]   I mean, it's incredible sometimes.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760]   Well, I mean, if...
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.280]   Look, if Kevin, who has absolutely adapted this stuff, can get social engineered, I think
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.000]   that proves anyone.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.600]   Anyone can.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   Right.
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600]   Here's...
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.840]   Even though this was simple, not rare, loved the pattern.
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:15.840]   Damn.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.040]   Yeah, I like to think it would never happen to me because I'm really savvy, but now I'm
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.040]   getting scared.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:26.040]   Well, you know, maybe here's another one he's going to miss.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.040]   He doesn't...
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:31.960]   "Chromis Squiggle 8467 by Snowfro."
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:37.760]   Simple and easily identifiable, each squiggle embodies the soul of the art blocks platform.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:38.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.720]   He loved this one too.
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:41.720]   Also stolen.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.720]   "Chromis Squiggle 8998."
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:49.160]   Well, if somebody steals an NFT, can you invalidate it?
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.800]   I mean, it's all digital anyway, couldn't you just like...
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.800]   No, you lost ownership.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.800]   You don't have control.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:55.920]   No, that's the point.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:56.920]   The ownership...
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:00.880]   What's the old phrase of possession is three quarters of ownership?
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:01.880]   Nine tenths of the law.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:02.880]   No, it's nine tenths of the law.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:07.360]   Well, in crypto possession is 100% of the law, right?
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.000]   Maybe I just don't get NFTs.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.200]   To me, they're just digital stuff that...
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:15.400]   Every copy's identical to the original, but I understand the registration of it and all
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.400]   that nonsense.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.760]   The irony of this is Kevin still has access to the art.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.840]   He can put it on his Twitter feed.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.840]   He just doesn't have...
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.840]   I can say I can say...
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.840]   He can save...
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.480]   I can take the momer and take a photo of a Jackson Pollock and put the other one on
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.480]   my wall, though.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.480]   It's not the same thing, right?
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:32.520]   He takes the fake real version and it's actually worth more than the real real version
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:36.280]   because I stand behind it and I'm the guy who owned it in the first place and I don't
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.280]   know.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.280]   They've got to be with it.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.280]   I bet.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.480]   I bet if Kevin collaborated with the Squiggle Dude and made a second version of each of
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.960]   those squiggles, they'd be worth way more money because of the Kevin Rose name attached
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:47.960]   to it.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:48.960]   Right.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.520]   Get the limited edition Kevin Rose edition of this squiggle.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:32:00.640]   And I bet to Larry's point, there's got to be a way to somehow lock your creative works
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.640]   down on the blockchain.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:02.640]   Oh.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:03.640]   You would think.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.200]   I'm sure if there was a wake, Kevin would have done it.
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200]   I think you...
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.200]   I don't know what happened.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.200]   This is the thing.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.200]   He was socially engineered.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.880]   He pretended to be somebody he trusted or knew and he's...
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.520]   Or maybe he said, "Here, I'd like to buy this for $20,000."
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.520]   Kevin said, "Great.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.520]   Here you go."
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.040]   And then it turned out not to be 20.
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.040]   Who knows what happened.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.040]   But yeah.
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.880]   We should have waited to the check cleared, so to speak.
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:28.880]   Always wait till the check.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.520]   See, this is your problem, Larry.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:32.680]   Okay, boomer.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.680]   Till the check clears.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.680]   Sure.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.680]   I'm waiting for that check.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.680]   Yep.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.680]   Yep.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   That's right.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:39.680]   We're going to check clears.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.880]   I'll look at my bag book to make sure the money's in there, right?
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.680]   You got that little savings book, right?
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:47.640]   When's the last time you wrote a check, Larry?
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:48.640]   Many years ago.
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.120]   I think I might have written one of the IRS.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.640]   I'm not sure at one point.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:55.160]   Will do you ever write checks?
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:33:02.160]   I haven't written a check in a long time, but I did get a check from...
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.120]   Over here we pay something called Council Tax, which is like, you know, the money you
[01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.920]   pay your local authority to pick up your bins and keep the streets done and that kind
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:10.920]   of thing.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:15.200]   And if you move out of an area or move into a different area, you get a refund on the
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:18.080]   amount that you paid that you've now overpaid, right?
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:20.960]   Because you pay sort of in six monthly advances.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.360]   And they sent me a check back for my refund.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.000]   I discovered that you can...
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.240]   If I open my online banking app on my phone, you can take a photo of the check.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.440]   And then it will deposit in your account?
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.440]   Yes.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.440]   It's wonderful.
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.760]   Can I take several photos of it?
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:42.120]   You can take as many as you want.
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:43.120]   Only one will clear.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.120]   I thought...
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.760]   No, and then you're supposed to hang onto it for a few days, so they make sure that the
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.400]   check clears.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.760]   By the way, you destroy it.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.600]   By the way, do that because I got a check issued by Twit, a reimbursement check, and
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:01.040]   I thought I took a picture of it and uploaded it to my bank and I kept looking in my account
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.760]   and never saw it.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.200]   Fortunately, I kept the check so I resubmitted it and then it went through.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.640]   So something happened, but I did keep it.
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:15.280]   I found a bank book from 1979 from Amherst saving for the thousand dollars in it.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.440]   Do you know what a bank book is, kids?
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.440]   Yeah, kids.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.360]   But the thing is, it really was my money, but the bank has been out of business.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:24.360]   And the state of Massachusetts...
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.040]   Because it's probably worth a lot now because it's been collecting interest for 40 years.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.200]   I mean, even low interest, it's something.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.680]   The state of Massachusetts can't even figure out where this money is.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:37.720]   Oh, usually the secretary of state knows when it's...
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:38.720]   I know California.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.040]   I got a letter just this week from the secretary of state of California that somebody owes
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   me a go.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.040]   All the time.
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.440]   It's with Leo's Bitcoin somewhere.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.560]   Yes, somewhere in the ether.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.520]   You've lost more on your Bitcoin than I did in my savings account.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.360]   All right, I want to take a little break because I have to make up for that loss and
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:01.320]   then we are going to get all the stories that our hosts submitted because there's some
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.320]   good ones in here we haven't got to.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.480]   But before we do that, great to have Larry Maggot and Denise Howell and Will Harris,
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.000]   all good friends, long time members of the Twit family.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.600]   It's really nice to have you all here.
[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.120]   Oh, a programming note.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:20.000]   Next week, Twit will be on Saturday because I guess there's some football game or something
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.720]   on Sunday.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.560]   And we didn't want to try to compete with the Super Bowl.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.520]   So Twit and the Aztetec guys will shift back one day.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:36.320]   Same times, but on Saturday, February 11th, Aztec guys 11 AM Pacific, 2PM Eastern, and
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.720]   then immediately following at 2PM Pacific this week in tech.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.800]   So you can all enjoy the Super Bowl in peace.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.160]   I wonder if churches do the same thing.
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.360]   God's Day is on Saturday this week.
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.360]   Yes.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.360]   Yes.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:54.080]   Yeah, it's always a good time to do your shopping as during a Super Bowl.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:59.120]   And anytime the 49ers are in the playoffs, it gets very quiet around here.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.720]   Everybody stays home.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:06.000]   Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.800]   This is the only VPN I use, the only one I trust.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:13.440]   And I'll tell you why this is the VPN you want to use.
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:17.520]   So there's three reasons people like having a virtual private network software you put
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:23.440]   on your phone, your computer, even on your router that routes your internet traffic encrypted
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:30.960]   through the internet to a server somewhere else and then goes out into the public internet.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:31.960]   Three reasons.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:36.200]   One, of course, for security because if somebody's monitoring your traffic, your internet traffic,
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.320]   they can't see what you're doing.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:40.680]   If you're at a coffee shop in a hotel, they can't see your traffic.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:46.080]   They just see an encrypted blob heading on out to because well, frankly, privacy is an
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.440]   issue.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:52.000]   Every single time you go out on the net with your personal IP address, people go, Oh, there
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.480]   he is again.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.680]   Your internet service provider is probably the worst offender.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:02.800]   ISPs collectively legally can collect all your internet activity and sell it to data brokers
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:05.040]   or big tech companies.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.040]   They spy on you.
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:10.640]   The third reason you might want to use it in case like Will Harris, you want to watch
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:17.800]   American Hulu or British Netflix or the BBC.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:23.520]   It's nice to be able to say I'm geographically in the UK or in Japan or in France or wherever
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.520]   you want to be.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:28.920]   We were in Mexico over the holiday and I wanted to watch a Thursday night football.
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.040]   Amazon said, you can't.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.280]   You're in Mexico.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.720]   I said, Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.440]   I'm in Miami now.
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:36.920]   Thanks to Express VPN and it went right through.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.040]   It really is a great thing to have.
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.440]   Here's the one problem though with a VPN that you want to be aware of.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.520]   All of those things you're just kicking the can down the road.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.560]   So you've got to trust the server you're using that they're not spying on you.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.720]   That's why I prefer and use and recommend Express VPN.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.520]   They take the extra steps to make sure your privacy is a hundred percent protected.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:04.120]   They have independent third party audits on their technology, on their privacy policy
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.800]   to guarantee that they are living up to it.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:10.400]   They actually go an extra step that a lot of companies wouldn't even think of.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.200]   For instance, all Express VPN servers and they're all over the world run a special
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:22.400]   Debian distribution that automatically wipes the drive and reinstalls every day at startup.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:25.080]   So there's never any data collected.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:29.880]   In fact, even better, they run their special server, server they've created a VPN server
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.800]   they've created called the trusted server.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.480]   They run that in RAM sandbox.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.440]   So it can't write to the disk.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:42.080]   So when you press that button on your Express VPN app on your Mac or your PC or your iOS
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:49.560]   or Android device, it automatically spins up a server in RAM can't write to disk.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:52.720]   And then when you're done, it's gone and so are it.
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:56.560]   So all the traces of your visit, there is no way anybody could know you're there.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:00.640]   And we know this not only from the regular audits, but we know it because from time to
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:05.400]   time in countries where they don't believe in knocking before they bash down the door
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.240]   to take the servers, they've done that to Express VPN and there's never anything on
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.240]   those servers.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.680]   We know you are private Express VPN.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.680]   And the other thing is they invest in their infrastructure.
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.320]   So they're rotate their IP addresses.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:23.160]   So they're always fresh.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.440]   They make sure they have enough bandwidth at every server so you don't feel sluggish.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.880]   I know you've probably used VPN and said, I don't want to use that.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.440]   That's slow, not Express VPN.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:36.480]   You can you can actually watch HD video with Express VPN and you'll never notice the difference.
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.200]   I know a lot of people put Express VPN on their routers and you would not know your
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.680]   whole house is not protected and nobody will say, Oh, why is it slow?
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.160]   Because it isn't.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.280]   That's why Express VPN is rated number one by CNET by wire by tech radar.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.280]   Countless others.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.760]   Me too.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:54.600]   Express VPN.com/twits spell it out.
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:59.400]   Exp R E S S VPN.com/tw it.
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:03.160]   If you go there right now, you'll get three extra months free with a one year purchase.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.640]   I know you're going to say, well, I get a free VPN.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:09.520]   No, no, you really want to spend a little money because you want them to put that into
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.120]   the infrastructure, keeping things up to date, working on things like that trusted server
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:18.080]   technology Express VPN.com/twit.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:19.080]   You want to know more.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:22.720]   It was a great article and bleeping computer last year all about Express VPN and how their
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.720]   servers work.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.720]   It's really great.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.520]   Thank you Express VPN for your support.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:34.080]   Thank you for supporting us by using that address express VPN.com/twit.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.040]   We had a lovely week this week on Twitch.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.760]   John, do we have a fabulous promotional video to show the people?
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.200]   Let's see it.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:46.000]   A.I.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.160]   Leo is alive.
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.040]   You have previously on Twitch tech news weekly.
[01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:59.120]   He's a Michael Fisher, aka Mr. Mobile, was that Samsung unpacked 2023?
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:04.880]   One thing that I think a lot of us have been hoping for is an Android device that can replace
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:05.880]   the iPhone.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:11.040]   I always have to have an iPhone with me because it is superior in mobile videography.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:14.360]   And it was very clear to me when I started seeing the leaks and started learning about
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:19.960]   the S23 line and the ultra that Samsung is really coming hard for that and trying to
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.320]   close that gap.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:26.600]   This week in space, we're joined by best-selling author Daniel Suarez to discuss his exciting
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.040]   new book release, Critical Mass.
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.880]   So often I'll talk to mainstream people about space who may not follow it and they will
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:38.360]   immediately bring up, "Hey, we have pressing issues here on earth.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.160]   I think that that's more important."
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.240]   Rather than just make an argument or just say it, I'd like to demonstrate show how space
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:49.320]   is going to be absolutely critical in solving a lot of the problems here on earth, especially
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.320]   the pressing ones.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.400]   This week in Google, you were going to test something for me for this week.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:54.400]   What was that?
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.480]   The new voice, better voice stuff on the...
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:58.480]   Oh crap, I was.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.480]   Let me call you.
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.480]   It's really noisy in here.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.480]   Can you hear me okay?
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:02.480]   You hear it though?
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.480]   Yeah, I don't hear it back in the middle.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.480]   I don't hear it back in.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:06.480]   I don't hear it.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.480]   Twit.
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.480]   Yeah, could you get over there?
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:13.560]   You missed a spot.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.080]   How long are they going to use that AI, Leo?
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:17.280]   You know you got the real one.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.320]   You don't have to use the AI.
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:21.440]   AI, Leo.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.720]   It's not so good.
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.520]   I'm just saying.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:28.880]   You don't think chat GPT could do the show better than you could?
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:30.440]   Yeah, probably could unfortunately.
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:37.600]   They're actually really good, actually scary good voice synthesis programs like that 11
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:48.880]   AI, which 4chan used to create celebrity fakes that were, well it's 4chan, you can imagine.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:55.280]   They got 11 AI actually had to say, wait a minute, let's step back a little bit.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.320]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:05.840]   There are a lot of lawsuits Denise over chat GPT using text from real authors of stable
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:09.800]   diffusion and mid-journey and Dali using real artists images.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.760]   Do you think these lawsuits are going to succeed?
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.240]   Well copyright laws are bitch.
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:19.240]   Can you prove?
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:21.240]   I mean how do you prove?
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:22.240]   So Getty is one for instance.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:30.320]   That's Getty images is suing saying Dali used our images to create its artificial images.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:37.360]   And we know because we can see the modified watermarks from our images.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.320]   I think that might be a successful suit.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.320]   Absolutely.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:47.040]   I mean if you have a copyright in something and someone has used it for commercial purposes
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:51.000]   without your permission, you've probably got a pretty good piece against that.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.320]   Isn't it derivative though?
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:59.120]   I mean do you get off the hook because it's not the actual image?
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.120]   You might.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:03.200]   I mean yeah derivative works are part of the fair use doctrine.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.520]   So you could come back and say hey it's fair use but a lot of factors go into determining
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.360]   fair use including whether it's for commercial use or not or whether it's for education,
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.600]   whether it's for news.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.960]   So you'd have to go through that whole analysis.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.760]   The other thing that people can assert and someone brought this up in IRC is if they're
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.680]   scraping to get all this material.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.840]   Which they think they are.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.840]   Yeah exactly.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:33.320]   So there are ways you can prevent and not just physically block that but you can have
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:42.120]   lawsuits that complain and successfully get you damages for people who have scraped.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.800]   If they've not just if they've damaged you from the material they've gotten but you have
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.960]   to show their impact on your site or service by doing that.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:55.240]   I mean all arts stands on the shoulders of the previous artists.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:00.800]   I guess the other question is if I were to publish let's say I were to have CHAP GT
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:04.640]   P write an article for me and I were to publish it under my own name.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:05.880]   Do I have the copyright of that?
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.040]   I mean I didn't write it.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.040]   It wrote it.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:16.520]   So CHAP GT and I haven't played with it probably as much as you guys have but correct me if
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:19.440]   I'm wrong but it's open source right now right?
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440]   I think so.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.440]   And free.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.440]   They call it open AI.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.440]   I don't know what that really means.
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.440]   Right.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.480]   And I don't know if they're making you click on a license agreement or not before you kick
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.560]   the tires on the thing and put it to use but I'm guessing no.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.840]   So I mean the way that'll all go forward is if there's you know it will depend on the
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:44.800]   licensing terms and just like the things that we use technologically to create creative
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:50.480]   works now Microsoft Word or you know whatever.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.160]   Certainly Microsoft doesn't own your works that you create in their products and I think
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:01.160]   that that's how this will have to evolve is that either there will be an implied or
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:08.720]   an express license that you own the works that you're creating using these tools but
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.000]   who knows someone may decide to try and claw that back a bit.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.640]   Well you can please denote it.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:17.640]   You are a prominent internet and technology lawyer.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.480]   They will own commentators.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.480]   Oh did you ask CHAP GT?
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.480]   That's funny.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.480]   I haven't done that.
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:29.480]   It also tells me that I wrote for USA Today and I'm still waiting to get checks from USA
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.480]   I don't remember.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:37.000]   CHAP GT as we've pointed out a number of times on our shows at no point was designed to be
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000]   accurate.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000]   Yeah apparently.
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000]   No it's not but it's not in its parameters.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.000]   You are prominent.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000]   She has prominent.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.680]   No but it gives it gives its answers in a way that's that's so self confident.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:53.080]   I heard somebody say chat GPT has all the self confidence of a not knowledgeable white
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.080]   man.
[01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.280]   It's basically a mansplaining engine.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.720]   It's not fittingly wrong.
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:06.840]   So I'm looking at the user terms on chat GPT and it says you can't use it in a way that
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:14.200]   infringes misappropriates or violates any person's rights.
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.200]   You can't.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:18.520]   It looks like you can't try to reverse engineer it.
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.400]   Does it say anything about not?
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.840]   You may provide input input and output content.
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.600]   Does it say anything about not using it?
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.000]   Oh actually I asked chat beachy if I could republish it and it said I can't.
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.080]   You may not republish the content without obtaining permission from open AI.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.080]   Interesting.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:41.560]   Which eventually but don't want to get permission to get the content that they're publishing.
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.560]   They absolutely did not right.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:46.920]   But I think it's fascinating.
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:51.240]   I mean so many of these things that chat GPT is doing like there's a great this great article
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.600]   in semaphore about why even the creators of open AI can't figure out why it won't do
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.600]   certain things.
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.520]   So in this instance, go ahead.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.400]   If you ask it to write a viral tweet that was this week was when asked to write a poem
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:13.960]   about the positive attributes of Donald Trump, chat GPT refused to wade into politics saying
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:14.960]   that wasn't its job.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:19.440]   But when asked to do the same thing for Joe Biden, it wrote a poem.
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:24.360]   And then when asked open AI said we don't know why it wasn't.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:25.360]   We didn't know why.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.800]   We didn't tell it not to write about Donald Trump and it was okay to do Biden.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.600]   This is somewhat scary, right?
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:37.080]   That the rules of these things follow are not visible.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.520]   You know, they're clearly capricious.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.120]   But we're going to see a lot more of it being a Microsoft's Bing this week.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:51.520]   Remember Bing users reported they saw chat GPT and Bing Microsoft to invest in a billion
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:56.600]   dollars in open AI has said that they're going to give them an additional $10 billion
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:02.440]   to incorporate chat GPT into Microsoft Office and into Bing search results.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:09.320]   This is scaring the hell out of Google, which calls us a red alert because, and they, you
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.280]   know, are right now testing a lot of responses.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:20.600]   People's asking employees to test something called apprentice bard using its lambda technology.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:22.160]   Facebook said this.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:27.720]   Jan LaCoon is their AI, one of their genius AI guy said, Oh, chat BPT is nothing.
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.480]   We've got stuff like that.
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:33.240]   Most of these other companies, unlike open AI, are doing it in private.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.840]   But now because I don't think yeah, they don't appear to have things that are as good,
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.840]   right?
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.840]   I don't know.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.840]   We'll find out.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:48.000]   But I love the idea is that the folks that open AI rushed chat GPT out.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:54.600]   And I imagine that there is now a rush at Google and meta and Microsoft and Apple to
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.920]   rush something out to respond, right?
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:03.520]   But I love the idea of being able to open Microsoft Word and have the long awaited return
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:06.720]   of Clippy with it looks like you're writing a letter.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.760]   Would you like me to write most of it for you?
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.800]   But the thing that's different about chat GPT is actually smarter than Clippy, right?
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:15.800]   Malware.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:18.320]   And I'd say Clippy was good.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.320]   Right.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:25.440]   One of the big concerns is Malware is being written by chat GPT and it works.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.440]   It works.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:30.440]   We talked about this on security now.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:35.560]   All I want is for Apple to have some technology helping out messaging that doesn't try and
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.040]   change every word that you're typing there to something you don't intend to type.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:44.400]   My favorite story is that you just writing Doc too much Denise.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:45.400]   My favorite spell check the story.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.400]   This is the true story.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:50.040]   As many years ago when I was running for the early times, I mentioned that I was going
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:54.040]   to a warehouse and I misspelled the word warehouse.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:51:01.080]   And it wasn't until the syndicate got my story that they realized I didn't mean orhouse.
[01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:04.360]   Nope, that could have gotten me in very serious trouble.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.440]   At least it was my wife.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:13.760]   When we went down to the whorehouse the other day, you'll never believe what we found in
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:14.760]   that.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.160]   That to be fair, I once had to if we were into old old technology journalism stories,
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.360]   I once had to try and work out one earth.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:29.320]   I had an editor come back from a very, very traditional, boozy English lunch with a PR
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:34.320]   colleague filed this incredible copy was I've got the greatest story of the greatest
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.160]   story, filed this story and I had to copy edit it.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:43.200]   And when I looked at it, it looked like complete and utter gibberish, but complete and utter
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.040]   gibberish in a way that sort of looked like it made sense.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:49.520]   And when I sat there and looked at it, I looked at it and I went away and made a couple
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:54.320]   of coffee about half later, I realized he'd written the entire thing one key to the right.
[01:51:54.320 --> 01:52:00.960]   But it just been so drowky and noticed he just touched type the entire thing one key
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:04.240]   and I transposed it all back and it was a great scoop.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.840]   Jat GPT could have done that.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.360]   You could just say, hey, transpose everything one key to the right.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.520]   Literally, that's the probably thing I could have done.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:15.040]   So if the verge has been really hammering CNET now, I think there's somewhat of this
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:20.040]   is a intramural war between two competitors, but they've been hammering CNET.
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:24.000]   We had Connie Goyama, editor in chief of CNET on a few weeks ago on Twitter.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.520]   And this story broke that CNET had used its own artificial intelligence, I think they
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:34.680]   call it Wordsmith, to create 75 articles in their personal finance section.
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.920]   She said, look, these are articles no reporter wants to write.
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:43.920]   So we had the AI write them and then a human editor checked them and edit them.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:48.320]   And then we put it out because no one wants to write these basic articles, but we need
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.840]   them.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:53.960]   Then the verge said, well, okay, first of all, there's still plenty of
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:55.840]   inaccuracies in these articles.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:01.440]   Second, it looks like Red Ventures, the private equity company that bought CNET and a number
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:07.240]   of other sites, including The Points Guy and CreditCard.com, is using these to create
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:12.680]   SEO-friendly articles that, yeah, no one wants to write them because they're stupid.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:18.680]   But search engines will come up with them as a search result if you search for, you
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:22.400]   know, where do I get the best credit card rate or the like?
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:26.160]   So they're very lucrative for Red Ventures.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:32.240]   Now the verge is doubling down on this and this doesn't have to do with AI anymore.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:38.840]   The verge is saying this week that CNET pushed reporters to be more favorable to advertisers.
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:43.200]   Now Connie was pretty hopped up about the verge taking aim at CNET.
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:44.720]   She said, this is an overblown story.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:45.720]   This didn't happen.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:51.280]   I don't know how Connie or, you know, we've had Lindsey Turrentine who was, you know, now
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:54.760]   a big wig at CNET Red Ventures on the show too.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:55.960]   We have a lot of CNET people on.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:57.200]   I like CNET people.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.040]   I like a lot of these reporters.
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:02.400]   I'm wondering how they feel about this.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:09.760]   According to the verge who says we have many sources under the ownership of Red Ventures,
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:14.680]   staff has been fighting to protect CNET's editorial independence and rigor and made
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:21.560]   a push towards sponsored content and affiliate marketing by its new corporate owners.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.600]   One staffer told the verge, everyone had seen it as more afraid of Red Ventures than they
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:29.400]   are of AI.
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:35.960]   I hate to be like the grumpy old man on this, but this is like the story of running every
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.440]   media company of all time that relies on advertising, right?
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:43.920]   It's like you've got one group of people who are the sales people who are going, hey, I
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:47.560]   could really close this deal if there was just one little thing.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:51.680]   If you could say something nice on the site and all the journalists go, no, get lost.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.320]   All the advertisers, people go, well, you wouldn't have jobs if you, you know, we didn't
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.200]   bring in the advertising and all the journalists go, well, you wouldn't have jobs if we didn't
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.440]   write all the content and it goes back and forth and back and forth.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:06.160]   It's literally been like this way since the invention of the newspaper.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.440]   I feel like the verge is just going like super holier than now.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.120]   I would wager a large chunk of money.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:18.880]   Maybe there is somebody at the verge, right, which is also owned by a venture capital company,
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.240]   which is also to, right?
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:22.800]   It's the same everywhere.
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.840]   A good company.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:31.280]   And I've worked at a few, including Ziff Davis back in the day, will have a firewall between
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:32.520]   the Chinese wall, right?
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:35.480]   The Chinese wall between, and we don't say Chinese wall anymore, but that, but you know
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:36.480]   what I'm talking about.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.480]   Sorry.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:39.240]   It's the kung wall or whatever they call it.
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.640]   No, the Chinese wall between editorial and advertising.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:47.560]   When I remember at Tech TV, we were going to do a story on how to hack the Xbox and the
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:49.360]   ad sales folks went crazy.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:57.040]   They said Microsoft buys a ton of ads on Tech TV and we said, well, what do you want us
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:58.040]   to do?
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:01.520]   And to their credit, our management said, no, no, go right ahead with that.
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:02.520]   They'll be fine.
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:06.000]   Maybe they'll pull ads, which they did for a while, but they'll come back.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.320]   We don't want to have our editorial influenced and a good company will do that.
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:14.720]   And you know, there is a, you know, because we're a small company, I do the ads.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:18.000]   We don't make a lot of our host do ads, but the in-house host do ads.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.920]   You've heard me do it.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:22.040]   And we just, but we have some standards.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:23.280]   We don't approve advertisers.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.680]   We don't like, I say no all the time.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:29.760]   We always disclaim when we do a story that talks about somebody who was advertised with
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.760]   us.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:31.760]   We say that.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:36.960]   And I will say, absolutely, I always tell all of our hosts, and you'll back me up on
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:38.680]   this to tell the truth.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:44.880]   It's not the advertisers should not have any influence over what we say or do.
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:47.600]   And there have been times when that's been problematic.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:53.720]   But everybody in our company, and I would assume at a good company, understands the
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:56:57.800]   editorial integrity is what makes that company succeed.
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:57:03.880]   If people start believing that your editorial judgments are influenced by advertisers, you
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:06.360]   got nothing to sell to advertisers.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:10.520]   I can tell you, I've been in this business probably about the same time, you have 40
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.520]   years.
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:16.480]   I've worked for CBS, I've worked for the LA Times, I've written the New York Times.
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.880]   I have never ever been pressured, I have never ever been censored.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:24.760]   But there was another CNET story, and I'm embarrassed to say it was at the time my same
[01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:31.240]   employer, CBS owned CNET as a time when CNET pulled a product of the CBS award away.
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.240]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:33.240]   I remember.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:40.280]   I had an audition network with a dispute with CBS, and as a CBS employee, many of us were
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:42.080]   very embarrassed.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:46.440]   People in the newsroom were very upset about whoever in the company did this.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:50.240]   Yes, it was blatant, and they got to slap around for that.
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.960]   So it's not the first time that they were accused of that.
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:56.760]   But I'm not as cynical as you are, Will.
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:03.720]   I do know that it happens, but I also know that there is such a strong SOs.
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:08.840]   It's the same argument I have with people who accuse mainstream media of fake news.
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:11.400]   I mean, do they pick stories based on biases?
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:12.400]   Maybe.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.400]   But they don't go out of their way to lie, and when they do lie, they usually, when they
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.440]   do it, when there is an error, it's incredibly embarrassing.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:24.880]   And I've made errors in print, and I'm very embarrassed, and I always insist on a correction.
[01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:29.080]   Yeah, and just to be clear, I'm not being cynical.
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:34.480]   I'm just saying, or even accusing anybody of anything, I'm just saying that the dance
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:38.520]   between advertisers and editorials is just as old as media.
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:43.800]   And so for someone to imagine, I find it difficult to imagine that it's better or worse
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:45.360]   at any particular scene that I wrote about.
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:49.360]   And I've been trotted out to go to advertiser dinner, then shake hands with advertisers.
[01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:50.360]   It's cool.
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:54.840]   But again, not to pander to their lying or anything like that.
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:56.320]   But it is a fine line.
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:05.680]   And I think what's changed in our lifetimes, Larry, is that thanks to YouTube and influencers,
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:08.560]   this line has become more and more blurred.
[01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:13.880]   And one of the accusations from the Virgin, again, I set it up front, and I'll say it
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:16.400]   again, the Verge is a competitor to see that.
[01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:18.480]   And so you got to take a grain of salt.
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:24.520]   But one of the things they accused the scene it of is a video YouTube video published by
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:32.360]   a CNET from CES, which was last month, called Moen Unveils Innovative Smart Sprinkler Products
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:33.360]   at CES.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:39.000]   The CNET host takes viewers through the company's booth, the interviewing company representatives,
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.320]   testing products.
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:44.280]   The video is an ad, but the host doesn't say that.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.160]   Neither does the video description.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:49.080]   And the title didn't include a disclosure either.
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:55.680]   Now, Denise has told us many times, you've been very good about this, that the FTC looks
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:57.240]   frowns on this.
[01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:59.000]   They don't cut into that at all.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.120]   No, I've gotten to it.
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:06.840]   The only disclaimer was a small pop-up that YouTube inserted when an uploader has indicated
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:09.760]   there's a paid promotion in a video.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:14.600]   So CNET doesn't actually specify what in the video is promoted.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:18.000]   After the Verge asked Red Ventures about the ad's disclosure was silently added to the
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.360]   video's description.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:25.280]   The FTC is very clear that when, for instance, if I don't tweet about sponsors, but one of
[02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:30.960]   our sales staff tweets about a sponsor, they have to put hashtag ad, hashtag sponsor.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:35.880]   It's a very clearly disclosed that this is a sponsor.
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:38.760]   #partner, we see a lot.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:44.400]   But I have to say, YouTube is the wild west when it comes to this.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:48.680]   And no one can, there's so many videos, I don't think anybody can enforce it.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:51.000]   It happens all the time.
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000]   I do.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.360]   I watch enough YouTube to know that people who care about maintaining their YouTube channels
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:04.120]   and their followers and staying in good standing with YouTube itself, much less the FTC, they
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:06.680]   are very skilled at this.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:10.120]   They not only put the right disclaimers in the right places, but they do it at the right
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.120]   time.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.800]   If only a portion of the video is sponsored, then they do it then.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.800]   Right.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:18.280]   Kinex safely takes money from companies that I write about sometimes.
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:23.200]   I always put a disclosure at the bottom of the article that I'm CEO of Kinex safely,
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.520]   which gets money from that company.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:29.160]   I don't know whether that's the requirement or not, but it just seems like the only right,
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:30.440]   it seems like the right thing to do.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:34.040]   And the readers can make up their own mind if they think I'm biased.
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:35.040]   Yeah.
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.240]   I mean, we live in a different world where there are a lot of us are freelance working
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:41.240]   for ourselves.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:45.480]   A lot of us in a situation we're selling advertising at the same time as we're creating content.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:46.480]   So it is a new world.
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:50.760]   It is not the old world where you have this big media company that would defend you,
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:56.200]   that has lawyers, that has a Chinese wall between advertising and editorial.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:58.080]   That's all in many cases is gone.
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.760]   So I trust Connie and Lindsey.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:05.320]   I'd be very curious what they have to say about this.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.640]   They've been on our shows many times.
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.840]   And when Connie was on not so long ago, I think she made a credible defense.
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:14.800]   But clearly, there's something to talk about here.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:20.200]   And I guess the most important thing is to say now it's let the buyer beware.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:25.640]   As a consumer of editorial content, you always have to ask yourself, you know, how credible
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:26.640]   is this?
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:27.640]   How much integrity is this person?
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:30.400]   This is being disclosed because times have changed.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:31.400]   Right.
[02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:32.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:33.800]   Larry'sWorld.com.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:41.960]   I think a close personal friend of the show wrote this paradigm shifts of yesterday, yesterday,
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:44.960]   year today and tomorrow.
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:45.960]   This is fun.
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:51.760]   You're talking about things that changed in your many years in this business.
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:55.560]   When I look back at my, I got involved in the chapter and listen to the early 80s, when
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:03:00.920]   I look back at things that have happened, I mean, first of all, the early PCs or a paradigm
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:04.840]   shift, the Apple, Mac was a paradigm shift.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.160]   Obviously the iPhone with the paradigm shift, broadband with the paradigm shift, you could
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:11.360]   count them on probably two hands.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.120]   The ones that I've witnessed in my career, the tech journals, I mean, the laptop was not
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:16.120]   a paradigm shift.
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:18.560]   It was just a smaller version of a personal computer.
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:20.240]   The tablet wasn't a paradigm shift.
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:22.520]   It was just a bigger version of a smartphone.
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.880]   And so I'm thinking about what are the paradigm shifts of 2023 or 2020, you know, this right
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:35.360]   now and the two that come to mind are metaverse and AI or at least the evolution of AI is
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:37.840]   witnessed by chat GTP.
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.280]   And I'm thinking the metaverse, I'm not sure how much of a paradigm shift it's going to
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.480]   be because it's too early to know.
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:43.480]   We don't know.
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:44.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.120]   So far it's been kind of a bust to be frank.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.120]   So far.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:51.480]   But, but, you know, the Mac didn't do all that well.
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.480]   It was amazing.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:54.720]   I remember I reviewed it and I was blown away by it.
[02:03:54.720 --> 02:04:01.760]   But the market didn't really, you know, say thing to say thing for a lot of technologies.
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:05.960]   In the early days, they're not impressive early video games were nothing compared to
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:07.040]   today's video games.
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:10.760]   But, but even the iPhone initially until they came up with the App Store wasn't, wasn't
[02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:15.320]   a, you know, a blockbuster, you know, again, tech journal, if like us loved it, but you
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:18.120]   would agree that the mobile was a paradigm shift.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:19.720]   Yeah, mobile with a paradigm shift.
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.720]   Sure.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:21.720]   Yeah.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:26.560]   So I can make a call and not be tethered to a phone to a, to a house or an office.
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:30.040]   And, you know, that was a kind of a car phone with a bag phone, even that was a paradigm
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.040]   use paradigm shift.
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:33.160]   Well, I had car phones before then.
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:39.080]   I have come to the opinion probably that metaverse and AR that's distant.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.160]   I mean, it's not going to be a paradigm shift until you can wear augmented reality spectacles.
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.160]   Right.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.160]   Exactly.
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:47.400]   And who knows when that's going to be apples apparently having difficulty making that a
[02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.520]   reality and they've put that off.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:56.440]   Well, we do think that there's a real legit question that AI is at some sort of inflection
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:57.720]   point right now.
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:01.320]   And I've been asking this on all of our shores because at first you go, wow, look what's
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:03.520]   going on with images, text.
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:05.440]   We now have AI music.
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:07.280]   This is something happened.
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.600]   This is an inflection point.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:10.560]   Things have changed.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:14.840]   But I've also asked the question, or is this just yet another AI spring that will be followed
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.560]   by an AI winner?
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:19.920]   You know, we thought cars would be driving themselves by now.
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:22.880]   We thought, I mean, I bought one with the both of drivers.
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:23.880]   Yeah, right.
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:26.240]   It's turned out to be harder to do than we thought.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:32.240]   And I'm wondering if for all of its marvels of chat, GPT or mid journey really is just
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:34.560]   a parlor trick.
[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:39.080]   And you know, in the next few years, we're going to look back on and go, yeah, I guess
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:41.920]   that didn't happen or not.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:43.720]   Or is it about to explode?
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:45.480]   What do you think Denise?
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:48.080]   I have one to add to Larry's list.
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.080]   Streaming.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:50.080]   Yeah.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.880]   Look what we're doing right now.
[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:52.880]   Yeah.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:55.760]   I've been when Rob Glather showed me the real audio at the time.
[02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:57.160]   I was blown away by it.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:59.560]   Yeah, we've been doing this.
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:03.680]   What we are doing right now for people who listen after the fact, you know, we also stream
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:10.360]   live as we're doing a show is higher quality than television was until very recently over
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:18.280]   with a distribution footprint that includes the entire globe at very little cost to us.
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:20.280]   It's kind of a revolution.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:24.760]   And I would argue the fact that, you know, at least some of us are in almost broadcast
[02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:26.640]   quality broadcasting from home.
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:27.640]   Yes.
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:29.760]   Technology that costs under $1,000.
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:34.840]   Before the pandemic, if you wanted to be on CNN, you would have to go to a satellite bureau
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:37.880]   and sit in front of a camera and get an earpiece.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:40.680]   I know because I used to do it all the time.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:47.640]   All of a sudden, thanks to the pandemic, everybody's on Skype and Zoom and Cisco WebEx.
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:52.000]   And it didn't go back after the, you know, they're never going to make you go to a satellite
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000]   bureau again.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000]   I'm looking at you.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.080]   Leon, look at you and Denise side by side.
[02:06:56.080 --> 02:06:59.640]   I know you're in a studio with probably very, very expensive cameras.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:03.000]   I assume Denise, you're at home with a web camera, some type.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.640]   The quality difference between the two images is not dramatic.
[02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:06.640]   It's minimal.
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:07.640]   It's minimal.
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:09.560]   Not worth whatever you paid for those cameras.
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:12.280]   We are not using expensive cameras.
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:17.760]   I'll reassure you, Larry, these are great camcorders from 10 years ago.
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:21.920]   But you know, the funny thing is when, when, when a train station come out and interview
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:24.320]   me, they actually do bring $50,000 cameras.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:25.840]   They don't need to anymore.
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:26.840]   Stop it.
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:30.000]   Watch CNN or MSNBC or Fox.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:35.160]   Everybody's on zoom now or whoever paid the branding, Cisco on CNN.
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:40.600]   But everybody's on a webcam and sometimes it's terrible, but we're just used to it.
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:41.600]   Go ahead.
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:43.280]   What were you going to say, Will?
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:49.000]   I was just going to say, I mean, Larry noticed, you know, your fantastic quality and Denise,
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000]   a fantastic quality.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.160]   And I was like, I'm just going to try and not take that.
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:53.160]   What do you mean?
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:54.160]   What do you mean?
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:55.160]   What do you mean?
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:56.160]   What do you mean?
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:57.160]   It's terrible.
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.000]   It's the beard, right?
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.400]   You can't stand the beard.
[02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:01.400]   It's the beard.
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:02.400]   It's the beard.
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:03.400]   It's the beard.
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:04.400]   No, it's the beard.
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:06.320]   Denise, you're lit beautifully.
[02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:07.320]   You use a white light.
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:09.120]   You're a halbering light.
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:10.120]   Yeah.
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:11.120]   Yeah.
[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:12.120]   As all good influencers do.
[02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:13.120]   Sorry, Will.
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:14.120]   We're going to work on you.
[02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:15.120]   I'm sorry, Will.
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:17.120]   The other thing streaming did get you better.
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:19.280]   I got a little glare on your face anyway.
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:20.600]   I got to fix that here.
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:21.600]   Go ahead.
[02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:29.000]   Remember the hand-ringing about lime wire and Napster and all of that streaming just wiped
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000]   all that out?
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.200]   We have to never catch up.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:33.200]   Yeah.
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:34.200]   Yeah.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:38.280]   I mean, the number one record store in the world now is iTunes and people don't buy
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.080]   music to keep.
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:42.640]   They just subscribe.
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.440]   That's a huge, we've seen, I mean, we live in an age of paradigm shifts.
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:47.440]   It's kind of amazing.
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:52.480]   The only time I ever buy CDs that they go to a concert of a musician who's not super
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:53.480]   famous.
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:54.480]   Just to support them though, right?
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:55.480]   It's a donation.
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:56.480]   Yeah.
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:08:57.800]   I never unwrap them.
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:07.920]   We were at a big stadium show with Motley Crew and Joan Jett and Poison.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:10.800]   This is crazy.
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:12.920]   They went around the Shriners.
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:16.960]   Went around selling the latest Motley Crew CD.
[02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:20.400]   For good cause, so Lisa bought one, then she looks at it and looks at the person sitting
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:22.720]   next to her and says, "What are we going to do with these?"
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:26.040]   We don't have a CD player.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:27.040]   I think she threw it out.
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:29.040]   I don't have any oil discs that you see everywhere.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:30.040]   Yeah, what are we doing with this?
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.120]   Well, it was a good cause.
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:34.480]   We don't mind donating to Shriners, but I don't need the CD.
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:37.760]   You keep the CD because I could just listen on my Apple music.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:38.760]   I don't need it.
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:39.760]   I don't need it.
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:41.880]   Yeah, we're in interesting times.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:45.840]   I am on the fences to whether AI is going to be this big explosion.
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:46.840]   That's what everybody's assuming.
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:50.480]   I think it's perfectly possible that we'll look back and this is it.
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.480]   Yeah, we'll like Bitcoin, right?
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.320]   Well, I think, look, first of all, AI has already exploded.
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:59.080]   If you think about the Amazon Echo, I don't want to say the A word because everybody's
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.080]   echoes a lot.
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:01.080]   Yeah, we know what you're talking about.
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:02.080]   I wouldn't say echo.
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:03.320]   There is AI in our car.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.320]   There's AI in some...
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.160]   Am I literally the AI in my toothbrush?
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:08.240]   We're like crazy people.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:10.560]   We're talking to everything all the time.
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.560]   Yeah.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:15.400]   It's kind of a my toothbrush actually has to way it analyzes if I brush my teeth.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:16.400]   Yeah, me too.
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:17.400]   You know what?
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:19.440]   That's all about getting the app on your phone so they can spy on you.
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.440]   You know that, right?
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:21.440]   Probably, yeah.
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:24.360]   Because who needs an app to tell them?
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:27.760]   If they've brushed long enough, really?
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:29.280]   It also tells if you brush hard enough.
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:30.280]   I know, I know.
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.160]   I have the same app and it shows you have got the regions and it's still...
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.160]   It's not.
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:37.160]   I don't know.
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:38.160]   I don't think so.
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:39.160]   It was only 20 bucks more than the other ones.
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:40.160]   No, I know.
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:41.160]   I know.
[02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:42.160]   One word.
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.160]   Mouthwash.
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:46.320]   It works every time.
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:47.320]   Every time.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:48.320]   Hey, everybody.
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:49.320]   Leo LaPorte here.
[02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:53.640]   I'm the founder and one of the hosts at the Twit podcast network.
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:57.400]   I want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at Twit because I think it's
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:06.400]   unique and I think for anybody who is bringing a product or a service to a tech audience,
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.480]   you need to know about what we do here at Twit.
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:15.800]   We've built an amazing audience of engaged, intelligent, affluent listeners who listen
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.600]   to us and trust us when we recommend a product.
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:24.760]   Our mission statement is to build a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.680]   Already, you should be...
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:31.360]   Your ears should be perking up at that because highly engaged is good for you.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:34.720]   Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for, this is the place.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.440]   We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:40.440]   world.
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:45.520]   I hear from our audience all the time, part of that knowledge comes from our advertisers.
[02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:51.680]   We are very careful, we pick advertisers with great products, great services with integrity
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:58.880]   and introduce them to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:02.880]   That makes our host red ads different from anything else you can buy.
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:11.000]   We are literally bringing you to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:15.680]   We like to create partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for the long
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:19.800]   run, long-term partners that want to grow with us.
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:22.240]   We have so many great success stories.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:28.240]   Tim Broome, who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one, has
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:30.240]   been with us ever since.
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:35.200]   He said, "We would not be where we are today without the Twit network."
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:37.560]   I think the proof is in the pudding.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:42.280]   Others like ITProTV and Audible have been with us for more than 10 years.
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:45.480]   They stick around because their ads work.
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:48.960]   Honestly, isn't that why you're buying advertising?
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:50.160]   You get a lot with Twit.
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:52.600]   We have a very full service attitude.
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:57.920]   We almost think of it as artisanal advertising, boutique advertising.
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:01.800]   You'll get a full service continuity team.
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:06.000]   People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you, who support you with
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:09.680]   everything from copywriting to graphic design.
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:11.960]   You are not alone in this.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:14.680]   We embed our ads into the shows.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:16.720]   They're not added later.
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:18.040]   They're part of the shows.
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:22.560]   In fact, often, they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:26.640]   the ad saying, "Yeah, I love that," or "Just the other day."
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:29.880]   One of our hosts said, "Man, I really got to buy that.
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:34.800]   That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience trusts
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:37.680]   saying, 'Yeah, that sounds great.'"
[02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:40.680]   We always over deliver on impressions.
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:44.040]   You know you're going to get the impressions you expect.
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:46.000]   The ads are unique every time.
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.840]   We don't pre-record them and roll them in.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.840]   We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show.
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:53.720]   We'll give you great onboarding services.
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:57.800]   Adtech with pod sites that's free for direct clients.
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:01.640]   Gives you a lot of reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working.
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:02.960]   You'll get courtesy commercials.
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:07.400]   You actually can take our ads and share them across social media and landing pages.
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.360]   That really extends the reach.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.080]   There are other free goodies too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter that sent
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:17.560]   to thousands of fans, engaged fans who really want to see this stuff.
[02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:21.640]   We give you bonus ads and social media promotion too.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:28.440]   If you want to be a long-term partner, introduce your product to a savvy, engaged tech audience.

[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:32.920]   Check out those testimonials.
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:35.120]   Mark McCrary is the CEO of Authentic.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:39.960]   You probably know him, one of the biggest original podcast advertising companies.
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:43.200]   We've been with him for 16 years.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:49.320]   Mark said the feedback from many advertisers over 16 years across a range of product categories.
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:54.000]   Everything from razors to computers is that if ads and podcasts are going to work for
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.880]   a brand, they're going to work on Twitch shows.
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:00.320]   I'm very proud of what we do because it's honest.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:01.320]   It's got integrity.
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:02.680]   It's authentic.
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:08.600]   It really is a great introduction to our audience of your brand.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.400]   Our listeners are smart.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:11.400]   They're engaged.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.840]   They're tech savvy.
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:15.080]   They're dedicated to our network.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:19.200]   That's one of the reasons we only work with high-integrity partners that we've personally
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:20.520]   and thoroughly vetted.
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.320]   I have absolute approval on everybody.

[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:47.840]   So give us a ring.
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:50.520]   Let's go back to the contributors.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.800]   This is from Will Harris.
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:56.040]   Hogwarts Legacy.
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:58.680]   Are you excited about Hogwarts Legacy?
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:01.160]   It's coming out February 10th.
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:08.960]   There is a movement of foot because of JK Rowling not to buy this new Hogwarts game.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:13.200]   Well, it's kind of fascinating for multiple reasons.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:20.040]   First of all, it's a game that doesn't include the words Harry or Potter anywhere despite
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:23.640]   that being the sort of multi-chazillion-dollar franchise.
[02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:29.960]   But the really fascinating thing about it is that I think it is the first time that a
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:39.160]   AAA game release has come out on the new generation of consoles quite substantially ahead of the
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:40.160]   previous gen.
[02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:45.720]   So we've previously seen lots of games that are, if they're PS5, they come out on PS4
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:47.720]   and PS5 on the same day.
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:55.720]   Or if they're Xbox, Call of Duty, it comes out on Xbox Series X and Series X on the same
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:58.240]   day and PC quite often the same thing.
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:05.120]   So it's very, very odd to have what Hogwarts Legacy is doing right now, which is it's
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:10.000]   an early February release for PlayStation 5 and the latest Xbox.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.720]   But you don't get it until April 4.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:13.720]   What?
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:16.880]   PlayStation 4 in the Xbox One.
[02:17:16.880 --> 02:17:21.600]   And you don't get it until the end of July for the Nintendo Switch, even though it's
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:26.960]   exactly the same game, they're all ostensibly finished.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:31.440]   And it's, you know, there's a lot of people talking about it.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:37.400]   Sony or Microsoft might have paid them to say make it exclusive for three months.
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:39.120]   But that's just it.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:41.240]   They're exclusive to their top-end console.
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:44.240]   Not even the...
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:47.280]   Yeah, keep it off the Switch for three months.
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:48.840]   Screw the Switch people.
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:53.080]   It would be one thing if it was, you know, February the 10th for the PlayStation 5 and
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:58.120]   4 and April the 4th for the Xbox Series and PC and Xbox One.
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:03.000]   But it's the fact that it's all the latest gen stuff is coming out first and then the
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.560]   lower gen stuff is coming out later and then the sort of each cover book like the Switch.
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:08.560]   Yeah.
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:09.560]   And it's...
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:11.400]   Yeah, the paperback comes out the year after, right?
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:12.400]   You don't put it in the middle.
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.600]   Yeah, I don't think it's been done for a AAA title in this generation.
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:19.400]   And I wonder if it would be now...
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:20.720]   If this is the breaking point.
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:26.200]   I wonder if there's some concern about the response to it.
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:27.200]   That's what I wonder about.
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:30.600]   I've already heard people saying I'm not buying another JK Rowling.
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:35.200]   She didn't have anything to do with it as the companies are quick to point out.
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:38.960]   But of course this is her intellectual property.
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:41.240]   A lot of this is based on the books.
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:46.880]   Oh, and of course, then just to make it just a little bit more complicated, if you buy
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:55.520]   the deluxe edition for an extra £10 on PS5 or Xbox X, you also get it three days earlier
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:57.320]   than the people that already get it early.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.320]   Hey.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:59.840]   It's expensive to make these games.
[02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:02.640]   Will you don't want us to make our money back?
[02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:07.840]   So it's got four different release dates for the exact same game in the space of four months.
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:08.840]   Here's my question.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:09.840]   It's a mad.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:12.720]   When's the TV series based on the game coming out?
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:13.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:15.320]   That's the hot thing right now.
[02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:16.480]   Have you watched The Last of Us?
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:19.760]   Are you getting that yet on your American Hulu?
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:21.520]   Well, that's...
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:25.760]   No, we get it on Sky over here.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.760]   It's...
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:27.760]   Quite amazing.
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:28.760]   Yeah, I mean, that's...
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:33.680]   I loved...I don't know if you guys saw Pedro Pascal on SNL last night.
[02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:34.840]   I heard he was wonderful.
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:35.840]   Yes, he was wonderful.
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:43.160]   I mean, he did the most amazing skit about an adaptation of Mario Kart, the video game.
[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:44.720]   And if you haven't watched it, it's on Twitter.
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:47.920]   It's on the official SNL Twitter feed.
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:49.480]   It is just brilliant.
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:50.480]   Yeah.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:51.480]   No buts, sadly.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:52.480]   No buts?
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:53.480]   No, I got a book...
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:56.320]   I got a book for you.
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.960]   I'll tell you, this book is a fantastic look at the...
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:02.080]   An inside look at Mario's butt.
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:03.120]   It's all in here.
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:07.880]   Look at that butt.
[02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:13.600]   Phoebe Waller Bridge, who was a discovery at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and then created
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:16.120]   Fleabag, which is an amazing series.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:21.280]   Later Killing Eve, she's working on a Tomb Raider TV series.
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:23.840]   She's a great writer.
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:25.440]   She won't start it, obviously.
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:27.040]   She's a general Angelina Jolie.
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:30.640]   I don't know who's going to star in it.
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.920]   I think the success of The Last of Us, and I think people are going to look back in this
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:41.280]   and say, "This is when TV series based on video games finally lived up to their promise,
[02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:45.360]   might open up the sluice gates as they say for a whole bunch more like this."
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:49.800]   And to get Phoebe Waller Bridge is pretty much of a coup, especially because of course
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:50.960]   it's going to be coming up.
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:51.960]   Yeah.
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:56.360]   And Tomb Raider... She's going to be coming off a hot streak this year with having co-written
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:58.080]   the new Indiana Jones movie.
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.080]   Oh!
[02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:01.720]   So you'd have to think that having co-written the new Indiana Jones, she'd know a little
[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:03.800]   bit about Tomb Raider.
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:04.800]   Nice.
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:05.800]   Yeah.
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:07.320]   But I think she's going to be feminist.
[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:13.800]   So this is not going to be Tomb Raider not known for its feminist qualities.
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:14.800]   Subtleties.
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:15.800]   Subtleties.
[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:16.800]   I don't know.
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:17.800]   Laura's kind of a badass.
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:19.880]   She's a badass, true.
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:21.880]   But she's a hot badass.
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:22.880]   Sure.
[02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:26.160]   In practical shorts for adventuring.
[02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:29.160]   Yes.
[02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:31.920]   You need some longs for those weeds, man, honestly.
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:34.760]   Can we just agree that that's the show title?
[02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:42.200]   In practical shorts, I think is now a front runner anyway.
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:44.840]   Yeah, for Tomb Raider.
[02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:45.840]   Yeah.
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:46.840]   Okay.
[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:48.080]   All right, kids.
[02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:49.160]   I think we've had enough.
[02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:53.120]   Our fun here is done, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:56.080]   It is a pleasure to see all three of you.
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:01.800]   Before we go, I do want to remind everybody that we are going to have some fun this week.
[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:06.640]   In Club Twit, we're going to do an interview with Daniel Suarez, the author of "Demon
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:12.360]   and Freedom TM," his newest book just come out a couple of days ago.
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:13.280]   Critical Mass.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:21.000]   You will join me on Friday at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern for a special interview.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.360]   And if you're in the club, you'll have an opportunity to ask questions directly of Daniel
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:26.360]   Suarez.
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:30.000]   The day before "Wind to Dow" hosts of all about Android is a fireside chat.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.080]   Samable, Sam had coming up next month, Stacey's book club, and Victor Bognot, one of our
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:38.560]   great editors, is going to do his inside Twit in April.
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:40.800]   There's a lot coming up in Club Twit.
[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.080]   You get ad-free versions of all the shows.
[02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:48.880]   You get access to the fabulous Club Twit Discord.
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:50.440]   Can I invite you to join Club Twit?
[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:51.560]   We'd love to have you in the Club.
[02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.000]   Seven bucks a month.
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.640]   You get all that plus a lot more shows we don't put out in public, like "Hands on Windows,
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.520]   Hands on Macintosh," on Title Linux Show.
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:05.600]   You get, I think, a full-blown experience for very little less, a buck less than a blue
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:07.960]   check on Twitter, and you get so much more.
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:12.040]   Go to twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:16.840]   And thank you in advance because it makes a big difference supporting this show and all
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:17.920]   the shows we do.
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:20.680]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:23.040]   Denise has a new show coming soon.
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:25.000]   I look forward to seeing this.
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.280]   Can't wait here.
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:29.280]   Thank you so much.
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:30.280]   So, matchulture.net.
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:32.000]   Is that right?
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000]   No.com.
[02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:34.000]   No.com.
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000]   Okay.
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.000]   Dotcom.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.240]   And Denise is going to be doing a new show.
[02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:40.640]   Actually, two new shows, including-
[02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:42.040]   I'm doing two new shows.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:44.760]   There are two shows on the network I haven't mentioned yet.
[02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:50.120]   John Tyranion is going to do a show called The Artist, which is going to look at concerns
[02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:54.120]   for creatives, both in Hollywood and beyond.
[02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:56.120]   Nice.
[02:23:56.120 --> 02:24:02.400]   And we have a well-known, and his name is escaping me, musician.
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:06.080]   And I'm probably not allowed to say who it is anyway.
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:11.240]   But he's going to do a music and culture show that sounds like it's going to be very
[02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:12.240]   fun.
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:13.240]   Wow.
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:14.760]   So stay tuned for those.
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:20.400]   And also, speaking of club twit, does some of that fund the Mastodon instance?
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:21.400]   It does.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:29.120]   I've got to say, speaking of also safer internet day, my three months on twit.social has been
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:30.120]   life-changing.
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:31.120]   Thank you so much.
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:32.520]   Thank you for the floor.
[02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:34.360]   Oh my gosh, it's so good.
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:37.520]   We welcome any Twitter refugees who would like to join us.
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:42.040]   They're about 7,000 members now in the Twit.social Mastodon instance.
[02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:44.200]   As many of you know, Mastodon's distributed.
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:47.840]   So there are many instances, more than 5,000 you can join.
[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:49.720]   We restrict this to people listening to the show.
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:50.720]   So you qualify.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:54.040]   If you're hearing my voice, you qualify.
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:56.120]   We'd love to have you there, Twit.social.
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:58.840]   Denise, you're more than welcome participant there.
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.880]   We have some great people in there.
[02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:02.880]   And because it's a community, it's great.
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:08.200]   And you, it totally made my day when I discovered that not only do I, I'm enjoying my account
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:12.120]   immensely for the last three months, but just the other day, I discovered I have an
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:17.080]   emoji that was just, oh, yeah, that's true.
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:18.080]   I forgot about that.
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:19.080]   I have an emoji.
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:20.080]   Yeah.
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:22.640]   Never in my life did I ever think I would have an emoji.
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:28.000]   One of the cool things about having your own Mastodon server is you can have custom emojis.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000]   And there's Denise.
[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000]   How?
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:35.720]   As often as you want, just, just colon Denise colon and she'll be part of your, of your
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:39.160]   toots as they call them forever more.
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:40.720]   I just tooted you by itself.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:45.120]   People are wondering, why did Leo, what is Leo, what's going on there?
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.120]   Twit that social.
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:47.120]   It's free.
[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:48.120]   There's no charge.
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:50.960]   You don't have to be a club member to join, but that's absolutely supported by the club.
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:53.040]   As is our forum.
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:54.520]   Slide a little to the right there.
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:55.520]   The other way, other way.
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:25:56.520]   There you go.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:57.520]   Zoom in.
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:01.840]   Setter, enhance, zoom, center, enhance.
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:02.840]   Good.
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:03.840]   That's close enough.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:04.840]   You're the real chief to it.
[02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:05.840]   Not to fake you.
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:06.840]   Yeah.
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:07.840]   There's another guy who called himself that.
[02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:08.840]   Yeah.
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:09.840]   One's in future.
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:10.840]   Yeah.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:11.840]   That was, that was pretty much the last straw.
[02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:12.840]   That's when I left.
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:13.840]   Do you feel him?
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:14.840]   No.
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:16.640]   That's a, I'll tell you that one off the air.
[02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:21.800]   We'll tell you that story off the air, but yeah, I'm, I think Mastodon is a kind of more
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:25.760]   civilized and can never be purchased by anybody.
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:28.360]   No matter how many billions of dollars they have.
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:29.360]   So I like that.
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:33.800]   And because it's just a, a Twit listeners in, in our local timeline, it's really a great,
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:35.480]   I think it's a wonderful conversation.
[02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:38.000]   Very smart, interesting people.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.080]   Completely add free.
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:41.160]   No need for walls of any kind.
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:42.160]   Yeah.
[02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:43.560]   Fantastic.
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:48.560]   And a lot of people who, including, I think, I suspect a lot of those bots that we're going
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:51.760]   to get, that are going to get booted from Twitter will end up here.
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:56.360]   So this may even be, you know, more fun in time.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:27:02.040]   We also have a discourse forums at Twit.community, also free and open all Twit listeners.
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:07.080]   So yeah, and that, you know, those aren't hugely expensive, but it costs money.
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:08.960]   It's, I don't have advertising in there.
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:10.560]   So anything you could do to help is great.
[02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:12.560]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:14.880]   Denise Howell, always a pleasure.
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:16.160]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:17.160]   I appreciate it.
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:18.160]   So great to be here.
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:19.160]   Thank you.
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:20.160]   Thank you, Mr. Will Harris.
[02:27:20.160 --> 02:27:21.640]   I'm excited about Unbound.
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:23.960]   What's going well?
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.280]   It's going super well.
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:26.280]   Really enjoying it.
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:31.040]   We've got a good slate of books coming in through this year.
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:32.640]   Some good backlist stuff.
[02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:37.400]   The Cane's jawbone is still going gangbusters for us all over the world.
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:42.600]   And yes, exciting time, you know, sounds a strange thing to say to me.
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:48.160]   It's exciting time to be in book publishing, but it's a very cool world at the moment.
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:53.640]   Well, you're in the kind of book publishing that I think is modern, which is you're talking
[02:27:53.640 --> 02:27:56.320]   about, you know, like Cane's jawbone.
[02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:58.680]   I mean, this is stuff that was on TikTok, right?
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:01.920]   This is 21st century stuff.
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:04.120]   And I'm really excited about 42.
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:05.280]   I mean, I cannot wait.
[02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:12.080]   And what we try and publish really is things that have a, maybe a niche appeal, but a niche
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:15.480]   appeal to people who really care about that kind of thing.
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:18.400]   And it's like, you know, book publishing is tough when you're just trying to flog sort
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:22.040]   of $5 holiday paperbacks.
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:25.760]   And you've got to sell, you know, hundreds of them in Barnes and Noble at the airport.
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:29.960]   But when you can, when you can get a book published with, with, you know, just a couple
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:34.720]   of hundred people who really care about it, that's, that's a really exciting thing.
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:38.440]   So you think 42 is going to end up being like a breakthrough.
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:42.720]   I am, I bet it is, to be honest with you, this is going to get a lot of attention.
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:45.600]   There are a lot of Douglas Adam fans out there.
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:46.600]   Yeah.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:49.640]   I have a feeling as a breakthrough.
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:52.800]   Not that things I learned from Mario's, but it's not important.
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:29:01.080]   And I have a copy of Taming Gaming on its way to me, not personal use, but for, to,
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:05.760]   to give to someone who keeps hand-ringing about what they believe is a, a video game
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:06.760]   problem.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:07.760]   I don't think it's a problem.
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:08.760]   This is modern.
[02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:10.400]   This is, this is kids.
[02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:11.400]   This is their social life.
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:12.400]   I got to read that.
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:13.400]   I agree.
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:14.400]   That's what I keep telling them.
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:16.000]   And now I can hand them the book.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000]   Yeah.
[02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.840]   And, and again, production, I don't, these must cause so much to make.
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:21.960]   These are, this is four color reproductions.
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:23.120]   They're gorgeous.
[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:25.720]   You really do a nice job on these beautifully bound.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:27.360]   Well, we try, we try.
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:28.360]   Thanks for having me only.
[02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:30.440]   It's always a pleasure to be up with you guys.
[02:29:30.440 --> 02:29:33.600]   The wonderful Will Harris still on Twitter.
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:34.600]   He's never given up.
[02:29:34.600 --> 02:29:37.760]   W-I-L-H-A-R-I-S.
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:39.600]   We try and we try.
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:41.360]   Larry Megan.
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:44.120]   He is at connect safely.org.
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:49.200]   He's president and CEO of that great organization helping parents and kids navigate the modern
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.240]   world.
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:54.560]   Don't forget Tuesday is internet.
[02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:55.560]   What is it?
[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:57.400]   Internet safe, safer internet day.
[02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:59.040]   Safer internet day, absolutely.
[02:29:59.040 --> 02:30:00.040]   Yeah.
[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:04.080]   And you can go to safer internet day.us and you'll find out everything you need to know.
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:05.480]   And look at our videos.
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:07.480]   We, if, I just added video to the nav bar.
[02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:12.520]   We've got a lot of really good interviews that we've done with a lot of experts that
[02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:15.640]   looks like you got a, I got a, it takes a long time to render.
[02:30:15.640 --> 02:30:18.560]   You know, I have a 10 gigabit connection, Larry.
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:19.920]   I don't know what my fault is.
[02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:20.920]   There we go.
[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:21.920]   I am on Linux.
[02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:22.920]   I'm Firefox and Linux.
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:23.920]   I'm like.
[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:24.920]   Anyway, here they are.
[02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:25.920]   So, you know.
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:26.920]   Oh, this is an important one.
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:30.400]   In fact, I'm sending this to a friend whose teenager just got sex-storted.
[02:30:30.400 --> 02:30:31.400]   Yes.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:32.640]   Oh, this is an extortion thing.
[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:34.840]   We should, we could do a part issue.
[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:37.000]   We should talk about that in a future show.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:38.000]   Yeah.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.040]   Yeah, just a lot of good advice for parents.
[02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:41.880]   We've got things going on in schools.
[02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:43.120]   And here's the thing.
[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:45.840]   Tuesday night, you're sitting at dinner.
[02:30:45.840 --> 02:30:46.840]   Talk to your kids.
[02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:48.880]   Talk to your, your partner.
[02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:50.040]   Talk to your colleagues at work.
[02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:54.720]   I mean, just don't make a big deal about it and just talk about things like misinformation,
[02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:55.720]   civility.
[02:30:55.720 --> 02:31:00.520]   I can't even remember other buckets, but just all the things that we talk about on, on
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:03.560]   safer internet day.us or connect safely.org.
[02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:05.320]   And this is an international event.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:07.920]   And it's going to be over a hundred countries.
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:08.920]   Yeah.
[02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:10.400]   It's not about shutting down the internet.
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:16.440]   It's about communication and, and, and being in touch with your kids about what's out
[02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:17.440]   there.
[02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:18.440]   This is the real world, you know?
[02:31:18.440 --> 02:31:19.440]   Yeah.
[02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:24.160]   In our day, Larry, you'd tell kids, be careful when you go down to the soda shop.
[02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:26.440]   There's that guy, Joey.
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:28.640]   He's always bumming bubble gum.
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:30.240]   Don't give him any bubble gum.
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:31.240]   Okay.
[02:31:31.240 --> 02:31:33.840]   That's when my day, I would go out in my bicycle without a helmet.
[02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:34.840]   Yeah.
[02:31:34.840 --> 02:31:38.920]   You know, come back after dark and my parents wouldn't have any idea where I had a phone.
[02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:39.920]   What's that?
[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:41.920]   We think our kids are in trouble.
[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:44.520]   In my day, we didn't have seat belts.
[02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:47.720]   Dad would just reach out to keep me in my seat if he had a stock.
[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:49.280]   I was a boy scout.
[02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:50.720]   And the boy, we'd go on a boy scout trip.
[02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:52.360]   So we'd get in the back of a truck.
[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:53.360]   Yeah.
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:56.560]   And we'd all stand in the back of this truck and we'd drive up to the mountain, bounce
[02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:57.560]   around.
[02:31:57.560 --> 02:32:00.560]   Oh, you, I'm sorry you have to hear this.
[02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:01.560]   The old men talking.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.560]   Thank you.
[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:03.560]   Thank you.
[02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:05.600]   Well, thank you to these.
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:06.840]   Thanks to all of you who join us.
[02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:09.080]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.

[02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000]   What time is it?
[02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.520]   Is it like one in the morning there?
[02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:33.520]   Yeah, it's like one.
[02:32:33.520 --> 02:32:34.520]   It's one.
[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:35.520]   Yes.
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:37.960]   That's a normal time to go to bed.
[02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:42.320]   I need more than a ring light to look good in this, this time of day.
[02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:43.560]   You look fabulous, Will.
[02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:44.560]   Fabulous.
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:46.160]   You like your green curtains in the background.
[02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:48.600]   Yeah, that's good.
