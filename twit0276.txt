[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   Hi there.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.500]   Good to see you.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   Great to have you.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   I see right behind you.

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   Yes, I am there.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   I also have one of your old books here, Leo, but I won't pull that out.

[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.460]   The pre-show was a little different.
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.900]   We do believe, we are not sure.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.140]   We believe we believe Andrew Barron of Rocket Boom is on his way.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.540]   At least the last we heard he was coming to the San Francisco Bridge.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.700]   Now we don't know what bridge that is, because there is no San Francisco Bridge, but if he
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.900]   was at the San Francisco Bridge, someday he'll be here.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.900]   He'll be there.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.300]   I know he tweeted about it a couple of times.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   I don't know.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.700]   Maybe he's living in a different time zone.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.700]   Well, there's a chair for him right there.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700]   Anywhere.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.800]   He's in New York still doing Rocket Boom, I think, right?
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   Yeah, he sure is.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   He's doing Rocket Boom.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   He has magma.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.100]   We've talked to him about that on net at night.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.640]   But as we were talking about just before the show, know your meme.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.760]   It has become such a huge internet hit.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.200]   That's where they take all the latest internet memes and they really talk about how they
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.100]   happened and the history of the memes.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.000]   And I think it's surpassed Rocket Boom as far as traffic.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Wow.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's kind of like Snopes for memes.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.560]   It's very cool, actually.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   I've watched a lot of them.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560]   And it's always fun.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.180]   I think from David after dentist to all the different memes that we follow along.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.420]   So they do a really great job of that.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.820]   The Charlie Bitme guy has a Twitter.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.820]   I don't know.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.820]   You do one thing by accident, like David at that dentist, where just by accident a father
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.340]   tapes his son and didn't even really think that it was going to be a video.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.340]   Others would see.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.100]   He just didn't understand how to make it private on YouTube.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.380]   Now it's got, I don't know how many tens of millions of views he's made.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.380]   He says well over $100,000.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.380]   Oh yeah.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.820]   I mean, he's turned it into a full business.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.820]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.140]   And then Charlie Bitme, which is another great internet meme, they've got a Twitter feed.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140]   I mean, these are little kids.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.460]   I don't think they're tweeting.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.460]   Probably not.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.700]   Probably not.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.740]   So there are some very, very big stories.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.340]   And I think the biggest one which is breaking right now is WikiLeaks.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.100]   I, you know, I really don't know what to think of Julian Assange and the whole WikiLeaks
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.100]   thing.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.780]   So I greatly respect, including Jay Rosen and of NYU, yeah, NYU and Jeff Jarvis, who hosts
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.260]   our twig show of, and is at Cooney in New York, both very esteemed journalists, not only,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.460]   you know, just a journalist, but teachers of journalism and kind of arbiters of journalism
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.700]   say that WikiLeaks is great.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.060]   Jay Rosen said it's the first kind of multinational journalistic enterprise or a non-profit.
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.300]   Non-national journalistic enterprise.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.940]   What are you, let me ask Dwight, because you're also a journalist, a practicing journalist.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.900]   What do you think of WikiLeaks?
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.500]   It's very intriguing.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.940]   There are a lot of, obviously a lot of ethical questions involved there.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.500]   The army private who gave the data to WikiLeaks that is, you know, being, has been parceled
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.020]   out over time, obviously is in a lot of trouble as a result of this.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.900]   You know, so far I kind of haven't seen anything that I think, oh, this puts our nation at
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.860]   risk or puts any individuals at risk.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.900]   And the WikiLeaks folks have said themselves that no one has been hurt as a result of the
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.420]   release of it.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.500]   But you know, it's, I think government needs to operate transparently.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.980]   You end up with questions of whether that's true in wartime and whether we are in war
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.980]   time.
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.980]   So there-
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.460]   I think everybody agrees there have to be secrets.
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.460]   Right.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.460]   Right.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.220]   And some of these are, you know, a lot of the stuff that I've seen, particularly in the
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.100]   New York Times story today, is kind of intriguing and embarrassing.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.860]   And a lot of it also has already come out.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.820]   So I'm not sure if, unless there's more there that we haven't yet seen and it hasn't been
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.820]   found.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.180]   So far I'm kind of, I'm not seeing kind of the big threat that a lot of people think
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.180]   is there.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.140]   Well, and I, you know, they did the right thing, at least with the initial release of
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.340]   releasing it first to true journalistic entities like the New York Times.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.900]   Yeah, that's how they've been doing it.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.980]   Letting them vet it first kind of this, that reminds me the Pentagon Papers, which is
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.660]   something you and I grew up with.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.660]   Dwight.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.660]   Right.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.740]   And I mean, equally embarrassing to the US government.
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:37.260]   Nevertheless, very, very important pieces of journalism and leaks important.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:44.980]   Now the New York Times says that the releases so far have been kind of embarrassing to
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.060]   governments.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.700]   The real question, I guess we'd all agree, we don't want something released that will
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.700]   cause people's lives to be lost.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.700]   Right.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.700]   Right.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:03.020]   And you don't know whether, if that will happen before, you know, something is released.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.500]   There may be something in here that, you know, doesn't seem sensational but could cause
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.580]   great harm because of a nuance that say the New York Times or anybody else going through
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.820]   it will miss.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:21.620]   And what's interesting is that someone somewhere was trying to stop this with a denial of service
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.300]   attack earlier today.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.060]   Obviously, they had already given the data to news organizations.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.660]   Yeah, you're blocking the wrong side.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.660]   It's not taking down WikiLeaks isn't going to do anything.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.340]   WikiLeaks, the cable archive is up right now.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:40.340]   If you go to cable, at least as we do this show, cablegate.wickeliques.org.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.180]   And this is where the secret US embassy cables are.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.780]   Part of what protects them, I guess, is that there are so much data.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.940]   There's so much.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.900]   That's one of the things I mean, I just, when you go through it and you look at the archives
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.620]   and how much information there actually is there, I was just kind of diving in earlier
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.620]   on today.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.260]   I mean, most of it isn't going to mean a lot to the average person, I would say.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.260]   Right.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.980]   Somebody said in the chatroom, "Well, oh, why are they only leaking US stuff?"
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.180]   Well, I think the point of WikiLeaks is everything, right?
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.500]   Not necessarily just US stuff.
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.380]   They happen to have this treasure trove right now, but it's not the only thing WikiLeaks
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.380]   does.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.100]   Well, and in this case, it came from this private who down-
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.100]   Right.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.300]   Just a slew of documents all at once.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.660]   And obviously, he's going to get it from US sources.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.660]   And he was a soldier.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.620]   So a number of people said on Twitter, "Trees-ness," including government representatives.
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:40.700]   And somebody I know, Adrian Lama, who is a hacker, is the guy who turned him in.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:47.140]   Lama, as often the case with hackers, people often go online to boast in chatrooms and
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.140]   so forth.
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.380]   He discovered this guy and he turned him in.
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.580]   And he said he felt he had a fellow in obligation to do so.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:09:01.100]   So there's really a clear point of view in any case, even the tech community on this.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.980]   I think though, this is going to be just the beginning of what's going to be a bigger
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.740]   problem over the next few years with more people sharing more things electronically and
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.860]   people being able to find ways to access the information.
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.020]   I mean, it really goes to show you that doesn't matter who you are.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.220]   We live in a world where if you want something to be private, it's increasingly more difficult
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.220]   to actually protect that.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.220]   Right.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.220]   Right.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.620]   That's where Jeff Jarvis, we love talking to him because he's the guy who says, "Everything
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.060]   should be public.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.060]   If it's all public, why?"
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.220]   You know, then everything's okay.
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.060]   Yeah, either do that or if you're having conversations that are sensitive, then you
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:33.140]   don't write them in any type of document that's saved electronically, right?
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.660]   And you don't go flying anywhere either.
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.460]   I think it's very interesting that the same time that this debate is going on over WikiLeaks,
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.380]   there's the debate going on over the scanners at the airports that the TSA have put in and
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.020]   the very personal groping that's going on.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.300]   And there's dissent over that too.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.180]   Well, just as many people think it's fine.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.340]   In fact, many of the major newspapers said, "Get over it."
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.220]   You know, be searched, whereas if you read Twitter, there's nothing but anger.
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:06.740]   Bruce Schreier has a really good piece on the fact that in essentially what his point
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.220]   is that this is closing the barn door after the horse is out.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:17.980]   You know, in each case, we have set up, according to him, a set of very technological attacks
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:23.260]   on an approach for harm that's already done.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.700]   You know, we've got the body scanners in because of the underwear bomber, right?
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.300]   But that's already happened.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:37.780]   And so the terrorists try something new and come at us from another angle and then we
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.540]   put in a block to that, but that's already happened.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.780]   And so, you know, Bruce essentially says that, you know, that's a complete waste of time
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.780]   and money.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:52.220]   And the things that they've done that have been successful has been getting people to
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.340]   fight back.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.340]   And I forget the other one.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:03.380]   But getting people to fight back is kind of one of the prime things.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:10.300]   And in the case of the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber, that's exactly what happened.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.100]   People aboard the plane took--
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.900]   Turned him in and said, "Hey, what you doing?"
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.580]   And he just says, "That's security success."
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.580]   I guess it is.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.700]   Now, Bruce always-- Bruce calls his security theater.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.700]   Right.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.180]   He says, "This is the appearance of security."
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.500]   Although, let's face it, that's not so bad.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.740]   I saw another article, somebody said, "Well, so what if it doesn't work?
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.060]   So what if it's theater?
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.020]   If it makes people feel safer when they fly and keeps people in the air, then that's a
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.020]   benefit."
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.900]   I love how creative people are getting.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.140]   I don't know if you guys have seen the guy in Colorado who invented the body scanner proof
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.140]   underwear.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.140]   It's so funny.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.940]   And then I think there's underwear as well that you can actually see a message on it.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.940]   Yeah, it's metallic.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.940]   It has the Fourth Amendment on it.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.940]   Yeah, it's those.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.940]   And then there's actually a pair that you can't scan through when you go through the scanner.
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.940]   There's figlies.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.460]   Now, I think if you wore that word of warning, they're going to pull you aside and grope
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.460]   you.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.700]   You're going to get groped if you wear those.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.580]   Did you see the bumper stickers?
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.380]   Can't see London, can't see France unless we see your underpants.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.140]   Oh, that's so funny.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.140]   Groped discounts availed.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.660]   These are TSA bumper stickers.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.700]   If we did our job any better, we'd have to buy you dinner first.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.580]   I don't want to jump ahead, Leo, but I know we're going to talk about the Twitter account
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.260]   for the TSA, which is also--
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.260]   There's only one.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.260]   --fresling, being weird at amusing.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.260]   There's only one, right?
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.460]   Now, there are a lot of fake Twitter accounts, but the TSA-- what is the TSA Twitter account?
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.460]   I don't know.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.460]   I think I have it here.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.060]   Hold on one second.
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.260]   Open it up early.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.260]   I'm flying on Sunday.
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.260]   I'm flying to France.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.260]   It'll be very-- I don't know.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.620]   I'm going to get the X-ray if I can.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.060]   I don't want to be felt up.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.060]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.860]   You're going to get the badge, though.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.660]   Don't you Leo, the fourth grad badge?
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.660]   Yes.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.660]   I will.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:48.660]   By the way, that's awesome.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.660]   I will.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.660]   If you do a check-in from the airport and what you have to say, like TSA groped me or something
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.860]   and you'll get a special-- I've been groped--
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.860]   Bitch.
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.860]   OK, so it's the TSA blog team.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.940]   Yeah, I just found it as well.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.860]   And I guess it's real, but I almost can't believe it.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.860]   I don't know if you guys felt the same way we came.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.960]   Well, you were a blogger, Bob.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.300]   I think we talked about blogger Bob onto it a few months ago.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.860]   He was blogging for the TSA.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.660]   I mean, maybe for a guy.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:20.660]   Ten thousand people following TSA blog team, they talk here about the fake Twitter accounts.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.660]   They say happy Thanksgiving.
[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:27.060]   TSA opt-out turns into TSA opt-in.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.760]   That was the 24th.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.460]   We talked about that, too.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.860]   People were saying, "Oh, I'm going to get patted down."
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.860]   Bad idea.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.060]   Yeah, the funny thing, if you read the--
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.660]   Most of this is retweets.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.860]   Almost all of this is retweets, yeah.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.260]   They go into-- in the Gizmo-do article, they go down through conversations that the TSA
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.180]   team blog has had with individuals talking to the TSA on Twitter.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.220]   And this one woman is really angry and she sort of swears at the TSA.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.460]   And the TSA blog team writes back and goes, "Um, um, um, um, dot, dot, dot."
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.260]   I mean, they just-- it's so extreme.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.660]   It's just some intern they hired.
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:05.060]   But they write things like, "No pie for you," when people don't like their-- I mean,
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.540]   I don't know if I want to laugh or cry at some of these comments.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.260]   I think they hired some college kids.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.860]   They said, "You know about social media?
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.860]   Yeah?
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.260]   Okay, can you do our Twitter?
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.020]   We need somebody on the Twitter."
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.020]   And there's all these smiley faces.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.020]   I don't know.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.980]   I mean, I just-- I guess I want the TSA to have a--
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   Serious!
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.380]   Or a stable or-- yeah, appearance or more serious appearance on Twitter.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.740]   Well, should they have an appearance at all on Twitter?
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.340]   Well, I think they can, but I think they need to sort of decide who they're going to
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.340]   be there.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.740]   Like, right now, if you look at the tweets that have been highlighted on Gizmo-do, they're
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.980]   really just having a lot of fun with different messages.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.540]   And they have, like, cute little jokes.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.860]   I don't consider airport security funny.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.420]   Apparently, they don't either.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.300]   Go ahead and try those jokes at the airport, see how they do it.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   Exactly.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.300]   Good point.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.900]   Actually, the TSA has a really useful feed where they tweet the waiting times at security
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.740]   locations for various airports.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.060]   Oh, that's good.
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.540]   And that's actually useful.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   That's the kind of thing they should be doing.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.260]   I mean, Amber, you know, you wrote the book "Power of Friending."
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.780]   I presume it's your opinion that every company should-- it should every government agency
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780]   be on Twitter?
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.940]   I don't care if your government agency needs to be on there, but I do think if you're
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.740]   going to be on there, you need to decide that you're going to kind of extend your image
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.340]   to people, your extend your brand.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.380]   And I would say the TSA isn't this fun, light brand, nor should they be.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.060]   And so to go to their Twitter account and see them having a lot of fun, like you said,
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.020]   if you went to use for security and you try to do the same thing, you're going to end
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.940]   up there for a lot longer and you're going to miss your flight.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.260]   So I think they need a bit of an overhaul and kind of need to rethink their presence
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.260]   there.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.460]   I mean, it's kind of cute, but I think at the end of the day, we don't want cute for our
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.740]   airport security, right?
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.420]   Yeah, not me.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.820]   So let's move on.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.380]   And there are other stories, including the federal government.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:56.260]   Apparently ICE, which is a division of Homeland Security, shutting down not terrorist sites,
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:01.980]   sites violating copyright, including torrentfinder.com.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:08.820]   If you go to these sites, you'll find a big logo of the Department of Homeland Security
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:17.500]   saying, you know, pending a criminal investigation, this site is shut down.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   Is this the beginning of what has been promised from the federal government of the federal
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.020]   government using ICANN, which is ostensibly an international, well, it's a US organization,
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:37.980]   but it really represents the international internet using that to basically to support
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:45.060]   an agenda that is, you know, the copyright holders, the agenda of the RIAA and the MPAA.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.500]   I'm curious about what the due process was in this.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.060]   I mean, they say that they had a-- They said they had a court order.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.300]   But the people who have been quoted who own these domains indicate that they have been
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.580]   given notice of this.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.860]   Apparently, they're going directly to DNS and changing it over, but shouldn't the owners,
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:12.980]   the people who hold the domains, who want them, you know, directed through specific DNS locations,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.060]   shouldn't they be notified?
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.460]   It almost seems like there's some kind of violation there due process.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:25.940]   This domain name, not the site, not the hardware, this domain name has been seized by ICE,
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.820]   Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a seizure warrant issued by the United States
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.180]   District Court.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.180]   What is the crime?
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.060]   Will full copyright infringement?
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.580]   I just don't-- I mean, it's not going to stop people, you know, that's-- I can't see people
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.580]   going there and saying, "Oh, okay, you know what, I see this message and I'm going to
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:47.700]   stop trying to get copyrighted materials online."
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:52.500]   I know in Canada, for example, I think we're one of the top nations as far as pirating music
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.820]   and movies and television shows.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.580]   And one of the reasons is we just don't have access to some of that content.
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:02.020]   We can't buy a lot of TV shows and movies on iTunes, like compared to the US, for example.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.460]   And so there is this huge demand to be able to go online and get access to this.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.460]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.340]   So Amber, if they keep-- you can't get it.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.220]   And if people are going to do it anyway, does that mean that the federal government of
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.260]   either country should not try to enforce it?
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.740]   Well, I think they should try to enforce it.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.060]   I just don't think it's going to stop it.
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.060]   So I agree.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.860]   They definitely need to do something about it, I guess, in their minds.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.420]   But I don't think it's going to have a major effect on people out there who are trying
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.580]   to find these different files.
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.100]   There's just too many other places to go.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.820]   So in some ways, I think they should try, but I just don't see it as being time well
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.860]   spent, I guess I could say.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.540]   I don't see an end to it.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.900]   Well, and I have a problem because I think that it raises much larger issues because
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.340]   this is a fairly heavy-handed way to do it.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.500]   And it really is impacting the free flow of the internet to steal the domain name and
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.740]   to use the fact that ICANN is a arm of the Commerce Department in the United States.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.660]   See, I think there are a lot of countries who have said, "We don't want the US Commerce
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.660]   Department running the global internet."
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.220]   Well, doing this kind of thing is exactly underscoring what they're saying.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.340]   But basically, to defend American interests, they're breaking the internet.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:19.140]   And these sites have taken and moved to different domains that are under the control of ICANN.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.620]   One of them moved to a dot info domain.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.980]   And so it kind of takes it out of the realm of what the US could do with it.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:32.260]   But I'm very interested and I hope that in the next few days, as this develops, we get
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.500]   to see exactly what the due process was and how this was determined.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.100]   I mean, as far as I know, there has been no trial.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:44.020]   There's been no indication of what they did to determine that these sites are primarily
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.460]   copyright infringement.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.980]   Now, some of them I understand from based on the domain names themselves.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.540]   It's obvious that that's what they're trying to do.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.060]   But not all of them do that.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.100]   Not all the content that's flowing through them is copyrighted or not for distribution.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.100]   Well, and that's why the torrent finder issue is particularly challenging because in fact,
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.260]   it's just i-frames.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.420]   And the guy who runs it runs it from Egypt.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.700]   So, you know, there, this really doesn't sound right.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.700]   It doesn't sit right.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.580]   It really bugs me, especially when I read quotes like this.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.980]   This is John T. Morton, Assistant Secretary of ICE, saying American business is under
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.260]   assault from counterfeiters and pirates every day, seven days a week.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:31.820]   Criminals are stealing American ideas and products and distributing them over the internet.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.500]   There's also a bill, which is currently making its way through Congress.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.700]   I don't know how you pronounce it, Kawika, the Combating Online and Fringivents and Counterfeits
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:47.460]   Act, which the EFF has basically says, "The Internet Sensorship Bill."
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:53.220]   You know, the operator of torrent finder says, "My website does not even host any torrents
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.500]   or direct link to them.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.100]   I'm sure something is wrong."
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.860]   He says his server is still up and running at a different address.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.500]   And it may be running outside the US.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   I don't know.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.500]   I'm not sure.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.020]   I guess I can, could in fact, block it worldwide if they should choose to.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.500]   You know what I didn't realize?
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.860]   I didn't realize I don't know if you guys know more about this, but I didn't realize
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.260]   what a big issue cyber squatting is for many big companies out there.
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.620]   I don't want to take this too far off track, but I work with a client right now who makes
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.820]   these great big down parkas, the name of the company is Canada Goose.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.820]   And there are so many companies right now in China who are squatting on names that sound
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.620]   like San Canada Goose and selling products that look exactly like their products for like
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.300]   a quarter of the price.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.220]   And with Canada Goose, there's a bit of a struggle right now to even show up in Google
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.460]   results because they're so advanced as far as understanding SEO and how to get to the
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.540]   top of Google search results.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.860]   So there's a, I think that that's such an interesting thing happening online right now,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.900]   too, although obviously very negative and hurting a lot of companies as far as sales.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.900]   Well, speaking of SEO, we're going to take a break and come back and I want to talk about
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:06.660]   decor my eyes, which is a very interesting study in gaming Google and the big New York
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.660]   Times article today about this site.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.620]   I think it should now see to me, this should be blocked for the bad jacks at Brown pun.
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.460]   Just forget the rest of it.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.020]   It's just, it's just a bad, bad name decor my eyes.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.020]   Thank goodness I'm not running.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.860]   I can.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.500]   Before we get to that though, and I think it's a really interesting story, I want to
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:31.580]   talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix and the great go to meeting, which is a really
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.980]   great service for people who don't want to travel, but need to meet with people around
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.980]   the world.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.860]   You know, that's a lot of times nice to meet face to face, but frankly, who can afford
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.860]   to do it all the time?
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.860]   Nobody can.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.140]   Nobody's got the time, the money, not to mention the stress of flying these days.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.060]   This is why go to meetings hotter than ever.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.260]   Go to meeting, let's you meet, let's you have a conference call that says good as a
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.540]   in person meeting because of the visual aspect that go to meeting ads.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.540]   It's very simple.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.500]   You can install it right now free for 30 days.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.620]   Just put it on your machine.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.620]   Very lightweight.
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.780]   Won't, won't, you know, occupy much space or bother you in any way until you're ready
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.940]   to have a meeting.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.540]   Then you, you can do it ahead of time, send out an outlook invitation or an email with
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.740]   a link or even while you're on the phone with somebody say, Hey, go to go to meeting.com.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.740]   I just started a meeting.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.740]   This is the ID.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.260]   They enter in that nine digit number.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.100]   Suddenly there's without any software on their side.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.100]   They download it.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.180]   For 30 seconds, it's suddenly they're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.860]   You can show them the PowerPoint, the keynote because it's Mac as well as PC.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:31.180]   You could show them the drawings, the spreadsheets, the websites.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.500]   You could collaborate together.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:39.100]   You could even, you know, give them control of your machine for training or vice versa.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.100]   Very easy to install.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.340]   Try it right now for 30 days.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.500]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:49.500]   G-O-T-O meeting.com/twit.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.020]   Don't you've installed it?
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.020]   Just have a meeting.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.020]   By the way, there's a great iPad app out too for Go to Meeting.
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.340]   Makes it really fun to have meetings out in the backyard.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.020]   As long as you got Wi-Fi, it's fantastic.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.580]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:08.500]   So you, I'm sure you've read this New York Times article today about decor my eyes.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.500]   Amazing story.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.500]   Amazing.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.900]   I just went to the website and look at this.
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.900]   Your feedback is important to us.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.340]   Did you be willing to give us one minute feedback?
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.820]   I don't know if I want to even click a link on this site.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.980]   It's terrifying.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.060]   What do you think was reading that story?
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:38.460]   And the writer talks about going to the owner of the website, his house in Brooklyn.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.260]   And he's sitting there and having this conversation with the guy.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.220]   And he paid such a wonderful picture of what this guy is like.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.540]   And as a reporter, you can feel him as he's talking to him.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.100]   He's thinking to himself, "This is a great story.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.900]   This is a great story.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.900]   This is a guy."
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.300]   I'm surprised or reported and explode.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.860]   He really said, "I know that feeling."
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.500]   I have struck gold.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.980]   You know he said it's the reason why it runs on for what it's like six pages.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.980]   It is seven pages.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:08.980]   Very long story.
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.900]   Seven pages on the New York Times website.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   It's a great story.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.340]   Two minutes ago, a bully finds a pulpit on the web.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.020]   He even had a good title.
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:27.220]   And so basically it starts off with the story of one Clarabel Rodriguez who typed the name
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:33.700]   of a eyeglass brand, a frame into Google, the very first site that showed up right at
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:39.940]   the top of the page was this decormyeyes.com.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.620]   And now because she said, because it was the number one, not a paid ad, but the number
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:49.140]   one search result she clicked on it, they had the LaFonte frame she wanted.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.700]   So she ordered them.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.660]   It was the start, this is the New York Times, of what Ms. Rodriguez would later describe
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:26:00.260]   as one of the most maddening and miserable experiences of her life.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.620]   She got counterfeit frames.
[00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.260]   She got overcharged.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.420]   The guy threatened her.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:09.380]   The guy took pictures of her house and said, "I know where you live."
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.900]   And she asked to have the credit card charge returned, the credit card company said, "Okay,
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.900]   then the guy called him, posing as her, got it turned around."
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.900]   She called the credit card company.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.340]   She said, "Well, take it up with him."
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.980]   But the funniest thing is this guy loves the bad publicity because it gives him Google
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.340]   juice.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.420]   It's unbelievable.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.100]   I cannot believe this story.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.420]   I just can't imagine you.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.900]   People who are finding this company that they're actually going to go and spend money even
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.220]   after reading all of these reviews.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.220]   I think that's funny more.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.940]   Yeah, well, it gives him Google juice.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.780]   The reality is it's short-lived as far as his popularity online.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.620]   And it's not really a long-term strategy to do well.
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.940]   So the reporter talked to Danny Sullivan, who's great of SearchEngineLand.com.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.940]   And we've talked to Danny before.
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.460]   He's a really smart guy.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.460]   This is his beat.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.980]   He covers search engines.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.980]   And Danny pointed out that, "Well, if you search for decor my eyes on Google, you'll see
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.980]   all the negatives."
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.980]   That's what Google said.
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:06.980]   "Well, I'll just search for the company.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.980]   You'll see the problems."
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.420]   He said, "Look, this isn't the problem.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.340]   She didn't search for decor my eyes.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.380]   She searched for La Fonte frames."
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.100]   So she never saw the negatives.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.380]   She only saw companies that sold La Fonte frames.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.980]   Because of all the negative links to decor my eyes, this is how PageRank works, the more
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.660]   links, the better.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.140]   In fact, many of these negative links come from a site called Get Satisfaction.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.140]   We use it at Twit.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.860]   A lot of companies use Get Satisfaction.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:40.500]   It's a place users can go to complain or to ask for, it's a customer service site, third
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.500]   party site.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.900]   And it has a lot of Google juice.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.940]   If there are a lot of links on Get Satisfaction, that's going to raise your search results
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.940]   up.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.420]   It doesn't matter that they're negative links.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:59.620]   You can't have Google doing links based on sentiment because there are so many angry
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.780]   links out there against Barack Obama or Sarah Palin and it would drive those websites,
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.700]   the White House's website, way down.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.220]   And so that's not a solution.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:17.020]   Danny makes a really good suggestion that when you search for, say, a brand of eyeglasses,
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:23.780]   and this is one of the search results that alongside or underneath the result for that
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.060]   specific site, you see some of the ratings that come up.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:32.420]   In fact, it might be interesting for maybe a competitor for Google to do something like
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.420]   that.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:39.460]   I mean, you can imagine Google including, say, Yelp star ratings or something on there.
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.340]   Does Get Satisfaction use a star rating system?
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   I don't know.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.340]   I don't think so.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.260]   You know, when the way it works for us, if something goes wrong with when our feeds
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.380]   or something, people go to Get Satisfaction and they say, "Hey, your feed's screwed up."
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.780]   And we have staff looking at that on a regular basis.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.180]   Ammer, a lot of companies, I know, use Get Satisfaction.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.700]   And I think the funny thing about this story is I think this is one of the reasons that
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.780]   I rarely ever buy anything online anymore just based on a Google search.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.780]   What?
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.780]   Well, I don't.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.180]   Well, I depend on my online social networks like Twitter and Facebook, and I'll go there
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.060]   and say, "Hey, I want to buy sunglasses online.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.540]   Does anyone have a recommendation?"
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.660]   Because for me, you know, sifting through all the results on Google, it just isn't that
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.780]   informative and I just don't rely on it or trust it as much as I would trust my own social
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.780]   networks.
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:26.140]   I think social search, I mean, this is, you know, obviously has a really bright future.
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.580]   And if I'm staying in a hotel in a new city, I'll go there and say, "Hey, has anyone heard
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.580]   of this hotel?
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.580]   What do you think?"
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.340]   Because to me, Google just isn't relevant necessarily as much anymore because I can rely
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.340]   on these other networks.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.980]   So this is actually a problem for Google.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.700]   Google's response was, "Well, what are we supposed to do?
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.100]   We're not going to censor this result.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.820]   This is a true result.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.140]   Does Google have a responsibility here?"
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.140]   I don't think so.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.140]   There's lots of crappy products inside out there.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.540]   You don't want Google to be the arbiter of, "Oh, this is good.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.540]   This is bad."
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.540]   I mean, that's...
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.780]   Or what you were talking about, Dwight, which is called sentiment analysis, where it's not
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.140]   merely how many links is how many negative versus positive links, but you don't want Google
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.100]   to arbiter of that either.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.100]   What should Google do?
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.660]   Although, Dwight, I mean, besides...
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.780]   Google should give you, do what it does best, which is give you data.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:20.820]   And if it were to show you some of the responses from get satisfaction or some other, there
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.500]   are other services that do provide ratings, I think if it just gives you the data, I
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:30.540]   think, along with each e-commerce site that offers to sell you something, I think that's
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.780]   probably the end of Google's responsibility.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.900]   Let me do the same search.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.220]   Here's an opportunity for Bing.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.540]   Same search on Bing.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:46.780]   And I search for LaFont frames, and I get the LaFont company as the first few places.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.340]   Huh.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.340]   I don't get...
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.340]   Let me put frames...
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:56.100]   Is Descor my eyes even after the story still tops on Google?
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.980]   Oh, well, that's an interesting question.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980]   Let's try it on Google.
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.220]   If Google has taken action.
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.700]   They don't say exactly what her search was.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.900]   I'll try LaFont frames.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.580]   FramesDirect.com is number one.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.540]   I don't see Descor my eyeglass.com.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.540]   Cool frames.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.580]   Now, I don't know that these guys are better or worse.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.580]   That's part of the problem.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.820]   So I guess it's let the buyer beware.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.860]   People should be perhaps before they buy doing it.
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:24.340]   I don't see the site there at all.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.340]   I don't see it at all.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.340]   I wonder if he got delisted.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.340]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.500]   Oh, the quotes from him are just stunning.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:35.340]   I think though, even if Google does something, and even if they include Yelp or any other
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.900]   services that provide recommendations that people have given, I can still see companies
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.460]   out there who kind of gaming these systems, right?
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.060]   And for me, that's why, again, I rely more on kind of a trusted network of people that
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:50.380]   I know or loosely know than going to search results because I know companies now who
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.140]   are going to Yelp and they're putting in fake reviews, TripAdvisor to me is just a disaster
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   when you go to the site.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.260]   I used to love TripAdvisor because you don't trust it anymore because you know hotel administrators
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.260]   are in there.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.260]   And so who do I trust?
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.300]   I trust my own networks people who have faces who I've seen or know somehow, even if it's
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.300]   just online.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.340]   Now, Facebook, I mean, Bing did, of course, this new Facebook thing.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.740]   You could see there's my highly.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.820]   Oh, Bing just got better with your Facebook friends.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.940]   So this presumably would be, I don't see it, but presumably they could have in corporate.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:28.380]   If my Facebook friends had been choosing frames, I guess maybe if I, let me try glasses frames.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.380]   This is interesting.
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.100]   This is, this is one of those solutions is to put social graph information in here.
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.380]   This would be an interesting test case for Blippi.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:41.980]   Oh, you know, don't tell me about Blippi.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:47.620]   Blippi, isn't Blippi the, it's, it's a Philip Kaplan is one either, I don't think he's
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.820]   a founder, but he thinks very involved in it.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:55.340]   It's where you, it, you make social your credit card.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.340]   Right.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.340]   Right.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.100]   Or Netflix or iTunes or right.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.100]   It's a specific site.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.420]   And so you share them with other people.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:07.580]   And you know, if it were more widespread, you could provide along with your credit card
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.020]   information some rating of the experience that would be interesting.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.580]   So, so the reporter, I love this.
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.860]   The reporter tracks down the guy who wants decor my eyes.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.900]   His name is Vitale Borger.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.460]   He lives in the sheep's head, Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn in a large brick house is welcome
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.540]   Matt.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:29.140]   He's emblazoned with a Russian phrase that roughly translates to go away.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.380]   Not welcome.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.580]   Go away.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:37.380]   So he sits down on leather sof and says, what do you want to know?
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.940]   And the first floor of a large brick house on home office where he lives with his wife
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.660]   and two year old child, toys are all over the floor.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.820]   Workers are noisily drilling nearby, renovating the garage.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:51.140]   Mr. Borger perks up explaining his business philosophy like a professor unveiling new
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:56.660]   research, talking at a frenetic pace, talking, tossing in plenty of profanity and ending
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.860]   sentences with, do you understand?
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.900]   When I fly to Las Vegas, I look down and see all these houses.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.980]   If someone in one of those houses buys from decor, my eyes and ends up hating the company,
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.260]   it doesn't matter.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.700]   All those other houses are filled with people too and they will come knocking.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.340]   He says, I'm not a sales girl at Macy's following a customer around the store to make sure you're
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.540]   happy.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:25.300]   He says he first heard about get satisfaction when he got an email from one of the site's
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.220]   employees who was trying to mediate on behalf of unhappy customers.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.180]   He says, they wrote to me, we'd like to talk to you.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.220]   You should take a proactive approach.
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.540]   Mr. Borger sneers and rolls his eyes.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:43.220]   I sent him a photograph of this and he flipped them off.
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.380]   What?
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:49.020]   They need audio or video.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.820]   It's he actually apparently he worked at Lehman Brothers where he.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.940]   Oh, that explains a lot.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.900]   In the back end computer systems for the mutual funds.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.340]   He's been sued by several luxury manufacturers, including Chanel, the accused of peddling
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.220]   counterfeits.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:12.620]   All of this publicity has weirdly enough ended up helping him.
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.340]   He says, he stumbled upon the upside of ruseness by accident.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.380]   I stopped caddying.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.980]   He says, and for that he blames customers.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.260]   They lied and changed their minds in ways that cost him money.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:30.700]   At some part, he started telling him off in the bluntest of terms to his amazement.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:37.500]   This seemed to better his standing in certain Google searches which brought in more sales.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:43.900]   Initially he'd hired a company, an SEO company to write positive things about him online.
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:47.900]   Then he realized, odious behavior worked much better and didn't cost him anything.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.500]   So he does this on purpose?
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.700]   Yes.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   Yes.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.900]   You're right, eight pages Dwight and you can't put it down.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:02.900]   It's just a means.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.900]   It's like fiction.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.900]   It's so good.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:05.900]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:10.220]   It almost reads like one point he says that towards the end of the month, he backs off
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.620]   because one of his resources, if he gets too many complaints, we'll cut him off so he
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.020]   gets nicer towards the end of the month.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.580]   And then when the new month starts, he's mean to get that.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.460]   Apparently, MasterCard says they're looking into him.
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.460]   He says, don't worry.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.540]   There's no such thing as shutting someone down on the internet.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.540]   It isn't possible.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.220]   If he's at a MasterCard, they ever shut me down.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.540]   I use the name of a friend of mine.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.540]   I've given one percent.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:37.540]   I can't wait till the viral videos come out with someone depicting this guy and using
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.780]   all the script.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.260]   It's amazing.
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:42.100]   It's amazing.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:47.380]   So he, I mean, I think he's skirting pretty close to the law.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.700]   I mean, he's threatening people.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.460]   The police, Ms. Rodriguez went to the police.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.620]   She said they were sympathetic.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.620]   They said, we're still trying to build a case.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.180]   She said, I want him to know if anything happens to me.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.860]   Who did it?
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.340]   She was that afraid.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.340]   She was that afraid.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.340]   Okay.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.740]   I take back my comment about not wanting to buy from there because now I kind of want
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.740]   to buy from there.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.940]   I see how mean they could be.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:13.940]   I do.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.980]   So he might have a bit of a spike over the next few weeks in terms of traffic.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.420]   So I sort of want to buy something and see.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.220]   You just want to be abused.
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.780]   I guess so, I suppose so.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:27.020]   But it is intriguing nonetheless.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.940]   He was arrested October 27th.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.860]   This is according to the Times accused of aggravated harassment and stalking.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.740]   Ms. Rodriguez.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   He confirmed he'd been arrested.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.220]   He played down the charges.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.860]   He says it's already been dismissed.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   Not so.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.580]   There's an arraignment coming up.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.780]   About 18 months ago, he says a detective showed up as a door and arrested him on accusation
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.860]   of physically threatening a woman who was a customer.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.140]   She must have known somebody.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:56.880]   He says she's a psycho.
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.120]   Wow.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.060]   He says actually his he says Howard Stern of online commerce.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.280]   The description of his voice actually is more Bronx than Russian.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.220]   It's Bronx with a touch of Russian.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.340]   I don't know if I can do that one.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.860]   So I'm going to stick with it.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.180]   Hey, he says I'm doing fine.
[00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.620]   He says I'm sure this is taking a toll on my health.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.860]   I probably won't live as long as you.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.300]   Yes.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.620]   So the reporter says maybe you should find a more mellow job.
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:30.900]   Maybe become a shepherd or something.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:31.980]   I love this.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.260]   I like the craziness.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.740]   This works for me.
[00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.420]   In unbelievable, unbelievable.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.060]   So it's not Google's fault, is it?
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.900]   No, I don't sound.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.060]   Is he gaming Google?
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:48.060]   No.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.220]   He's gaming Google.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.220]   Is he?
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.220]   Is he going to Google?
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.220]   Yes.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:56.620]   But in kind of a most unexpected way.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:04.180]   And so long as Google doesn't show you exactly why somebody's getting those hits, he can
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.220]   continue to do it except it looks like they have pulled him down because I went through
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.220]   three of the results.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.220]   I don't see it.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.220]   The site is still there.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.220]   The site is still there.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.220]   It's just not on the Google.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.220]   And Google could do this.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:18.700]   I mean, the one thing that Google will do and feels no compunctions about doing or explaining
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.700]   it to you, they'll just take that.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   It reminds me, though, I mean, if you think about it, he's not doing anything new in terms
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   of what's been done in the offline world with celebrities.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.700]   So fancy.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   Think about the soup, Nancy.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.700]   Right.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.700]   Sure.
[00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.060]   And you think of bad press as being a good thing.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.660]   All publicity is good, right?
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.340]   I just found their Twitter account, by the way, decor my eyes on Twitter.
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.340]   Oh, is it good?
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.740]   And they only have one, two, three, four tweets.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.420]   But the most recent one is from 22 hours ago.
[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.340]   It says, have a look at this publicity stunt.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:50.340]   Wow.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.340]   We are famous.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.340]   Oh, geez.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.340]   Oh, geez.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.340]   So talk about unrepentant.
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.340]   So there's two other 50 people following.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.820]   Oh, I'm going to-- is it just decor my eyes?
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.300]   Yeah, I'm going to follow.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.660]   This guy is going to be an internet celebrity.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:03.660]   He is.
[00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.660]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.660]   Which does he have?
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.660]   He has 250 followers.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:07.660]   All right.
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.660]   He's not listed anywhere, but that's not a big surprise.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.420]   And he's following 44 people.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.540]   He has-- it says he has eight tweets out, actually.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.740]   I'm telling you, pull a surprise for this article.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.100]   At the end, we say-- this is the reporter again.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.380]   We say our goodbyes, and I ask him to sit for a photograph.
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:24.580]   No, he says.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.340]   Too many psychos out there.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.900]   Besides, he doesn't need his face in the newspaper.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.140]   What he needs is his company's name
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.540]   visible for all the world to see and all the search engines
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.300]   to crawl in the online version of the New York Times,
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.940]   along with some keywords, of course.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.100]   Just throw in designer eyeglasses,
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.340]   designer eyewear in a couple of different brand names,
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.340]   he says.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.340]   And I'm all set.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.420]   You know, I'm telling you, he's going to be a letterman.
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:51.620]   He is.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.540]   I don't think we're going to be at the end of this guy.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:57.380]   This guy's-- his name has been made.
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.260]   Ironically--
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.220]   It's funny.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.580]   Ironically.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.460]   So what should you do?
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.260]   Should you shop via Google No?
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.940]   You should shop via Google's shopper.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.380]   I mean, there you'd see some reviews.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:09.780]   Well, you--
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.300]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.060]   --smartly.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.540]   You shop slightly no matter what you do.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.540]   You do your due diligence.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.300]   And before you buy at a--
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:21.580]   and from any particular site, you search the name of the site.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:25.700]   Jeff Jarvis in his post talked about buying from Dell
[00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:28.900]   years ago and then not searching on Dell Sucks.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.460]   Right.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.940]   You definitely want to search for decor.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:31.940]   My eyes sucks.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.900]   See, before you buy there's some.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.860]   That's what you were talking about a little bit, Amber, too,
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.540]   though, is that it's not squatting.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:42.780]   But I know a number of companies will buy their name Sucks.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:43.340]   Screw them.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.020]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.620]   I would recommend that to any company.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.380]   There's like 10 different things that they can buy,
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.460]   just to make sure that other people don't latch onto them.
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.340]   So I think that's a pretty standard procedure that's
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.180]   been going on for quite a while.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.340]   People try to scoop up any of those names,
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.060]   so no one else sits there.
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.540]   One thing I'd decor my eyes, it looks
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.940]   like they have a live chat, but there's no one there right now.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.060]   I think it could be kind of fun.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.340]   One of these days, they just jump on and see if they're rude
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:06.180]   and chat, too.
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:06.940]   Get in there, Amber.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.540]   Chat with them.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.340]   I'm going.
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.340]   I'm going--
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:12.180]   I'm going to take up a little more.
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.740]   It is just fascinating.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:20.740]   And by the way, I interviewed Steve Martin earlier today
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.860]   on the radio show.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.940]   It was what he wanted to talk about.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.500]   He thought that was fascinating.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.140]   So everybody's kind of aware of it.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:28.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.260]   We're going to take a break.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.020]   We'll come back with more.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.340]   We have lots more tech news.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.740]   And Amber MacArthur is here.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.100]   Donnie, I don't need to introduce Amber.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.580]   She's the host of our own show, Ned at night.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.140]   Her own show, Command End TV is here on TV in Canada.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.580]   My former co-host on Call for Help,
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.020]   the author of Power-Friending, a book
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.500]   about how to use social media for your business.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.620]   Maybe he read that.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.780]   I hope not.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.740]   Hey, Leo.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.620]   If I were you, I'd send him an autographed copy.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.660]   I think I might.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.300]   Get a blurb for the next stuff.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.180]   That's a great idea.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.100]   You know, I've interviewed people like this.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.540]   I mean, they didn't ask full of people like this
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.180]   who have a unique perspective.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.660]   That's kind of the fun of it.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.300]   Also here, Dwight Silverman.
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:17.300]   He is the tech blogger at blogs.crum.com/techblog.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.860]   Does a radio show out of Dallas?
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.700]   Out of Houston?
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.140]   Houston, I'm sorry, a Pacific radio there.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.580]   When is that show on?
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.660]   That's on Wednesday nights, eight o'clock to 10 o'clock
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.820]   central time.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.260]   It's called Technology Bites.
[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.980]   And we kind of do what you and Amber did
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.020]   with calling tech help.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:36.940]   You got to have me back on.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.940]   That was really fun.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.780]   We will have you on any time.
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:40.980]   OK, I really enjoyed it.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:41.580]   I had a great time.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.980]   You have a great team.
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.580]   It seems like there's 12 people on that show.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.180]   It's huge.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.580]   The studio feels like that too.
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.020]   It's very full.
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:53.340]   All right.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.220]   And Andrew Barron, is he--
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.540]   hey, Eileen, is he on his way?
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.540]   Oh.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.700]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.980]   He'll be here any minute now.
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.780]   I'll tell you what, if he makes it by the end of the show,
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.180]   I'll put him on.
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:08.980]   That's a deal.
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.980]   That's my promise to you.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.260]   Before we go on, I want to thank our friends at Carbonite.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.140]   They do a great product.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.820]   You've heard about the consumer version of Carbonite.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.500]   This is an online backup.
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.660]   That is just fantastic.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.340]   Does everything right?
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.740]   It's automatic.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.100]   Encrypts 128-bit SSL.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.340]   Whenever you're online, even if it's at a Starbucks or an open
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.100]   access spot, you are safely encrypted, sending your data up
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.140]   to the cloud where you can retrieve it anytime.
[00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.380]   If that laptop gets stolen, the hard drive dies,
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.420]   even if you accidentally delete a file,
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.180]   you just log on with any computer to your Carbonite account.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.740]   There's your data.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.740]   They have a free iPhone app, a free BlackBerry app.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.860]   Well, Carbonite found out a lot of people
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.660]   were using this in business.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.340]   And the consumer version, they were buying an account for
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.580]   everybody in the office.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:53.540]   Now, that's cookie.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.300]   So they said, look, we're going to do a business version.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.140]   This is CarbonitePro.com for small businesses.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.580]   Same great Carbonite automatic backup.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.540]   128-bit SSL.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.940]   You get triple deaths or blowfish encryption.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.820]   If you want complete privacy, this is good for a law
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.220]   office, a doctor's office, anywhere where you have to
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.100]   secure this data.
[00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:12.820]   But here's the cool part.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.980]   One account, no charge for the number of users.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.340]   You could have 1,000 users.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.380]   You only pay for the data you use.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.420]   And it starts at $10 a month.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.900]   The single most--
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.780]   I've looked at them all, most affordable way to back up
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.220]   your business.
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:27.820]   For $10 a month, you get 20 gigs.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.580]   So you could have 10 users, two gigs each.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.300]   That's pretty typical.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.060]   $10 a month.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.500]   I want you to go to CarbonitePro.com.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.300]   You could try it right now.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.100]   30 days free.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:37.220]   They've got the price list there.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.020]   Everything you need to know.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.140]   Software for CarbonitePro is Windows only.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.540]   Carbonite Consumer Windows and Mac.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.740]   And I am told they're working on a good Mac version for
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.740]   business.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.020]   Frankly, most business computers are Windows, so this
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:48.900]   works fine.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.460]   CarbonitePro.com, a central dashboard, so you know
[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.300]   exactly the status of all your systems.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.740]   Your users can restore there, by the way.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.700]   This was always the embarrassing thing if you got the
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   big presentation that afternoon and you accidentally
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.100]   delete the PowerPoint.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.340]   Then you have to do the perp walk down the hall to IT.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.380]   And pray they're there.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.580]   Please, will you restore my spreadsheet?
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.100]   I need that PowerPoint back.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.140]   Well, you don't have to do that, because they'll do.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.220]   They control it themselves.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.340]   CarbonitePro.com.
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, Andrew Barret and now, so you're
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.100]   sitting over here, Andrew.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.780]   That's your seat right there.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.140]   Just in time, Andrew.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:26.620]   All right.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.380]   Where's your movember?
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:30.860]   I'm in watching your mustache grow.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:31.620]   It's gone.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.820]   Here, pull that microphone right up to your mouth there.
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:34.820]   All right.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.060]   Unlike-- and point it at yourself.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.540]   Really aim it at your mouth.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.340]   All right.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.420]   Hey.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.740]   So how-- did you run into a little traffic on the way?
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:48.740]   This has been an incredible experience not knowing much
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:50.780]   about driving around in California.
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.820]   Certainly can't go based on minutes per mile.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.620]   You didn't use Google, did you?
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:57.140]   No.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:57.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.660]   And yeah, just also a little unfamiliar with the
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.700]   science cause of you.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.700]   I'm glad you made it.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.300]   Few issues, thank you.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.540]   And by the way, we call that bridge the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.060]   Not the San Francisco Bridge.
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:08.660]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:12.140]   Well, I'm just a long story, but anyway, not working.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:12.900]   I'm just teasing you.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.940]   It's great to see you.
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.540]   Rocketboom.com.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.300]   We talked to you last time.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.780]   We talked about mag.ma, magma.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.700]   And we were just talking as a show began about your internet
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.580]   memes.
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.020]   Oh, cool.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:23.820]   That is hot.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.460]   Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.700]   That's the biggest site now, isn't it?
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.780]   It's the biggest one we have.
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.740]   Pull that right up to you.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.300]   You got to talk right into that thing.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.540]   Because like this, I'll kiss it.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.460]   Come on, right in there.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.380]   So you can tell Andrew's a TV producer.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.020]   So what do you mean?
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.620]   I can't put a microphone in front of my face.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.300]   You won't be able to see me.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.260]   No, that's what we do here.
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.860]   Think of it as radio, Andrew.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:48.020]   Last time Andrew was on the infamous TWIT57.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.540]   Do you remember that?
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:49.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:49.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.820]   That was caused quite some drama.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:55.060]   In the Apple Store, you and Jason got into it.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.540]   That was fun.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.700]   And it was especially a situation where none of us who
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:02.860]   were there on the program could hear.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.740]   No, that was the problem.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.380]   It was my fault.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:05.820]   And I take full blame for it.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:06.660]   I still do.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.140]   Because we were in an Apple Store
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:09.700]   and we didn't provide headphones.
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.140]   And so nobody could hear what was going on.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.340]   It was really noisy.
[00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.860]   Everybody was talking to one's.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.500]   You don't put Robert Scoble and Jason Calicanis
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.060]   in the same room and then expect anybody else
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.020]   to get a word in edgewise.
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:19.780]   It was just crazy.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.260]   It was kind of a gong show.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:21.860]   It was a gong show.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:22.820]   And Amber was there.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:23.740]   I was.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.380]   Hi, Andrew.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.260]   Welcome to the show.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:25.900]   All right.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.740]   I know you know Amber well.
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.820]   So we've already talked about a number of big stories,
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.140]   but we still have many more.
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:34.620]   So we're not done yet.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.100]   Great.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:35.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.380]   It's really nice to have you here.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:41.780]   And we won't mention Twitch 57, Amber again.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.260]   This is Twitch 276.
[00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:44.700]   Wow.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.300]   So it was a while ago.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.300]   We can live that down.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.900]   You know what you're doing now.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   Yeah, we figured it out.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.620]   We'll give you headphones now.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.020]   What would you say is the biggest difference
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.060]   between then and now?
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:57.980]   Just in a--
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.300]   Before the show was beginning, we played a little bit of Twitch
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:02.500]   57.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.100]   And actually, there wasn't that much difference.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.180]   It's still the whole premise of Twitch
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:10.020]   was just good friends who are really interested in tech,
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.420]   getting together, BSing.
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:18.060]   Basically, we don't make any pretense to any sort of authority,
[00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.660]   BSing about the tech stories.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.220]   And in a way, it works best that way,
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.940]   because nobody feels pressured to say something deep
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.580]   or profound.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.060]   And it's a great conversation.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.500]   I always think of it as something you, people who listen,
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.140]   would feel like they're a part of.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.620]   Like they're sitting around the table with us talking.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.300]   Yeah, well, actually on that note, I would say, even up
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:42.580]   until today, every time when I describe Twitch to people,
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:47.100]   the first thing I always say is that Leo has the largest
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.740]   audience that I've ever seen that is a participatory audience.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:52.140]   They are, aren't they?
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.260]   I mean, the amount of--
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.180]   If you just look at the chat room and all the stuff going on--
[00:49:56.180 --> 00:50:00.380]   And just how much everybody's into it,
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.140]   I think that's one of the most incredible qualities
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.660]   about Twitch that has really gone--
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.820]   I don't know how you did it, but I mean, it goes--
[00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:09.020]   or how you do it, continues to be--
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.700]   Well, it's not me, because it's the audience.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.260]   It really is.
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.220]   And it's just--
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.620]   It's doing what they want.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.860]   So they tell me what they want.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.860]   Well, you're watching it.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:16.860]   It's fun.
[00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:17.360]   Great.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.140]   This is the first time here.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:18.780]   Welcome.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.380]   Thanks.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.620]   Yes.
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.980]   The all of it.
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:22.980]   Amber hasn't been here.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.260]   The last time Amber was here was an empty room.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:25.660]   It was.
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.860]   It was a small room, Leo.
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.700]   And I know you had high hopes.
[00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.180]   And I can't believe what you've built now.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:30.940]   It's amazing.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.180]   Every time I go to the Twitch site,
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.420]   I see all of the different shows,
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:35.820]   there must be more than 20 now, for sure.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:36.300]   Right.
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.900]   Well, the most important changes that we now
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.180]   have other anchors is not just me.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:44.620]   So Tom Merritt and Sarah Lane and Becky Worley,
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.100]   we have some really good hosts, and we're
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.020]   adding more all the time.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.900]   And that's going to make the biggest difference of all.
[00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.700]   So I kept the TV stories till you got here.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.540]   Oh, OK.
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.060]   Number one, Google TV.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.420]   Is it in trouble, according to TechCrunch,
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:59.860]   Sony is now cutting 25% off its Blu-ray units with Google TV.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.300]   I have to say, I have a Logitech review.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.180]   You probably do too, right, Dwight?
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.380]   No, I haven't gotten one yet.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.140]   I've asked for one.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.180]   I haven't been sent one yet.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.180]   Highly underwhelmed.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.580]   And it doesn't help that ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, and Hulu
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.380]   all blocked their content from it.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.380]   What are you going to watch?
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.380]   The reviews have not been kind, either for it or the Sony
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.180]   version.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:21.780]   No.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:22.980]   Too hard to use.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:28.260]   Too hard to use and with minimal amount of content
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.500]   that the masses want to see, it's not a real compelling product
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.460]   yet.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:39.180]   And yet, I have to say, the promise of it is great.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.100]   I mean, if it's Android, right, if you could put--
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:44.820]   oh, this is the thing that got me
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.980]   both Apple TV and Google TV.
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.300]   Just give us the marketplace.
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:51.260]   Let us install apps on this stuff.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.300]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:54.300]   That's what made the iPhone.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.100]   That's what makes-- imagine an Android phone with no apps.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:59.580]   And iPhone with no apps, you'd have the same lousy reviews,
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.460]   wouldn't you?
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.780]   You know, I think the thing that's
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.140]   interesting about all of--
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.500]   like the first thing I've noticed about all of the TV over IP
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:13.740]   boxes, whether it's Boxy, Apple TV, Google TV,
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:17.500]   it seems like every single one, when you turn it on,
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.620]   then you've got to figure out a bunch of stuff
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.860]   to start watching when you want to watch.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.620]   I mean, the first thing that happens,
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.940]   you plug in the Boxy box, you've got half an hour of updates.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.140]   Same thing with Google.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.020]   But even then, once you get it all set up,
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.580]   you still have to sit there and flick.
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.540]   Usually, people like to just turn on the TV
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.220]   and just start watching.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.500]   And nobody's provided that experience yet.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.540]   First of all, as an internet TV mogul,
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.740]   do you watch TV at all anymore?
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:41.620]   Still don't.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.620]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.420]   You're a bad person to ask, really.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.740]   You're not even interested in the competition, huh?
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.500]   Well, no, actually, I mean, I went through a long period of time
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.660]   where I was interested in sort of having
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:03.340]   a pure sense of influence, or I'd like to be influenced
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:04.740]   by other things other than TV.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.420]   Oh, you didn't want that influence.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:06.980]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.460]   Just to try to keep the fresh ideas.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.220]   But yeah, I'm very interested in like to see little clips
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.860]   and the highlights.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.660]   Right.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.700]   Yeah, I feel the same way.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.740]   It's funny because I don't even know why I have cable,
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:20.500]   because I never watch it.
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.820]   Because even Saturday Night Live or any programs like that,
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:25.860]   I just wait for it to show up very quickly on YouTube
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.740]   or another video sharing site.
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.460]   Because the reality is I'm not going to sit through many programs.
[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.020]   And if I do, I have my laptop in front of me.
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.300]   And then after five minutes, I lose interest
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.340]   in what's happening on the show.
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.580]   Well, that's just because we're ADD.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.100]   We are--
[00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:40.100]   Let's face it.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.100]   We're all victim.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.580]   I don't know if we were born this way,
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.020]   and that's why we do so well in the milieu.
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:47.620]   Or the milieu has influenced us and turned
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.980]   us into short attention span people.
[00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:52.020]   It's very hard, which came first.
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:56.380]   But none of us have the attention span to consume TV anymore.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.420]   I swear to God.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.540]   I have to have something in front.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:01.460]   Maybe this is the promise of Google TV
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.860]   was that maybe you could do both.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:03.820]   You'd have picture in picture.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.020]   You could Twitter.
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:07.460]   But it's not well designed.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.820]   It has to be a lot simpler than it is.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:13.180]   And the Twitter bot is too big and the TV is too small.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.700]   I mean, it just doesn't work.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.500]   When you hear the idea of, oh, I can search for television
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.620]   for what I want to watch, that sounds like a good idea
[00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.260]   in theory.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.780]   But then what that means is you have
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.460]   to put a keyboard in front of you.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:32.020]   And you have to be-- or you could use a ridiculous remote
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.460]   control where you kind of--
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:38.180]   where you mouse through the letters that you want.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.300]   People just don't like that.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.860]   People just want to sit back and relax.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.740]   The closest one I've seen to it that does that is Roku.
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:46.700]   I love Roku.
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.100]   That's my choice.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.740]   Yes, which is based-- that uses the channel metaphor.
[00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:54.660]   You just move the cursor through a series of boxes
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.100]   that represent channels.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.620]   And once you go into the channel,
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.900]   you just choose what you want to see.
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.460]   It's very simple.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.900]   It doesn't have a lot of choice and not a lot of high-end choice.
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.540]   But as a kind of a supplement for TV, it's great.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.500]   You know, the only thing wrong with Roku and the advantage
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:13.100]   maybe Boxy has is it won't play your content.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.260]   So the Roku box is everybody on the internet.
[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:18.340]   But if you have content on your computer or your servers
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.220]   or stuff, that's no good for that.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.900]   Yeah, and that's a big missing component.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.460]   Right.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.420]   I think so.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.180]   Although-- no, wait a minute though.
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:33.220]   I mean, Rocket Boom was one of the early shows
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:36.260]   that I would guess you had more people watching streaming
[00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.020]   than downloading.
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.580]   No, actually, we were always--
[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.580]   More downloaded?
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.660]   OK, we've always been that way too.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:46.100]   It's been my hope, my great dream, that it would flip.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.340]   It's about 80% download, 20% live.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.100]   It's still?
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.420]   OK, so we've definitely flipped.
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:52.180]   You have.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.420]   We're way on the-- I mean, people consume it mostly
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.860]   through Flash video now.
[00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.540]   Yeah, OK.
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.540]   So isn't that the future?
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:55:59.620]   So who cares if it's stored?
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:01.100]   Who cares if you could see the stored video?
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.700]   Don't you just want to see what's playing?
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.500]   Well, that actually brings up another thing
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.340]   that all of the boxes are kind of missing.
[00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.340]   Is that--
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:10.100]   Go Flash.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.380]   But also, what about your collection?
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.100]   We're humans, and we like to collect.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.260]   People have had collections of DVDs,
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.980]   even if it's only 20 or 30.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.900]   And on your goot, if you-- like on Apple,
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.620]   it doesn't store anything.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:28.260]   And so how are you supposed to keep
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:32.020]   track of the movies and the video clips and the TV
[00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.260]   programs that you've watched?
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.580]   Netflix thinks you don't want media.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.100]   Netflix is now offering-- and I think
[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:39.260]   this is where Netflix is going.
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:42.020]   This is actually one of the stories.
[00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:46.500]   They're now offering a $7.99 a month plan that's just instant.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.060]   No DVDs.
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.620]   And they raised their DVD account by a buck.
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.940]   Doesn't it sound like they're pushing towards streaming only?
[00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.580]   In fact, I know Hollywood would prefer that,
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.980]   because there's no risk of piracy.
[00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:58.320]   Sure.
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.860]   Well, streaming still can work even without--
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.300]   you don't actually need to store it,
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:04.260]   but you still would like a mechanism
[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.900]   to be able to bookmark it.
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.660]   Or maybe a law-class style mechanism
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.740]   where it knows what you own.
[00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.780]   It'll stream it for you, but you don't have to store it.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.300]   Yeah, you just need the tags.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:14.800]   Right.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:17.580]   It's actually like, here's my collection of videos
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.940]   that I like, but I don't store them here.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.140]   I just know how to click to get them, kind of.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:22.620]   Right.
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:24.420]   Well, Netflix has that with its queue.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.660]   Gives you your instant queue.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.460]   You could queue up movies.
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.020]   And you don't have to necessarily--
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.860]   they're not queued up for you just to watch.
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.140]   But that's how I use it.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:37.020]   I have probably about 20 or 30 in my instant queue.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.340]   And those are kind of my movies, the ones I like.
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.700]   I notice I very rarely--
[00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:45.780]   I mean, I have that documentary that I got on disk five months
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:48.580]   ago is collecting dust under the TV from Netflix.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.860]   But I very rarely watch those physical discs.
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:52.500]   They were sitting there for months.
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.620]   So I'm going to immediately do the 799 thing.
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:56.860]   Well, I don't think that the queue is really--
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.940]   I mean, you're just hijacking the queue
[00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:00.260]   to use for that purpose.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:03.580]   Because typically, the queue is just kind of a dump
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.260]   of all the stuff that you think you're going to want to watch.
[00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.540]   But then when you're done with it,
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.100]   you want to kind of take it out of the queue.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.740]   And then it just goes away forever.
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.940]   Well, there's about 20 movies that I probably--
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.740]   that I have in there that I would come back to.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.780]   I hate to admit this.
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.180]   Well, no, actually, I'm proud of it.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.180]   What?
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:22.660]   What's your guilty pleasure?
[00:58:22.660 --> 00:58:24.140]   Can you organize them?
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.780]   Can you organize them based on titles and categories?
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:28.300]   No.
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.580]   No, it doesn't give you that.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.420]   But I sure wish it would.
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.980]   So what is the movie that you want to see over and over again,
[00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:34.780]   do I?
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:35.260]   Dead Snow.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:36.620]   Dead Snow.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.460]   Dead Snow.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.700]   Zombie Nazis.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:41.700]   Zombie Nazis.
[00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:43.060]   It's a great movie.
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.660]   What is the appeal of zombies?
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:46.020]   Would somebody explain that?
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:46.220]   What?
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.660]   How did zombies--
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:50.300]   how did zombies get so big in the--
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.700]   and it's geeks.
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:53.780]   You go to a Jonathan Colton concert.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.420]   Everybody's dressed up as a zombie.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.900]   I wonder if it's Michael Jackson's thriller that--
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:59.780]   Oh, you guys grew up on Thriller.
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.500]   That's what you used.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:03.900]   It's a big group activity to kind of redo that.
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:04.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.060]   We have zombie walks in Toronto that are really popular.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:08.860]   I hate to say that.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.220]   You know, funny thing is about Netflix.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.220]   I don't know if you guys know this,
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.780]   but it's really not that popular in Canada.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:15.140]   It actually just launched here this fall.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.860]   And it was a big bust when they launched.
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.540]   They actually hired a bunch of actors
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.380]   to go down to their launch party and pretend
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.580]   that they were Netflix fans who got interviewed
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.660]   by some of the major media outlets in the city.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.380]   So that was their number one problem.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.940]   It was uncovered that they actually hired actors
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.060]   who were interviewed by journalists.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.860]   Second thing is we have hardly any content.
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.460]   So people were so excited about it.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:37.900]   I don't know if you realize this in the US,
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:39.540]   but in most places, I mean, you're talking--
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.980]   oh, I love zombie movies.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:44.780]   I mean, we get nothing when it comes to some of these providers.
[00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:46.220]   Definitely not zombie movies.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.900]   No zombies.
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.660]   No zombies are any other major television shows
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.620]   that people want, so they just have kind of fallen flat.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:54.740]   That's interesting.
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.700]   Apparently, it's not a twist unless we mention Hitler or Nazis.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.540]   Zombies.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.780]   Which we've done both, by the way.
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.660]   In fact, we combined them felicitously.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:08.340]   Thank you, Dwight, for Nazi zombies.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.580]   All that remains gets--
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.300]   it's actually the report corollary to Godwin's law.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.340]   Godwin's law said that every conversation eventually
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.380]   devolves into calling-- somebody calling somebody else
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:21.180]   Nazis.
[01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.580]   We eat Nazi zombies.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.220]   And then we have to, at some point, mention jumping the shark.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.740]   And then we'll be done.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.100]   Then we can go home.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:28.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.420]   Well, Amber--
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:29.820]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:31.020]   Good night.
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.780]   Amber, are you saying that Netflix is jumping the shark
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.220]   in Canada?
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:36.820]   Pretty much.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.100]   And they've fallen, and there's no zombie movies here on it.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.860]   So that's pretty much the sum up situation here.
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.060]   It's not good.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.460]   It's not a popular service at all.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.260]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.820]   And do you think that has to do with a streaming,
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:50.380]   or just lack of awareness?
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.700]   It's just a lack of content.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.140]   It's the same thing in iTunes.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.660]   You may think, OK, I want to go to iTunes
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.580]   and get a new movie that just came out.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.740]   And for us and many other countries around the world,
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.020]   you go to try to do it, and you just can't get it.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.260]   So the content is crap, and there's a lot of Canadian content.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.540]   And with all due respect to many producer friends
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.180]   that I have, some Canadian content is just weird and not
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:10.980]   that great.
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.380]   And so there's just a lack of quality.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:16.300]   And I think, again, getting back to the point
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.700]   where I said that Canada is one of the leading countries
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.020]   as far as pirating, that would be one of the reasons.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.620]   Well, and I think it's just a matter of time.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.260]   I mean, initially in the US, streaming Netflix wasn't
[01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.540]   so compelling and had a--
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.420]   it was all crap zombie movies.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.620]   But now, I would say almost everything
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.940]   is going to eventually be streaming.
[01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.980]   And I think we're getting rapidly to that.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   And I mean, the reports have been coming out
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.740]   about the success that Netflix has been having in America.
[01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.180]   It's insane.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.060]   I mean, I've been hearing that they're actually using
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:48.860]   as much as like 30% of all of the bandwidth.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:49.820]   During prime time.
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:50.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:51.820]   Wow.
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.980]   That's massive of all in America, all bandwidth.
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.460]   Yep.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:58.340]   And now they've got the TV programs in addition to movies.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.860]   And in fact, you know what?
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:04.140]   I think maybe Netflix is essentially right now the killer
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.740]   app that makes mom and dad want to buy an Apple TV
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.140]   or something that allows them.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.540]   All they want to do is just have just Netflix.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.540]   That's got to be why Apple TV sold so well,
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.620]   because I don't think it's the iTunes rentals.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.860]   It's got to be Netflix.
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:22.700]   And Roku, all the advertisements I see is says Roku,
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.260]   plus Netflix equals what you want.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.180]   It's about Netflix.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.380]   And that's why-- but I think that's why we like Netflix,
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:28.900]   right?
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.620]   I mean, Roku is because you get Netflix,
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.540]   but you also get Amazon.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.540]   You get all these extra channels.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.540]   There's a lot.
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.540]   You get Twit.
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:35.900]   Now, Foxy.
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.900]   The other night, I wanted to see Scott Pilgrim versus the world.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.580]   We have Uverse.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.020]   And I couldn't make it play on Uverse.
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.540]   They're having technical issues.
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.340]   So I used my Roku and went over to Amazon
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.620]   and rented it through Amazon.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:50.700]   And it was actually $2 cheaper to Amazon
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.740]   than if I had gotten it through Uverse.
[01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:54.660]   That's a great deal.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.100]   That's all.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.060]   That's great value.
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:58.740]   You see, the other thing, Andrew, about Netflix,
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:01.340]   is Netflix is really smart because it's making apps
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.340]   for every device.
[01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:08.820]   And putting Netflix on the iPad, on the iPhone
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.380]   is a really smart move.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.780]   I love watching a streaming video on my iPad.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.540]   That's just being able to sit back and hold that right
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.620]   in my face on a chair.
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.540]   I do that a lot.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:23.620]   They won't put it on Android, though, because they say it's not--
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:24.620]   there's no DRM.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.060]   It's not secure enough.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:31.660]   Well, the other thing is maybe Netflix is essentially
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.700]   the killer app operating system in a way
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.380]   that all of the boxes are needing.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:40.980]   And it's the layer on top of the boxes.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.500]   In other words, whatever box you have,
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:44.700]   if you can get Netflix on it, just open it up,
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.820]   go to Netflix, and then do everything you want from there.
[01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:50.140]   Which makes me question Hulu's strategy, because they could--
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.020]   in fact, this is what Mark Cuban said a couple of weeks ago
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:56.180]   in his blog, is Hulu blocking, the networks blocking.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:59.220]   All they're doing is opening a bigger path for Netflix
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:01.980]   to come swoop in and say, that's fine.
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.860]   Well-own streaming, no problem.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:05.420]   We'll take it.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.380]   And with the international issue, as Amber just pointed out,
[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:12.980]   I mean, it's ridiculous and sad to see the lack of content
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.580]   going around the world.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.500]   Well, and this is why, frankly, Andrew, you have an advantage.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.620]   I have an advantage.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.420]   Because we have a new model that's not
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.500]   based on regions or countries.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.660]   We want everybody.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.820]   We don't care where they come from.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:26.580]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.540]   Although, I don't know about you, but many of our advertisers--
[01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.260]   we're slowly shifting that.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.900]   Pay only for US downloads.
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.620]   We're shifting that.
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.700]   That's starting to change.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.940]   Yeah, and also it just depends on what kind of advertisers
[01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:41.700]   you're working with.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.700]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.580]   Ford wants the global audience.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.580]   They pay for the full audience.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.340]   It's-- don't tell them this.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.460]   But if you're a smart advertiser, you say, I want you--
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.780]   something like Audibles, I want you,
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.620]   it's only that you're going to get everybody else.
[01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.420]   And if you do business and all these other companies--
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:57.860]   Yeah, that's--
[01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.220]   But I understand the issue because advertising agencies
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:06.020]   at Bastor National, there's no global advertising.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:11.180]   Every country has an advertising budget for that unit.
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.860]   How are they going to pay--
[01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.380]   I don't even understand how Ford does it because--
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.260]   I mean, do they make money off sales in Europe?
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.820]   I guess they must figure they do.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.900]   Sure.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.340]   I mean, they do ultimately.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.740]   But does the agency benefit from-- I guess they do?
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.020]   I think what is happening is I think corporate's directing
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:26.660]   this.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.980]   It's coming out of the corporate office--
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.500]   And they're evolving.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.620]   Yes, they're evolving.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:31.540]   And making it happen.
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.580]   Good news for us.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.860]   Because that's a really-- I think that's a real advantage
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:39.340]   that internet broadcasters have over more traditional broadcasters.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.540]   Leo does the issue with Audible only buying US
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.180]   have anything to do with US rights for some of their audio.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:49.220]   Yeah, well-- and by the way, I was using them as an example.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.020]   And I'm not sure if they pay for--
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.740]   I believe they only pay for US words.
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.540]   Partly that's because they've been with us for four years.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:57.780]   They're kind of grandfathered in.
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:01.620]   But they-- I mean Audible UK, Audible Australia,
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.620]   they sell those companies get new cut subscribers
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.220]   and they make money based on the ads they hear on Twitter.
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.020]   30% of our audience is outside the US,
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.180]   is in Canada, Australia, England.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:11.180]   Wow.
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.060]   Of Scandinavia.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.460]   Oh, yeah, 30%.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.060]   Wow, that's significant.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:18.700]   Yes, so when I do an ad that I only get paid for US,
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.780]   I get basically a 30% discount.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.220]   Because I can't have it figured out
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.540]   how to have different versions for different countries.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.300]   That's too complicated for me.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.100]   Moving along.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:32.860]   What do you think of Connect?
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.340]   Let's talk a little bit about Microsoft Connect.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.940]   Because it's been out for a few weeks now.
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.100]   Any of you use it?
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.100]   I've got it.
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:38.620]   Connect.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.900]   Do you have it?
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:40.780]   What do you think?
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.780]   In other words, Mike, my real question is,
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.260]   does it have legs?
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.580]   I think it does, particularly for younger people, for kids.
[01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.980]   With me, it's kind of like I'm so out of shape
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.700]   that it's hard for me to play for a couple of years.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.860]   You'll get off your duff and start dancing, Dwight.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.820]   But the games are really good.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:01.100]   They're fun.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.300]   The games are very similar to the Wii.
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:04.940]   The games that first came out with the Wii.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.740]   But I think Wii does not have legs.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:10.660]   I guess what I am implying here is that people get tired of the Wii.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.460]   Nintendo will do what Microsoft has done.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.460]   They'll take away the controller.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.020]   They'll do their own version of that.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.580]   So the Wii is kind of a transitional product.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:20.740]   I think Microsoft has it.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.020]   I think it's still a 1.0 product.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:26.620]   But the nice thing is, is that it's very software-upgradable.
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:29.020]   And so they can refine and fix a lot of the glitches
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.220]   and deal with the-- there's a little bit of lag in it.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.340]   And I think they can fix that with software.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:36.380]   So yeah, I think it has legs long term.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.260]   I have to say, I like it.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.540]   You like it, Amber?
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:39.620]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.020]   I mean, I have the same issue with Connect's idea
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:42.900]   with watching television.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.820]   I just find playing games, watching TV.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:48.540]   I know obviously playing video games is more interactive.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.260]   But I just find it something I get a little bit bored.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.900]   I guess I like the idea of sitting with my computer,
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:56.060]   being productive, creating content, those type of things.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:57.780]   So I've never been a big gamer.
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.700]   However, I will say that it's fun.
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.420]   I did a demo of it on my TV show here, WebNation.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:03.620]   And I really enjoyed it.
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:04.820]   It's fun, isn't it?
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:05.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:06.980]   There's no barrier to entry.
[01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.860]   It's not like the average person can't get up
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:10.220]   and understand how it works, which I think
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.980]   is an issue with a lot of video games
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.940]   to get that the family market involved.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:17.060]   So I do think they kind of have a hit on their hands.
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:17.540]   Right.
[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.460]   Right.
[01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.820]   Rupert Murdoch says, we're going to do an iPad newspaper.
[01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.620]   The Daily, iPad--
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:28.500]   Yes, you're chuckling Dwight.
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.220]   Keep reading Leo.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:36.860]   He says, we're going to hire six techs and 100 journalists
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.900]   for a national newspaper.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.980]   It'll be $0.99 a week.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:46.340]   iPad only, not updated by the hour, not updated every eight
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:50.260]   hours, updated once a day, just like an old school newspaper.
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:51.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.460]   We talked about this on Twig.
[01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.820]   Jeff Jarvis's immediate reaction was, that's not enough.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.900]   Not enough journalists to do a newspaper.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.100]   How big is the newsroom at the Chronicle?
[01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:04.540]   You know, I don't know post our most recent layoffs.
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.180]   I think maybe about 200 to 300--
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.500]   200 to three times bigger.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.180]   And that's for you.
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:10.980]   Huge times bigger for this.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.220]   Now, according to-- if you're doing it right in terms
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:19.100]   of combining aggregation as well as reporting,
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.540]   you might be able to get away with that.
[01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.660]   If you're limited in your scope, what I'm more concerned about
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:28.700]   is the fact that he's kind of taking the square peg of the old
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.100]   newspaper and forcing it into the round hole of an iPad app.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.100]   And you're surprised?
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.580]   It's Rupert freaking Murdoch.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.420]   Well, but he's not a dumb guy.
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:42.020]   And he's got people who are advising him.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.260]   I mean, he needs to have some kind of social aspect, which
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.900]   it may have when it actually launches.
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:47.740]   Yeah, we don't know.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.780]   I mean, this is all speculation.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:52.100]   But it needs to have some kind of social aspect.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.460]   It needs to update constantly.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:57.740]   I mean, I am not going to just pick this thing up and read it
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.180]   in the morning and be done with it.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:01.220]   I want to go back to it.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.540]   And it needs to be my lifelong to the news all day long
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.420]   if it's going to be a hit.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:10.580]   And you have to be able to share the content in it
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.700]   with other people.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.740]   So you need to be able to send links out to your friends
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:18.820]   if it's a wall garden, which is as it's described,
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.300]   that's not going to happen.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.660]   So I think the market for--
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.780]   we'll probably get a lot of interest right at first,
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:30.460]   but as people use it and see that it's very limited in scope,
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:34.260]   I think it'll probably drop off and be a very much
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.020]   a niche product.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.700]   I could see Bob for 99 cents a week if it's a good pay.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.660]   If it's well written, I might buy it.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.940]   Do you guys know of any really good newspaper apps
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:43.660]   on the iPad though?
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.660]   Because I know the Globe Mail in Canada, for example,
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.380]   has an iPad app, but it's really limited
[01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:48.140]   as far as the content.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.060]   And they're just kind of throwing the content there.
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.500]   Like it seems like they could be possibly doing
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.220]   the situation.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.620]   Is there a great example of it?
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.100]   Well, USA Today is pretty good.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.380]   USA Today app is good.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:01.140]   Also, the newer version of the New York Times--
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.780]   I like the New York Times.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.180]   Because it's a full New York-- it's not select anymore.
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.780]   But it's free temporarily.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.060]   Early next year, they're going to start charging for it,
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:09.980]   which is interesting.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.540]   Washington Post is also doing, again, free for now,
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:16.660]   but soon to be paid version of--
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.860]   you know what the best one is?
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:18.420]   Is the journal.
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.140]   Now you have to pay for it.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.140]   But I think the Wall Street Journal does a very good--
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:26.820]   basically, it's the print edition of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.980]   I mean, it's not updated past the daily updates.
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:33.660]   But I would rather read this on an iPad than the paper one.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.140]   The irony of this is I called them up
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:40.260]   and you can buy the electronic-only version,
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:44.180]   but it costs more than buying the print plus electronic version.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.020]   Right.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:47.220]   I don't get that.
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.660]   So I get the print version and I recycle it.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:53.380]   To me, the best online newspaper-- and I'm
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:56.940]   a newspaper in air quotes--
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:58.780]   is Flipboard.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.140]   Really?
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:11:59.700]   You think so?
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.940]   Flipboard is the way an online newspaper should be.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:07.580]   It is-- it's still kind of clunky and the design
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:08.740]   doesn't always work.
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.420]   And I hate the intermediate step where it blows up a story
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.460]   and then you have to go off to the website.
[01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.300]   I wish you could just take me to the web.
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:21.100]   But in terms of-- I use this to read the news.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.620]   This is how I read the news is.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.540]   And what it's doing is kind of interesting, basically,
[01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.460]   except for the Facebook page.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:31.060]   It's aggregating Twitter feeds and just finding the links
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:35.180]   in the Twitter feeds and then making a kind of a magazine out
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:35.820]   of it.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.500]   So even when it says the economist, it's not actually
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.020]   the economist.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.300]   It's whatever the economist puts on its Twitter feed.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:41.620]   Right.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:45.700]   And what I do is I take the people I follow
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.060]   and I've got them sorted into lists.
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:52.740]   And so I have a technology list and a journalism list.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.660]   And I feel that--
[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:54.980]   You make your own in effect.
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:55.980]   I make my own.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:59.180]   And it's some of the smartest, most interesting things
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:02.100]   on the web organized in a very readable manner.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:04.500]   And that is the way I like to read.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.260]   This is Scobles Tech Influence.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.140]   I don't make my own list.
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.780]   I use Scobles Tech Influencers list.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:10.140]   And it is.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.660]   It's a very-- it's a good feed.
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.220]   Now, this has an advantage over Rupert.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:16.460]   For one thing, I don't pay anything for it.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:17.940]   It is updated constantly.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.420]   Well, it's really different because it's an aggregator
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.580]   as opposed to a content company.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.020]   But from the point of view of the user,
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:27.980]   is it in this--
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.100]   I mean, isn't this superior to anything Rupert and I actually
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.060]   use it?
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.540]   But what I keep finding is the way that it organizes it
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.380]   is really abstract.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:37.740]   Right.
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.820]   It kind of-- when I end up wanting--
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.140]   I like to go through the media that way.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.820]   But I only end up using it late at night
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.740]   when I'm like, mostly.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:48.740]   Exactly.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.580]   You're like, just show me some candy or something.
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.780]   I don't do research with it.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:54.700]   You're exactly right.
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.180]   It's for casual reading.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.260]   It's for sitting back.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.020]   It's like People magazine.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:13:59.420]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:13:59.940]   Right.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:13:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.860]   But you can provide order to it using Twitter lists.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.540]   That's kind of the way to do it so that you don't have just
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.300]   for tired Twitter feed, your entire Facebook feed.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.660]   Brank it down into lists just for this,
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.660]   and it works really well.
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.220]   Now, but this is essentially parasitic
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.700]   because Flipboard creates no content.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:21.140]   It's all other people's content.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.540]   Yeah, it's the aggregator of other stuff.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.740]   So don't we need people like Rupert Murdoch
[01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.820]   to create content so we can aggregate it?
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.540]   I mean, you won't be able to aggregate the daily
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:31.780]   because there's no outbound links.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:32.500]   Right.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.820]   Well, I think what's going to make the daily interest--
[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.180]   I mean, I agree with everybody's arguments
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.540]   that it's kind of not going to work for the reasons
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:43.620]   that we all have expectations that are higher than--
[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.220]   No, it is.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.940]   --we expect it's really going to be.
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.540]   It's the post-web world.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.260]   The web exists.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.500]   You can't take that back.
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:49.780]   Right.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.660]   But the thing that I think is--
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.500]   the first obvious point as to why something that--
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.620]   like that may not work is because most of the time
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.220]   when there's a news story, then everybody else
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.460]   jumps on the news story.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.980]   And then it's not a private information
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.460]   that you have to pay for.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.540]   And so I think the only way that it will work--
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.300]   and I assume that this is how they're going to go for it--
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.100]   is they're just going to have to compile the best
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:18.620]   journalists that actually really write
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.420]   some significant, unique articles.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.020]   They have to dig up and crack the stories.
[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.260]   Well, we were talking about the New York--
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.780]   you weren't here, but the New York Times article
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:30.340]   about this crazy guy is creating Google with decor in my eyes.
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.140]   I don't know if you saw it.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.700]   But that's an example of great reporting.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:37.460]   If Murdoch can find even 20 people that good,
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.300]   then it becomes a primary source and everybody will read it.
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.060]   It's a magazine.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:41.940]   Then it's the Atlantic.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:42.900]   Then it's the New Yorker.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:45.140]   Then it's a great magazine.
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.900]   But doesn't he do himself a disservice
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.220]   by not allowing outbound links?
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.500]   Because yeah, I now have to get the daily to read it.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.740]   That was his idea.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.380]   But there's no promoting of it.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.100]   We may never know that great story exists.
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:57.100]   Only the people who buy it.
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.460]   We will because as soon as somebody reads it,
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.140]   then they're going to write a version of it
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.380]   will end up in a tech meme.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.220]   They read it.
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:03.980]   That's what I was saying.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:04.460]   You just--
[01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.140]   I steal it.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.700]   Well, the important headlines--
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.740]   Just like the story you mentioned from The New York Times,
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.180]   we could all summarize that up even though it was like a nine
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:13.740]   page story.
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:14.740]   True.
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:15.260]   True.
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:19.140]   It was just like here's a guy who is terrible to his customers.
[01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.180]   And he's actually making that work
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:22.540]   because he's gaming, doogling, doogling.
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.540]   It's a good point.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.980]   At least on this show, we didn't need to give you
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.940]   an outbound link.
[01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:28.660]   And we talked enough about it that if somebody is interested,
[01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:30.740]   they will get the New York Times version of it and read it.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:31.740]   Yeah, you want to go get the whole thing.
[01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:32.980]   They'll get the benefit of it.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.620]   I do think that you get much more value, though,
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.860]   if somebody can embed a link in a Twitter stream
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.820]   and direct you to the traffic to your site.
[01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:40.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.980]   That's really much more valuable than having
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.460]   a closed walled garden on the iPad.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:48.060]   By the way, Oprah's favorite thing.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.860]   I watched that video.
[01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.980]   I didn't actually see the show, but it's so funny because I
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:54.460]   can't tell you how many of my girlfriends watch Oprah
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.420]   and saw that show.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.380]   And we're so excited to see her favorite things.
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.620]   But I watched the video that is in the article
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:01.660]   that you sent across.
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.860]   And I can't believe-- it's like some of her audience members
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.740]   are almost crying.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.420]   They were so excited to see it.
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.540]   That is her number one product.
[01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:10.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:13.500]   Her audience members are thrilled that she picked the iPad.
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.820]   They were just so excited.
[01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.820]   I can't believe how excited the audience was.
[01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:17.820]   Like, you've been watching--
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:19.980]   They're hopped up on methadrine or something.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:21.500]   I don't know.
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:22.700]   And she was so excited, too.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.460]   I was kind of freaked out because I'm thinking,
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.380]   I love the iPad.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.060]   It's fantastic.
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.100]   But it was really surreal.
[01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:31.940]   Oprah's number one favorite thing.
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:34.340]   This is somebody, by the way, taping off the TV.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:39.140]   So this is probably highly illegal, what I'm about to do here.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.020]   I mean, literally, you can hear this is taped off the TV.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:45.540]   It sounds like they got the microphone across.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.900]   I know it's wrong to be in love with a thing.
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:51.740]   And I don't normally recommend it.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.060]   But from our very first moment together,
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:57.100]   I knew it had stolen my heart.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.740]   Oh, please, Oprah.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.340]   She's just associating herself with the hottest thing
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:02.860]   on the market.
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:03.500]   You got it.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.500]   It's really--
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.700]   Leo, it comes-- you had-- I mean,
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.020]   I don't want it to make you watch that.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.900]   But actually, the iPad comes down in the studio
[01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.140]   with wings on it like an angel.
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.500]   And people go crazy.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.500]   I'm not kidding.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.340]   What are you talking about?
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.420]   Leo, I'm telling you.
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:17.940]   All right, let's watch it.
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.940]   All right, OK, I'm going to violate work.
[01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:21.140]   Oh, look at these people.
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.740]   They're over excited now.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.180]   Oh my god.
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:23.660]   There it is.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:24.700]   It has wings on it.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.260]   She's dancing around it.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:30.220]   It's like the Victoria's Secret models only.
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:31.420]   It's a thing.
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.180]   They're worshiping it.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:34.180]   Amber.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.180]   Amber, she could have said--
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.420]   Don't blame this on me because I'm not working.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:40.100]   She could have said a muffler and everybody in the audience
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.540]   would have gone crazy because they're so--
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.420]   You gotta understand.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.220]   Have you ever been to one of these shows, Amber,
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.860]   with the warm up and everything where they really get you going?
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.300]   Yeah, I have.
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.180]   These people are just happy to see Oprah.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.500]   They're not-- they don't care less what came down out of the raft.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.220]   It was just surreal, though, Leo.
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.820]   I mean, I watched the whole thing just
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.580]   so I had a sense of what was going on.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.660]   And the wings-- I don't know.
[01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:01.820]   It was just a bit dark.
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.180]   Let me tell you.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.620]   Look at this woman.
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:08.100]   They look like they just all won like 10 iPads.
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.100]   Well, in fact--
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:09.900]   She gets the iPad.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:11.780]   In fact, I think that's what happened
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:15.140]   is they said they realized they all got one.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:15.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:19.300]   So they were told ahead of the show, whatever Oprah picks,
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:24.460]   as her favorite thing, even if it's a muffler, you get it.
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:25.660]   That's why they're so excited.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:26.780]   They're getting an iPad.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.860]   Describe what I feel for this magnificent device.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:33.500]   I really think it's the best invention of the century so far.
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.500]   Wow.
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.460]   How many iPads is this going to sell?
[01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.220]   I know.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:37.860]   We got about two years to go.
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.780]   So what you going to do to top this?
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:40.340]   I don't know.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:45.660]   But thanks to my iPad, I now read about four newspapers a day.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.660]   I keep a journal on my iPad.
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:49.580]   That's who's buying the daily.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:50.660]   Right there.
[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.060]   And you miss where she actually promotes the new Oprah magazine
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:54.820]   on the iPad.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:55.820]   So it's just--
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:56.820]   Yeah, bye.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:57.340]   --you have four.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.060]   There it is.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.780]   There it is.
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.580]   You said once you want to be the next Rupert Murdoch, Andrew
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:03.180]   Barron.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:07.260]   You still want to be the next Rupert Murdoch?
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.620]   Well, did I say that?
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.540]   Yeah, I have it on tape.
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:12.420]   I have it on tape.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.900]   You told Jason Calicanis.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.180]   And he mocked you for it.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:15.700]   OK.
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.260]   But I think what you were really saying
[01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.340]   is that this--
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:19.660]   --have to be dreams.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:21.140]   Well, it's not just you.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.260]   It's our turn.
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.500]   I mean, me, I'm older than mud.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.900]   But it's your turn.
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:29.580]   It's the turn of the internet, isn't it?
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:34.380]   And the next Rupert Murdoch will not be a newspaper publisher.
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.780]   Or she will be an internet publisher.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:42.540]   Yeah, I mean, the whole idea is that both all of us here,
[01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:46.540]   actually, Amber, you, myself, our colleagues,
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.780]   we're all in this unique period of time
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:54.060]   where we're in a position where the likelihood of any of us
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:56.540]   becoming Rupert Murdoch is obviously very slim.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.580]   But we're all in a position to where
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:02.220]   we have a more realistic opportunity
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.460]   that probably has ever been before.
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:08.060]   And we're in the beginning of being positioned.
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.340]   So based on how we can make things work from here,
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:14.820]   it's kind of up to us to try to take hold
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:18.820]   of the opportunity that is clearly there.
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.260]   Not to be self-serving, but this is kind of like the Ernie
[01:21:21.260 --> 01:21:23.700]   Kovacs or the Milton Burl.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.460]   We're getting to invent a new medium.
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.140]   That's a little Charlie Chaplin-like.
[01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.940]   Yeah, he basically invented movies in many ways.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:32.420]   So yeah, I would agree with you on that.
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.340]   And who knows even--
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:36.700]   Not in the sense that we'll be as rich or as successful,
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.780]   but merely that we have an opportunity in a new medium.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.700]   They're more realistic than ever before.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.980]   Yes, I agree.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:48.260]   Acer announces Android and Windows tablets for 2011.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.820]   Talk about hedging your bets.
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.020]   Does anybody want a Windows tablet?
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:56.260]   Anybody, show of hands.
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.620]   Nobody.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.380]   I'm afraid to make.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.140]   Anybody?
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:02.820]   Although I'd be interested to see what would happen
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.820]   if you were to take the operating system on Windows Phone
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.500]   7 and do that as a tablet.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.300]   I like that.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.500]   And I bet you we will see that.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.660]   In fact, I think Microsoft's hinted
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.100]   that that's what's going to happen.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:15.460]   I think Windows Phone 7 is actually pretty great.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:19.980]   I think it's interesting that HP has been reluctant to send out
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:24.180]   to a lot of viewers their current Windows 7 tablet saying,
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:27.060]   oh, no, this is just for business and you cover consumer stuff.
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.340]   You don't want this.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:33.700]   Because I have not tried one, but I have seen video of one.
[01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.660]   And you know how in the iPad, when you take it
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.980]   and you turn it on its side, it automatically
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:44.500]   changes in its orientation very smoothly.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:48.420]   Apparently, when you turn a Windows 7 tablet,
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:51.980]   screen blanks and then reappears in the orientation,
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:53.860]   in the correct orientation.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.620]   And that's just-- that's kind of not the experience
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.980]   that I think people would--
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:00.380]   We're looking for here.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:03.660]   By the way, I just-- OK, a little plug here.
[01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.620]   This is the Samsung Focus.
[01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:07.940]   I got to go back to the home page.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:08.380]   Look at that.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.940]   There is the TWIT application.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.220]   Thanks to Dimitri.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.700]   Oh, there you go.
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.300]   Look at this.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:15.780]   Look at this.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.460]   Beautiful.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:18.660]   That just shows you that he wrote it incredible.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.740]   These are all the TWIT shows.
[01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.300]   Plays back the video.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.700]   We don't have live yet on here.
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.580]   I look forward to the time when we can put live video on here,
[01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.460]   which we can't already on the iPhone.
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.900]   But a really nice job.
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:31.900]   Thank you, Dimitri.
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.620]   And if that's free, if you have a Windows--
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:36.380]   if you wanted the 25,000 or whatever people
[01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.580]   was, it was a fun 7.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.740]   Have you carried this around at all, Dwight?
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.100]   Do you-- have you used it?
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.460]   Yeah, I don't have that one.
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.820]   I have the--
[01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:45.460]   This is a nice one.
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:48.620]   I have the HTC one, but yeah, I love it.
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.940]   And I have always liked the operating system that
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.820]   is inside the Zoom.
[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:54.980]   This is what it's based on.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.700]   It's basically the Zoom, yeah.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:00.260]   And even though people made fun of the early Zooms,
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.260]   the software, and it was pretty nice,
[01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:06.780]   and it continued to get good in the last Zoom, the Zoom HDs,
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:09.700]   are really nice to vice largely because of the software.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.860]   And so I'm glad to see that they've stuck with this for the phone.
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:14.620]   It's surprisingly good.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:19.060]   But the focus has a nice AMOLED, super AMOLED screen
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:19.780]   is all the sounds--
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.340]   That's beautiful.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.740]   Yeah, it's a really good screen.
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:25.420]   I'm curious as to whether Windows is going
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.660]   to make it in the long run.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:31.220]   And one of the biggest reasons I think they--
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:33.020]   one of the things I think they have going against them
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.220]   the most right now is that what we're talking about here,
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:39.580]   like we're excited about the apps, not the operating system.
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.260]   Yeah, who cares about the OS?
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.540]   But I think the reason why Windows may lose it
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:48.100]   is because there is one entity, kind of an entity that does care.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:53.780]   And that's the manufacturers who either have to license Windows
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:57.060]   and pay for Windows and kind of deal with it as it is,
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:00.780]   or to use a free version of Android.
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.140]   If you're going to ship a hardware,
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.540]   you may want to go with the free--
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:05.820]   Why pay for an OS?
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.460]   It's the appeal of Linux.
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:11.300]   And after all, Android is the most widely used version of Linux
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:11.780]   there is.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:15.260]   I wonder if Android is just going to wipe out--
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:18.420]   between Android and iOS, just wipe out Windows.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.580]   Interesting point of view.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.980]   I haven't really thought about that.
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.580]   Microsoft's got to be wondering.
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.420]   I think we got Windows for a little longer.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.460]   I mean, it's going to take a long time, of course,
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.660]   because there's so much business and so many people on it.
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:30.420]   I just wonder if--
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.460]   You know, Apple's clearly--
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.140]   --providing itself in some ways to be ready, at least,
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:36.420]   if people want to use iOS instead of OS 10.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.460]   I can't believe they haven't done it yet.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:42.500]   They must have a very strategic reason why.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.860]   Oh, I left out one thing.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:49.860]   Nazis, zombies jumping the shark, and Angry Birds.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:51.100]   Oh, of course.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:54.780]   Angry Birds Day, December 11, 2010.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:56.420]   Apparently, this is not to celebrate it,
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.860]   but to stop the madness.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:01.180]   Oh, no.
[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.540]   On this special occasion, we want to raise our concerns
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.540]   about the alarming levels of avian,
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.060]   porcine, aggression worldwide.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.820]   To our knowledge, at least three trillion
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:13.980]   piggies have been popped around the globe this year
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:17.460]   with millions of feathered foul lost in the process.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:20.780]   It's time to stop for a moment and think about the consequences.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:22.420]   PayPal.
[01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:24.820]   Angry Birds meetups around the world.
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.220]   There's not many games that get this kind of loyalty.
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:29.060]   It's crazy.
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:29.820]   I can't believe it.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:30.740]   You know, I have to say it.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:32.540]   I mentioned it before that I don't play games a lot,
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.900]   but this is one game that I can sit and sort of--
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.780]   you know, it's so easy to just pick up and just play
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.780]   for a little bit, right?
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:39.260]   Whoa.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:40.660]   I know it's not good.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.980]   Did I read correctly that somebody just
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:45.860]   said that there were actually 7 million downloads
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:47.140]   on Android for that?
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:47.980]   Yes, already.
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:48.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:49.340]   Free.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:50.740]   It's free on Android ad supported.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:53.540]   I bet they make tons more money because of the ads.
[01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.820]   Then they do on-- this will be a very good test of Android
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.980]   and whether you can make money on an Android application.
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.940]   And they do say they're going to do a Christmas version.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:01.780]   They did a Halloween version.
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.260]   And that the next version of Angry Birds
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.820]   will be Angry Pigs.
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.260]   They get their revenge.
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:09.620]   They're the next Rebert Murdoch, right?
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:11.220]   It's a small finished company.
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:11.620]   You know?
[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:12.300]   It's amazing.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:15.260]   Although also gaming is really picking up
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:16.660]   with-- in terms of--
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.220]   Touch gaming is huge.
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:22.700]   It's a form of casual gaming that I think is really underestimated.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.380]   And boy, the Nintendo DS, forget it.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:27.540]   People got these-- there's phones.
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:28.620]   You know, I'm not--
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:29.620]   Sorry.
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:30.100]   Go ahead.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:34.980]   Have you seen on either the iPad or the iPhone 4,
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.380]   the latest release from id, rage, HG?
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:38.940]   Yes.
[01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:39.620]   Unbelievable.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.980]   And I'm not going to play it because I--
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:41.980]   Oh my god.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:43.460]   Get this.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:46.500]   I played it on iPad today.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:47.940]   And I showed it.
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:53.460]   And we got pulled off YouTube for inappropriate content.
[01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:54.340]   Really?
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.020]   Yeah, because it was so violent or something.
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:57.220]   Yet there's plenty of videos there.
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:59.780]   But I guess they said that, well, the expectation is a iPad
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:27:59.980]   today.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:01.380]   You're not going to have ugly violence.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:04.260]   By the way, here is a better shot of all the people.
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:05.580]   Oh, shoot.
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.180]   Oh, shoot.
[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.300]   Of all the people.
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:10.580]   Happy that they're getting--
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:13.740]   An iPad.
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:14.740]   Oh, it's crazy.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:17.100]   [CHEERING]
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:17.940]   Wow.
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.300]   It's like, meet the Beatles.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.700]   This is like-- yeah.
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.100]   These are the Oprah audience.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:25.780]   They are so happy that they're all getting free iPads.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:26.780]   Treats me up.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.700]   They're going crazy.
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.060]   You know, I guess it's funny.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:30.820]   Oh, go ahead, Amber.
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:31.580]   Look at this.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:32.900]   No, I wasn't going to say--
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.500]   It's like the Chilean writers.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:35.060]   It's like--
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:37.740]   It's insane.
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.860]   I was just going to say that one thing about the iPad,
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:40.360]   though.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.860]   I mean, obviously, I enjoy using it.
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.500]   What is this guy's crying?
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:44.500]   I know.
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.100]   I cannot believe how it's great for kids, too.
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:50.900]   And I know just with my son, Connor, he's only 21 months now,
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:51.460]   I guess.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.740]   But he can literally navigate the iPad.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.500]   And play games.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.580]   I mean, a lot of the touch games that they have for toddlers
[01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.860]   are just phenomenal.
[01:28:58.860 --> 01:28:59.940]   And so we sits there.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:00.860]   We just went on a road trip.
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.060]   And he played with the iPad literally the entire way.
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:03.660]   He loves it.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.940]   He says iPad, iPad.
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:06.980]   And you can only say 10 or 15 words.
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:07.700]   But the funny thing about it--
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:08.220]   Wait a minute.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:08.700]   Wait a minute.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:12.860]   Your baby's 15th word is iPad?
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:13.300]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.180]   Oh, for sure.
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.380]   iPad, iPad, iPad.
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.300]   He says it all the time.
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:17.300]   He loves the iPad.
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.540]   And we have to kind of control it now.
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.740]   What do you have him do?
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.260]   What is he doing?
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:21.820]   He's not playing Angry Birds.
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.460]   No, he plays all these great games.
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.700]   They have Old MacDonald, where you can touch the pig,
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:27.740]   and the pig jumps up and down.
[01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.540]   They have amazing toddler games.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:30.420]   I cannot believe it.
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:32.260]   Many of them are educational, where
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:35.180]   they can learn the sounds of different animals.
[01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:36.340]   He's got literally--
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:38.780]   what does in apps that are geared towards that age.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:41.220]   But what's really interesting-- and I cannot believe this--
[01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.460]   he now goes up to the television when we have it on,
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.660]   which is not that often.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.660]   And he tries to touch the television.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:49.100]   And he gets really angry, because he can't understand
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:50.620]   why he can't interact with the television.
[01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.860]   Oh, me, why can't I pinch it?
[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:53.300]   I want to zoom in.
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:55.700]   To me, this is just a sign of how, first of all,
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:56.700]   how amazing the iPad is.
[01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:00.020]   But the future of media, he really--
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.740]   he can't handle even a computer screen.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:03.860]   The fact that he can't touch it if he was watching a video
[01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:05.380]   on a computer screen, he goes nuts.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.060]   This actually confirms what you said, Andrew.
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:08.860]   It's really people are going to get so used to that they're
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:11.020]   not going to want it that stop our burning system.
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:15.660]   Does it-- now, both Dwight and I like a love, in fact,
[01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.580]   are Samsung Galaxy tabs.
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:20.060]   These are 7-inch Android-based tabs.
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:22.860]   So do you think Dwight has to be iOS?
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.980]   Could it be Android?
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:25.380]   Could it be Windows?
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:28.260]   I think it has to be something that's designed for touch.
[01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:28.740]   Not Windows.
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:31.380]   One of the Windows of Windows 7 is that it's not
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:32.580]   designed for touch.
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:34.500]   And even if you do things like HP
[01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:38.620]   that's done with its touch smart shell that sits over it,
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:41.380]   it's still a shell that just doesn't feel quite right.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.580]   It's got to be designed from the get-go for touch.
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:48.220]   And that's why I think what Apple wins and Android wins.
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:50.620]   I keep touching my laptop.
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:51.220]   I know.
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:52.100]   It's kind of weird.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.460]   Well, I want my-- I thought maybe they would have already
[01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:56.820]   come out with an air that had a--
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:58.180]   I love the air.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.180]   And of course, Steve Jobs says--
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:02.300]   It's ergonomically not right.
[01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.220]   You don't want to--
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.260]   You want to do both.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.020]   You don't need to constantly do it.
[01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:09.340]   But I'd want to go up and touch and then type and do
[01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:10.100]   some things.
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:11.260]   Let's take a little break.
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.020]   We have a great panel here.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:16.540]   Andrew Barron is here from rocketboom.com and magma
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.100]   and the new internet meme.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:18.660]   What is this?
[01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:19.940]   You are all of that.
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:21.220]   No, you're meme.com.
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:25.340]   No, you're meme.com.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:26.940]   If you just go there every day, you
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:29.580]   will not be left out of cocktail party conversations ever
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.420]   again.
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:32.180]   It's pretty crazy what's happening over there.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:35.820]   What's the hot meme right today right now?
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:36.460]   I should go there.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:37.180]   Let's find out.
[01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:40.700]   A lot of people are still recuperating from Fort
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:41.900]   Chumbler.
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:42.860]   Well, I even know that.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.260]   See, I'm left out.
[01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:44.900]   I feel left out.
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.580]   I missed out.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.820]   This is really interesting.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:50.660]   So you know how 4chan has been causing quite a lot of havoc
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:54.820]   and really doing some interesting hacks on the social web.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:58.660]   And so they started to attack Tumbler.
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.420]   And Tumbler was like, hey, we're not
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:02.980]   going to stand around and attack.
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:04.220]   We're going to attack that.
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:11.460]   And it was kind of a bloodbath, essentially, of posting.
[01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:14.540]   Tumbler decided that what they were going to do to Fort
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:20.140]   Chan is post cute pictures of cats and fun, kind of like a
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:22.700]   happy-go-lucky stuff on Fort Chan.
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.860]   Because you know how they go around and are always posting
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:28.460]   really cruel, exaggerated stuff.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.540]   So that was kind of funny.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:33.740]   But then I noticed that Fort Chan, also, their method of
[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:35.980]   attacking Tumbler was effective.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:39.340]   What they would do is they would go around and follow tons
[01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:40.260]   of people.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:42.900]   And then you know how people just instantly follow back
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:43.940]   quite a bit.
[01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:46.740]   And all those people that just followed back, they suddenly
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:49.980]   wound up with all this really horrible media in their
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:51.340]   dashboards.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:54.300]   So people were like logging in, going, whoa, what's going on
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:55.140]   with my dashboard?
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:58.900]   It's like turned into a porn site, essentially.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:32:59.820]   So it was kind of funny.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:04.180]   And at the end of the day, nobody will really probably
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:04.740]   admit this.
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:07.740]   But I have to say, I think Tumbler kind of--
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.900]   One.
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:11.860]   I'm not going to go as far as say that they won, but they
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:15.460]   certainly did hold the ground.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:20.340]   Knowyourmeme.com.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:21.300]   Andrew is here.
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:23.300]   Dwight Silverman from The Chronicle.
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:28.820]   Houston Chronicle, crong.com/techblog.
[01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:29.820]   You got it.
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:32.260]   Amber McArthur from ambermac.com.
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.460]   Before we go on, and there's lots more to talk about, I want
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:36.060]   to talk a little bit about the Ford Edge.
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.220]   What a great vehicle.
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.380]   I'm a big-- as you know, I've become a born again Ford fan,
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.500]   driving my 9th little 2010 Mustang.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.220]   The Edge is great.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:45.420]   Now, Amber, you got to get the Edge.
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:48.300]   So you and Connor and Chris can drive and safety and comfort.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.340]   It's got the most legroom in the second row.
[01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:50.900]   I like that.
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:55.460]   It's got the optional vista roof featuring the front panel,
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:56.340]   which tilts and opens.
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:59.220]   But then there's a fixed skylight in the second seat.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:02.140]   So they're not traveling in the dark.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.420]   They're coming along with you.
[01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:04.460]   The great ambient lighting.
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:05.340]   I have that in my Mustang.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.540]   You can change the lighting.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.420]   Just really slick.
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:10.500]   But the thing I like best is the My Ford Touch.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:11.260]   This is amazing.
[01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:13.300]   The 8-inch screen in the center console.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.580]   The two little screens behind the steering wheel.
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.260]   Absolute control without keeping-- your hands never
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.540]   leave the wheel.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.780]   You can do almost anything.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:24.940]   Touch and voice commands for entertainment, climate control,
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.780]   phone navigation.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:31.820]   It includes a 5-2 5-way switch pads on the steering wheel.
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:33.380]   So I mean, it's almost like a joystick.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:35.860]   It's almost like a video game you can play.
[01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.820]   It is amazing.
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.980]   I want you to go to a Ford dealer and test drive
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.580]   the Ford Edge, the 2011 Ford Edge.
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:49.100]   And get ready because the 2012 Ford Focus is coming.
[01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.460]   This is their new international car.
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:58.380]   If you go to twitfordfocus.com, twitfordfocus.com,
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:01.980]   you can enter for a chance to win a trip to Madrid
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:04.180]   to be one of the first people in the world to test drive
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:05.940]   the 2012 Ford Focus.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:08.660]   Now, I've seen it, but I didn't get to drive it.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:12.500]   You could be driving a 2012 Ford Focus in Madrid
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:17.020]   at the Spanish National Institute for Aerospace Technology.
[01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:18.740]   How about that?
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.220]   Well, I got to sign into my Facebook account here.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.740]   So here's how you get involved.
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:24.020]   Go to twitfordfocus.com.
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.780]   This is through December 31.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:29.500]   Make a video of two minutes or less saying why you should
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.540]   go to Spain to test drive the new Ford Focus.
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:36.340]   And then Ford will donate $10,000 if you win.
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:38.380]   $10,000 is the charitable cause of your choice.
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:40.420]   A total of half a million will be donated.
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.900]   And send you and a friend on a trip to Madrid to test drive
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:44.220]   the 2012 Ford Focus.
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.700]   Now that is a good deal.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:47.820]   Tell Ford which charitable cause you'd like this aboard
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:50.780]   and why you should win this prize.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.180]   Twit, Nick, I can hear Amber going there right now.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.780]   Twit, wait, wait to make the video after we're done.
[01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:59.020]   Twitfordfocus.com.
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:00.620]   We thank Ford for their support.
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.460]   They make great stuff.
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.620]   I'm just, you know, my Mustang's right outside.
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:05.780]   I love it.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.020]   Although I wouldn't mind the new one.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.780]   Just a hint, little tip, birthday coming up.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:12.060]   I mean, just, you know, it's a Mustang.
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:13.820]   That'd be good.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.860]   Just a little thing.
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:18.420]   Why did you see that Facebook wants to trademark the word face?
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:19.620]   I can't believe that it's--
[01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:21.060]   What the hell is that all about?
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.220]   I don't know what that's all about.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.420]   But I'm almost sick of hearing Facebook news.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:27.140]   I mean, I like the site, but I don't know.
[01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:28.780]   That this is just one of those things I think
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:30.780]   is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:31.900]   Voice of Reason, Dwight.
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.020]   This is just how business is done.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.420]   You trademark the words.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:36.420]   You use what?
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.340]   Tell me why.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:38.820]   That's ridiculous.
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:40.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.740]   That's what I say.
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:42.740]   Come on.
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:44.740]   That's a plain old English word.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:45.820]   Exactly.
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:46.860]   Exactly.
[01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:51.860]   I mean, it's like, did "Handspring" ever, you know,
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:53.940]   trademark the word hand?
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:54.980]   I hope not.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.420]   It's not-- I mean, you could trademark face books.
[01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.020]   You could trademark face time.
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:00.780]   But come on.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:01.540]   But not face.
[01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:02.620]   It's not face.
[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:06.660]   So, Amber, did you get the invite I sent you to Diaspora?
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:07.620]   I sure did, Leo.
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.300]   And I have logged on.
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.380]   And I'm not overly impressed, I will say.
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:13.380]   I don't know how you feel about it.
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.580]   Well, it's new.
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.580]   It's new, but Leo, one thing that drives me crazy.
[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:18.140]   Is it-- I mean, I love programmers,
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:20.420]   but it really looks like it was created just by programmers
[01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:22.060]   in the sense that when you log in,
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.300]   there's just-- it's not very user friendly in the sense
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.420]   that some of the words and terminology they use.
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:30.180]   And the whole idea of managing your life in aspects,
[01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:32.660]   I hate that word that is throughout the site.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.900]   I don't know if you noticed that.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:37.100]   But aspects are different, I guess, groups or category.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:37.740]   It's just groups.
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:39.220]   Is there a word for groups?
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:40.660]   I don't know.
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:43.420]   I know it's new, but it's--
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:45.820]   It's not only new, there ain't much going on.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:46.660]   That's really cruel.
[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.380]   There's nothing there.
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.180]   Yeah, I didn't even know where to go.
[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:51.660]   I mean, I logged in, I see you're one of my contacts.
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:53.380]   And then I go to the different tabs.
[01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.540]   Of course, there's nothing there,
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.420]   because I haven't done anything.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.620]   So there's just no content, I guess,
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.900]   unless you start kind of pushing a lot of stuff
[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:02.580]   through there yourself.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.980]   I like it because I got the name Leo.
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:06.940]   Shoot, I got to get on there.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.980]   Well, if it's a social site, you could get Andrew.
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:10.260]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.780]   It's a social site, and it's in alpha.
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:13.420]   So I definitely--
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.140]   Yeah, it's brand new.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:16.540]   It's not going to have a lot of stuff yet.
[01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.540]   It's up to you to make the stuff.
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:21.460]   And the fact that it's an alpha, that kind of feedback
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:24.620]   that you're giving Amber, hopefully they'll take to hard
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:28.180]   and do something to make a lot better.
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.180]   This is often the case where you design something.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.860]   Engineers design something.
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:33.980]   It comes out looking like it's designed by engineers.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.860]   I have to be honest, I invited about 12 people.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:39.940]   And Amber, you're the only one who accepted.
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.900]   Leo, you remember that, OK?
[01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:42.660]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:45.540]   Y'all say it from now on, invites go to you.
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:48.180]   Well, it doesn't look like Amber's all that active right now.
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:49.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.540]   But that's the thing is you don't really
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:52.380]   know what to do yet.
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.980]   I mean, when I sign up for Twitter,
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:57.140]   there's information there I can easily follow people.
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:00.060]   But here, if you're searching around,
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.620]   it's difficult to begin using it.
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.540]   And when I say it's not that user friendly,
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:06.060]   it is easy to sign up and get an account.
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:07.140]   But they're just weird things.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.500]   I don't know if you notice this, Leo.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.900]   I think when you enter your birthday,
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:12.140]   you can't even pick from a little form.
[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:13.460]   You can't even pick the year you actually
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:14.420]   have to type something in.
[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:17.180]   And there's little tweaks like that
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.980]   that I think they could have done a better job.
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.260]   I like it that you can type in your gender.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:22.740]   You can make any gender you want.
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:23.380]   Oh, yes.
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.500]   That's the thing.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.500]   You could be any gender.
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.540]   I kind of was surprised by that.
[01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:26.940]   But--
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.340]   Well, I think that's good.
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:28.820]   I'm--
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:28.820]   I'm--
[01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.700]   I'm manish.
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:33.380]   I know this to you.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:35.820]   You're my only manish friend.
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.380]   I think that the whole dysphoria thing is interesting
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.740]   because I know it's close to my heart
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:45.140]   because I've always been very proactively outspoken
[01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:49.020]   about wanting a decentralized social--
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:51.740]   Well, that's what's cool about this is you can-- they call them
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:53.740]   seeds, but you could run-- in fact, I'd
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:56.620]   like to run our own diaspora server on our site.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:57.780]   And that's the promise of it.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:59.980]   It's sort of like what I want more than anything
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:03.100]   is my own Twitter or my own Facebook version
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:04.620]   that I can run on my own server.
[01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.900]   And then-- and the most important thing
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.460]   is then if Twitter goes down, you
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:12.340]   can just get it from my site or it's centralized.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.060]   That's how it should be.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.060]   That's how it should be.
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.420]   And nobody should own it.
[01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:16.300]   We tried to do that.
[01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:19.260]   Remember with a Twitter--
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:20.500]   it's status.net now.
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.620]   We had our own Twitter, Twitter army.
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.460]   We still do on status.net.
[01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:26.540]   And it was identical.
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:27.620]   But it just didn't catch on.
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:28.140]   Same idea.
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:28.900]   You federate.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:29.860]   All of that.
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:31.020]   It just didn't catch on.
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.460]   I think the disappointment with diaspora-- and by the way,
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.340]   I'm not yet disappointed.
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.540]   It's early days yet.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:41.420]   But they raised $200,000 at the beginning of the summer.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:44.220]   They've been working on this six months.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:47.260]   And I mean, I could have written this functionality
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.060]   in Ruby on Rails in about 10 minutes.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:50.540]   I don't understand what they've done.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:52.700]   The brand is what's there now.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:55.100]   But I don't know who the people are or what's going on.
[01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.620]   It's a bunch of NYU students.
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:57.140]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:58.660]   Somebody said, well, hey, that's nice.
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.820]   That we paid them $200,000 to learn how to program.
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:03.060]   Somebody should-- they should--
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:05.380]   I think that the best business decision those kids
[01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:11.260]   could make right now is to come out here and establish
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:13.260]   their business and find some real talent.
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:14.380]   That's what Zuck did.
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:14.860]   That's how to--
[01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:16.740]   He dropped out.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.500]   Dropout kids are telling you.
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:20.140]   Be cool, get out of school.
[01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.180]   You learned it onto it.
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:21.580]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:22.820]   Just drop out right now.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:23.580]   You don't need that.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.140]   You don't need that education.
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:25.700]   That's not--
[01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.700]   They've got the momentum, though, in the traction,
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.460]   just with the brand and the concept.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.020]   So they really-- I mean, I'm hopeful it will eventually
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.100]   turn into something because we need it.
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:37.340]   And it's the only thing that's got everybody's attention,
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:39.220]   just like you were saying, Jai-Q, et cetera.
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:40.060]   They all died.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:40.580]   They all died.
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:41.260]   They all died.
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:43.300]   But if they truly want people to start using it,
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.220]   like one thing that frustrated me when I logged in
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:47.220]   is that invites are currently closed.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:49.380]   So even though Leo invited me, I can't invite anyone else.
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:52.860]   So all of a sudden, my network is so tiny, right?
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:55.060]   Have to maybe try to search people who maybe on this.
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:55.980]   It's going to be--
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:57.620]   You could have gotten more invites.
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:59.180]   Early on, we were getting a bunch of invites.
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.900]   And then they couldn't keep up.
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.900]   So they've closed it down the invite system.
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.660]   They couldn't. It was a technical issue.
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:06.700]   And Leo, can you share?
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:09.340]   Because when I tried it, it says share across all your aspects.
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.940]   So when I tried to share, it seems I can only share photos.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:14.620]   But can you share text just conversations?
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.940]   Or have you-- I know I can't see if you've done anything.
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:17.820]   Maybe you haven't.
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:18.940]   I only have one friend.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:21.140]   How can I share across my aspects?
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.460]   You're the only aspect I got.
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.540]   It shares something with me.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:27.380]   Hey, dare.
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:29.660]   Amber.
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.660]   So-- and I can add photos.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:33.620]   Now, by the way, it's kind of interesting
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:37.380]   because right now it's piggybacking on Twitter and Facebook,
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.740]   ironically, because when you post, that's where it goes.
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:42.220]   So I'm going to make that--
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.100]   log into Twitter.
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:43.780]   I'm logged into Twitter.
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:45.660]   I'm logged into Facebook Managed Connected Services.
[01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:46.460]   OK.
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:50.060]   I probably should suppose something better than hey, Amber.
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.180]   What do you have?
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:51.660]   DERP.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:55.420]   Think about DERP?
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:55.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.500]   What's DERP?
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:58.380]   D-E-R-P?
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:58.900]   DERP?
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.460]   I should just type DERP.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:01.900]   Really what will happen?
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:02.860]   I'm not going to say.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:04.220]   All right, D-E-R-P.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.980]   Capitalize it?
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:06.580]   Sure.
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:07.500]   Yeah, that looks good.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.020]   Derp?
[01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:09.540]   Just like that, yeah.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.060]   OK.
[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:11.740]   Andrew told me to do this.
[01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:13.580]   Should I add a photo?
[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:14.220]   Nah.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:14.780]   No photo.
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.100]   Let's just derp.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:16.420]   OK.
[01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:17.260]   So I've derped now.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:18.900]   Now, that's going to go to Facebook.
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.620]   And it's going to go to Twitter.
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:21.540]   Oh, what have I done?
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.540]   Have you just told me to do something embarrassing?
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.420]   I just found it.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:25.980]   No, you're a meme, Andrew.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:28.100]   Oh, if I'd only got to know my meme.
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:30.860]   Sometimes used online to signify stupidity,
[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:33.260]   much like the earlier forms of death.
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:38.100]   It's like duh or derp.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:38.620]   Right, yeah.
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.260]   Well, I mean, we were looking for something to say.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:41.900]   No, this is perfect.
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:42.900]   I thank you, Andrew.
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:46.180]   So now my third post on diaspora--
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:47.940]   I mean, I think this is OK, but I mean,
[01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:50.620]   it's no different than anything else.
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.140]   I'm hoping that they put a lot of underlying stuff in here
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.900]   and that there's a lot of stuff going on
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:56.100]   that we just don't see.
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.860]   And of course, the ability to start a seat.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:59.140]   And I'm going to wait once they get out of it.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:43:59.980]   I'm going to wait for you.
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:01.900]   Every time they do improve it, everybody's
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.180]   going to come back and have a look.
[01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.140]   So they've got the right traction right now.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.740]   Look, I got some requests.
[01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:08.900]   Two new requests for friendship.
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:10.900]   I'm Leo, by the way.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:13.100]   Join diaspora.com.
[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.060]   So now what happens is you drag these people.
[01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.380]   It doesn't have their name or anything.
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:18.060]   So I don't really know who they are.
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:18.820]   That's Ralph.
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:20.380]   I'm going to make him a fan.
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.740]   See, I'm dragging him to an aspect.
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.700]   I have to say, I like this part of it.
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:24.220]   Because--
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:25.220]   You have a drag and drop suit.
[01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:26.220]   It's making lists.
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:27.740]   Remember Mark Zuckerberg said nobody
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:28.340]   wants to make lists.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.300]   This is a very easy way to do it.
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:31.500]   Some people ask you whether they want to be a friend.
[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.500]   You can put them in a bin.
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:38.860]   Well, if you get another set of invitations, Leo, send me one.
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:39.460]   I will.
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:40.420]   I'll play.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.340]   OK.
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:42.580]   Let me see if I have any more left.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:46.260]   Because I had 20, but I think that they all went away
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:46.980]   is what happened.
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:49.500]   So don't ask me, folks.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:50.860]   I ain't got a-- remember Amber?
[01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:52.620]   I mean, we just get slaughtered when we say we've
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:53.780]   got invites to anything.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.260]   I remember a newsvine.
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:58.780]   1,200 invites three days of me online all night long,
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:00.780]   sending them out to every single person.
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:01.500]   Oh, man.
[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:02.020]   Whatever.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.020]   No, is that still around?
[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:04.500]   Newsvine is still around, isn't it?
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:05.500]   MSNBC--
[01:45:05.500 --> 01:45:06.020]   I don't know.
[01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:06.500]   MSNBC--
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.500]   MSNBC--
[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.660]   Yeah, owns it.
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.100]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:13.500]   Amber C, you did all that work for MSNBC.
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:15.900]   They owe me big time.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:16.980]   Terp.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:21.460]   Invites are clearly closed on this diaspora pod.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:23.780]   Oh, there's seeds and there's pods.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:26.980]   I wonder if there's stems.
[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:28.740]   You can request that feature, Leo.
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:29.820]   I'd like to be a stem.
[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:35.300]   Tim Berners-Lee says Facebook could fragment the web.
[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:38.260]   Yeah, derp.
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:39.580]   How about this?
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:43.940]   FCC wants to use texting for 911.
[01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:44.980]   Oh, that sounded--
[01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:47.500]   Does that seem like a good idea?
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:47.980]   Well, sure.
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.500]   If you have-- you know, the average teenager
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:52.180]   sending, what, 3,000 texts a month or something like that?
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:53.260]   They don't use the phone.
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:56.140]   Some kids are so fast with their thumbs.
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:00.660]   Help, I am falling off a cliff.
[01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:02.060]   They could probably do that fast enough.
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:03.660]   Maybe they don't know how to use the phone.
[01:46:03.660 --> 01:46:04.660]   I don't know.
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:05.160]   Right.
[01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.180]   Yeah, also the other thing is you can usually
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:09.180]   get your SMS to go through sometimes
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:10.180]   when you get a signal.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:10.660]   With a phone channel.
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:11.500]   That's your exit.
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:12.460]   That's a good point.
[01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:13.860]   I guess it makes sense.
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:18.140]   They also want to know protocols for sending video and audio
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:18.780]   along with it.
[01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:20.820]   So if, like, if you're at a fire,
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:21.580]   you could take--
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:21.940]   Oh, wow.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:25.340]   --the fire and where the location is, send GPS coordinates
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:27.220]   along with your SMS.
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:30.500]   That's actually kind of interesting.
[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.020]   I don't know how valuable it is.
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:33.380]   What do they need a video of it for?
[01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.660]   The only thing they need to be careful of is--
[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:37.660]   I know with some of the news stations in Toronto,
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:39.420]   and I'm sure it's the same thing in other places,
[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:41.820]   is because they're asking for all of this user-generated content,
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:45.620]   the thing is people are risking their lives to choose video
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.300]   of buyers.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.700]   And if there's a car accident, people
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.180]   are pulling over because they want
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:50.460]   to be able to capture footage.
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:53.180]   And it just makes me a little bit concerned.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.980]   The iReport generation.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:57.580]   Somebody in the chat was just wondering
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:00.860]   what would happen if you sent in a DERP and to 911?
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:02.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:04.220]   What would they do?
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:06.660]   Oh, I'm not going to take a chance.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:07.620]   I'm not going to take a chance.
[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:09.180]   I've already durped on the internet.
[01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:11.700]   I don't know if I want to do any more durping.
[01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:17.060]   Well, another question you'll ask is SMSing too easy.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:20.900]   To use 911 right now, you pick up the phone,
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:23.860]   you have to dial it, you have to talk to the operator,
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:25.580]   it's a person to person.
[01:47:25.580 --> 01:47:27.580]   And it makes it harder to do--
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:31.180]   Yeah, it makes it harder to do something fake,
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:33.100]   whereas if you just want to prank something,
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:37.340]   you just call in a man down at a location on your phone
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:41.060]   and you end up getting the cops, and it's a false alarm.
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:41.580]   Yeah.
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:44.780]   Yeah, there's no way to gauge the tone of it, right?
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:45.940]   And I think that's--
[01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.420]   I'll tell you guys a quick little story about my old roommate,
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:49.340]   Jenna.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:51.380]   Her mom was traveling in Northern Ontario,
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:53.620]   and she sent us a text message that said,
[01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.180]   "Bears everywhere send help."
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:57.180]   And--
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:57.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:59.180]   This is the first text message that--
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.620]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:03.740]   This is the first text message she ever sent in her life.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:04.700]   So Jenna and I are at home.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:05.540]   It's a Saturday afternoon.
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.220]   We obviously didn't have better things to do.
[01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:08.060]   We start freaking out.
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:10.100]   We start laughing, and then we think, oh, my gosh,
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:10.820]   what if it's true?
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:12.860]   Because we know she's driving through Northern Ontario.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:14.020]   There's a lot of bears.
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:15.140]   And maybe she doesn't need help.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:17.780]   So of course, I'm on the phone with the RCMP.
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:18.620]   We try to call her.
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:19.300]   We can't get through.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.340]   There's no signal.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:23.980]   And so all of a sudden, three hours later, we get through.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.700]   And her mom starts laughing her head off.
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.460]   But because we couldn't establish the tone
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.380]   that it was a joke, right?
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.300]   If she had called and left a message, we would be like, oh, OK.
[01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:31.140]   There's no tone, is there?
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:31.900]   There's no tone.
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:33.940]   And so we got an embarrassing speech.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.620]   Speaking of lack of tone, I'm told now that my Derp post has
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:39.460]   been retweeted multiple times.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:40.100]   It's a meme.
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:44.620]   I've created a Derp storm on another Twitter.
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:45.940]   That's why Derp is a meme.
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:49.180]   It just-- you hear it, and you just start going with it.
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:53.180]   And people are saying, this week in Derp, Derp, Derp, Derp.
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:55.220]   Look at all these Derps.
[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:56.620]   And it's all because of me.
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:57.820]   Actually, it's all because of you.
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:58.700]   I blame you, Andrew.
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:01.700]   Well, you typed it in.
[01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:04.340]   That was the more on the dinner.
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.500]   I don't know if it's good or bad, but I have Derps.
[01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.300]   No, that's awesome.
[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:11.460]   I have Scott Johnson will be happy, they say.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.140]   It's a 4chan, apparently.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:16.460]   So I'm now part of that crew.
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:17.940]   Maybe I'll put some fuzzy kittens up,
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.820]   and everything will be better.
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:22.340]   Andrew, I'm so glad to see you out here.
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:22.780]   Oh, thanks.
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:24.180]   Thanks for coming up.
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:26.660]   Like, the most-- when I look back once again,
[01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.900]   I mean, this is like the biggest opportunity
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:30.900]   I find in this medium.
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:31.580]   We're lucky.
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.820]   I really love what we're doing.
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:37.020]   I feel a kindred spirit in you and Amber
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:40.220]   and all the people who are doing this kind of stuff.
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:42.420]   It's so early days, we're not at each other's throats.
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:43.300]   We're just going--
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.940]   Come on, come on, come on.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:46.420]   Like, going along.
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:48.180]   Except that son of a bitch, Jason.
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.220]   But other than him--
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:50.300]   True.
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:51.300]   This is true.
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.660]   It's pretty-- but don't get me started.
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:54.660]   She's so cool.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.580]   She's so cool.
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:58.340]   Actually, Shelley.
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:49:59.140]   No, no, no.
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:00.260]   That's another--
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:03.580]   Nancy, zombies, angry birds--
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:04.140]   Derp.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:05.380]   Derp and Calicanis.
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:08.740]   And we covered it all.
[01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:09.940]   So nice to have you up here.
[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:12.300]   Andrew is at rocketboom.com.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.100]   That's also-- there's a link there to knowyourmeme.com.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.100]   And magma is a great site if you want to see what's
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:21.340]   hot in the internet video, mag.ma.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:21.840]   Magma.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.500]   Thank you, Anne.
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:23.500]   Thank you.
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:24.980]   So nice to see you.
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:26.660]   Amber MacArthur, great to see you.
[01:50:26.660 --> 01:50:27.980]   You don't make it to Twit very often.
[01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:30.020]   I'm glad you could be here.
[01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:31.180]   I'm very happy to be here.
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:32.060]   I've learned a lot.
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:33.060]   Derp.
[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:35.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:35.340 --> 01:50:37.020]   I think we have a show titled, by the way.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:39.340]   I don't think there's any question at all.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:39.900]   That's easy.
[01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:43.340]   The name of this show is Amber is at ambermact.com.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:45.700]   You can find her on Twitter under that moniker.
[01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:50.180]   You can also find her on commandn.tv, her weekly video
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:52.060]   show, which is fantastic.
[01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:53.820]   And on CP24 web nation.
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:55.220]   And don't forget, Net at night, which
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:58.300]   is a great show that Amber does every Tuesday with me
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:02.580]   at 130 Pacific 430 Eastern at live.twit.tv,
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:05.180]   or you can subscribe to it and get it forever and ever
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:09.620]   at Twit in her book, Power Fending.
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:10.700]   These are book stories.
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:11.380]   Is it selling well?
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:12.220]   Are you doing well with it?
[01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:13.500]   Yes, I can say.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.420]   Are you making me?
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:14.900]   Yeah, I am.
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:17.100]   I just made it to the Globe and Mail bestsellers list,
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:17.940]   not that long ago.
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.940]   So that's pretty cool.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.380]   But yeah, so it's been really a fun process.
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:24.140]   And it's gotten me lots more speaking gigs.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:25.540]   But Leo, who cares about me?
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:26.420]   Happy birthday.
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:27.420]   Oh, thank you.
[01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:29.740]   I think we'll call it happy Derp Day.
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:32.020]   Oh, that's good.
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:32.820]   Thank you, Amber.
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:35.580]   Yeah, great book, Power Fending, highly recommended.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:37.660]   And last but not least, Dwight Silverman, thank you
[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.300]   for being here.
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.580]   Dwight rearranged his camera shot.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:44.100]   So it looks so much better.
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.260]   He tells me.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.260]   Derp.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:47.460]   Yeah.
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:51.700]   You can-- Dwight's link role is absolute must read
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:55.500]   on his blog at blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.980]   And of course, you can read him in the Houston.
[01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:00.380]   Monica, thank you for being here.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.380]   And thank you.
[01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:03.740]   And I really enjoyed getting a chance to meet you, Amber.
[01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:06.220]   And Andrew, I both have liked the stuff you've
[01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:07.260]   done over the years.
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:09.820]   And it's great to get a chance to meet you
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.140]   virtually via Skype.
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:12.140]   That's awesome.
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.140]   Yeah, you too.
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:14.660]   That's what Twitter is all about.
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.340]   He's getting together just really great people in the industry
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:20.060]   so we can sit around and chat.
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:21.900]   We are doing a Best of Show this year.
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:24.540]   Instead of getting together after the Christmas holiday,
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:27.740]   I want to take that day off, the Boxing Day.
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.820]   So if you would like to help us with that,
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:30.500]   it's very simple.
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:34.740]   Go to twit.tv/bestof and nominate your favorite bits or episodes
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.660]   from the past year.
[01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:37.980]   And we'll chop it all up and put it all together
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:39.900]   and make a Best of Twits salad.
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:42.540]   That's twit.tv/bestof.
[01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:44.980]   I also want to point you to--
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:47.140]   we're going to do a special.
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:50.860]   We sent Sarah Lane down to Los Angeles
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:53.180]   to do a special on the neutron movie.
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:55.660]   And she went down to Digital Domain
[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:58.220]   and saw the special effects and how it was made and so forth.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:03.660]   And that's going to debut at November 30, Tuesday on Twitter.
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:05.260]   Do you know when I Lane it's going to debut?
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:07.340]   Well, it'll be out.
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:09.500]   There's a little sample right now on our Twits specials feed.
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:15.220]   5pm Pacific, 8pm Eastern, live.twit.tv for that special.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:19.580]   Is there anything else I need to do that I have left out?
[01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.420]   Anything else I have to say?
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.340]   All right.
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:23.620]   No.
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:25.300]   Actually, can you mind if I pitch in something?
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:26.660]   Please, Andrew.
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:29.420]   I was just thinking about what we just witnessed there
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.740]   with the Oprah audience.
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:33.420]   And I started off talking about your audience.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:37.500]   And I actually would compare them a little bit,
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:40.140]   but the thing that's neater about your audience that I like,
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:43.260]   that was so clear to me when we saw it,
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:46.620]   was that Oprah has wound up with this audience
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:49.340]   that seems as if they're just sponges
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:54.060]   waiting to soak up anything without being critical about anything.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:57.100]   I've never seen anybody do any criticism
[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:59.940]   with their audience or any of the commentary.
[01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:01.180]   It's always just, oh, I love you.
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:01.620]   I love you.
[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:04.580]   But I feel like your audience, which I--
[01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:05.580]   I could use a little more--
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.220]   I could use a little more of that, by the way.
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:09.660]   But they have-- not that they criticize you,
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:12.300]   but that they jump into the conversation
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:14.540]   and with their criticism on the topics.
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.300]   Right.
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:15.740]   And so--
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:16.260]   No, I do.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:18.180]   I like a more valuable--
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:21.580]   I like an audience that's crunchy chewy, that pushes back.
[01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:22.580]   And that's--
[01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:25.820]   Who wants just people who just soak it up-- whatever you say,
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:26.020]   on it.
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:26.780]   Well--
[01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:27.420]   Oh, well, it's--
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:29.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:30.580]   Anyway, it's not as fast.
[01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:31.620]   That might be OK.
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:32.660]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:34.060]   I think-- I couldn't agree more.
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:37.100]   I think that's one of the best things about the internet
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:38.620]   audience is that they do push back.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:39.540]   They do participate.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.260]   They're in there.
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:42.500]   And they have some skin in the game.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:45.060]   I won't be here, by the way, next week.
[01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:46.220]   Tom Merritt will be filling in for me.
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:48.140]   I'm going to be in Paris for Lou Webb.
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:49.660]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:51.300]   Thank you, Louick, for inviting me to that.
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:54.060]   And I'll be back a week from Sunday for Twit.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.460]   And of course, a week from Tuesday
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.260]   for all the regular shows at live.twit.tv.
[01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:01.140]   Thank you for joining us one more time.
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.860]   Let's just watch people go crazy as they get--
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:04.860]   I would say that.
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:05.380]   --their iPad.
[01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:07.340]   And it's just to make sure that YouTube really does
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.140]   pull this video down.
[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:10.420]   It allows you to think about a lot of things
[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:13.740]   into clear channel for giving, giving to others.
[01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:16.020]   So how about we meditate on this?
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.500]   [CHEERING]
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:20.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:24.420]   Oh, they went crazy because she took off her dress.
[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:25.420]   What the hell?
[01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:27.580]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:30.340]   I think it's the wrong episode.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.620]   What is that?
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:33.980]   This is an old Christmas show, I think, Lou.
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:35.220]   Oh, this is something different.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:37.420]   This isn't her current favorite things?
[01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:40.060]   Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:42.700]   I think they went a car.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.860]   Oh, this is the car one.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:45.420]   Must have been the car.
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:45.940]   Yeah.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:48.020]   Well, it's pretty much the same reaction.
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:49.100]   It's pretty much the same thing.
[01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:49.940]   iPad car.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:52.460]   [CHEERING]
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:53.460]   Huh?
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:54.380]   They got Volkswagen Beatles.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.860]   They got Volkswagen Beatles.
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:57.740]   They already did that?
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:55:59.900]   Wow.
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:02.700]   It didn't make the news, I guess, this time.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:04.540]   Watch Oprah's ultimate favorite things.
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:05.900]   This is like my radar.
[01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.700]   Announced that--
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:11.340]   or the surprise to her audience.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.300]   Hmm.
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:15.460]   It doesn't actually say in this Gawker post,
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:18.060]   why they're going crazy.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:19.700]   It's just her ultimate favorite thing.
[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:21.420]   So that wasn't this year, that was another year.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:21.940]   I don't think so.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:23.740]   I think she's wearing a gold dress, sorry.
[01:56:23.740 --> 01:56:26.220]   I probably am the only one who noticed that.
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:27.740]   Thank you, Amber.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:29.380]   That's why you need ladies on the show, Leo.
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:31.340]   I need more ladies on the show.
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:33.020]   No, they say that's the right episode.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:33.540]   I don't know.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:37.900]   Somebody saying Oprah did two gifts or something, I guess,
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:38.700]   or two days.
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:40.580]   She did two days of it, I think, maybe.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:43.820]   Maybe the car was the other fave.
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:45.260]   Oh, wow.
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:48.700]   So somebody's done an interesting meme video of this.
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:51.140]   Bees!
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:52.140]   Bees!
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:53.140]   Ah!
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:54.140]   Ah!
[01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.140]   Ah!
[01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:56.140]   Ah!
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:57.140]   Bees!
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:56:58.140]   Ah!
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:01.060]   Oh my god, there's bees in here!
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.060]   Oh!
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:04.060]   Oh, bees!
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:07.540]   You know, it's pretty much the same reaction.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:09.020]   I'm getting stuck to death!
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:11.700]   Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:14.300]   And she's the queen bee.
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:16.580]   Oh, oh, bees!
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:18.180]   It's just weird.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:24.300]   I just cut all that crap out and I'll say another twit is in the can.
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.300]   See you later.
[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.300]   Bees!
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:39.380]   And we may do an unofficial, I might do an unofficial Paris something.
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:40.380]   Not corona.
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:44.100]   Can you say on the air where you're staying?
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:45.620]   Yes, we'd rather not.
[01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:47.100]   No, we're right next door at the Renaissance.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:48.100]   I got it.
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:49.100]   I got it.
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:50.100]   That's where I always stay.
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:51.100]   I always stay at the Renaissance if I can.
[01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:52.100]   I like the ruby air.
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:53.100]   I'm at the ruby air.
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:58:00.100]   The helicopter has landed.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:03.100]   Wow.
[01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:05.100]   Okay.

[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:13.100]   Leo loses it.
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.540]   Up next to Gilmore gang.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:16.540]   Yeah.

[02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:28.140]   She knows what it's doing.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:31.140]   Oh my God.
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:33.140]   Oh my God.

[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:24.140]   She's not going to do anything.
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:31.140]   She's just sitting there.
[02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:34.140]   Yes.
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:35.140]   Hello.

[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:49.140]   By the way, remember when I told you, Eileen, that we didn't have, we didn't have Amber on
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:52.140]   Twitter anymore because the Skype was always terrible.
[02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:57.140]   Remember I told you that?
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:59.140]   No, she does a show every Tuesday.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:00.140]   It's fine.
[02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:07.140]   I'm not going to do anything.
