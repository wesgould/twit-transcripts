[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We got a great panel for you.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   We're going to talk about the week's tech news with Neil I Patel, who is joining us from...
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Now, you've got to map a Chicago, but you're in Manhattan.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yes, that's your own from Chicago, so it's...
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I get it.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I'm the editor of where I'm from.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   He's the editor at theverge.com.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   What is your actual title?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Managing editor.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Managing editor.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And the one that tells everybody else what to do.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's awesome.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   It's awesome.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's also from New York.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Joanna Stern from ABC.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Good to have you, Joanna.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Good to be here.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   In green.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   In green.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   She was prepared.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Which is more than I could say from Molly Wood.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It was not wearing any green at all.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I brought my Iris temper.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   That'll work.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   She's actually Irish, so that counts.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Always on the great TV show on the CNET.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I know it has been a long time and this is going to be a pretty great panel.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Well, I had to invite you because you and I were in sync.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Unbeknownst to each other.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   We were both watching the Galaxy S4 launch out of New York City, which was Thursday.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Neil, Neil, I was there.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I was there.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Joanna was there.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   I saw her there.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I was unfortunately there.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I was there.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I cannot tell you how terrible of an event it was.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Well, apparently Molly and I were watching from afar both had the same reaction, which
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   was not only with it, but with Texas, but it was kind of tone deaf.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It was like Samsung coming.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   What is that buzz?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Somebody had that.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I'm turning off my phone.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Don't leave your phone on the desk.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's vibrating right into my ear.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Only you have that.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You know what they're doing?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   They're texting you saying, "Hey, you're on Twitch."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Oh, my God, they can see you're on Twitter.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It is all notifications.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I need to wait a minute.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.560]   This is a St. Patrick's Day.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.520]   You can't have a Twitch on St. Patrick's Day without some green beer.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.000]   So we're going to have now some magical harp.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Molly Wood is pouring me some harp.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   My boobs are pouring just a mop apparently.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Why?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Why are you doing that?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   You're still pressed feet and green, I see.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   That's good.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   That's good.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Oh, why are you doing it like that?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Give me some foam.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Give me a head.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I never thought I'd ask Burke for head, but there you go.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Mayday.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Mayday.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Okay.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Now for discussion of women's issues.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   That gardener was hot.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I'm going to do my nails this whole time.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You just tell me when the show is over.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   That was the funniest one.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I was going to get some beer except that there's too many calories.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I'm going to go get a Zima real quick and then I'll be right back.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Don't worry.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   S-Health can tell you.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That's right.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   You're right.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   What an event.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   That was the funniest part.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I think the funniest line I had.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   A stack of.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   They're talking about how you can float the, uh, float your, uh, above the screen, not touch
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   the screen.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And why would you want to do that?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Because my nails are drying.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   My nails are wet or I have lotion on my hands.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I just can't.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I can't do it.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I just ate something.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I don't want to get my screen dirty.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I'm not.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I can't do anything.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I've had the lotion problem.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Joanna.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   That does happen, but still.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I was actually telling you after.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I mean, when I get my nails done, I have absolutely, that's when I use my phone the most actually.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Because you're like sitting there, you have nothing else to do.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And it doesn't mess up my manicure.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   The magazine pages mess up my manicure.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   So, so really it wasn't so much that it was sexist as it was just wrong.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   This was factually wrong.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So, I got to figure that something like half the market for Samsung phones is our women.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I mean, considering half the market for any phone, it should be women.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   You know, the event was very, it was just Samsung wanted to put on a big show.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And I think actually the most telling thing about it was at one point they said, you know,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   we're going to launch this phone on, you know, two billion carriers in something like a hundred
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and fifty five countries.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And that's when I began to like thinking about it.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It's like, oh, that's why this was so terrible.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Because when you talk to that many people, you can only end up at the lowest common denominator.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Right.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And the very sad truth is that the lowest common denominator is just stereotypes of people.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's everyone is like this, right.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And that's, to me, it's you have to be smarter than that.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   You have to think to yourself, well, we're talking to this huge audience,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   but the people who are covering it, the people who are going to be there and talk about it afterwards
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   are not necessarily the huge audience.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   There are people sitting in New York and tech fans around the world who are a little bit more
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   sophisticated than a hundred and fifty five countries on 300 carriers.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And I think that's really really messed up.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I'm not even sure.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I see what you're saying, but that was, but they had to know who they were presenting to.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Because like you said, the audience for the actual show that they put on,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I'd be very surprised if that was many more people than tech media and total tech.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Half a million people watched on YouTube.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And in the audience, it was unfortunately way more than just tech media or enthusiasts.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I mean, it just, it was tons of people.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I mean, my biggest problem as I told me live was like, it was more the lack of wireless than the making fun of women
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   or whatever else was going on in the presentation.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But I mean, I ran into people there that I was like, why are you here?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And like, oh, we just, we got a ticket.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   How did you get a ticket?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   How did people get tickets?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I had no idea.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I mean, press was like, you know, all press usually get into Samsung events.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   We register, we go through the whole process.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   But I ran into a lot of like tech PR people that were just like, I just wanted to come see this.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Well, they rented radio city, they rented radio city music hall, which must have cost them a million dollars, right?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Something, some huge number.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's more than that.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   It seats 3500 people.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   I don't know if there's 3500 tech journalists who could go see this, right?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   I mean, they've got to fill it with something.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   They also flew in all, I'm pretty sure all the tech media from around the world.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I mean, I was sitting next to a Russian journalist on my left and a bunch of, I don't know where they were from on my right.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   They were just, I just knew they were equally as mad about not having wireless.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Yeah, there's a guy behind me.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   He was like, I flew in from Germany for this.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I mean, Samsung opened it up.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I mean, they were holding contest to give fans tickets.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   That's great.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So, all of that is great.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And I think what, I think ultimately what happens is when a giant corporation decides to deliver marketing messages to people, they forget that people are actually people, and not a collection of demographic information, like women.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   You know, like if you just reduce women to like, here are the activities women do with a phone.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Here are concerns we've heard about using a touchscreen phone from women in surveys.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   That's that thing.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Well, no, you immediately lose the fact that people are actually people and you start thinking of them as how can we effectively talk to these like disconnected disembodied concerns, and then you generate this thing.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And I, you know, there's like the only silver lining is like, at least it wasn't as stupid as some of the other stuff they've done, right?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, what have they done that was stupider than that?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I mean, the sad thing to me is that they were to be, to be totally clear.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I don't think any of this, as I said, on CNBC is going to affect sales.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   It doesn't matter really.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Right.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Bones going to be absolutely fine.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Right.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Going to sell like investors.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Can I do great?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   If anything, they did a disservice to the phone by not just focusing on it.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   They should have.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And it was, you could barely tell that they were introducing a new phone and a new phone that is a really great successor to a really popular phone.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And then the saddest thing at all is that I think they were actually trying to sell the phone to women.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And that's why they had so many examples of context in which women are at least one dimensional.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   So, you're talking about two character ladies might want to use it.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Right.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   So I think that's the thing.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So they got, this is what I'm saying.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   This is where they improved.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   They actually had the product involved much more so like, you know, in 2011 at CS, they had a whole presentation.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And the point that presentation was going to get this order wrong.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   They were moving from digital humanism to human digitalism.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Not even kidding.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Like that.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   That was true.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, I had the kid from Billie Elliot dancing around and saying insane crap.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And I don't know why that happened.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Look, I still was amazing now.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   It was amazing.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And I had a lot of fun.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I can't think of another tech press conference where they had tap dancing.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I think that's.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   No, but yeah, I can.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And they're all Samsung.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Somebody in the chat room said nobody does weird like Samsung weird.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It was so, I mean, like stepping away from the part where it sort of did gradually just get more and more offensive.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It was surreal.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Like it was beyond bizarre.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I mean, I'm watching this thinking, well, at some point they're going to stop doing this, right?
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And then start to have like a.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Got a weird.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And then every time I thought that it just got weirder and then there would be tap dancing and then there would be like it.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I mean, it just I don't I kind of don't understand, especially considering the money involved.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Plus, why didn't you get a bigger star?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Like, why do you get that orange guy from Smash that no one's ever heard of?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I have no idea who he was.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   No, I had a Google.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Someone was like, oh, we'll chase.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I was like, I have no idea who he was.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   You know why?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Because Neil Patrick Harris could said no.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   No, so it was all Broadway.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   He doesn't say no.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Let me let me let me ask Joanna because Joanna and Eli were there.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And one of the things I thought and maybe you two Molly is that those of us watching at home were watching on a screen
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   that this is a big, big, big theater with 3,500 people.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's a big show.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   It might be playing differently to the people in the live audience.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Was that the case you think Joanna?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I was trying to find wireless for 50 minutes.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   That's all you cared about.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   So I have really no clue what happened.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   All I know is I kept picking up my head and I was like, what the hell is going on?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And why is there no wireless?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Stay away from the brown ass.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Let me just give you an idea of how there was no wireless.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I had an AT&T phone, no service in there.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   LTE Verizon, not working.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Apparently 3G Verizon was working and that's what saved me alive in the Verge bunch.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And there was a press wireless, but that didn't work.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Were you trying to do a live blog Joanna?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Is that why you?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Yeah, I was trying to.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   We were trying to live blog for ABC News.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Very frustrating.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And I was just sweating it out.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But yes, I did keep picking up my head and I was like, what is going on in here?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Right.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And I mean, you know, no one in the audience was really reacting.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I mean, I think people were clapping because they felt like they had to, I think.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Well, that was another production error that we at home noticed, which is they didn't
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   mic the audience.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So even if the audience was clapping, it always sounded like this.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Plus, it hasn't everyone learned at this point that don't clap on stage when you're
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   mic'd because you will always sound like the only person clapping in the room.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Like it was just so...
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Neil Patrick Harris would have known that.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I gotta point out.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   He would have known that.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It was big in laws, I think, at that when they announced 13 megapixel camera, there
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   was big applause for that.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And then it just kind of went in waves.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I think people were sort of like, are we supposed to clap now at the end of the scene?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   There's one moment of huge applause when they announced the phone order of LTE.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And I couldn't, I still don't know why that happened.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Well, it was LTE.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   It was LTE worldwide.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   We've had LTE in the US, but internationally, often not.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   And they said, LTE is all 155 countries.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   That's an applause line.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   If it's true, then people thought the LTE would work in the audience.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   That was rise in 3G.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I don't know.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   It was like a vesting or a version.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   I mean, really?
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I'm still so...
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Did I mention the wireless?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Okay.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Which was worse.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   The Qualcomm's CES keynote or the Samsung Radio City Music Hall debacle.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Because the Qualcomm was pretty bad too.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I'm thinking I got to go Samsung because there's bizarre and then there's bizarre and offensive.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Here might be the source of the...
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I can't get kangaroo for sure.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Or whatever that on there.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   A donkey, I don't know.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   So here's the thing about chip companies doing keynotes.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   They have no idea what they're selling or how to sell it, right?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   So like our chips are fast and you can do stuff with them.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And because they're faster, here's some awesome stuff you can do.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Right.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And here's some people you can relate to.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Right.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   So the chip Intel keynotes are always crazy too.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   I had a season sorry one year.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I remember just like pretending to be a time traveler.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   And I remember having like this isn't affecting me.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I don't know why.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   There's literally this all.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I was just watching this happen and wondering why you spent this money instead of like pushing chips forward.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Samsung on the other hand, I think they actually with the Galaxy S4, they have a similar problem is they have a phone with all of these features and all of these gimmicky crazy features.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Like I don't think people want them.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I told when I was going on CNN the next morning and talk about the phone, I told the person who is like the CNN makeup lady.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I was like, oh, there's a new phone.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   It watches your eyes when you're reading a webpage and scrolls for you.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And she's like, I want that.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   She was like, that's freaky.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And she started telling her friends like the new phone watches you.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And they don't know how to sell it yet.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And I think they can contact all of these.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   It's not working.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Do you think Joanna that it's a gimmicky?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I made him off.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Do you think it's a gimmicky phone?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I mean, the idea that I don't, you know, I think they want to focus on the gimmicky features, which is the wave and the scrolling and that kind of thing.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I think there are some really useful and practical features.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   They didn't seem to really want to focus on those.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   But I do think, yeah, this idea of wanting to tilt and wave your phone is, is they're just trying to come up with ways to say look at, look at how we've been innovative in this space.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   We actually, we've been saying for a while at CNET that Samsung has a little bit of feature,itis or maybe a lot of feature,itis and that they, they really do think that the way to, you know, our hearts is to just sort of keep cramming things into the phone as opposed to having a killer feature.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And I almost feel like the saddest thing about this presentation was that it that they could have, I think, had the self esteem in a way to say this is a great phone.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   The Galaxy S3 was a great phone. It was the first like phone all on its own to outsell the iPhone. And this phone is just as great and then some end worldwide LTE and things like, like a few features like that that are really important to people, like a really good camera, great battery life and fast data.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   That's all you got to say.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I actually, yeah.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It's like, to me, the phone with, by the way, a release date and a price.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But the problem with, we didn't get either, though.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   The problem with that is that it's kind of a commoditized thing now. Everything's, all the new phones will be 1080p. All of them will be really fast quad core or R8 core. All of them will have two gigs of RAM.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   And Samsung's Achilles heel his is the design looks exactly like an S3 or a Note 2. They haven't really updated the design particularly.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Yeah, but Apple doesn't do that, you know, either.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Yeah, but then you're up against the HTC one, which is gorgeous.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Right.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Yeah, but that phone is, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I mean, the HTC hasn't sold anymore phones. I agree with you. The HTC one is a beautiful piece of hardware and has a tremendous screen, actually, I think.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   But I think the software, the average person isn't looking for a flip board on their home screen. And the people who want to buy gadgety phones, they're going to go, they're going to flock to the huge list of Samsung gimmicks because they're there.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   There's a list of Samsung gimmicks.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And then they're going to have a phone with a big screen that has LTE and that's what people want. And Samsung has a marketing budget to say this is the phone with a big screen LTE.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   They can do all this stuff. The iPhone can't do. And, you know, I think it's working. You know, I think Apple's running a little bit scared. They've got, they had, you know, Phil Schiller gave those interviews to the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, I think.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   The day before the event they put up the new marketing site today, or yesterday, only an iPhone can do this stuff.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   I think Apple feels the heat from Samsung a little bit. So, tone deaf, yeah, a little sexist, yeah.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But effective, like apparently so. And I think that's really interesting.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Here's your tip.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Yeah, I think going back to that feature point, I wrote something about this on Friday.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   The headline being "S teach" because after I came out of that event, I just kept adding "S" to everything. I was saying it was an S mess of an event.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I met Neil after for drinks and I was just saying S. I need an S drink. I was just going on and on.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   What a pain in the S, yeah.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a best wireless promise.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   From S not to make these jokes anymore.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You're fired, John. That one's over the line.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   No, I'm coming.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   That was Texas.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I think in terms of the features, I think Samsung had this same thing last year with the Galaxy S3.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And I asked a bunch of my friends who bought the Galaxy S3. Well, not a bunch. I have two friends that own it.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And I said, do you know what? The pop-up video thing is, do you know what?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I forget the name of the feature that allowed you to be able to pop the video and watch it while you're scrolling and watching the web.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Or do you know about Smart Stay or do you know about all these features?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And they said, no, I have no idea what those are.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And when I reviewed the phone last year, I said, there's a ton of features, but it took me a long time to figure out how to use them.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And they're not very obvious when you first get the phone.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   So my feeling is that these features are great, and maybe they'll market them this year.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Maybe they'll just keep going after Apple and these marketing things.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But how are people going to know to use these features?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And are they going to take the time to learn that?
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   It is smart.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   From a marketing perspective, it is smart of Samsung to try to differentiate.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And that was one of the few positive things that I said about this presentation.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   They really, I mean, they barely, what did they, they mentioned Android once and Google, not at all.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And they really are trying to do it.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   They're trying to differentiate themselves from the slew of Android phones.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   They're trying to create their own ecosystem, their own sort of proprietary app universe on that phone.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And I think they're probably trying to give people a reason when they go into a Verizon store or an AT&T store to go to that phone as opposed to some other phone and give actually good talking points to carrier sales people when they're trying to sell that phone.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   So it is smart to say, listen, we have all these features that nobody, no other phone has.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So the HTC One might be really pretty, but there's a lot of cool stuff, cool magic to work when you're trying to sell this phone to a consumer in a store.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Right.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And I think, you know, the fact that they can do what is it, 100 photos in four seconds, like you can demo that in a carrier store.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Right.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   You can be like, look, you can, you can remove photo bombs.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And I would say that was a nice feature.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I think I went to, I think some of the camera stuff actually got applause.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And I think that stuff is really interesting.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I think people want to take better photos of their phones.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Now, I don't know if any of it's going to work.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   There's a sense to this.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And this is what Molly is saying about featureitis.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I remember when Microsoft used to do this with Word or with Windows, and they would demo all of these features, endless features to basically flood out the competition.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   So, you know, don't, don't wait for the Mac to get this feature.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Don't wait for Word Pro to get this feature.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Here's a demo of something that works like it in Word or Windows, and they did this throughout the 90s.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And that's, there's a sense of that here.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   It's like, look at all the features.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Like, you want to use a Fitbit with an iPhone?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Guess what?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   We made an Armband in a scale, and now we have S Health.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Is that real?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Is that going to happen?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Is anyone going to buy Samsung's Bluetooth scale?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Maybe.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I don't think so.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I really don't.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   I think they're going, I mean, I don't.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I think people are invested in the Nike system.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   I think there's a lot of people invested in the Fitbit system.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I think those companies actually know what they're doing, and they're building good products.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I think Samsung is like, they work with a Samsung phone, so you don't need to get a Samsung solution.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   But they've just set up like a Samsung area best buy, and then people are like, "I can add this onto my phone, and they're going to buy it."
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Yeah, it's like buying a case.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Well, I'm going to get the wristband in the scale too.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And then it lends a little more legitimacy to the phone.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   If you can walk in, and like you said, Joanne, if the little Samsung mini store is there, and there's all this other stuff, you're like, "Wow, Samsung really has it going on.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   They're just like Apple."
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   And there is no Nike.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I think that's the thing.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I think just like Apple, and I think, you know, all these features, they're sort of what they're going after Apple with these features, but to me, they have to now focus on those features to market it, which is what Apple would do.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And Apple would also make those features really easy to find and use.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And that's how I think they'll really win with the featureitis.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I love featureitis, but I think-
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   You said two words, Nilla, earlier that I think are actually at the root of all this marketing budget.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Interesting article on a Simco Horace Deus talking to an economic analyst from a French or European magazine, and they came up with this graph, which shows that Samsung's been able to do this.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Which shows that Samsung's marketing spend is proportionate to its income.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   In other words, the more they make on the phone, the more they spend on marketing.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Apple's the opposite, the yellow line is Apple.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   It's been going down as a percent of sales.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   So Apple's marketing budget is fairly constant.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Samsung's exploding.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   They've got a ton of money to spend.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   And sometimes when you have a lot of money to spend, you just spend it on stuff that may not be useful.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Sometimes they're spending something like $400 million just to launch the phone.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   That's not the budget for the lifetime marketing.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   That's comfortable as the amount of money Microsoft spent to launch Windows 7.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Yeah, huge amount of money.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   They're very proud of it.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It's more than Apple's ever spent, so I've heard.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And that's just a massive amount of money.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And I think that what they want to do is they want to cement themselves as the Android phone.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   I think there's been a lot of stories about Galaxy taking over as a brand name from Droid.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I think that's tremendously important.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   And I think they want Android to be underpinning.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   They're basically getting Android for free, right?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Google spends all this money developing it.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   They take it and they do whatever they want with it.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And I think they want to be the Android phone.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And I think all these competitors like HTC or LG or whoever, Sony, they're building all these other.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   You're seeing Android fragmentation happen.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   I think it already did happen.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And now I think what you're seeing is consolidation of the market onto Samsung's version of Android.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And I think they've got what?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Android 4.2.2 on the phone.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   So they're not behind, right at this second.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   But I suspect the phone's going to come out in April, May.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   That's what I've been hearing.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And right after that, Google's going to have the next version of Android.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So they're going to be behind again.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   It just doesn't matter.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   It's a two-word phrase.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   But yeah, normal people don't.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I don't think care about that.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   No.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Right.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I mean, I don't think so.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I think some Samsung, I think some Galaxy buyers do because that is an enthusiast phone.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And I think that they'll be a little disappointed.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   But the majority of people at this point, honestly, I think the majority of average consumers are walking into stores and they're seeing iPhone or Galaxy S, whatever.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And that is the decision that they're going to make.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Is your experience like mine?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   The only other phone I see on the subway in New York is an S3.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   The iPhone's an S3.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And that's it.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And every time I see a Galaxy S3 one, I want to like stop him and be like, how did this happen?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Walk me through.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Where did you buy a Galaxy?
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I honestly don't understand.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Like, you know, the ones are great phone or the one X, I guess.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   That was a great phone.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   The new ones are great phone.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   But I just don't expect to ever see them around.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   How many of you see Blackberry Z10s on the subway?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Let me ask you.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Are you using that thing?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I'm rocking the Z10, baby.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I see way more of these.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Are you really?
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Because I have them.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Oh, that's a real Blackberry.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   With that T-horn.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.400]   That is too legit.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.800]   The funny thing is about this, it looks just like an iPhone.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.800]   But with less.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   A lot.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.480]   You know, it's like, why would you buy it?
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   I don't understand.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.720]   Should I talk to your view unit?
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   So I have one.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.400]   I had it charged and I used it and then the battery died and I have not charged it again.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.560]   Well, it doesn't take long to really understand it.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.960]   If you're in the Blackberry world, if you have to use BBM or BIS, then then you can
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   and this is the phone for you.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   And this is the 10 for three weeks.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   But if that is not the phone for you, even then that is not the phone.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.560]   That is the phone that I used exclusively in Barcelona and there's an episode coming up
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.560]   on Tuesday.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.960]   I'm always on that is the road test of it in Barcelona.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.920]   And let me tell you, even if you have to use those, I beg you to wait for the Q10, even
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.800]   then you may not be happy, but there is no reason to buy a Z10.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   It's just, it's terrible.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   I have to.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.480]   Using the Z10 makes me think, oh, I'd like to look at the Q10 anyway.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.800]   The Q10, I love the software keyboard on the Z10.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.440]   Why are we calling it the Z?
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   That's what they call it.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.280]   Because they're Canadian.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.240]   Because they're from Canadian.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.760]   I love that.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.760]   They should have Z health.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.600]   They should have Z wireless.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.440]   Longer lifespan from today.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.640]   HTC or Blackberry, which company, which company last.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.880]   It really has become a two horse race, isn't it?
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.680]   Samsung and Apple, and then a lot of all sorts of.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.200]   What you didn't even mention, Nokia, they're still in the game, aren't they?
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.520]   Oh, I think Nokia is definitely in the game here.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.480]   I do think the 9th, the Lumia 920 is a phone that I would buy.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.560]   I really like that phone.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.880]   I'm really sorry that we broke it because I wanted to use it.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.120]   How did you, because you do these torture tests, what was it that happened to the 920?
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.320]   I drove a snowmobile over it.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.160]   Well, you know, darling, I don't think that's really a good idea.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   Just moff the top of my head.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   I doubt there's many a phone.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.400]   But can't you use that one with gloves?
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.800]   You can use the, don't you know, didn't you worry you at the Samsung event?
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.560]   You can use the S4 with gloves.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.560]   I know you can use the S4, but I think you can also use the Lumia with gloves, right?
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.560]   You can't, that's right.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.360]   All of the Nordic phones you can use with gloves.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.080]   I totally, I have some opera gloves in my closet right there that I was talking about.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.640]   You're like, darling.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.720]   All right, well, let's, okay, so the fact that Samsung barely mentioned Android leads
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.560]   us to the second story, which we're going to take a break talk about.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.040]   Of course, Andy Rubin, moving on, the guy who's been the head of Android for 10 years
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   since before Google bought it.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.200]   And what does that all mean?
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.960]   But that's our next subject and we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:43.200]   Neelipa tell us here from the Verge, from always on, Molly Wood, always ranting Molly
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.480]   Wood and Joanna Stern of Blackberry.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   No, of ABC.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.760]   It which Blackberry is that?
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.760]   It's the bold.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:53.760]   Wow.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   Do you still use that?
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.600]   Does ABC make you use that?
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.000]   Well, they don't make me, but they gave this to me and I love using it.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Uh huh.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.680]   Oh, this is very business like the other day I was with you after the Samsung event, we
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.240]   were hanging out, we're having drinks, we're talking about it.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.760]   And she literally like, Blackberry'd be in the face.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   She was like, hold on.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.840]   And I was like, you just, you just dissed me for a Blackberry.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.640]   I like a phone you can use two thumbs with.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.640]   I do.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640]   I like that.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.880]   I carry an iPhone and the Blackberry right now.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.440]   Oh, you're just like the woman in that Samsung ad.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.440]   You might have gotten my nails done.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440]   I've got them for checks.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.440]   Huh?
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:33.160]   I know there's a unicorn apocalypse ad where they have the one woman in sales or accounting
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   or whatever.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.160]   I have two phones.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.280]   I have my home phone, my iPhone and I have my business phone, my Blackberry.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.640]   You're like that.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.640]   I am like that.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.920]   Why don't you carry one phone that does it all?
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.640]   The Samsung Galaxy S3.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   I may, maybe I'll carry, well, no, I think the Samsung Galaxy S4 does it all.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.960]   The Galaxy S3 has great and support ice roll and all that.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   So that's why there's cool.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   Thank God.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   And then you actually, any friends can have a feature.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   I'm with you.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.320]   One of them is not a Blackberry, although I have taken those keyboard Blackberries.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.240]   Those are like our CNET loaner phones when you're going overseas.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Really?
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.440]   And you know, if you don't have a company phone, they'll give you a Blackberry thing.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.800]   So somebody bought a million, somebody bought a million Blackberries just this week.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   Who was it?
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   Nobody knows.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.800]   Blackberry.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.600]   Just to get the sales figures.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.400]   Have you heard of Rogers Canada?
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.960]   That's probably the balance.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   It was a Canadian.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   It had to be a Canadian.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   It had to be a Canadian.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   Really?
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   The hardware keyboard.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.920]   If there was a great Android phone with a hardware keyboard, I told this to Matthias
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:38.480]   Duarte last year who does the design of Android, I said, "Please, a great Nexus phone with a hardware
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.040]   keyboard and I will stop carrying."
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.240]   And he said, "You are one of maybe 400 people who would buy that."
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   No, he was really used.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.000]   No, I really, I think that would sell like hotcakes.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.680]   I think that the reason that, in fact, to answer that earlier question about HTC versus
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.760]   Blackberry, the reason that Blackberry may end up triumphing is that people will buy
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.480]   the Q10 for that physical keyboard.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   Are you kidding?
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   You know, they could buy right now.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.840]   They could go buy a Droid 4.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   They could have bought a Droid 3.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.840]   They could have bought a Droid 2.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   Don't go married.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   Let me tell you.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   I had a Droid 4.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.840]   I had a Droid 3.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.800]   When I put hands on a Droid 3 and I'd rather die than buy that phone.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   That's right.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   I'm with Molly.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   I have the same experience.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   Where as Molly?
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   It's janky.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Janky.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   Super janky.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.520]   They didn't sell enough to justify turning them into flagship phones.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.120]   They all turned it in niche products.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:32.320]   I think there's a second of older people and people who had hard work keyboards before
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.040]   who were nostalgic for it and things that weren't proactive.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.400]   You're old.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   Olden spirit.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   It's a sexist.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.960]   Hey, I still, I'm still rocking the Microsoft.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.560]   That was S-bull.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   I'm still raking the Microsoft.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.560]   Ken.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   Now, there was a phone.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.280]   Nice keyboard, beautiful form factor.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.280]   I love it.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   Offware.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.680]   And they killed it in two months.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.920]   The only reason that nobody is still using droids is because droids were bad.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.760]   And even the people who had them when they were competitive phones, they fell apart so
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.600]   quickly and the cameras were awful and they bogged down.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.240]   But it doesn't mean that people don't want those keyboards.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:12.720]   And I do still see people, like, reluctantly using the Droid 4 because they want the keyboard.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.400]   And I think that is enough of a selling point.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:20.440]   If BlackBerry gets the damn Q10 out the door, and HTC continues to just like, not market.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.480]   I actually agree with you because this, well, I'm not crazy about this phone.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.720]   BlackBerry 10 is not bad.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   It's fast and snappy.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   It's got some nice features.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.120]   I think maybe this on a Q10 form factor with a keyboard might be a good phone.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.560]   And by the way, I think that software keyboard is like the best software keyboard out there.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.560]   It's okay.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.560]   On the Z10?
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.560]   It's okay.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.920]   You can throw, it makes suggestions and you throw them and...
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.920]   I never really used that.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.280]   I was able to type way faster on that than I could type on the iPhone or my older Galaxy.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.440]   It's more like a small lady fingers with nice nail polish.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   I do actually.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.200]   My sausage fingers.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.000]   I hit three keys with one stroke.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Look at that.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Look at that.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Manicure.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Look at that.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Beautiful.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Oh my gosh.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Manicures and blow dries.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   She has to.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.040]   She's in real TV, Molly.
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.280]   She's in real television.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.200]   No, Molly's way in more real TV probably than I am.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.920]   I get my nails done once a week and I don't know how I've been surviving without S-Wave
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   or AirWave.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   Whatever the hell they're going to call it.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.120]   Why didn't they just call it S-Everything?
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.120]   Some things were like not S-airwave.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.480]   Joanna, don't you find it's emasculating to look at a phone like that?
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.000]   Don't you find that emasculating?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.360]   I wish I could wear Google Glass.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360]   Then you wouldn't be emasculated.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360]   Phones are emasculating.
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   That's what he said.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.360]   That's what...
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.360]   That's what Sergey said.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   That's what Sergey said.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.360]   That's what it's all about.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   At Ted?
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.880]   He said it at Ted.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.320]   That was such a weird way to go.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.960]   And frankly kind of sexist.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   Kidding.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   That's a joke.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   God.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   Well it was.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.000]   Although really that's your thing about phones that they might be emasculating.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.120]   There's a lot of reasons that I might want Google Glass but to sort of just be like phones
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.120]   are over.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.600]   If you think looking over people's shoulder while you talk to them is "masculating" then
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.120]   you're crazy.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.320]   And you'll look crazy wearing them.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.880]   I'm really wondering what the next ad is.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   Thank you Joanna.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.880]   See?
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.920]   Real broadcasters know it's the ads that make the show flow.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   I don't know that that's what she meant but you're written.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   I'm taking it.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   I'm going to take it.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.000]   I don't know what she meant.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.800]   Our show today brought to you by our good friends at Citrix who do that fabulous go to
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   meeting.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.960]   Actually they're people waiting with baited breath because we're going to announce the
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.700]   winner of our iPad giveaway in a moment but first let me tell you a little bit about go
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.700]   to meeting.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.620]   You're face to face no matter where you are.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.820]   I mean successful team is the key to successful business and when you meet face to face you
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.460]   are working more effectively.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.780]   You're getting the job done.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.820]   Not always easy nowadays.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.180]   Businesses spread out all over the globe.
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.660]   Clients all over the place on the go.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:55.540]   So go to meeting makes it possible to work with them wherever they are even on an iPad
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.540]   or an iPhone.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.780]   It is the powerfully simple way to meet and collaborate online and with HD faces you're
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:06.300]   actually seeing each other from wherever you are wherever and whenever you need to connect.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.500]   It's just a remarkable tool for meetings.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.060]   You can now present on the iPad which I think is fantastic.
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.780]   He uses the camera for HD faces.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:17.580]   He uses a microphone and the speakers so you don't have to need a phone line or anything.
[00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:22.660]   You can go out in the garden and enjoy a lovely go to meeting.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.180]   I have to say it's a great way to share screens, work on documents in real time, see the people
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.340]   you're meeting with.
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.620]   It's actually better than meeting in person.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.740]   I love it and I love it so much.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.460]   We arranged to give you an iPad to somebody.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:44.100]   We asked you to tweet where this winter you would like to host a meeting using go to meeting,
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.220]   where you would and why you would and maybe who you would like to meet with.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:53.500]   We asked you to use the hashtag twit iPad and go to meeting and we have, wait a minute,
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   we don't have a winner.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.700]   We got another week.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.900]   I thought we were going to have a winner.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.500]   Oh, that's good news.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.500]   It's not over yet.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.100]   Here's the deal.
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:07.020]   Just tweet where you would like to use go to meeting and with whom and why.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.020]   Make sure you use hashtag twit iPad.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.060]   It's two hashtags and hashtag go to meeting.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.980]   We'll do a random drawing of all the entries next week.
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:16.980]   So you got it.
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:22.900]   It's going to end this Thursday, March 21st at 11.59 Pacific, 11.59 PM Pacific and then
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.420]   we'll announce the winner next week in the show.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:25.420]   I thought we were going to do it this week.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.420]   That's good.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.420]   You got another week to do it.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.420]   Okay.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.260]   March 21st, 11.59 PM Pacific is the deadline.

[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.020]   that iPad.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:55.340]   I got it right here, but I'm not going to show you because you didn't win it yet.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.340]   You got to win it.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:03.660]   But by the way, speaking as long as we're still on the on the phone thing, seeing rumors,
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:07.900]   Neil, I don't know if you had this on the verge of this Nexus five.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.380]   We know that Google I/O is coming up in a couple of months.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.260]   You think it's conceivable that they'll have a next generation Nexus phone.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.260]   I think the Nexus four has been a bit of a failure actually.
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.580]   There's a lot of people on our team who have them.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.140]   The battery life is bad.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.620]   You can't take out the battery.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.620]   You can't take out the battery.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.620]   Normal people.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   It's bad.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.620]   Everyone on our staff complains about it.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.420]   The thing to remember this is different.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.940]   This is the difference of this.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.140]   Google wanted to make a cheap phone.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.300]   This is a $300 phone.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.420]   They weren't they admittedly it's the Google experience phone, but I don't think they were
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.940]   saying this is the phone you want.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.620]   If you have a Google this is the inexpensive Google phone.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.420]   So developers and people internationally can afford it.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.420]   That's a very different thing.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.060]   Are you using your primary?
[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.140]   Well, I carry both, but I primarily use that one.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.140]   Yeah.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:54.140]   I carry two phones.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.980]   But the I had no LTE.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.980]   There's no LTE.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.460]   That's a that's a that's a that's the biggest problem.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.460]   That's a non-starter.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.940]   You know what though?
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:02.940]   I've had so many problems.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.940]   Camera sucks.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   I don't know.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:12.420]   I'm a little bit of a tangent, but I really don't know why manufacturers aren't going after
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.980]   the iPhone more on camera.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.740]   Like it's one thing to come out and say you have 13 megapixels big deal.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.740]   I agree.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:19.460]   Talk to me about the sensor like I couldn't believe.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.940]   But they're using the same sensor.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.580]   They're using Sony sensors.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.780]   This is the same sensor.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.900]   There's something there's magic sauce in what Apple's doing.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.820]   There is magic sauce because there is not a phone on the market that can touch the iPhone
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.820]   5 in terms of the camera.
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.860]   And that is the reason that I'm still carrying that thing.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.980]   Even though I think it's annoying and like kind of lame feeling and the screen is tiny,
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.580]   like I couldn't be more over the iPhone except for the camera.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.580]   For the camera.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.580]   I'm with you.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.580]   And actually it's funny.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.660]   I just switched from Android to the iPhone.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:52.300]   I had the Nexus, the Galaxy Nexus, which was a was a great phone for a while.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.620]   Like you're saying the camera was terrible.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.260]   The battery life was never very good.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.700]   And I've been really happy with the iPhone for the last month.
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:05.140]   So I think what you're seeing here is there isn't a huge difference between any of these
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.060]   phones anymore.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.260]   But I do think that it does seem like Apple's doing something with the camera that makes
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.260]   better.
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.380]   In fact, I'd had hopes that HTC is one with its 4 megapixel camera.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.460]   It's two micron sent pixels might be a better camera.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.900]   Yeah, it's an ultra pixel.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:27.100]   But on the verge you had a review, first review I've seen, I don't know how you did it, Neil.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:31.180]   But it's, but the camera, according to your reviewer, was terrible.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.780]   I mean, it was not, I don't think it's terrible.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.780]   It's a point.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.180]   It's not measured against the claims.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:40.060]   The reality, the reality doesn't match the hype.
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:45.460]   I think it's impossible that you had a pre-pro unit that wasn't yet tuned.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.460]   You know, maybe, but if HTC is handing these things out to reviewers and saying go review
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.700]   this, then there's not much we can say.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.340]   I mean, like, who knows what Verizon is going to do to this phone when they release it or
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.340]   AT&T?
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.500]   You know, I had a Galaxy, the unlocked Galaxy Nexus and it was fine.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.460]   And then I had a Verizon LTE Galaxy Nexus and it was a total piece.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:08.060]   So yeah, we had the manufacturers version.
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:13.340]   Maybe AT&T will make the camera better, but I really would not hold my breath for that.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.340]   By the way, your clock?
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.540]   Yeah, and that's probably the Android phone.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.380]   I was really hoping that the Galaxy S4 would be not so plastic-y and cheap feeling.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.380]   Me too.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:27.340]   I was going to say that you need a battery because it's completely-
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.740]   I haven't dragged a ladder from over there.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:36.140]   Okay, that's just, I thought it was me, but okay, good.
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:44.340]   Anyway, Andy Rubin, moving on in a bit of a shock, actually, announced this week, Wednesday.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:50.340]   He's going on to places unknown and the former head of Chrome and Chrome OS, actually not
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.340]   former.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.140]   He's still his head of Chrome and Chrome OS.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.460]   Sundar Pichai is taking over at Android.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.380]   What does this mean?
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.940]   You know, I think we've been doing a lot of research into what's happening over there
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.860]   and talking to a lot of people.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:13.940]   My gut says that Android is too big and too important for it to be a silo at Google anymore,
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.300]   which I think it has been.
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.660]   I think Google realizes that it has a real chance to go after Windows and to go after
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.660]   Microsoft.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.460]   I think you were just saying, you're not a big fan of Windows 8.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:27.220]   The head of Samsung said Windows 8 isn't hitting with consumers.
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.980]   I've heard that from a lot of companies.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:34.420]   I think Google realizes that everyone's poking around at Chrome OS.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.180]   We have what is effectively a dominant platform on the web.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.980]   People who use our services don't use other services.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.820]   We can make a real play to be the dominant platform in computing in total if we integrate
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.100]   our products.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.540]   I don't think Ruben was fond of that idea.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:53.940]   I think Android was his baby and he was moving forward with it.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:59.180]   You think we're going to see a merger of Chrome OS and Google has two OSs, Android and Chrome
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.180]   OS.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.660]   You're going to see some sort of unification?
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:07.940]   I don't think we're going to flip the switch tomorrow, but I think we'll see.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.060]   If I look at Android in the way it handles the web, I have an X is 10, an X is 7, and
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.260]   an X is 4.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.620]   I actually think browsing the web in Chrome on those devices is less good than using the
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.060]   web on the iPhone in mobile Safari or on the iPad with mobile Safari.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.220]   I think that's kind of a huge shame.
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:31.780]   It's weird that Android has these other alternative apps and they don't really depend on web
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.700]   technology as much as they could and that Android isn't being used to push the web stuff
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.180]   forward the way that Google should be using it.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.100]   I think maybe not a direct integration, but I think we'll see a lot more sharing a lot
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.860]   more collaboration between those teams.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.180]   Why did you say I hope so, Joanne?
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.420]   Joanna?
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.020]   I was just reviewing the Pixel and I've been playing around with it.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:56.860]   I think just so much of the time, why can't I run a...
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.860]   Why is there not some sort of melding here on the app front?
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.540]   It's confusing.
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.980]   I think actually again talking to about that Matias Duarte interview I did last year, he
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:13.100]   said that he wanted Android, again, he's the head designer of Android, he said that he
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.740]   wanted Android to run on every kind of computer.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.780]   When I asked him to say, "Well, that sounds a lot like Chrome because you've got Chrome
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.060]   on laptops now and at the time they had the little desktop too.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.260]   Did I still have that anymore?
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.260]   The desktop box?
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.260]   I forget the Chrome box.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.260]   The Chrome box is still in there.
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.260]   I don't see it for sale on the play.
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:34.260]   I don't see it for sale on the play store, but I guess they have it.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.260]   That was definitely something.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.260]   That's exactly like...
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.100]   And that was definitely the Eric Schmidt.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.980]   The Eric Schmidt vision also was Android on everything, Android in refrigerators, Android
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:50.620]   as a platform, an operating system, and an integrated system.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:55.620]   But it seems weird to me that Ruben wouldn't be the guy to take that vision and run with
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.820]   it if anything it feels like maybe they've decided to double down more on Chrome OS or
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.220]   they've decided to move in that direction.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.420]   They're doing some kind of integration.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.900]   They do seem to be realizing that all these separate things like killing Google Reader
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:16.820]   but folding feeds into Google Plus, driving users, corralling people into different directions,
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.340]   that maybe that is a unification effort.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:23.580]   But the fact that Ruben is leaving makes me wonder if the unification is centered a little
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:24.580]   more on Chrome.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:29.580]   If you were going to bet between Chrome OS and Android, if somebody said, "Well, which
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.580]   is the stronger the two?"
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.580]   You'd say it was Android.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.580]   You'd always say it was Android, absolutely.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.580]   So I don't understand why the Chrome would you?
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.580]   Time out.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.580]   Why would you show?
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.580]   Well, no, no.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:42.620]   I would say that Android has the better brand recognition and the better market penetration,
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:47.020]   but I would also say that if I were at Google, I'd want to pour my resources into Chrome
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.820]   because Chrome has the better potential to make money for them.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.020]   Like Android doesn't make it very much money.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:55.820]   Well, there's that, but Chrome is their product, man.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:01.140]   You go and you download Chrome from Google and it's Google's and it works as Google.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.500]   Android is great, but we've just been talking.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.940]   Android is Samsung's product.
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.140]   They've lost control of Android.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.900]   Well, and that's what I'm saying.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:08.900]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.180]   I have a feeling that if they're centralizing on anything, it's on the product that they
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.180]   control.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.340]   They own that they're gathering your data from that they can make more money off of and that
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.620]   Android actually might be getting pushed aside a little bit and that's why Ruben left.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.860]   Either that or they're going to start a new project at Google with robot.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.740]   Yeah, I mean, you know, the letter was a Larry's letter, Larry Page's letter was more moonshots.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.740]   I mean, and he's staying at Google.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.540]   No, I think it's very cool for us.
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.540]   So far, we don't know.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.980]   I mean, he could have been forced to, that's the same.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.380]   You get the same letter either way.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.540]   We, you know, we wish him the best of luck in all of this.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.940]   I mean, you get the same letter.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.220]   The CEO is not going to say, yeah, we fired him there.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.380]   Guy was, no, it's not.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.860]   You didn't stay at Microsoft.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   Well, that's true.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.180]   She forced to stay at Apple.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.780]   I mean, they're gone.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:54.780]   They're leaving.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.900]   Marissa Meyer stayed until she left though.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.020]   Yeah, but she had a different word.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.660]   She wasn't, you know, everyone, she wasn't the same.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.700]   I was my theory is because Andy Ruben's big into robots.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.820]   That's why the Android logo is an Android.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:08.820]   He loves robots.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.380]   His whole house is roboticized.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.200]   He has when you ring the doorbell, a robotic arm rings a gong.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.200]   He is into robots.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.380]   And I think this is Google's next initiative is robots.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.180]   I don't know why they haven't done more with robots up to now.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.180]   So it's a win-win.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:25.500]   It's what you really want as a Google robot following you on recording your activity
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.340]   and displaying targeted ads.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.540]   Yeah, that's what Google really wants.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:30.540]   That's called Google Glass.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.540]   What are you talking about?
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:32.540]   You have to follow you around.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.540]   You're wearing your head.
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.540]   Perfect.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.100]   So as you got your head, you got glass.
[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.220]   It could be nothing more than the fact that Android is mature and they feel like they've
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   figured out what they want to do.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   And they want Andy to do other things.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   And he might be bored.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.720]   I mean, sometimes it's just that he's bored.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:52.400]   So I'll do this right now, just for everybody's benefit.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   Okay.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   He's going to work on a watch.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   Google watch.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   I think that's the one thing he almost certainly is not going to be telling.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.760]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.240]   I want to talk about Google Reader.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   Why they killed it?
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   What your theory is?
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.480]   This was because they did the Andy Ruben thing and then like three hours later they announced
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   Reader.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   So this is smart.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.580]   They're going to bury the Ruben story with another story that's going to drive people
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.580]   nuts.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.580]   But who knows?
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.580]   We have normal people care about it.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.020]   Normal people don't care about either one of them.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.140]   Normal people want to know how they can use their phone when their nails are still drying.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.380]   That's what normal people want to know.
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.380]   That's true.
[00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.420]   Actually, all I care about is the gardener problem.
[00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.060]   I just because I don't want my video to keep playing when I'm looking at the garden.
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.060]   I know.
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.060]   So annoying.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.060]   I know.
[00:47:37.060 --> 00:47:38.060]   I'm augling the pool boy.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.060]   I do wish I had some wine though.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.060]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.060]   Me too.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.060]   Was the pool boy hot?
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.060]   The pool boy.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.060]   I don't know.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.060]   Me too.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.060]   I apparently loved it.
[00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.380]   There's a lot of people on stage.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.820]   There was just like, I kept wondering like, is that the MC is he now dressed up like a
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.320]   dad is now he over there dressed up like a traveler.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.480]   Why is the Chinese guy now speaking English perfectly?
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   What is the story?
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   What is the story?
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.480]   I will say this.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.660]   There was a little bit of self awareness to all of that.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.660]   Too much.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.660]   Self awareness.
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.600]   They kept saying, oh, ha get the joke or a joke.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   That's the same person much.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   He's not wearing gloves.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   Too much.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   Get it.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.640]   You can see get it a bunch of being aware of how bad your joke.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   There was a lot of this.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.640]   Joke's any better.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:21.160]   I'm telling a joke.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.760]   And the guys don't smash anymore.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.160]   Anyway, they killed the Joe DiMaggio character off.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.400]   He's not there anymore.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.200]   So you watch Smash is what he loves.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.200]   I don't even know what you're talking about right now.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.200]   He loves Smash.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.240]   So what you're admitting is that you watch Smash.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.800]   Does that make me gay?
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:36.800]   No.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.160]   It just it's not that it matters.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.720]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:43.720]   I like Smash.
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.440]   I tried, man.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.440]   I did.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.960]   I made a wholehearted effort to watch Smash.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.520]   I feel any TV show where people burst into song at random moments is fine with me.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.520]   Oh my god.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   That makes me so uncomfortable.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.680]   I have this beard.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.240]   It's almost like a phobia.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.680]   Like I get really embarrassed when people start singing on TV shows.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   Like because it's I don't know.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.640]   I just am always like, no, please God stop.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.040]   I think it's fabulous.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.960]   No, I really like Smash.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.280]   It's got Angelica Houston.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   It's got singing.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   It's got dancing.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.280]   It's sexy.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   It's good.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   It's good show.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   I'll try it again, man.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.560]   There's a word for when you see people on television embarrass themselves and then you
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.000]   yourself are embarrassed.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.640]   It's called a Samsung keynote.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.440]   No, it's like Vajar or something like that.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.720]   And that's what Smash makes me feel.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.920]   I'm just tremendously embarrassed for all of them all the time.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.920]   If I could figure out a way to have this show periodically break out in a song, I would.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.720]   I'm surprised it doesn't.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.240]   More often because it doesn't take much prompting to get Lea to break the song.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   Oh, Danny, boy.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.400]   He's getting ready.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.400]   The pipes.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.520]   The pipes are calling.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.280]   Now what we do is we break out into commercials.
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.920]   And it's time for a green beer.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   Go ahead.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.560]   You may enjoy one.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:50:01.720]   While I talk about squarespace.com, everything you need to create an amazing website at squarespace.com.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:06.440]   In fact, they've added another feature that makes it even better.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.440]   You've seen squarespace.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   We've showed it before.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.960]   It's hosting plus the best content management software out there.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.880]   So it's everything you need.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.400]   And now they've added e-commerce.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.480]   So it makes it so easy to set up your own store.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.480]   So affordable too on squarespace.com.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.640]   Fast merchant account set up.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.680]   You can accept payments right away within minutes, credit card or debit.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:39.440]   A single interface for order management, tracking orders, providing customer email updates, printing
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.800]   shipping labels, coupons.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.720]   They take care of all the taxes and all the different different tax codes and all that.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.960]   They handle that for you.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.440]   For physical goods or digital goods, this is the easiest way to set up a store.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:53.280]   Like I feel sorry for these companies.
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.120]   I've been around for a while with these online stores.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.120]   This is amazing.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.480]   Look at the cost.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.800]   So there's three pricing here.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.040]   Well, first of all, you can go there and try it for free for two weeks.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.120]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.280]   You don't even need our offer code.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.960]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   Set up your site.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.600]   They've got importers for WordPress, Typepad, Blogger.
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.360]   So they can get all the data in.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.880]   And that's everything, including comments, images, all the links are preserved.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:19.600]   So you'll really get a sense of what your current site might look like on squarespace.com.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.840]   Then, after a couple of weeks of trying it and playing with the, you know, kicking the
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.560]   tires, if you decide to buy, that's when you want to look at these pricing.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.360]   And I got to say, it's fantastic.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:30.360]   Oh, I touched the screen.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   My mistake.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.800]   Wow, that surprised me.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   So standard price, when you buy an annual plan, $8 a month, the unlimited plan, which
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:44.720]   is right now the most popular, gives you unlimited pages, galleries, unlimited blogs,
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.720]   unlimited bandwidth.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.720]   You will never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.160]   If all of a sudden, you know, you get slashed out at a week, point a lot of people to you.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   No problem.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.720]   First of all, you can't bring a squarespace site down.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:59.360]   Second of all, you've got unlimited bandwidth plus unlimited storage, a mobile website.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.720]   When you buy an annual plan, you get the custom domain name free.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:04.280]   They'll hook it up for you.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.040]   That's $16 a month purchased annually, $20 a month a month.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.400]   But now look at this new e-commerce account.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:15.200]   Everything you need to do your own store built in, all the squarespace templates work with
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.200]   it.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:21.040]   You get the mobile store as well as a desktop store, fully integrated, physical products,
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.200]   unlimited, digital products unlimited.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.680]   Squarespace does not take a cut of your sales.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.600]   They just ask $24 a month.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.880]   When you buy an annual plan or $30 a month a month, that is a great deal.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.320]   I want you to check it out.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.200]   Squarespace.com, click Try It Free.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.560]   When you decide to buy, do buy an annual plan because you'll get the best savings and you

[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.440]   Try it and then set up your store.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.920]   You were going to love it.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.920]   Let's talk to Tom Merritt.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:04.240]   He's on the other room right now with a little bit on what's coming up this week on TWIT.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.280]   Hey Leo, here's a look at what we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.280]   Today, Wednesday, March 20th, giga-ohm structure data kicks off in New York.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.920]   Might be a couple things come out of that.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:20.240]   Also, Thursday, March 21st, Ignition Mobile happens in San Francisco and that's the anniversary
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.920]   of the first Twitter post that came up on the internet in 2006.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:25.920]   Wow.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.040]   Friday, March 22nd, Eric Schmidt is planning a trip to Myanmar, aka Burma.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.120]   The Blackberry Z10 goes on sale for AT&T at $200.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:43.560]   The Sony Xperia tablet Z with LTE hits NTT Dokomo in Japan and the Nintendo Wii Mini arrives
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.560]   in the UK.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.560]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.560]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.560]   Thank you, Tom.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:51.520]   Molly, you and Tom are doing a show now together.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.520]   We are.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.520]   I'm muted.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.520]   Sorry.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.520]   I'm muted.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.520]   I'm muted.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.520]   It's so great.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   I know.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.520]   We're getting the band back together.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.520]   It's called It's a Thing.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.520]   And it's just a thing.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.520]   It's just a thing.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.040]   It's just our show about things that we think are a thing.
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.040]   It's just a chance for you.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.080]   Is it audio only right now or?
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.480]   Right now it's audio only.
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.880]   And it's, I mean, it literally, it's like the lusi-gusiest kind of trans-spotting, like
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:15.520]   things that were kind of like, you know what?
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.160]   That might be sort of a thing.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:22.780]   People are really into burgers in LA or, you know, not spraying windshield wiper fluid
[00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.480]   on other cars behind them.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   Stuff like that.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:26.640]   Where can we find it?
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.920]   Sometimes there are actual things to real trends.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.000]   It's at it's a thing.me.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.200]   It's a thing that me.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   Wow.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.240]   Or Twitter, Twitter.com/it's a thing.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   It's a lot of it.
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:38.240]   We're having a lot of fun.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.240]   I love it because it's going to be a thing.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.240]   It's a thing.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   I hope so.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   That's a thing.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:44.240]   It's going to be my thing.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   This week, whiskey and issues.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.960]   We have a segment called It's Your Thing.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.960]   It's your thing.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:48.960]   Do what?
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.840]   I know we got to somehow, we got to like, we need to do a Kickstarter just to raise the
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.480]   money to license that song.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   Yeah, because that'd be great.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.760]   Because that's going to be expensive.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:01.040]   So it's like, when people say, is that a thing?
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.240]   You say, yes, it's a thing.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:04.120]   Yes, we go, yes, that is a thing.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.040]   We have identified that as a thing.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.080]   So we talked about like cocktail trends.
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:14.040]   We recorded one that was sort of about how shrub shrubs are a thing in cocktails right
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.320]   now or food trends or fashion trends.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.680]   It's, I mean, it really, it couldn't be more general.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:25.560]   But I also like, we did a recent show where I talked about how I think, you know, that
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.640]   we're, the web is maturing to a point where we don't feel like we have to tolerate comment
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   trolls.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.880]   So there's a lot of conversation about comments and how to deal with trolls.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.880]   That's a thing right now.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.240]   So it's, you know, I mean, it's sometimes it's kind of serious.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.440]   And then sometimes it's totally goofy.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.600]   It's time to be a thing.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.600]   If it's not a thing, it should be a thing.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   Exactly.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:42.600]   I like that.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:44.600]   Sometimes we're trying to create a thing.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   It's a good idea.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   Let's subtly.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.400]   So there's shows about nothing, but yours is a show about thing.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.640]   So there's a show about things that are things.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.080]   Sounds like you have a lot of power to wield there where you're like, well, this shall
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   be a thing.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.800]   I declare this a thing.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.200]   Maybe we'll be tastemakers.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   Ooh.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.400]   Thumbs up or thumbs down.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   It's not a thing.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   It's a thing.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   Not a thing.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   Tequila.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   Like, for example, tequila is a thing.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.560]   Tequila is the new bourbon.
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:12.560]   That's good.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.240]   But mezcal isn't even bigger thing than tequila.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.240]   And that's bad.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.240]   That's not a thing.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   I mean, I'm just saying I've been watching a lot of house of cards.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.240]   Love that show.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   It seems like I could like, I could call it that.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.240]   That's a thing.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   Molly.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   This will be a thing.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.240]   Molly will regret it.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:30.120]   I can promise you that this was a thing.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.320]   I am sad because I have watched.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.400]   You need to have the thing from Adam's family.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.760]   I'd be like, I don't know.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:40.360]   Do you know the guy who licenses the It's Your Thing song?
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.760]   I promise you will be done.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.240]   I finished a house of cards and I'm sad because I can't wait till the next season.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.800]   It's really such a good show.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   That's a thing.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   I mean, it's a long time I was talking like this.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   It's really bad.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.960]   I couldn't stop talking like this for some reason.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:57.640]   Every time I watch that show, I'd be talking like this for a while.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.440]   That's a lot of that.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.880]   You can do that all day, Leo.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.880]   It's a nice accent.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.400]   But what I like about it is he seems like a nice guy eats barbecue and everything, but
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   then he's deep down.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   He's devilish.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.400]   He's a brilliant guy.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.800]   Would you also stop and just address the camera in the middle of the day?
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:14.800]   I do.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.600]   I did that on TNT the other day.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.600]   That's it.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:21.400]   Meanwhile, what Molly doesn't know.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   That's a thing.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.600]   She's not a thing.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.840]   Kudos to Netflix because I'm not a thing.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   Samsung.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.560]   I think Netflix is making that transition between movies by mail to streaming movies
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.320]   now to a content creator.
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.320]   They're the new HBO.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.520]   You think they're going to pull it off?
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.320]   I think they already are.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   I think they already are.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   I think we're in the midst.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.200]   I think what we're seeing right now is the birth of the next networks.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:52.240]   Like the next ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox are being born right now, except their names are Netflix,
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:54.880]   Hulu, Amazon, Twitter, Google.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:00.400]   I just thought of a great segment for your thing.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.040]   The next big thing.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.040]   It's a thing.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.040]   And it's sponsored by Samsung.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.040]   Sponsored by Samsung.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.040]   The next.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.040]   That sounds familiar.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.440]   And you talk about, I don't know, really, the next big thing, but also have to talk about
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.640]   Samsung's craziness.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:15.640]   That's what I don't want.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.720]   Hey, let's see what we missed this week.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:18.800]   We had a good week on Twitch.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:24.400]   Let me just show you some of the highlights previously on Twitch, Twitch live specials.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:28.200]   Where Samsung is expected to announce its brand new phone.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.600]   And we're given this the full Apple treatment.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.000]   And in a way, so is Samsung.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.280]   First time ever, Samsung has launched a phone in the United States.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:41.720]   I think the phone itself, the devices, clearly it's an improvement on the Galaxy S design.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   This week in Google.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.200]   A decade, Andy Rubin worked on Android.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.440]   But a decade of his life.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.840]   I don't think it's anything against Andy Rubin.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.800]   He's done a magnificent job.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:51.800]   But look at Vic.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:57.560]   Vic was all Android and then went on to Chrome, which is a high priority for Google.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.560]   There is life after life in Google.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.560]   Windows Weekly.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:03.000]   It's a new pool game, Paul and I have invented.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.120]   We'll sit in the pool.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.600]   We won't swim because that's dangerous.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.280]   You could have a heart attack.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.200]   And you shot my giver.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.160]   And I'll shout Matlock.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.160]   We're the baddie, Paul.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.160]   Couldn't it be great?
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:20.160]   Paul's proud.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:22.080]   Before you buy.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.880]   This is the Samsung Galaxy Victory, which is a budget phone that runs on the Sprint network.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.960]   And you can notice right away, it's a bulky phone.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.800]   It looks like the old iPhone 3G.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.480]   Like it's just massive.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.480]   Sprint does offer a ton of other phones that would probably beat the pants off of this thing.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.320]   If you want the latest and greatest, this isn't it.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.560]   But if you're looking for a budget phone, not bad.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:43.560]   Twit.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:47.760]   Don't make me come back there.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   Make sure you watch all week long live at Twit.tv.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   Now, what was that?
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:54.160]   How long did you guys spend on the Galaxy Victory?
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.560]   How much of your life did you spend talking about the Galaxy Victory?
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   I know.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.560]   Three minutes and that was over.
[00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.560]   I feel like I just spent too long watching that little one.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   I know.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.560]   I was like, that was it.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.560]   It was done.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.560]   It was done.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560]   We got to review them all.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.760]   It's just we're trying to get a complete set.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.840]   That's really nice of you.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.640]   He's got to do it.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   So what is it?
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.440]   What is that word that when you watch something that's embarrassing and then you're embarrassed?
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.240]   Vijay Jay, what was it?
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.240]   Vodja.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.440]   That's what it's called.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440]   Vodja.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.440]   Vodja.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.640]   I don't know how to spell it.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.440]   Like slightly related to Shaden Freud.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.120]   Yeah, it's like the opposite.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.240]   It's like the embarrassment of Shaden Freud.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.640]   How do you spell Vodja?
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.240]   I'm looking at it.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.240]   Hold on.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   I had you guys full-screened.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.040]   Let's see here.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.840]   V-A-J-A?
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.320]   You get to, you get to the jazzle real quick when you start typing involved.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.320]   Yeah, I know.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.160]   I think I might have to go to the urban dictionary for this.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.200]   No, you don't want to do that.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   Chris, that's always a mistake.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.320]   Holly Gaunt was telling me about it the other day and that's what he was saying.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.040]   I think he was making it up.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.880]   No, it's a good, it's a real thing.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880]   You see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.880]   me all kinds of link.
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880]   The chat room doesn't even believe it.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880]   Is it just empathy?
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.880]   Empathy.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:06.880]   Yeah, that's empathy.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.960]   But so this is, are you embarrassed that they're embarrassed or do you feel embarrassed by what
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.440]   you perceive to be embarrassing behavior?
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.840]   No, seriously embarrassed and like hide under covers when I watch television and people
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840]   get embarrassed.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:17.840]   And people on TV are embarrassed.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.840]   There is a German word for that.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.520]   Oh, see, I just feel that way when they start singing.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.320]   As soon as they start singing, I start to get.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.000]   You're describing what it's like when you watch girls.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.320]   I love girls, but when she's playing bink bong naked, I get v-j-j or whatever it is.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.320]   Right?
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.680]   Yeah, I think that's what we're all describing.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:39.880]   I felt for actions done by someone else, Fremd Sham, it's the new Schadenfreude.
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:40.880]   Wow.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.880]   Friend.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.880]   Thank you.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   F-R-E-M-D-S-C-H-A-M.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:46.480]   But that's the German.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.480]   I don't know where Vajj comes from.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.480]   I'm from Sham.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   Sham felt for actions done by someone else.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   I love that.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.480]   I get that a lot.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.480]   It's a good word, too.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.800]   That's a good word to have.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   That's a good word to have.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800]   And you're totally right.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.880]   That's the word that you apply to girls and that Larry David show.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.280]   Yeah, Fremd Sham for that.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.680]   And the UK version of the office.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   Like...
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.080]   It can't take it.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.680]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.680]   It's W-A-H-J-A-H.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.480]   Wajj, embarrassment by proxy.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.280]   The court feels you most pronounced when the person is making you fool of himself is so
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.080]   earnest in what they're doing or saying, "All right, you don't know."
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080]   Where are you reading that?
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.080]   I know where you're reading that.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.880]   That's the urban dictionary.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.880]   Yeah, but it's like a thing.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.480]   It's like a people's...
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.680]   It's going to be a thing when it's on "Molly Show."
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.680]   It's about to be.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.680]   Next week on "It's a Thing."
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.080]   "Vajjj, is it a Thing?"
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.080]   I don't know.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:47.480]   It's always the games journalist who told me about this because they always go to games
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:53.480]   events and it's like Sony's PS4 event was for that.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.480]   That was Wajjah.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.880]   And so was this Samsung Galaxy S4 event?
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.880]   Yes, Wajjah is exactly...
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.880]   Is it Wajjah or Wajjah?
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:00.880]   Wajjah.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:01.880]   And where to come from?
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:02.880]   What language is that?
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.680]   No idea, man.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.680]   It came from games journalism, is my guess.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.080]   I bet they made it up.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.600]   It came from the urban dictionary.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.680]   Let the Eagles soar was extremely Wajjah when John Ashcroft sang it.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.880]   Oh, it was a point down in that message words, of course.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.880]   2007.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.880]   Because you need a word for it.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   What other word?
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.880]   But of course, the Germans have had a word for it a long time.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.880]   I'm having it.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.880]   So, Google Reader...
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.880]   I don't know.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.480]   Some say, "Oh, it was obvious.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.480]   The writing was on the wall.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.880]   It was inevitable Google would close it to me."
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.480]   It was like straight out of what?
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.280]   Google's closing Google Reader in July.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.880]   People who I think are most upset about this are tech journalists.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.880]   No, not tech journalists.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.880]   All journalists.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   All journalists.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880]   It's all journalists.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.880]   It's all people who deal with media in the press.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:50.880]   They're pissed about it.
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.880]   And yet there is a petition with 100,000 signatures...
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.120]   And Google will not care about.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.120]   Which Google will go?
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.120]   Yeah, right.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.760]   Tell me when it's 100 million signatures then maybe.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.640]   They have a Python script that says signatures equal greater than or equal 1 million.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.440]   Otherwise it rejects it.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.800]   So, here's what...
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.880]   There's been a lot of conversation.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.120]   I think it's true.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.200]   I think for normal people, Twitter and Facebook and other social channels have taken over
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.600]   for Reader in RSS.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.040]   I don't think...
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.120]   I think that's fine.
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.680]   But Deato Bowen wrote a big editorial about why RSS is still important for us last week.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.520]   A lot of people who are listening to this show are listening on an RSS feed.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520]   Oh, sure.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.880]   But the RSS feed has been repurposed into iTunes or a podcatcher or something.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.440]   It's still an RSS feed.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.600]   I think RSS feeds actually.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   I think RSS feeds are just like...
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.040]   That's like saying SMTP is important because everyone uses email.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   Well, it is.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040]   Well, right.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.840]   But it's not a front-facing technology.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.240]   It's how it's presented.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:54.680]   Right, RSS has been generally replaced by a button, whether that button is follow or
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.720]   add to or, you know, by a contact.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.000]   Well, but it's also a different context.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.600]   You know, Dave Weiner, who invented RSS or was one of the people of been in RSS, actually
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600]   had an interesting quote.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.520]   He said, "You know, maybe it's appropriate because the inbox metaphor for content where
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.920]   I've got 3,000 unread articles in my inbox, which is basically what Google Reader tells
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   you."
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   He says, "I don't use that anymore.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.680]   I do the River of News," which is more like Twitter, Facebook, "where it's flowing by.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680]   Dip in.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.680]   I read.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680]   I move on."
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.400]   So here's Deeter's point, which I thought was really tremendous.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.840]   I never thought about this way.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.000]   That's great if you're like an internet nerd and you spend all day in the River of News
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.640]   looking at stuff and tweeting.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.120]   And that's real time.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.600]   And I think real time has replaced a function of RSS, which was here's what's happening,
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.080]   right, it's happening.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:47.360]   But RSS also has this secondary time-shifting DVR for content purpose, which is I'm reading
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360]   my feeds.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.360]   What the hell happened today?
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.600]   Like, what did, how, you know, we publish 50 articles a day on the Verge.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.960]   Like, you can't get those all in real time because it takes 24 hours to do it.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:04.800]   And if, unless you're watching our site all day, every day, which you should be, that means
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.760]   you don't sleep.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.040]   Just keep getting refreshed.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.200]   How are they going to do that when they're so busy watching CNET?
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   I know.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200]   And I hear ABCs from it.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.200]   And ABC News.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200]   And ABC News.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.360]   You can watch as whenever you want, folks, I don't care.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.000]   Well, you've got to wait in a S pop-up window.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.680]   Yeah, you do whatever you want with Twitter.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:29.680]   But really, I think for a lot of people, there is that, which is if you want to follow
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.960]   something and you don't want, you can't be in real time, which is the vast majority
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.320]   of people I suspect, RSS fills that role for you.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320]   And it's important.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.440]   And I think Google Reader was so good and served as the underlying foundation for so
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.000]   many other RSS readers.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   But people are not complaining about it, I think, is that Google basically wiped a market
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.160]   in an instant by saying, "We're going to kill Google Reader."
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.120]   Worse than that, they started killing it a year ago.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.600]   They started taking out features, moving share to Google+.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.800]   If it died, it's because Google actively killed it.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   Right.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.640]   But RSS, I mean, that's like saying Google's going to shut down Gmail and the market for
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640]   email will go right.
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   Right.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   Well, and that's the good news.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:17.040]   They say, "Sign up, half a million Google+ or Google Reader refugees."
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.200]   But it's not quite the same.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.240]   I mean, I'm looking at my Feedly feed.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.520]   It's more of a magazine than what I would really like.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.360]   If I look at my tech news, instead of the articles all being lumped together, they're
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.000]   organized by source, that's not what I want.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   Right.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   You want a big list of that.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.360]   You want something more bare bones and techie.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.360]   I want a pile of news that I can scan.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.360]   Right.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.480]   And I think that there's a lot of news junkies in the world.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.000]   And I think the market to replace Google Reader was not a good one.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.120]   I mean, building a one for one replacement for Google Reader while Google Reader existed,
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.520]   I think was a stupid idea.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.760]   And I don't think a lot of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are running around trying to
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.760]   do that.
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.040]   Now the Google Reader is gone.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.280]   I think the market to try to actually replace that experience for journalists and other
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.520]   news junkies is there.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:10.160]   And I will tell you, all of our people use Google Reader.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.600]   Joanna and Molly, I suspect you do too.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   Leo, you are.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.160]   Every tech journalist I know does.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.680]   I have to invest that I actually don't.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.160]   Like I was shocked that they were killing it.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   And I don't know why.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.160]   How do you get news?
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.640]   I use, I go to websites.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.640]   And I use Twitter now.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   I use Twitter.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.640]   I use Twitter.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.960]   I use Google Reader every morning.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.720]   And Twitter is harder to go back and see what happens, right?
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:34.720]   Because there's such a flood of stuff.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.040]   But all day, I used to watch Google Reader.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.280]   Now I just watch Twitter.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   You guys can just do the virtual.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:40.520]   I watch Twitter all day.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.320]   And I really, and I have to admit that some of the stuff they've done around discover and
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.720]   discovery is really, really useful to me.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.320]   It actually has turned into a nice, helpful digest.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.720]   And then to be honest, instead of using Google Reader, I use Google News.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720]   Really?
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.960]   Yeah, I use Google News or tech.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   I use Google News.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.040]   I tech me is the first place I go because I like the idea of articles being surfaced
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   by interest.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:08.960]   So I also use things like Prismatic, these social news readers, Nuzzle, that are designed to
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.920]   kind of surface stuff via Twitter, Facebook and other social signals based on interest.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920]   And that--
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.680]   Right, when I'm not working, I use like Flipboard or Pulse.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.680]   Flipboard's awesome.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:19.880]   This 360 to read on my iPad.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.960]   But like, during work hours, that's not a great solution.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.960]   What's wrong with it for work?
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:26.960]   Is it too slow?
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960]   It's too pretty.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   Too pretty.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   It's just pretty.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:30.960]   It's like, that's more of like a lean back.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.240]   You want to read and look at these photos and maybe go watch a video when I'm at my computer.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.880]   I'm doing that lean in experience, as everyone's been saying.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.040]   I'm copying links and I'm reading and I want to write or assign something.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.040]   By the way, thanks to the chatroom I found a view on Feedly that is closer to my Google
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040]   News view.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.320]   If I click all, I'll see all the articles in a chronological fashion.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.040]   It's much more like Reader.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.520]   I love the chatroom.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:57.520]   They're so helpful.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.040]   Yeah, so there is an opportunity for third parties like Feedly.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.680]   Maybe it's not a big business for Google, but half a million users, new users is a big
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680]   deal for somebody like Feedly.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:09.480]   Can I ask you a question though that I've been wondering about this?
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.680]   Google usually kills off products and it's always like that no one's using them.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.840]   But in the case of Reader, why couldn't they just leave it alone?
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   I wondered too.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.280]   I was, in fact, I think I tweeted something about that.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:26.680]   Like, how expensive or difficult is it to actually maintain Google Reader and keep it
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   alive?
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:29.680]   I think it's all about--
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.680]   I know.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.680]   --to Google Plus.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:32.680]   I know.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.680]   I know.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.680]   I didn't realize an answer, but I'm not sure we want to hear it.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680]   So here's the thing.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.560]   So Google had no dedicated employees on Google Reader--
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.560]   None.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.560]   --for at least the past year.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.560]   I would say.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.160]   Zero employees running Google Reader.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:50.120]   And when it had problems, they would have to divert people from Google Plus on to Reader.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:55.760]   And the second thing is that running it isn't-- if relative to Google, running it isn't
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:00.720]   expensive because Google has massive amounts of processing power and data storage and
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   all that.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:07.080]   But running a cloud feed service for people is tremendously expensive.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.080]   Just think about--
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.600]   No, they're not going to stop running a cloud feed service.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.120]   They're going to redirect all of that delivery into Google Plus.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.120]   So Google--
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.480]   That's really what happened here is Google saying we want you to use Google Plus, even
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.840]   if it's a poor fit, even if it's completely different.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.880]   And you know what, nobody freaking uses Google Plus.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.400]   Can we just acknowledge that?
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.360]   I use it to share because apparently it's better for search.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:33.280]   I-- that's exactly why I use it.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.120]   So Google has shown on you and you're using it.
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.120]   They have totally--
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120]   They have totally--
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120]   --aimed it.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.840]   Every company, every journalist, and every personality is using Google Plus because the
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.280]   second that you post something there, you instantly get a Google News result with your
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.200]   name in it or your company name in it.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:57.000]   And if you want more proof that they are gaming their own results and their own search results,
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.080]   you look no farther than they want to one response from posting something on Google
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.840]   Plus to seeing a Google News alert.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.440]   Yeah, and don't judge us for being SEO.
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:06.440]   Hors.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.440]   So--
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.440]   Wow.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.840]   And that will capture being a discussion about sexism and technology.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.840]   It's not sexist.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.840]   SEO.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:14.840]   Sexism.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840]   I don't--
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.840]   Yes.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.840]   SEO.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:18.840]   As sexy.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.840]   Is that a word?
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   Sex--
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.840]   Sex--
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840]   Sex--
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840]   Sex--
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:24.840]   S-Horse.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.640]   So I don't use Google Plus, maybe I should start, just for the SEO benefit.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   I will say this.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   Sometimes there's good conversation.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.440]   There is because the people are making fun of me, but it's totally fine.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.680]   So few people use Google Plus that it's an intelligent bunch of people and it's the
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.400]   best way to see what Google people are doing.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.400]   Right.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.400]   And lots of guys.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.560]   It's a very male-centric audience into tech.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.840]   I do get proposed pretty often on Google Plus.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.840]   Do you?
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.480]   Do they say, will you marry me or is it a different kind of proposition?
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.480]   No, it's usually--
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:58.440]   Well, it's usually will you marry me, but then there's a lot of them that are in non-English
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.360]   character languages that might be dirtier, but I don't really know.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.400]   They say, you plus me equals us.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   That's really good.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.520]   A little Google Plus, man.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.520]   I ask love you.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   I ask love you.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520]   Well, what this shows--
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.200]   I ask plus us equals-- you plus us equals us.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.200]   Oh.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.200]   Oh.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.480]   And totally does equal us.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.480]   Joanna Smart.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480]   There's no eye in us.
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   There's a super interesting position in San Francisco.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.520]   Joanna's good at math.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.520]   What was the phrase?
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.880]   Wait, but Samsung had a phrase that they were using as their marketing line.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.480]   Oh, the tagline was terrible.
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480]   Life companion.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   Life companion.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.240]   That was the thing that we were all making fun of before the 1950s ladies came out.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:45.320]   Is that like a pillow that I'm going to marry?
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.560]   So I have a theory about this.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.000]   And I have this book in my shelf over there.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.040]   I don't remember who wrote it, but it's called The Conquest of Cool.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.400]   And it's basically about madmen era advertising.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   Oh, I got to read this.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.520]   The counterculture in the '60s was subsumed into advertising in America.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.480]   So irony became the dominant mode of American and thus Western communication.
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.480]   Right?
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.640]   Everything were too cool for everything.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:17.200]   Hitting something right on the nose doesn't work for American consumers and American tastes
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.680]   because the counterculture so dominant.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.720]   So you have to be ironic or sarcastic or funny or whatever.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:29.000]   I think Samsung's presentation and Broadway is a combo effect are sort of immune to this.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.040]   It's they're big and they're cheesy and they're brave and they're not brave.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.560]   They're bold and how earnest they are.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.000]   I think there was a lot of life companion is an example of that.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.480]   When I was in Dubai a few years ago and I just remember seeing the billboards for real estate
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.240]   and it would straight up be like buy this condo and your life will improve and thinking
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.080]   myself that would never fly in America.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.000]   But it's just it's just the lack of irony that I said it in my live blog at the S.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   Wirvin a few times.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.800]   There's no irony here.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:03.200]   There's this like camp self awareness, but there's no sense of detachment or cynicism
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.200]   about the product.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.440]   They really think it's your life companion and that waiting at your phone will improve
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.400]   your life.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.280]   That's the sense I'm getting from all of what Samsung is doing right now is it's it's so
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.680]   earnest and so on the nose, direct about what they're trying to accomplish that they're
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.680]   missing.
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.600]   They're just they're floating over the sense of irony that I think we all have about how
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   we're marketed to.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:28.000]   Well, and I think they could have actually played they could have gone with earnest, right?
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.960]   I mean, you can't say that Apple's presentations are not a little bit earnest or at least very
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   earnest.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.080]   Yeah, I mean, they're yeah, they're extremely earnest and they're really are promising this
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.080]   incredible thing.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.280]   I mean, Samsung's language, it's true.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.200]   And I think that sometimes the language or the presentation does make Americans feel a
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.320]   little uncomfortable because it is sort of right in your face and really lovey.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:53.040]   But I almost felt like if anything, they were trying too hard to be sort of ironic and self
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.480]   aware in this particular presentation.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.200]   It's weird because sometimes Samsung when they nail it with advertising, they really
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.920]   nail it and they did manage to build up this reserve of cool.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.280]   The line campaign was absolutely brilliant.
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.040]   But then when they don't nail it, when they do these sort of, you know, they'll do these
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.680]   weird like YouTube campaigns where the people are all really white and they're all on the
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:20.320]   verge of singing and it's and it's just like, what do you, well, like the for the one that
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.160]   they did for the phone that had the projector built in, where it is unbelievably earnest
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.560]   and it almost feels like and it's very likely actually they have two totally different
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:34.040]   ad agencies working on this kind of thing, many, many different, but it's I mean, they
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:38.280]   need to like just centralize on the one that has a little cause after because the reason
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.120]   that Apple wins is cool.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   Right.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.640]   And I think this is I don't want to veer too far into this, but I think there is a big
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.840]   difference in tone and content when Samsung US and Samsung Mobile US are speaking to US
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.160]   consumers and they're the ones behind the line ads, for examples.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.500]   And when Samsung headquarters in Korea is doing the top down speaking and I don't know
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:08.680]   Samsung has 500 ad agencies and 300 PR people and it's it's a joke in the tech press but
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:13.160]   how disorganized and disconnected all of these different pieces can be when you're when
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.320]   you're dealing with them.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:22.920]   But I suspect that some of this wild, like disparate tone comes from here's one one regional
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:28.160]   organization doing this versus another regional organization and I the reality behind it,
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.940]   I don't know if anybody will ever figure out until like the one disgruntled Samsung
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:37.440]   marketing manager comes for and speaks about it because it says it's chaos.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:39.440]   I'm ordering a sport.
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:40.440]   I didn't have a tag.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.440]   I kind of say though, I didn't have a tag.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.000]   I mean, even though it was kind of cheesy, I didn't have a terrible.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.440]   I mean, I think my phones kind of are my life companions.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.600]   That was that could have been a team done right.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.600]   That would have resonated me.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.560]   I'm just saying we go to bed together like we sleep with our phones.
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.920]   Me and my phones are really tight.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:00.320]   I eat breakfast every morning.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.520]   They're next to the bed.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.840]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840]   That's depressing.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.840]   But I think it's true.
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.840]   That could have worked.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840]   That could work.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.840]   Did it right?
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:08.840]   What?
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:09.840]   U plus s equals us.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.240]   I'm just saying that's going to happen to you.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240]   I'm less s equals us.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.880]   Who's going to ask you for Samsung or for Google plus or for me?
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.840]   Oh, now we're mixing the message here.
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.600]   By the way, Thomas Frank, the conquest of cool business culture, counterculture and the
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.760]   rise of hip consumerism.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.760]   1190 on Amazon.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   You like it?
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.360]   And this guy just became a sponsor for the show.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.600]   No, I just want to come and buy it.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.600]   I'm going to buy it.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.440]   No, he's getting a great plug.
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.360]   Now, this is like a is just here.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:37.960]   You want me revealed to watch about myself?
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:41.480]   I love reading books about America when I'm not in America.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.720]   And I was one of the ones I read, 100.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.640]   And what do you read when you are in America?
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.440]   That I go to bed with my phone.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.440]   I read your book.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.440]   Was your book revealed?
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   Slate.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:57.160]   Slate created on Friday after the after the close of Google Reader or the announced close
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.360]   of Google Reader, the Google graveyard.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.960]   It's hard to lose a loved one, especially if that loved one is a Google service.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:08.240]   You can plant flowers on the graves and let the healing process begin.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:14.480]   Like, I'm going to plant a flower on Google Reader that'll make 32,574 flowers.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:17.280]   I Google not so much Google Labs.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.720]   Yeah, I kind of miss Google Labs.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.680]   Google Wave, not so much Google video.
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:23.680]   Google desktop.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.560]   In fact, a lot of crap, didn't they?
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.120]   Google video got some soon into YouTube.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.120]   Yeah, that was a sad thing.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.720]   Actually, you know what?
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.720]   I'm going to put a flower on that grave, too.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.280]   Isn't this good?
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.280]   You made this say?
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   This is from Slate.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.280]   Oh, sorry, man.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.280]   I really like this is that.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.280]   Wow.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.480]   There's a lot of stuff here in that Google fast flip.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.200]   Yeah, not so many flowers in that one.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.360]   It's interesting that you can really tell.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.920]   There's frugal on there.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.400]   Oh, I'm sure frugal's here.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.400]   Let's see.
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400]   There's an all frugal.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400]   Frugal.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.360]   Oh, I'm going to put a flower on Jiku.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.360]   Oh, Jiku.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.880]   I totally remember when everybody was doing that for like a week.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.560]   And here, look, they've already got the grave for Google Glass.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.600]   That is not cool at all.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.600]   That's amazing.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600]   That's great.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.240]   That is also S-Bolt.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.240]   I heart Google Glass.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.800]   I can't even wait for that.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.800]   I really have really molly wood.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:16.800]   Really?
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.920]   You're going to go around.
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.120]   We're in first of all, you don't wear glasses.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120]   Nope.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.960]   So you're going to wear glasses just so you can do that.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.960]   Yep.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.440]   Many of us had Lasik surgery where contacts have gone to great expense.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.440]   Not to wear glasses.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.880]   I wear contacts too.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:34.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.760]   So Google is so persuasive that you're now going to go back to wearing glasses.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.760]   I mean, there is no incline coming.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.280]   Any place I happen when I'm wearing those glasses, I will totally set myself apart as
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.280]   like a member of the awesome--
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.760]   Yeah, because nobody's going to let you into anywhere.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:52.760]   I know.
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.120]   You won't be able to go to a bar, a gym, a club.
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:57.440]   They're going to say no, sorry, glass.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.440]   It's true.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440]   The privacy and also the--
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.440]   I don't go to any of those places anyway.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.680]   Yeah, I'm just going to be at home with your cat.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   I don't have a cat.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   You beat my phones.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.680]   Yeah, with my life companions.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.960]   I'm just going to be doing my normal thing with my life companions.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:18.800]   I can't wait for the first twit where the entire panel, including me because I have
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.240]   the reservation, is wearing glass.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:27.880]   And we're all looking a little bit off camera to the right and up and distracted.
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.880]   That's going to be--
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.840]   It's not going to be the snappiest conversation.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.840]   No.
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:39.120]   And Google announced the first apps now for Google Glass, which make no sense at all the
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.120]   New York Times.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.760]   Yeah, they really make no sense.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.760]   Come on, I'm not going to--
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:43.760]   Was that really?
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.320]   Well, I don't want to consume media.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.480]   The only apps I want are the ones that are currently part of the Google Now cards.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.840]   Because those Google Now cards rock my world.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.400]   I love how that phone.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.200]   It knows me so well, my life companion.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.400]   It will pop up a little thing.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.680]   It'll be like, hey, sweetie.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.200]   I thought you need to know that there's a traffic jam during your commute hour.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.200]   So you have a question.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.200]   It'll ask you to.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   And that's what they're doing.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.200]   That's what they're doing.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.200]   So they feel the whole UI.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.200]   I want that.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:15.840]   Wait, Molly, so in your mind, your Google Now's voice is a very well-meaning, like, Minnesota
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.840]   mother.
[01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.640]   Hey, that's what I heard.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   Hey, sweetie.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   No, it's her mother.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.440]   You want to know that there's a special on soup.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.440]   That's your mother.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   That's her mother.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.480]   So, you know, I went ahead and I got your frappuccino because I know you're going to
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.280]   be in the car for a while.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.280]   I got it.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.160]   I see what Google Now's doing for you.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160]   It's cool.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.000]   Hey, did you wear a blazer today?
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   It's kind of cool.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   Are you from Minnesota, Molly?
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   North Dakota.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   I went to high school in North Dakota.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Oh, my God.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   You are Fargo.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Oh, I come by it, honestly.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.920]   You know, this is not this is not what I'm.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.360]   This is a real me.
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:56.320]   You actually do look like you could be wearing a parka and I could see you there.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.320]   Oh, heck yeah.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.600]   I can shovel your driveway in about 10 minutes flat there.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.600]   If you need me to.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.600]   It's a thing.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.600]   That's great.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.600]   Wow.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:11.240]   It's true that whenever I emulate any kind of caring voice, it always comes out that
[01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.240]   way.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.240]   It's your mother.
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.240]   That's why.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.240]   I guess so.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.240]   Don't channel it's my mom.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.920]   Does your mom watch all your shows?
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.360]   Oh, heck no.
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.320]   Does she even know?
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.520]   Does she even know what you do?
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.120]   Not totally.
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:30.560]   Sometimes when I put it to Facebook, she'll go ahead and like it.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.640]   She does that computer thing.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.840]   So I don't know what she's.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.800]   She's in the California now.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.800]   Doing that computer thing.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.960]   My parents really only engage with what I do when I go on CNN.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.000]   Yeah, like it's something that I've learned.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.440]   Well, that's real media.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.400]   That's why Joanna Stern's parents are so damn proud.
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.000]   I will say that I get a lot of emails from my parents friends.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.400]   We saw you on TV.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400]   You were fabulous.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.240]   We saw you talking about a phone in a cab.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.640]   You're that a lot.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.640]   Don't.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:04.040]   It's amazing.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:09.600]   New York Times, Evernote, again, something I don't really want to look at.
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:10.600]   Evernote would be helpful.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.760]   I guess if it's if it's send to Evernote, like send that to Evernote.
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.760]   It does.
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.560]   Send that to Evernote.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.560]   That's the house.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:19.560]   You say, "I'll take glass."
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.560]   Send to Evernote.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.000]   I want to remember this one.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   That's what you do.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   I'm going to take a little bit of a shit to my Evernote.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   Put her in.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   Oh, God.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   And if I was like, I have an Evernote list for wines I like.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   So if I'm at the store and I can just be like, and it's good.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   That's good.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   Evernote's useful.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   You'll be that crazy person in the aisle.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   Yes.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   Talking to one.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   Talking to yourself.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   I like that wine.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   That's good wine.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   Definitely good wine.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   Definitely good wine.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   Keeps doing this.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   I don't.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   I think it's...
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   It's a little cold, don't you?
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   And there's a sense of tempo.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.360]   Well, I'm not making it up.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:02.000]   I've seen people, crazy people do that.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.320]   I'm not swiping you off this thing.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.320]   The glasses.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.400]   See, the problem, you're confusing it with if I had the implant, then that would look
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.400]   weird.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:11.400]   Ooh, I would like the implant.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   Then I'd be waving and moving my eyes.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:16.160]   But if I had the glasses, they immediately marked me as a member of the DeGirati.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.880]   And they're so very attractive.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.080]   Well, if they put it in a hat, I'd wear it.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:22.840]   I like hats.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.440]   So, ever note New York Times Gmail, so you can get your mail.
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:27.440]   That's good.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.440]   And Path.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.440]   And Path.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.440]   And Path.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   Let your imaginary friends know what you're doing.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.240]   It's good for taking pictures of food.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.840]   Let your three friends on Path know.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:36.840]   I'm your friend.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.680]   I was excited about Path because then it would remind me that I have to use Path.
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.480]   You never post on Path, Joanna.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   I never post on Path.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.800]   Well, I'm following you and expecting something.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   I want something.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.520]   I want to see a picture of something.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.920]   Just put a picture.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.560]   When I get my glass, I'll remember to use it.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:57.160]   Maybe that'll be suddenly everybody will be hot air ballooning and taking kayak rides
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.160]   through other rapids.
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160]   It'll be so great.
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   No, everything.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.120]   If you're a social network user and you live in California, you're always having adventures.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   Right.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.120]   It's just way it goes.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.680]   That's somebody said that it's going to be the photo record of the 1%.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.520]   Oh, boy, that is hurtfully true.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.520]   That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:18.080]   Which kids on Instagram is going to be revolutionized by Google?
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.680]   A lot of rich kids on Instagram, by the way.
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.520]   That is so awesome.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.800]   I get the JJ when I look at that one too.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.800]   No, that was hurt.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.800]   I don't know if that's appropriate.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:32.800]   Cricut.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:33.800]   Cricut.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:39.000]   You do not think that word means what you think it is.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.480]   Let's take a break.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.240]   And I'm going to look up rich kids on Instagram and talk about stamps right now.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.240]   Instagram.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.840]   Oh, I love when stamps.com is right.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.200]   I love this one.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   There's a rich kid.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   What do they?
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.720]   So he's got what?
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:59.280]   Dom Perignon and a pack and a drawer full of euros.
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.920]   Yeah, some sort of courage.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.920]   Beach muscles.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.920]   Don't forget the beach muscles and the beach muscles.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:04.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.840]   And he's and he hates his life.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:12.720]   Here I am with a magnum of champagne at my indoor swimming pool and I hate my life.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720]   That's what's best about these.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.160]   These people are so unhappy.
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.400]   Oh, because they're all alone.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.640]   Here's my lonely dog because my yard is too damn big.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:27.240]   I've got a strange hat on and my girlfriend looks like an Indian princess.
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.960]   Have you ever had people more than them?
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:32.920]   Oh, back in my yard, you know, we have a yard is so big.
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:37.200]   We have a special vehicle for navigating it.
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.080]   Ah, I'm just your trash with a big tub.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.720]   Oh, nice watch.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.720]   Big.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.000]   Oh, God.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   What is this?
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.640]   So the guy instagrams his bar bill.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.160]   No, that's bottle service.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.160]   Bottle service.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:59.240]   By the way, hashtag 1% right there is amazing.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.240]   That is so choice.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.240]   Just follow the hashtag 1%.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.360]   So he has a $6,043 bottle bill.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   What is it?
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.880]   That's that's euros on top of that.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.360]   So it's euro.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   So it's roughly $9 million.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:11.360]   That's $6,000.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.120]   Can we just look at this receipt for one second?
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:19.120]   So you've got the ace of spades, which I believe is it's Jay Z's booze, right?
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:24.280]   So that's 10,000 pounds worth of ace of spades.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.440]   So that's and then you've got five, you know, for three grand and then you've got 13 red
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.440]   gold for 65 euro.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.440]   Oh, who's drinking that?
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.440]   Ooh, strawberry daiquiri.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.440]   Starberry daiquiri.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.440]   I love it.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.080]   That sounds so good right now.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.080]   That's for the girl.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.800]   Yeah, there's a girl there.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.800]   It's all guys and one girl.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.440]   Tell Samsung that sounds really good to me.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.120]   They can feel better for their next day.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:46.320]   I love a strawberry daiquiri right now, Samsung.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.320]   Sorry.
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.760]   We are really living up the stereotype right now.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:52.760]   Is that Snoop Dogg's bar?
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.400]   Let me put on my lip balm.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.440]   If you guys are ahead of my ami.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:57.440]   Let me just ask you this.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.560]   By the way, he cut the tape, the tip in half.
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:01.320]   So he's double douche bag.
[01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.080]   Oh, let me ask you a question.
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.880]   Have you ever had an ami vice?
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.720]   No, what's that made out of?
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.120]   One astroberry daiquiri, one half pina colada.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120]   Yeah, I've had that.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.120]   In one glass?
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.120]   One glass.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.120]   It's good.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.120]   It's really good.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120]   I like to be for a drink.
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:23.040]   By the way, I just want to report that I, when you drink green beer, it does not turn
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.040]   into green tea.
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.040]   I just found out.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   Mm.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.480]   Where, how did you just find it?
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:28.480]   Well, you were talking, Neeliah.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.480]   I ran out.
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:30.480]   Now he didn't even leave the set.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.480]   I got a jar.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.960]   I got a catheter and a jar.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.960]   That's all right.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:35.960]   But it's going on under the table.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   Nothing is going on under the table.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.280]   Let's later tell a report later about this.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.280]   Joanna, do you like stamps?
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.920]   Did you actually say, I like it when you do a stamps ad?
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.320]   Did you actually say that?
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.320]   I do.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.320]   Why?
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.360]   Because I like the idea of customizing your stamps.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.360]   Very cool.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:56.120]   So you don't have to go to the post office to buy stamps anymore.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.680]   By the way, you could print forever stamps.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.360]   You could print your stamps right now from your computer.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.160]   Your printer, you do not need a postage meter.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.920]   Don't let them tell you that you need a post that you don't.
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:05.920]   You don't need special ink.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.800]   You just need stamps.com.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.400]   And what you've already got, your computer and your printer.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.720]   And you can print right on the envelope.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:12.720]   You can print your logo.
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.160]   You can print little fairy hearts and stuff if you want.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.000]   You can intertwine little things around it.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.440]   You can have your return address automatically printed.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.240]   It'll even pull the address of the person you're mailing to from your QuickBooks, your
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.960]   business accounting or your address book on your computer.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:32.160]   Or if you sell on eBay or Etsy or PayPal or anything like that, it'll pull it from there
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.160]   too.
[01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.800]   It's really for people, mailing professionals.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.200]   It's a pro tip for people who do a lot of mailing.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.400]   And I got a special deal for you.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:43.840]   If you go to stamps.com and you see Callie Lewis there, but don't know, I got a better
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.200]   deal than Callie.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.280]   Go over on the right there where it says $80.
[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:53.280]   No, click that microphone and enter in our special Twit code, TWIT.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.480]   Whoa, what did they do?
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.400]   They changed it.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.400]   Where's the code?
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.080]   Whoa, did you click the microphone?
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.080]   I did.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.080]   So now it's here.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.080]   How did you hear about us?
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.480]   And you have to click promo code.
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:31:07.480 --> 01:31:08.480]   Shh.
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.560]   Now it's going to make it hard for you to show because you have to fill out that form.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.560]   I might.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:14.560]   Oh, no, maybe not.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   See?
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.160]   Oh, well, that's too bad stamps.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.440]   I'd like to show you my special offer, but they've hidden it.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.440]   So here's the deal.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:27.920]   If you click that microphone, you can get a $55 in free postage over a first free month
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:28.920]   of your account.
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:29.920]   You get a free digital scale.
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.440]   This is it right here.
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.440]   Beautiful.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440]   This is a USB scale.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.720]   So you plop the letter or package.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.920]   Any class of mail on that.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.880]   And it automatically calculates the right postage, $5 supply kit and a four week trial
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:41.880]   of stamps.com.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.600]   It's $110 bonus value.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.320]   All you got to do is use the offer code TWIT.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.160]   You will know it when you see my face.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.720]   Then you'll know you're in the right place.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:51.720]   Stamps.com.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.080]   Print postage right from your computer.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.320]   Never go to the post office again.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.560]   By the way, you don't have to even bring the packages or whatever.
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.720]   They come and get them.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:03.760]   There's a guy or a gal that goes around every day from door to door and they'll pick your
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.880]   stuff up.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:06.880]   Stamps.com.
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.280]   That joke went over like a lead balloon.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:12.240]   All right.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.640]   We've done rich kids of Instagram.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:16.640]   Google I/O is coming up.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.240]   Are you all going to Google I/O?
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.760]   Big developer comments.
[01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:21.960]   They're going to give out something right.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:25.320]   They gave out last year you got a Chrome box.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:33.080]   You got a Google Q. You have the opportunity to buy a glass for $1,500 this year.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.080]   Who knows?
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.080]   What you got?
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.680]   I'm going to Google I/O again.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   Are you going to go?
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:39.680]   It might be somewhere for that.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:40.680]   It's May 15th.
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   It's May 14th.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.920]   Yeah, I got to book some hotel rooms.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.920]   It's a fun event.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.920]   I like it.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:46.920]   You know what?
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.600]   If you're going, if you're going, we're going to do this week in Google from there.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.000]   Just come on over and say hi and we'll interview you.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.400]   We'll talk to you because it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:02.120]   Now is, we're pretty sure going to be available at Google now for Chrome OS and Windows, which
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.640]   means that that was going to be everywhere.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:06.640]   And I like it.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.080]   Do you think the value of now and not a mobile device though, that's a good question.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.080]   That's what's great about it.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.440]   Well, because it knows your commute and you're about ready to leave and you're on your desktop
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:17.880]   and it says you better leave early.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:18.880]   That's valuable.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:20.880]   You got it.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.880]   I'm wondering because I think we all need another weather widget.
[01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.880]   That's true.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:27.640]   I can't even have enough weather widgets.
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.720]   I like it's weird.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:35.160]   I wouldn't mind it if I were working popping up ticket reminders.
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.400]   I mean, it's almost creepy how it's talking.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.400]   It's almost creepy.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.760]   It's creepy how it stocks everything that I search for.
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.600]   But I do search for, you know, sporting events or music or bands I like or whatever.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.560]   Molly, would we know you like Justin Bieber?
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.400]   We wanted to let you know he's going to be performing in your area in two months and
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.040]   tickets go on sale in a minute.
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.040]   Oh my gosh.
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.040]   Does he come into Oracle or like?
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.040]   Oh, I love him.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.040]   He's such a nice boy.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:02.320]   Actually, I think that was his bottle bill, by the way.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.320]   Probably.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:04.320]   Probably.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.080]   He was freaking pictures on site or him.
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.920]   Do you think people are creeped out by Google now?
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:11.520]   I'm not creeped out by Google now.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:15.960]   I don't even care that they're selling my info to the drones just in case the drones
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:16.960]   want to take me out.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:17.960]   Like, I don't care.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:18.960]   It is that useful.
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:22.800]   I love when I'm in a location and it's like, hey, there's three restaurants near you and
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:23.800]   I'm like, thank you.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:25.520]   That's also my picked one.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.520]   I love it.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:30.120]   These drones take you out and you actually meant like shoot you down, but I think I was
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.760]   picturing like you going out with a bunch of drones.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.160]   Because all of my life in Canada is a mechanical.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:40.360]   It's come to this Molly's dating drones now.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:44.080]   And you're like out with them and with your Google now phone, with your life.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.080]   The aliens and them.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.960]   The drones are really good boyfriends.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:48.800]   They know everything about you.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.800]   I mean, hashtag team drone.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:51.800]   Team drone.
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:54.200]   Team life companion.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.200]   And hashtag 1%.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.200]   Yeah, because drones are not cheap.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.200]   That's right.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.200]   No.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.880]   They don't see just any old trash.
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.760]   Which one is the werewolf?
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.440]   Only high value targets.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:07.440]   Mm-mm.
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.440]   Good.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.440]   Wow.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.880]   Do you think there are those people though that are paranoid enough that they think that
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.200]   the drones will target you because you've got Google now running?
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:19.960]   No, I think that they just they're passing on the information on a just in case basis.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:20.960]   Hey, Becky.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.080]   I'm totally they're not doing it.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.080]   Now I believe you.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.080]   I'm scared.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.080]   I know it was seriously.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.160]   Well, I mean, you know, it's there's no question that Google now is gathering a lot of information
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.240]   that you know, it's sharing.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:33.920]   I mean, but Google is right.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920]   So is everybody.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.600]   Yeah, but Google more than anyone.
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.280]   If you read inside the plaques, I think you should be deeply creeped out.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.600]   But but in a way that's sort of just like, well, what am I going to do?
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:49.080]   But Google could definitely build the digital copy of me that would be indistinguishable from
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.080]   me.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:52.120]   They know that much about my I have to say this.
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:56.160]   I just asked my wife if it would if it would be cool if I called her high value target.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.520]   You got a very silent, very not.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.520]   Did I know?
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:05.320]   No, no, that's not going to like go back to talking into the computer.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.680]   It's the TV, babe.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.880]   So apparently Google now is coming to iOS.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.160]   It's one thing iOS has has not had, but there was a video leak on YouTube, which was immediately
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.480]   pulled down, which in my mind confirms its veracity 100%.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:25.280]   Yeah, I expected it to be like announced the next day.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.680]   But this one's the value of Google now and Android.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:34.360]   It's it's it's there and it's like useful and it's I'm convinced that Google now will
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.320]   eventually be the home screen of Android, right?
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.840]   Yes, or the computer, whatever mobile and they're building up to that functionality.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.960]   Well, they already have a widget.
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.760]   You could make it your home screen.
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.600]   If you have an update Android, they already have a widget.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.400]   So you could actually already do that.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.400]   Right.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:51.680]   So if you open an app on iOS, I think removes a little bit of that.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.440]   There's no widgets on iOS.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:54.440]   Right.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.440]   And there's no background processing.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.440]   Right.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.360]   Unless it goes into it, it'll probably pop up in notifications and then you have to go
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:01.360]   into.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:07.680]   Yeah, it'll just a better way to sort and filter notifications than iOS is notification
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.680]   center.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.680]   I mean, that's just amazing.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.680]   Just try it.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.960]   There's some real things I miss about Android.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.080]   I mean, I really, really miss it.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.920]   You don't like how the notifications on your iOS notification screen are three to five weeks
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:20.920]   out of date.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.920]   That's on your favorite thing.
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.000]   And then it's such a pain.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.880]   The target to close and clear them is this big.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:29.520]   And I know you have lady fingers, but even then it's really tiny.
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:35.200]   No, even my lady fingers, I can't hit the target and it's just I feel like my my Gmail
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.400]   notifications are never coming up right.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.120]   It's just I miss a lot of things.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.600]   The Gmail delivery is just I mean, the reason that I actually use the Google that next
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:48.880]   is for more than the iPhone, I mean, way, way more than the iPhone is strictly about
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.880]   Gmail delivery.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:54.120]   Like I have three different Gmail accounts and I just cannot reliably get mail on the
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120]   iOS device.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.480]   Like it's just I feel like jelly bean makes iOS look so tired that it's gotten almost
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.480]   embarrassing.
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.480]   Yeah, but then you're out of work today.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.280]   But man, that camera though, that camera is so good.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.800]   Yeah, the camera and the apps.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.360]   I mean, the main reason I actually finally switched was I was sick of carrying around
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:18.840]   another iPhone to test apps because right any any of the new apps are first coming to
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:19.840]   iOS.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.080]   It's still the case and still I'd rather use some of these apps like I just they look
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.080]   nicer.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.880]   They're easier to use and I find that there that lag still happens in a lot of Android
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.200]   apps.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.960]   So it's there's nothing there's no perfect solution.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:34.960]   Maybe.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:39.360]   Carrying to maybe that's my I mean, really my perfect solution is carrying them both.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.040]   I just think I'm going to trade the Nexus for for the note to or maybe wait for the note
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.040]   three.
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:51.160]   I'm carrying a blackberry Zed 10 and iPhone iOS 5 and the Galaxy Note 2 and as soon as
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.520]   I'm going to carry a Z a Z 10 and a bold.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.520]   I think that is going to be.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.400]   It's the new dual blackberry solution.
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.520]   Wow, that is terrible.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:03.000]   I love that girl.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   I'm just joking.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000]   You just doing it to confuse the drones.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   That's all.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000]   That's right.
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   You can make.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000]   You know what?
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.280]   You're safe though because I bet the drones are not targeting blackberry.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.280]   It's your right.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.520]   Actually, all high value targets carry blackberries.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:17.520]   Serious.
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:25.760]   The chat room has gone straight up hashtag HBT by the way, which is like rocking my world.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.640]   I love the chat room.
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:30.840]   So what do HBO and Twitter have in common will tell you just a moment.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:36.000]   But first I want to remind you that if it's time to get rid of your Z 10 or maybe upgrade
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.240]   your iPhone 5 5s, maybe get a new iPad, don't forget you can get money for your old stuff
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:49.160]   at gazelle.com G A Z E L L E. We'll give you cash.
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:52.280]   American dollar for your old stuff.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:58.280]   In fact, you can go to gazelle.com right now and get a 30 day quote on everything.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.440]   I presume we're going to see some new hardware pretty soon.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.960]   And maybe you're thinking, I don't know.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.520]   I want to see the S for before I buy it.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.360]   We'll get the quote now on your old phone.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:10.600]   And that quote's good for 30 days, giving you plenty of time to look at the S for to
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.680]   decide whether to buy it, to transfer your data over then send it off.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.040]   Look, here's my my old S three in good shape.
[01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.720]   No water damage.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.320]   What would what would gazelle give me for that S three?
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.520]   177 bucks.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.520]   Bingo.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.200]   Now the best part is you they'll send you a prepaid postage paid box.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.640]   You throw it in the box with a lot of other stuff.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.400]   And then on the return trip, you get money.
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.480]   You can either get a check a PayPal credit if you want it right away or my recommendation
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:42.200]   get the Amazon gift card because they bump that 5% gazelle buys phones.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.800]   They buy Mac computers.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:48.520]   They buy a variety of stuff visit gazelle.com get the quote now because a quote is good
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.520]   for 30 days.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.560]   And I can guarantee you one thing that phone is not gaining in value.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:55.640]   Absolutely not.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.200]   It's worth less every single day.
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.560]   It's not an antique yet, folks.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.600]   It's got no nostalgia value whatsoever.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.760]   What's my iPad three worth?
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:05.760]   I'll take it.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:06.760]   185 bucks.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.760]   I've got two.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:08.960]   That's an iPad two even better.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.960]   Wi-Fi only.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:10.960]   Wow.
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.920]   Gosh, that's like half the value of it.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.920]   I know.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:18.720]   Gazelle.com they've paid out over $50 million to half a million customers.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:21.400]   Maybe you're next gazelle.com.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.960]   So thank you, Ed bot for noticing this and making me feel so much better.
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.680]   Microsoft, maybe you know this in Windows eight in the Metro browser.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:36.680]   They block flash unless you're on a whitelist and they switch that this week to.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.680]   Having a blacklist.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:46.000]   So in the past, if you went to a flash site in the Metro version of Internet Explorer,
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.440]   you would either be able to run it or not depending on whether it was on this whitelist.
[01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:57.040]   So they updated it and now they have a blacklist and there are only 12 domains that flash will
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:03.360]   not run on HBO and Twitter are two of the 12.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.360]   So I bizarre.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:11.480]   No HBO, a Russian site on 24.
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.280]   I don't know why we're on this list.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.280]   Ed bot did the digging.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.240]   There's a little XML file that has the the blacklist.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.760]   It contains only a dozen domain names.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.160]   Presumably they'll add to that later.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:30.240]   And it's mainly focused on flash and arm windows RT and the surface RT.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.240]   My surface broke.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:32.240]   I dropped it.
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:35.760]   Well, I mean, you have an HTML5 solution.
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:36.760]   We do.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.520]   So if you go to twit.tv, the player will say, Oh, well, I can I can do it this way.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:46.560]   But I just find it bizarre that I'm in this group and that HBO is in this group.
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:49.120]   But I think HBO has an HTML5 solution as well.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.920]   So there's plenty of HTML5 companies out there.
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.360]   I mean, there's more than 12.
[01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.360]   Why why these 12?
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.320]   I mean, I'm just saying my guess is that they evaluate.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.760]   I'm literally just guessing, but they evaluated and they said the HTML5 solution is better
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.760]   than flash here.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.040]   We'll just push them to file.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:08.440]   We'll push them to the HTML5.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.760]   Yeah, works fine on Windows 8.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.920]   I tried it.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:15.080]   But on RT, unfortunately, we have an HTML5 solution.
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:17.800]   You'll be shunted over.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:20.040]   The live stream does not work.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:24.080]   So if you know, if you want to watch live, we can only do it in flash right now.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.160]   Interesting.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.440]   So they hate us.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.320]   I think is the reasonable collision and because you broke your surface, they hate Game of
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.320]   Thrones.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:36.120]   And anybody who hates me and Game of Thrones is off my list.
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.840]   I have another speculation, Leo.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:38.840]   What is it?
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:43.160]   It's that probably one of our viewers noticed that the live stream was broken and then they
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:45.480]   emailed Microsoft.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.560]   And so now Microsoft is like, Oh, yeah, no, we don't have a solution.
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:49.760]   Let's just go ahead and blacklist it.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.640]   And that's why this list is so small.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.640]   It's a weird list.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.200]   Yeah, is that I believe that a viewer probably contacted Microsoft.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.360]   Well, whoever did that, knock it out.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:06.200]   Briggs and Riley, which makes bags luggage is on here.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:09.000]   Well, HBO is on.
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:21.760]   But what news 24.jp on 24.com TNT dash online.ru and me.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.440]   That never has problems like this.
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.560]   Molly would ABC never has problems like this.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:31.400]   The verge Joshua to Polsky's beautiful talk show never has problem.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.920]   What about I don't understand it.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.960]   Have you ever been to HBO's corporate website?
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:43.800]   It's a home box office.com who like not not the most amazing website in the world.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.120]   What really?
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:49.360]   This is not for this is not for you to watch HBO, but this is their corporate.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.000]   Oh my God.
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000]   It's horrible.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000]   That's horrible.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000]   What is it?
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000]   They just box office.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000]   Let it go.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.280]   First of all, first of all, they would call themselves home box office in years.
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.200]   It doesn't stretch all the way across the screen.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.040]   So it's obviously not mobile responsive design.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.360]   It looks like the text is a different fonts.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.440]   Yeah, this doesn't surprise me.
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:15.560]   There's a drop shadow that goes up.
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.680]   Everything about it's great.
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:21.840]   I love that it has hours of operation.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:23.840]   That's my favorite part of it.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.920]   It's 3M to midnight.
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:30.560]   So between midnight and 3M, you got some screw.
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.400]   Day quick maintenance.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.320]   Oh my God.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:36.520]   What the hell?
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.680]   What is this?
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   That is bizarre.
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.560]   Yeah, it's the best.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.560]   How did you find it?
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:42.560]   That's hysterical.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:44.760]   Somebody just showed us me one time.
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:49.920]   Every other part of HBO is so smart and savvy and HBO go is so much better than the show
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920]   time.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.280]   Maybe this is what Microsoft's blocking.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:56.200]   3AM to midnight.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.880]   Monday to Sunday.
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.680]   Every day of the week we close with 3AM to midnight.
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:03.680]   Wait a minute.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:06.400]   That means they're only open three hours.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.840]   No, it's midnight to three hours.
[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:10.720]   Oh, they're close three hours.
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:11.720]   That's confusing.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:15.960]   It has hours of operation, Monday through Sunday, 3AM to midnight Eastern time.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:17.960]   Then it says--
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:18.960]   It's in the mid-night for three.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:23.240]   And we'll be unavailable for midnight to 3AM Eastern for maintenance.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.680]   Because they've been maintaining that day with it.
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:26.680]   Obviously.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.840]   You know what?
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:30.840]   This is a fake.
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:31.840]   Maybe this is a fake.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:33.000]   I don't think it's a fake.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.600]   I think that's what big corporate media websites look like.
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.600]   Wow.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.600]   Mason.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:40.600]   That is really fun.
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.600]   I think it was really nice.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.600]   Yeah, I know something.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:45.600]   There's a--
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.800]   Do you know how often is ABC closed for maintenance?
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800]   No.
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:51.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:53.600]   She can't say anything.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:56.400]   The gag order is issued.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.040]   They're never closed for maintenance, but--
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:46:59.040]   I got to tell you.
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.040]   I got to tell you.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.200]   The things besides that look like this.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.480]   I am excited about the new Roku 3.
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:05.040]   Just got it.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.360]   It's one of the features I really like.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.480]   It has a headphone jack in the remote, which is bizarre.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:10.040]   But I don't know why nobody ever thought of this.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:12.280]   So I could list on my headphones through the remote.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280]   And it works great.
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:14.280]   Sounds good.
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.280]   Yeah.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:16.280]   Now it's great.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.280]   It's really cool.
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:21.200]   But the thing that's most interesting is there is a Time Warner Cable app.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.600]   Now I'm not a Time Warner customer, so I haven't tried it.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.440]   Zachary Seward writing for Quartz points out that you can watch everything, including
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.600]   live TV.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.360]   It is a set-top box for Time Warner Cable.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.560]   They're all going this way.
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560]   Time Warner Cable.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.440]   Yeah, but you don't need to rent a Time Warner box anymore.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.920]   You don't even need to have a cable connection.
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.000]   All you need is internet.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.840]   And this will make your TV do everything, including live TV, that a Time Warner Cable
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:49.840]   box will do.
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:51.920]   But you can do this on Xbox right now.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:52.920]   You can do this.
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:56.280]   Xbox has a-- I have a Fiosap on my Xbox.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:57.280]   It's bad.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.280]   Well, that's Fios, though.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.200]   No, but there's a Comcast app and a Time Warner app.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:08.400]   The problem is never been the technology or the UI or the delivery.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.880]   The problem is the content deals.
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:13.920]   So the shows you're watching on Time Warner, they're licensed for delivery over Time Warner's
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.360]   pipes, literally over cable.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:21.600]   And when they say we want to deliver it over the internet, their licenses don't allow
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.920]   them to do that.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.800]   So they've got years and years of legal shenanigans to go through to get the licenses to deliver
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.960]   over IP.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:30.880]   So yeah, it's there.
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:31.880]   It's cool.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:35.560]   It's the same kind of limited app as what's available right now in the Xbox.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.040]   It doesn't solve your core-- it doesn't make you a cord cutter because you still need
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.040]   a Time Warner.
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:41.960]   Same thing with the HBO Go app, you still have to have a cable company.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:42.960]   By the way--
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:45.520]   Because HBO doesn't own a lot of-- you know, they don't own that content, apart from their
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:46.520]   original series.
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.480]   So they're doing a lot of work.
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:50.080]   I talk to these guys all the time.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:51.600]   And they want to do the work.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.520]   They know that the answer is there.
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:57.840]   What they say to me is we go to the content companies and the VP in Hollywood is sitting
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.840]   there saying, "If I bet on you, the only thing that can happen is a little bit of a
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.760]   thing that I lose my job because this won't bring in a guaranteed revenue that's selling
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:09.360]   this stuff to the cable companies the way that we already do does."
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:11.080]   And that's like reality.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:12.080]   But it's cool.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.080]   It's very cool.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.000]   But it's not quite what you might think it is.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]   All right.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.160]   How many of you show hands Veronica Mars fans?
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.160]   One person.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.160]   Two.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.160]   We got some people in the live studio.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.800]   Molly, I think you're muted, by the way.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:29.400]   Molly, are you a-- she's just talking, but nobody hears her.
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.560]   Oh, I've totally been muted all this time.
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:33.560]   I've been saying these really interesting things.
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.840]   I was wondering, I haven't heard from you in a minute.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840]   I was wondering, I haven't heard from you in a minute.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.840]   I was like, oh, there he is.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:41.080]   I know, well, I just thought it was because everyone else was talking or I was doing that
[01:49:41.080 --> 01:49:42.080]   ducking thing again.
[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:43.080]   No, that was telling me.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.080]   I had it on mute.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:45.080]   It was a beautiful light.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.080]   The muting.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:51.840]   So Kristen Bell, who is very cute, and is now in that Showtime show, which I love with
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:57.080]   Don Sheedle about management consultants.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:58.800]   But she was in Veronica Mars.
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.560]   Did you watch that show?
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.560]   I never watched it.
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.560]   Nobody.
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.560]   I'm going to start watching it now, though.
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:06.560]   Yeah, because--
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.560]   Now that I know what the great love of like--
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.560]   Oh, it's like my new Buffy.
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.560]   I'm in.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:16.720]   They raised $3 million on Kickstarter to make a movie out of it.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.440]   In fact, enough to actually say, we're going to do it.
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:25.600]   So somebody at an interesting article said, this is the end of Kickstarter.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.600]   This is the end of television.
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.880]   This is the end of everything.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:29.880]   Life is over as we know it.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.440]   Because why would anybody-- there it is.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.840]   Did Veronica Mars ruin Kickstarter?
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:41.240]   Why would anybody now put up money for a movie when you can get poor schmucks on the internet
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.480]   to kick in with no participation?
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.880]   Why is everybody on the internet such a downer?
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:48.880]   What?
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:50.880]   Why would that have to ruin Kickstarter for God's sake?
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:54.880]   Why could there still be movies that get green lit legitimately and the Kickstarter could
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:59.880]   become a way to prove viability for media ideas that might be otherwise hard to sell?
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:00.880]   Yeah, three points, six million.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:01.880]   Can't they--
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:02.880]   Can't they--
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:03.880]   Can everybody just all get along?
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.880]   Three point, six million dollars is not a lot of money.
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.680]   It's not enough to do the movie, actually.
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:07.680]   Probably.
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:10.280]   They all have to get some money from a movie company.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.280]   And you also have to get distribution.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:13.080]   You got to get marketing dollars.
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:14.080]   It's not enough.
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:19.320]   Well, Tom and I talked about this on an upcoming episode, actually, of It's a Thing.
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:23.200]   And he was saying that the movie studios, essentially, that the message they gave to the
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.360]   makers was, we're interested in the movie, but we don't know that there's enough interest.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.560]   So if you can raise some money on Kickstarter, if you can raise two million dollars, we will
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:34.520]   green light it and, you know, match it or put in more money.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:36.680]   So it's going to-- you know, I think it will cost more than that to make.
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:39.720]   But it proves interest in a way that I think is useful.
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:42.800]   In fact, now I'm thinking like, I want to put Jericho up.
[01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:46.200]   Twelve thousand nine hundred ten people put fifty dollars up for this.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.720]   Now they understand they're not getting anything.
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.160]   They're not even getting guaranteed that the movie will be made.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:54.920]   I mean, they'll get a DVD of the movie, but if it's made.
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.760]   Well, you know, Kickstarter is building some massive new headquarters here in New York.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:01.720]   And one of the reasons it's so massive is they're building a screening room.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:06.520]   I mean, funding movies and TV shows and other kinds of media is actually the predominant
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.640]   use of Kickstarter.
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:14.000]   So for something mainstream or closer to mainstream to go this route, it's not surprising.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000]   And I don't know why this would be the end of Kickstarter.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.720]   This is actually, I think, Kickstarter hitting a point where the studios are taking notice
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:25.600]   of it as a platform rather than doing whatever they were doing before and like doing petition
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.560]   drives to bring back Buffy or whatever.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:28.560]   Right.
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.560]   Did that happen?
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:30.560]   I don't know if that ever happened.
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:32.200]   Was it bring back or the petition drive?
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.200]   I'm sure there was a petition drive.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:36.200]   By the way, this is-- Oh, I'm sure there are.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.200]   They're always this.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:40.640]   This HBO site, just to add to it, is a SharePoint template.
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:43.600]   It's real good.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:44.600]   It's real.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.200]   Tell me the who is results for.
[01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.200]   It's real.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:48.200]   And it's a SharePoint template.
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.200]   All right.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:54.000]   So this is wonderful news that Veronica Mars raised $3.6 million and probably will raise
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]   more.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.520]   Also, if you go to the way back machine, it looks better in 1997 version than it does
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.520]   now.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.520]   It's a lot cleaner.
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:03.520]   And it's a lot cleaner.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:08.520]   If you do it today, you just start moving the furniture around really.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:09.520]   I mean--
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:10.520]   Oh, embarrassing.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.520]   I love that they call it their B2B site, too.
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.520]   B2B.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.520]   I think that's enough.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:24.640]   I think we need to discuss Samsung one more time.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:27.640]   I have corned beef and cabbage waiting for me, so I'm going to have to--
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:28.640]   Yeah, I know.
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:29.640]   Dinner is a dinner.
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:30.640]   It's not good.
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.800]   My people now app made me corned beef and cabbage for dinner.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:34.800]   Aw, your little plastic pal who's fun to--
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.080]   I got to take my HBT to dinner.
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:43.080]   That means the happy Valentine's template.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:45.240]   Or something.
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.400]   Thank you, Neelite Patel.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.400]   Theverge.com.
[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:48.760]   Always great to talk to you.
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.760]   Appreciate your insights and your knowledge.
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:51.760]   Have a great weekend.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:52.760]   Real soon.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.120]   Molly Wood, of course, is always on.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.280]   That's the name of her show.
