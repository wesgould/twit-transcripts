[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.800]   pundits starting with our good buddy, Jason Calicanis,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.960]   from mahalo.com.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.280]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.800]   Mahalo, hello, Mahalo.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.640]   It's been wonderful.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.440]   Mahalo, Shalom for Purim.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.800]   Shalom.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.520]   I'm here.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.800]   I'm ready to do the show.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.360]   We're all wearing funny hats, but they're really just
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.320]   headsets for the Skype.

[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.680]   I'm ready.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.920]   This is it, baby.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.120]   You got the stories.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.960]   Ready to go.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.240]   Let's see also with us.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.080]   Besides Jason, we got the great Dwight Silverman
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.160]   from the Chronicle, Houston Chronicle, at blogs.chron.com/techblog.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.720]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.520]   How are you today?
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.040]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.000]   Dwight was a little sad.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.360]   I said, "It's much better than the last time I was on your show.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   I was sick."
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.760]   "I was just kind of leaning in the corner,
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.960]   but I'm ready for bear.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.200]   Watch out, Calicanis."
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.520]   And Jason is the bear.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.280]   He is the bear.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.880]   Dwight just said he's smoking chronic.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.280]   He's on the Chronicle.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.640]   He's on the Chronicle.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.400]   Hey, here's a face we haven't seen in a long time.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.080]   Brett Larson, my old friend, was at Macworld Magazine,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.320]   and he did a regular feature on Tech TV on my Call for Help show.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.320]   Then I went Tech TV.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.520]   He went bluey.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.560]   He went to New York, where he has been working at Fox 5
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.600]   for five years.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.320]   Several years now.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.440]   Several years.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.360]   And then--
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.160]   I was there for two.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.920]   I was at CBS.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   Well, that's right.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.720]   You went to CBS then 5.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.880]   And now he's wandering around, as we say in the business,
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.480]   on the beach.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.240]   Yes.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.720]   On the beach.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.960]   But I got a job for you, Brett.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.400]   We're going to talk a little later.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.680]   I got an idea for Mr. Larson.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.200]   I like here.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.080]   I have something I think something Brett could do.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.240]   Emmy award winning, Brett Larson.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.360]   That is correct.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.400]   Nice hat.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.920]   I'm jealous of the green hat.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.520]   With wings.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.960]   What the hell?
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.480]   Kid Icarus or something?
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.680]   I don't know.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.160]   What are you wearing that hat for?
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.800]   Oh, it's Purim.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.400]   What am I saying?
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.960]   I have no funny hats within reach.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.320]   Dang it.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.720]   Isn't sunfair?
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.800]   I don't know if it had the snow storms that we just had.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.120]   You guys are out there and cold.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.840]   This hat is related to a website
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.120]   that's outside the United States, whoever guesses it first,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.280]   on the chat room.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.800]   OK.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.560]   It's got wings.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.280]   It's kind of a green canvas hat.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   Somebody will get it.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   It's got a red ribbon, orange ribbon across the front.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   Somebody will get this because of the wings.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   It's a website outside of the United States.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   FTD.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   Somebody says the FTD.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Nope.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   Is it an angel investor hat?
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   Hey.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   Hey.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   Hey.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   Hey.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   It's a web company in Asia.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   Asian web company.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   What are the top two?
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   That narrows it down.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   Top 20 websites.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   Hermeza.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.280]   Now my hat is what they call a Jane hat, J-A-Y-N-E.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   And it's made, it was knitted for me by Kat of Let's KnitTogether.com.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   Jane was a character in the TV show Firefly.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280]   Remember?
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   He was the big tough guy.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   And his mother sent him this hat.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.280]   And he was so scary and tough that, of course, all of his friends when he put this silly hat
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.280]   on said, oh, it suits you.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.280]   Looks good, Jane.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   Looks good.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.280]   Here's the stories of the week.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   Rumor flying because of a stray random tweet from Alex Payne, one of the founders of Twitter,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   M.G.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:09.360]   Seagler, a spotted the tweet which said, and I quote, "If you had some of the nifty site
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.560]   features that we Twitter employees have, you might not want to use a desktop client,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.120]   you will soon."
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.120]   A lot of speculation on that.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.320]   Dwight, now you just told me about Echo Phone, which is a new desktop client from the folks
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.120]   who do the Mac or the iPhone app, Echo Phone.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.520]   Yeah, it's been around for a little while.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.720]   It's in beta right now.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   It's free.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.120]   It, you know, I've been using Tweety on the Mac, which has kind of gotten to be the gold
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.320]   standard for Twitter desktop clients on the Macintosh platform.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.240]   But Tweety hasn't been kept up in terms of features.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.280]   It doesn't support lists.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.640]   It just hasn't kept up with what Twitter is able to offer it.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.120]   And so Echo Phone is available as a free download while it's in beta and it does lists.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.720]   It has a cool drawer that kind of slides out and shows you additional information if you
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   want it.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.880]   It loads very quickly and it's very simple in terms of its interface.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.080]   Jason called it elegant.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.160]   I agree with that.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   It's really nice.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.000]   They're very popular iPhone app, Echo Phone is.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.880]   Well, it's because they have a free one that is fairly well featured and there's also a
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.720]   pay one that does more.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.280]   But the free one has a lot of features and so it gets used by a lot of folks who don't
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   want to pay.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.640]   I use Brizzly, which is web based and I think that's probably one of the companies that
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.320]   might be threatened by what Alex said.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.400]   I also use Hootsuite.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.480]   That's what you were saying you liked, Jason, right?
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.480]   Yes.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   And I have inside information on the Twitter issue.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.960]   Oh, let's hear it.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.560]   I always try to break some news on the program.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.760]   So I had dinner with Evan Williams last month at the TED conference.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.400]   Was that the Edge Dinner?
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.040]   Man, that looked like a party.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   Holy cow.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.040]   There were 50 people at this dinner.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.600]   I was the 51st person.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.760]   I basically got to put my left foot in the room for about 30 seconds.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.320]   It was like Bill Gates, Larry and Sergey have Williams and everybody like Daniel Dannett
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.160]   and Sam Harris and all his incredible authors.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   Who are clients?
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.560]   Yeah, he's my book agent, even though I haven't written a book, but I get off his arm.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.560]   So wait a minute.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560]   So he didn't invite you to the dinner.
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560]   He let you step your--
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   No, he did.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.560]   He did.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   He did.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   He did.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   I'm sort of joking.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   He was just like, I did not belong at this dinner.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   But--
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   No, kidding.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   I would have been tongue tied with those people.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.060]   Well, what happens is I walk in and it's like I'm sitting next to Matt Greening from
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.060]   the Simpsons fame.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.720]   And so I've met him a couple of times and really nice guy.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.160]   And I got Daniel Dannett to my right and Sam Harris to the table and Jeff Bezos and
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.960]   this crazy like discussion going on.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.160]   Were the conversations good or were the people so different?
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.560]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   It was incredible.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.760]   Because what happens is, I think like this, everybody is so brilliant except for me that
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   it just-- it doesn't end.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.560]   Everybody has something to contribute.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.360]   So these conversations just, they flutter between all kinds of different topics.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   Right.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   Amazing.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360]   I would love to be there for that, boy.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.360]   I'll get you in next year.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   Now, let me ask you about that because you are-- are you persona non-grata at--
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.080]   Ted, what did you-- what do you do?
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.280]   You play poker there.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.920]   Well, here's what happened.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.800]   There was a guy who ran-- I've never told the story before, so this is another twit exclusive.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.000]   There was a guy named Richard Solworm and who ran Ted originally.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.160]   Yeah, I know Richard pretty well.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.560]   In fact, when he started Ted, I used to have on my radio show, he did the Access Guides.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.960]   He was all about UA, UI design, smart guy.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   Very brilliant guy.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   I loved him.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   And he's a total crum-mudgeoned.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.960]   He's very much like Devorak, kind of.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960]   He's just--
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   More actually, I'll address.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.560]   Anyway, here's what happens.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.920]   Brockman-- I'm talking about 10 years ago.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   I'm 26 years old, 27 years old.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.840]   In the late '90s, Brockman invites me to his dinner.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.360]   This is when they were doing it in Monterey.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.080]   So I say, OK, I'll come to the dinner.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.560]   They call up the billionaires dinner because, you know, whatever.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.120]   And only 50 people get to go to this out of the 2,000 people go to Ted.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.120]   Wow.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.560]   So now, you know all the controversy about how exclusionary Ted is.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   Now imagine having a dinner for 2% of the people at Ted.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   Now you get an idea of what this ticket's like.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   Wait, even Robert Scobill wasn't there.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.720]   Oh, Robert Scobill wouldn't let Robert Scobill with him
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.080]   five blocks of the dinner.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080]   Forget it.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.800]   If Robert Scobill was the busboy, they wouldn't let him bring in the bread.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Right.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   It's out of here.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   Literally.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.080]   Anyway, so I go to that thing.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.320]   Rich O'Wurman finds out that I'm going to go to this dinner.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.040]   And he goes on tilt.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.640]   And he starts telling everybody that I'm crashing Ted.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.720]   Because the dinner isn't Ted, but piggybacks on Ted.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.320]   John Brockman is the most famous agent and brilliant guy.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.200]   And he has all of his, all the great authors in the world of science, you know, like Jared
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.080]   Diamond and all these people, he's their agent.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.600]   And he basically gets all his book stunts.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.200]   And anyway, all the tech people and the scientists and literati and digiarate all sort of get
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.240]   together at his salons.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.000]   Long story short, he basically starts telling everybody I'm crashing.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.960]   So I confront them on it and he's like, you're never going to Ted ever.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.800]   And I said, okay, F you, I will never go to Ted, but I will come to the dinner.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.560]   Then Chris Anderson starts running Ted.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.040]   Now Chris, you took it over from.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   He took it all.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   Okay.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.920]   So Richard Solwurman, but Chris Anderson was a video game publisher.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.920]   Right.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.960]   He was just, he had these like video game magazines and then he all of a sudden he'd be.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.200]   Yeah, he had this publishing company, a future publishing or something.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.200]   I don't know.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   Oh, he was a future.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.720]   So I got a publishing company that did all these video games.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.600]   So then he asked me for this advice in the web blog thing day.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.440]   It's like, how would I do a blog because Ted had no website.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440]   So I go to dinner with him.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440]   I explain everything.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.600]   And then I'm like, Hey, you know, I'd love to go.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.440]   And he's like, Oh, totally go to the website on this day and, you know, buy a ticket.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   I'm like, well, I like to go this year.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.480]   He's like, ah, I can't make it happen, but go to the website on this day, the day of
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.640]   10, you can buy it for next year.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.640]   So I'll take $6,000 ticket by the way.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   Well, this is back when it's for.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.360]   So I think, you know what, I'll bite the bullet.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   I have the cash to do it now of screw it.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.480]   I got to redeem myself, you know, new, new, new, new group of people.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.920]   I go to the website the day, the morning, six, seven o'clock in the morning, I go to the
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   website.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   It says sold out already.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   It sells out a year, a year ahead of time.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.520]   And again, I can't get in.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.520]   Oh boy.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.880]   And I help the guy out and I was nice to him, you know, and I give him a bunch of advice.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.760]   So finally, I said, you know what screw this, I'm not going to be his donkey and beg him.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.560]   So I tell all the people who work for him who want to come to tech crunch 50 and stuff
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.560]   like that.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.560]   I let them come.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.680]   I give them comp tickets, you know, and they're like, Oh, thank you for the ticket.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.920]   I'm like, yeah, like, Oh, you come to Ted.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.400]   I'm like, I would never go to Ted in my life.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   Like, why?
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.800]   I'm like, because you guys treat me like a jerk off and I'm not a jerk off and I'm not
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.280]   going to sit here and be treated like a jerk off.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.280]   And they're like, what?
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.120]   And I'm like, yeah, I'll never go.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.360]   And so now I go.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.320]   I had a poker game.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.280]   I took $1,200 off of some guy who goes to Ted.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.080]   So now I'm positive $7,200.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:03.320]   And so now I'm really percent in my drive because I host a poker game in the lobby of
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.320]   Ted.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.800]   And the big secret is go to the lobby of the two or three hotels there, have a drink at
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   night.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   You'll meet everybody at Ted.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800]   You don't have to buy $6,000 ticket.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   Just lobby crash.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.960]   And if Jason's lobby crashing and I'm a player, you can lobby crash.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.760]   There's no shame in it.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.240]   Well, that's what I'm going to do next year.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.480]   Totally come down and you can you can interview people.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480]   It's like no big deal.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.920]   It's in Long Beach and everybody has dinners.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.760]   We should just do a total like not invited group.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.840]   To me, the edge dinner was much more interesting than what was going on at Ted.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.560]   But so you, okay, well, we're going to take a break, but you talked to Ev at this dinner
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.880]   and we're going to get the straight dope.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.200]   What's happening at Twitter?
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   Like I care.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.720]   No, you care about that.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   Oh, I do.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.280]   When we come back, when we come back after this word from the folks at Citrix, the makers
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.040]   of the great go to meeting product.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.680]   See this will be another way you could have a Ted conference.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.000]   Just keep your button, your chair, but go to meeting on your system and then have a meeting
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.800]   and anybody can see it.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   And in fact, there's a go to, they have a go to, what is it, go to webinar, which where
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   you can have lots of people.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.960]   See, I mean, these guys really know remote access Citrix.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.200]   Of course, you've heard the name.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.160]   They do the enterprise grade remote access.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.120]   They're the ones who licensed remote access to Microsoft for their own remote product.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.360]   They do go to my PC.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.800]   They go to go to assist and go to meeting.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.880]   This is the one for meetings.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.960]   The problem with the meeting is it's expensive, the business travel.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.800]   If you don't, if you're appearing in the butt, it's just not worth it.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.680]   Or you can have conference calls, but then they're not visual and people are bored and
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.680]   you know what they're doing.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.680]   They're answering, they're tweeting.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680]   Why are you talking?
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680]   They're tweeting.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.640]   They've got their blackberries in their hands.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.640]   Typing away.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.640]   You can tell.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.760]   You've, we've been on that conference call where the guy, you could clearly drift it
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.800]   off and then it suddenly says, yeah, it's like he's not there.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.600]   So what you got to do is engage him.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.200]   You got to give him something visual to look at.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.520]   And this is where go to meeting is so cool.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.400]   You can install it right now free for 30 days.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.240]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.960]   You know, it take you before I'm done talking.

[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   No cost to you.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.480]   Now, the next time you're on that call, you say, you know, you probably get bored.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.160]   Let me send you to see, he's a go to go to meeting.com.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   He goes there.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.120]   I say, click the join a meeting button.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.120]   He does that.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.200]   You give him the meeting ID.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.720]   Now, suddenly he's seeing your computer.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   He's seeing your desktop.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   He said, oh, that's nice wallpaper.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   Yeah, that's my kids.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   Let me show you the PowerPoint.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.560]   And he's seeing the PowerPoint.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.760]   He's suddenly very engaged.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.920]   And then you could say, hey, you want to work on the spreadsheet?
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   I got the numbers.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.400]   What do you think here?
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.760]   And suddenly you can give him control of the computer.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.200]   It is truly revolutionary.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.000]   It is the best way to have a meeting.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.960]   I do it three or four times a week.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.320]   Mahalo sales calls.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.320]   We do it like this.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   People from New York.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   People from San Francisco.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   It just works.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.880]   I mean, the thing is, I think people tried these kind of services, Leo, like four or five
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.400]   years ago, and the screen flickerd.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   Maybe it didn't work.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   It was awful.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   It was problematic.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.400]   Let's be honest.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   Five years ago, this technology was not ready for primetime now.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.040]   Just like us, just like streaming.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   Absolutely.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   And now it's flawless.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   It really is flawless.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.640]   And the webinar thing is really incredible.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.240]   I mean, you can get a lot of people on these things now.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.520]   So if you want to have a conference, this is what I've been thinking about doing for
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.240]   my show, this week in startups, is doing a webinar and charging people like $20 to
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.480]   do like, hey, everybody come in and this is a webinar.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.720]   I got an idea for you.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   I got an idea.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.520]   If I'm immediate, right to you, we want to do kind of like an angel investing meeting
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.040]   where people come in and they pitch using go to meeting their pitching, you know, a business
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   plan and we let the audience invest and vote whose best and everybody can put in a buck
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   or whatever.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.440]   We create a little consortium of listeners who put some money.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   That was an awesome idea.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   Can we get go to meeting a kitchen man?
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   You bring your idea to the table.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.440]   Pitch it to the people.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   Exactly.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.440]   It's like American Idol for your story.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.440]   Isn't that a good idea?
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   Great, great.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.440]   It's a reality show.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   It is.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   It's a reality show.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   Oh, so brilliant.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   And go to webinar will be the perfect platform.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.520]   So I'll send you an email because Greg Martin, one of our sales guys came up with this and
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.520]   he really wants to do it.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.720]   I think he's going and this is just a natural for these guys at Citrix.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.360]   They would, I'm sure love to sponsor it.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.800]   Go to meeting the Simon Cowell.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   You would be it.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   You could be it.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.840]   That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.840]   Who's taking Simon Cowell's place?
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840]   Daphora?
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.840]   I think how sternous.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.840]   How stern supposedly is.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.040]   Yeah, that's a hundred million dollar deal.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   Well, it's worth it.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.560]   It's the only show that can afford him.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.840]   I mean, serious can't fork over that kind of cash.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:21.960]   But can Howard Stern do a mainstream TV show without a Symbian or a porn star or something
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   going on in the background?
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.640]   I think he would do fine because you know what?
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   He's an intelligent guy and he does all that other smarmy stuff just to, you know.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.640]   He's a smart guy.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.920]   He's the type of person that is going to say whatever he feels.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.280]   If you come out there and you belt out a tune, that's what you need.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.800]   That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   It's a darling.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   Darling, come here.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   You suck.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   You suck.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   You terrible go home.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   Nice.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.840]   And with webinar, with go, just bring it back around with go to meeting.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   He wouldn't have to leave New York.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.080]   He could do it from his home.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   Say look at that.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   Just put it nice, 27 inch apples.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   Darling, you're beautiful.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   Right there in the sea.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   How did you get so beautiful?
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.080]   Your waist is so.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   Hike it up.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.640]   So what it ev?
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   That's the ad.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   Try it right now.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   That's not free.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.640]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.640]   You should pay three times.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   Well this week we gave him about three.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.640]   I know.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.640]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.640]   That's what I had to tell you.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   So you're talking to ev?
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.320]   So I talked to ev about this issue.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:29.040]   He is a little frustrated that he's frustrated that he can't have a soup to nuts and eat.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.920]   That's the experience where people have a Twitter client on my phone.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.840]   That's bad because it was the API that put Twitter on the map.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.160]   The fact that third party applications exist.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160]   He knows that.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:48.480]   However, now Twitter is going to mass adoption and your mom doesn't, is confused or maybe
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   not your mom.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.280]   You've heard from my mom.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   Yes, I know.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.200]   We're going to get her a line.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.800]   She just wants to, they just want to have a basic Twitter application for Android, for
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.120]   iPhone, for Blackberry that has the basic features that is brain-dead simple on the
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.120]   website.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.920]   He's basically considering doing it.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.040]   Then what he would have to say to the people, which he's had to do already with things like
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.240]   lists and things like the group tweeting, etc.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.120]   You have to move up the stack and provide more value.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.000]   He's not going to make a multi-user Twitter client, but I guarantee you he will have a
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.520]   Twitter client this year on every platform named the Twitter client.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.960]   Now, he told me the problem is you search for Twitter in the iTunes store and it's a
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.000]   bad user experience because which one do you use?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Right.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.640]   It should be an official one that is easy to use.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.840]   Now, that one doesn't have to have the feature set of Hootsuite or Seismic or Tweet Deck or
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.560]   the other leading ones that are out there.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   It certainly won't.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.880]   In fact, they don't want that.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.400]   They want the simple basic one.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.320]   Have you seen Seismic look?
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   I have.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   It's gorgeous.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.080]   Seismic is, I have to tell you, I, Louis, asked me to invest in his company when it was
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   the threaded comments.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.480]   I said, "You know what?
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.240]   The people who are in the comments on blogs are ugly people.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.080]   They're never going to turn their video cameras on.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.320]   They're not the lucky people.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.320]   These are trolls."
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.800]   Seismic, the video thing just died.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.760]   However, I didn't make a mistake because you should bet the horse not, you know, whatever
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   the race.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.040]   I know he's a great entrepreneur.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.600]   When we say it again, you should bet the horse not the race.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.120]   It's like, the horse might not win in this race, but he will win a race at some point.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.760]   I'd rather own the horse than just bet on the horse for this race.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   Got it.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.240]   As an investor, I should have bet on him not the race he was in with the video comments
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   because even if he loses that race, which I knew he would, he wasn't aware that he would.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.720]   That's part of being an entrepreneur is you got to bang your head against a wall.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.000]   He banged his head against the wall.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.760]   He tried for two years.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.400]   Then he bought that Twitter riff.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   Was it Twitter riff?
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.400]   He bought an every brand.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   No, no, I can't.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.400]   He bought a twirl.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   He bought a twirl.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.160]   But God bless him, he makes I think the best client out there.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.960]   I mean, I don't know if he makes any money on it.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.600]   I don't know exactly where the business is.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.880]   He's good friends with Evan.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.200]   I would say 60, 70% chance he's make gets bought by Twitter.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.440]   They'll buy the leading one.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   Well, that's what made me think.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.120]   If they're going to do a desktop app, they should do look.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.080]   I mean, this is beautiful.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's beautiful, but it's looking after you use it for a while.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.040]   It gets a little frustrating to use.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.440]   I think even if you're a noob, if you poke around in there, it's kind of confusing as
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.000]   to what's happening where.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.560]   I thought it's using Windows Presentation Foundation, WPF.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.720]   I thought it was gorgeous.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.880]   I just thought, well, it's not for me because I'm a power user, but for my mom, it might
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.600]   be good, but you don't think so?
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.200]   I think that what it does is it pushes you towards kind of the suggested users.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   Right.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.720]   When you first fire it up and you go in it, it's got these channels that want you to use
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   that it's almost difficult.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.440]   It's difficult to get to your friends and your timeline.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.040]   It's like a different thing than a traditional Twitter client.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.600]   But if they're interested in having their own Twitter client and they were to end up
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:04.920]   buying something like a seismic twirl, which they stopped development on now that they're
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:10.520]   doing the seismic client stuff, it would be really interesting to rebrand twirl as the
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.000]   Twitter client and just keep it as simple as it is.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.080]   Is it easier to monetize Twitter if you hold the client?
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.040]   I guess it is.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.800]   Well, if you're doing ads or if you're charging for the client, but if you're having a client
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.960]   where you don't pay for it and you're not putting ads on it, you're under the same problem
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.720]   that Twitter has.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:38.160]   If they do a really simple app and they have the competition of things like Echo Phone,
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.520]   which is very easy to use and I mean, you don't have to be a genius to use Echo Phone, why
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.080]   would anybody use something that doesn't have as many features as something like Echo Phone
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.080]   when they can use that?
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.080]   Well, here's what's coming.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   Since demand.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.720]   I actually know what's coming.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.240]   There's going to be, there's two things that are coming.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.760]   One is there will be in-stream advertising.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.720]   So it doesn't matter what client you use.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.600]   That's important because otherwise you can completely defeat it.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   Right.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:10.080]   So every fifth or 20th or 200th, maybe let's call it every 200th tweet will be an ad in
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.520]   your tweet screen and will be based on what people are talking about in your tweet screen.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.520]   That's smart.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.520]   So let's say-
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520]   That's smart.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.240]   Will it be location aware so it'll know to send me stuff that's around me?
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   Of course it will.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.800]   And so what you're going to have is Leo and I are talking on Twitter and we both are
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.780]   at South by Southwest and it's like, here's an ad for Dell computers, party in South by
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.560]   Southwest or that example, but it will know that we both have Android phones or whatever
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.120]   and give us an Android ad.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.200]   Can you pay to not see the ads?
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   I don't think they're going to have them.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.200]   That's premium.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   I'd love for that.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:51.160]   I think with Buzz here, if Twitter does that, there's a group of us, not certainly the mainstream,
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   not the millions.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   What is it?
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   What did they just say?
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.160]   It was 500 million tweets a day or something?
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   Ridiculous number?
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.080]   I mean, those people aren't going anywhere, but I'm going to go to Buzz.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.120]   In fact, I'm kind of mostly on Buzz.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.560]   Well, the thing that's going to happen is you will, you say that now, but when you see
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.800]   one ad out of it, just like, I mean, do you block your ads when you do Google search?
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.720]   No, in fact, I see Google ads all the time in my Gmail and everywhere.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720]   Right.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.520]   So, I mean, you're complaining, but you're not going to go anywhere if it's modest.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.520]   Yeah, but it's not in your stream.
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.320]   It's not right there in your face.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.280]   That's what I don't like because it's part of the editorial.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.200]   It's essentially part of the editorial.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.640]   It will be clearly labeled when you go to Engage it and you page down, you will see a
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.800]   medium rectangle ad.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.720]   Every blog has that and it's in the tweet and it's in the content stream.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.640]   We just did an ad for go to a meeting in the stream.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   Is your, well, right?
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.640]   You're right.
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.160]   So, as a blogger, Jason, in the past, that that's, those are the ads that work not the
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.720]   side bars, but the ones that are really in the content.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.240]   Okay, here's what happens.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.120]   If you make a beautiful graphic ad on the top, a leaderboard and on the side, a medium
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:50.640]   rectangle, those things can capture people in the general audience, but for sophisticated
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   users, putting an ad within the content column will, if it's a content based ad, like if it's
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.640]   text and it has good clickable links in it, that will work better.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   Right.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.

[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.

[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   So, you have to know which ones to use.

[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   So, I have a strong feelings on this.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   But, I can't speak for the next five minutes.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   I know the chat rooms banned you.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   The jader. The jaders are told me I can't speak.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.640]   No, no, no. You can talk all you want.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.640]   The news feed, which is, okay, now, actually,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.640]   after looking at the patent, we talked a little bit about this on Twig,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.640]   yesterday, after looking at the patent,
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   it's really saying, well, this isn't just a patent for like a news feed.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   This is a patent for taking activities that your,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.640]   your social graph is doing.
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   You know, Brett Larson just, you know, bought a poodle.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   Dwight Silverman just smoked a cigar, and that goes in there too.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.640]   And so, I could see, I mean, that's unique, isn't it?
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.640]   Or, well, go ahead, Jason.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   There is going to be a lot of prior art that's going to come out
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   that will negate this patent.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   Yeah. And it's a distasteful patent.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.640]   It's such a broken system, this patent.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.640]   Yeah, but it's a distasteful patent from a distasteful person,
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.640]   Mark Zuckerberg, who has been stealing every single person's innovation.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.640]   Really?
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.640]   Like, I mean, he's stolen every, everything Twitter does.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   He just, he just incorporates.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.640]   And then he incorporates four square.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.640]   He just steals everything that's out there.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   Now, you can have a very intelligent argument that smart people, you know,
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.640]   that there should be no, you know, patents, et cetera.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.640]   And then people are iterating on each other.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640]   And that's fine. I believe that.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   And that's what happens in the computer industry.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   I mean, Apple steals from Microsoft.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   Microsoft steals from Apple, and the iteration is good for everyone.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   However, when you are the master iterator, and then you start pulling
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.640]   it down, say that carefully.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   You have to be an adult to do that.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   Yeah, when you're a master at iterating and you're iterating three times a day.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   Yes.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.640]   All the time.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.640]   And that's what you're known for, your iteration, even when you do it at home,
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   alone in the middle of the night, you're iterating.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   Nonstop iteration.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   Yes.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   You should not be filing patents because you're a little thief anyway.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.640]   And everybody knows Zuckerberg's a little thief.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   And everybody in the industry hates him.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   Really?
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.640]   Everybody.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   And he is being gun for right now.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   Like you would not believe.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.640]   Who's gunning for him?
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.640]   I'm not saying anything.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   I was at a table with his partners, with other people who compete with him.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.640]   Multiple CEOs.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.640]   And they were badmouthing him like you would not believe.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.640]   He is hated.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   Because he's young and he created something that most of the world is using.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   It's not that what it is is.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   But that's got to be some of it.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   People hate, I mean, you know, you.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   These are sophisticated people.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   They don't hate him because of his success.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   No, what they hate him for is he steals everybody's ideas and then files a patent like this.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:32.040]   And he is, he does not care about people in the way that the first web generation of
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   online is.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   No, that's very much true.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   He is a very much of a new generation.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   He's a new generation of, it's been up to now very collegial and the sharing of ideas
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.640]   has been positive and not even competitive exactly.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.040]   I mean, when you did Propeller, for instance, which was a clone of Dig.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.840]   Well, I was trying to evolve the deal.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:29:00.040]   I said, what if you put an editorial team on top of, you and Kevin are still good friends.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.640]   Of course, because he knew I was adding to what he had done and he knew that he was adding
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.040]   to what Josh at Delicious had done.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   Right.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.040]   We were building up each other.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   People don't feel that way about Zuck.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   It's not the same.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.880]   He does not support any open standards.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.360]   He will not let you export your address book.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.160]   You know, when you get that blackberry thing, you know, it's a silo.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.160]   It's a silo.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   It's a silo.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.160]   Twitter's, well, it's less of a silo.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   It has a nice, nice idea.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   Anything on Twitter, you are your content.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.920]   You can export your list to whatever you want.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.080]   And that's exactly the rub.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.320]   He is into closed systems and stealing and these patents.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.400]   He's a bad person.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   People don't like him.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.200]   And I think he's going to be like, you know, Caesar kind of situation.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   He's like the big king and then he's going to get stabbed.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   Who's going to be his Brutus?
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   Who's the Brutus?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.360]   Oh, it's going to be multiple.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.280]   There are so many people gunning for him right now that the daggers are going to start coming
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.280]   out.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:53.780]   So, Jason, do you think that the lawsuit, the early lawsuit at which his friends in college
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.920]   alleged that he stole all their little intellectual property?
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   The twins.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920]   They get it.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.440]   Was that kind of an example of what he does regularly?
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.720]   I, what do I personally think?
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.240]   I personally think that he has a stealing gene and he doesn't, I think he's got like that
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.680]   Asperger's thing where he doesn't care about other people or in no empathy.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   So if you look at his pattern, yes, he was working for somebody else when he stole the
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   idea for a Facebook.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   Wait a sec.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.480]   Let's just have a minute, a minute or two or we don't use tape anymore, but no, no.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.960]   What if it's just a case of he's just a better businessman and these people, I mean, because
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.800]   how often have you sat around the table with your friends?
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.000]   You're like, you know, it would be a great idea if we created a, you know, customer
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.320]   teacher website and he said, that's a great idea.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.720]   And the ninth person went and did it.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.440]   And then the other eight are like, what the hell?
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   You stole our idea.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.440]   That was a good conversation.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   We had a whole dinner.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440]   We had a whole dinner.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.240]   It's pretty different from Microsoft and Microsoft.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   It's not in Microsoft.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.720]   Microsoft went to Microsoft got sued by the Justice Department for doing what they did.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   Right.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.640]   It's not except the only difference is he's better at it than Bill Gates was.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   Interesting.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.760]   Will he be richer?
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.920]   It's quite possible.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.200]   And the two lawsuits, you remember, there were two lawsuits in the early days.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.600]   One from the Connect You guys who say he stole their ideas.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.560]   And two, he, he, according to that book that's coming to me, turned into a movie.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.760]   The Ben, Ben, uh, Eisenhower book, which is by the way, a great book, but I don't know
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.520]   how accurate accidental billionaires.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.680]   Well, it's, and it's also a great audio book, but I don't want to jump the guy.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.640]   We will get there.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:36.080]   He supposedly allegedly took his co-founder out of the company, reincorporated and moved
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.960]   the assets of that new company and screwed his co-founder and then the heavy, heavy air
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.440]   guy and then had to go back and settle that.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   That's very dramatic.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.040]   We don't know multiple lawsuits.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.680]   But now remember that Ben got his most of his sources.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.360]   Was that guy, not Mark, but the, I can't remember the other guy's name, but that was
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.360]   his source.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.120]   So, you know, we're hearing one side of it.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.280]   It's going to be a movie, by the way, Justin Timberlake is going to be in it.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.320]   Justin Timberlake going to play the, play him.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:07.920]   No, he plays, uh, uh, the entrepreneur, uh, yeah, Sean Parker.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.080]   And who's playing a mark?
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.320]   I don't know.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.640]   Who would you cast to play Mark Zuckerberg in the, in the accidental billionaire?
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.680]   That's from American pie.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.120]   Who holds his pie on the vid of the kitchen?
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.640]   He's 48, but, but you know, he, that's something, something like him.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.320]   And his partner's name was, uh, Eduardo, uh, Saverin.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   Eduardo, that's right.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.560]   And if you go look it up at water, Saverin, he, he, they settled their feud, but it was
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.560]   a major feud.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   And in the book, it's very dramatic.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.560]   He basically gets the rug pulled out from under him.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.560]   It's a Jesse Eisenberg.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.560]   Who is it?
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.560]   Jesse Eisenberg.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.040]   Is that's the kid from American pie?
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.720]   Or that's the guy's going to play Zuckerberg.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   That's the kid.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.080]   That's who's got to play, uh, that's, that's who's going to play Zuckerberg.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   Somebody sent me.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   It's true or not.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.360]   You know, it's an Aaron Sorkin script, which to me is all I need to hear.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.480]   Um, somebody, oh, he, Jesse Eisenberg looks just like Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.960]   I mean, that's a good, oh yeah.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.720]   And Jesse Eisenberg is also, he was in, uh, he was in zombie lamb.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720]   He's the kid in zombie.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.160]   Oh, there you go.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   Which is a great move.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.440]   So, uh, somebody sent me what they purported to be the script.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.480]   I'll send it along to you, Jason.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.720]   I don't know if it's real or not, but it reads like an Aaron Sorkin script.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.720]   I think it is.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.600]   Is this going to be like a made for TV movie?
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.240]   No, this is a big deal, uh, trigger street production is Kevin Spacey production.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.040]   It's called the social network.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   Oh, really?
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   They changed the name.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.680]   That's, that's the name on, on IMDB anyway, the social.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   Okay.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.600]   Cause the, uh, the name of the book was accidental billionaires.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.920]   The social network, an upcoming 2010 comedy drama, David Fincher directing.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.320]   That's, that's good.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:54.080]   Jesse Eisenberg, Brenda Song, Justin Timberlake, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara and Arne, Arne
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:34:00.400]   Hammer, Aaron Sorkin writes from Ben Mezrich, his 2009 novelty accidental billionaires.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.400]   I, I should be good.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.800]   Oh, and Stanley Tucci is playing Jason Calicanas in it.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   Really?
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   Yes.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   Are you in it?
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   No, no, no, I got the ability to pick.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   Uh, it's actually going to be a Rick Schroeder.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   Ricky Schroeder.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   All grown up.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:17.200]   But that's, but he's just the right height.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.160]   I, uh, I was at the celebrity WPT, celebrity poker tournament and saw I was introducing
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   my self.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.520]   Rick Schroeder, people believed it.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.520]   That's funny.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.520]   Look like a little Ricky Schroeder.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.520]   Get that all the time.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   Self response.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.200]   We're going to, uh, we're going to take a little break, come back, uh, with more might
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.120]   as well do the audible things since you started it.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.240]   And I know you love audible, uh, Jason, uh, audible.com/twit2.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.360]   That's the place where you can go get two audible books.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.560]   Uh, I guess we're going to have to make accidental billionaires be one of them.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.800]   You should, you know, I always like to read the book before I see the movie.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.120]   And, um, when I say read, I mean, listen, because audible just brings these books to
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.120]   life.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.960]   I mean, and this was, I really enjoyed listening to accidental billionaire.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.560]   You know when I like audible when I'm on the subway, sure.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.720]   And not only do I not have to listen to the crazy people around me, I'm, it's like I'm
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.760]   reading, but I don't have to be focused.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   Right.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   And I can continue.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   I can get on the subway.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.920]   I can get off the subway.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.080]   I can do my whole commute without ever having to pick up a book, but yet I'm still getting
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   the information.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.680]   That's the ideas that you can read even in the places where you wouldn't want to hold
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:30.680]   a book when you're using your forearms to defend yourself against stab wounds, but you
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.320]   don't have to put the book down.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   It's great.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   And you're walking upstairs.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.840]   Maybe you can't get a seed and yeah, you can, yeah, it's awesome.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.080]   You can never get a seed on the sub.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.680]   All the service cuts, service cuts.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.120]   I have a audible pick.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   All right.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.880]   So there's one accidental billionaires founding of Facebook, but you're going to get two
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.880]   if you go to ombel.com/twit2.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.880]   What's your second one?
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.520]   And they, by the way, they build up.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.520]   They don't expire.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.960]   Oh, you keep them forever.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.560]   If I look at my library, I've got well over 350 books now in my library.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.560]   That's incredible.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.560]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   I love it.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.560]   I like to do that.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.400]   I usually when my iPod is on random, you get a book.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.400]   You get a book.
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   And audio book.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   Isn't that funny?
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.400]   And I think that's very funny.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.600]   It'll go from like a song to Ellen DeGeneres reading, whatever the name of her book is.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.840]   You can actually tell it not to include books in the shuffle.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   You know that, right?
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.280]   But that makes it more fun.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.320]   Yeah, you never know what you're going to get.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   You're randomly rocking out.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.880]   And then all of a sudden it's like, when I was 17, I discovered that.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.880]   That's pretty good.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880]   Oh, Ellen.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.880]   I'm leaving it at that.
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   Oh, Ellen Ellen.
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.920]   The best of times it was worse than hot.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.480]   It's read by her too.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.480]   That's what's so great.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   I love Ellen.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.400]   I think she is so funny.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.160]   So my pick is talent is overrated.
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.120]   What really separates world-class performers from everybody else.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.120]   Talent is overrated.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.320]   It's by Jeff Colvin.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   And it is a nonfiction book, which I love.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.480]   I love it.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.360]   And it is narrated by David Drummond.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.960]   And it is awesome.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.440]   Wow.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:04.200]   It goes into like-- So is this like a freakinomics type book or outliers kind of thing?
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.480]   Yes, but it's better because it gets really into what makes somebody truly great at something.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.480]   I got to listen to this.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.000]   It's basically on that same-- this is like, I think I'm pretty sure that the outlier stuff
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.400]   with the 10,000 hours.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.040]   You know, was sort of derivative of this book.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.040]   I don't know that.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.680]   But somebody will check that fact and put it in the chat room.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.920]   But it is great because it goes into like what actually-- like here are these three chess
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.720]   champions and here's Mozart and--
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:35.880]   It's the same premise that success in a field is not determined by inborn talent, but by
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.680]   practice and perseverance over the decades.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   Oh.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.080]   And I tell you, it's about deliberate practice is what they go into.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.040]   You got to get those 10,000 hours.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   Right.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.040]   Which is those.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.560]   It's the deliberate practice where you are practicing a certain way.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.040]   And then they go into some of the great receivers in the NFL and how-- who's the guy from San
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.040]   Francisco?
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   Is it Rice?
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.040]   Jerry Rice.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   So they go into Jerry Rice and how he practiced.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.040]   And I just have to say everybody's asking for it in the chat room.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.040]   Oh, audible.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Mm.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   Mm.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   Mm.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   Mm.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   Oh, audible.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   Ooh, baby.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   That's a ringtone, by the way.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   There's a famous ringtone.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.640]   Audible.com/twit2go there.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.640]   And you get two books.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.280]   Audible is the greatest library of audio entertainment ever.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.120]   It's the Alexandria library of audio.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.880]   And you can get two books free right now.
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.000]   And cancel at any time and keep those books.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.800]   Talent is overrated.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.160]   One of them and the other one accidental billionaires.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   And so you could actually do that.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.360]   You could sign up right now at audible/twit.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.160]   Take the two books and then cancel and you just got two books.

[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   Twit.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   Nothing to lose.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   It's literally/twit2.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.320]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.400]   Thank you so much, Audible, for long-term support of this show.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.800]   They've been keeping us going for a long time.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.880]   So it turns out that Four Square will be airing a TV commercial tonight on Bravo.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.720]   You're a Four Square investor, right, Jason?
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.680]   Actually, an investor in Gowala.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.680]   Oh, you're in Gowala.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.000]   I think Kevin has money in both.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.520]   He's got money in both, which is a little weird, but yes.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.000]   Well, he's betting the race, not the horses.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.200]   He's betting horse racing.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.640]   I think he just bet a lot.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.000]   Do you use the Brett Larson?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.760]   Do you use any of these location-based services?
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   I don't.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:20.760]   Live in New York.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.480]   See, if you live in a big city and you probably go out every night.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:31.600]   Well, I have this weird phobia of people randomly knowing where I mean, it's one thing.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.200]   I'm not to like blow my own horn because if I could, I'd never leave my apartment.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   But when you're...
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   Okay.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   Oh, I just got it.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   Oh.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   When you're on TV, everywhere you go, people know where you are because they wreck, you
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   know, they see you.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.280]   Oh, so you're not allowed to go out?
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.680]   You're that biggest celebrity in Manhattan that people would say...
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.640]   We have to be very careful.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.280]   We always were warned about, you know, you don't want to update your Facebook and say,
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.440]   "Oh, I'm going to be here."
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.840]   Because they'll track it down.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.360]   Well, because then people like, stalkers can show up.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   And there's this great website.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.840]   Have you seen PleaseRobMe.com?
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   Yes.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.400]   We interviewed him last week on Net at Night.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   That is...
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.560]   I mean, that's a great example.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.600]   I mean, look, I live in a large apartment building.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   You'd be hard for...
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.680]   Well, you don't say, "Here's my address.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   I'm going out.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680]   I'll be back in five hours."
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.440]   You don't put that on four-square.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:26.120]   Here's my argument against the PleaseRobMe.com Monday through Friday, most people are at work.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.120]   Right.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   You know that.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   Criminals only go out at night.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   I mean, what the hell is that?
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.800]   Stupid, well, they're stupid.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   So let me play this.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   I just...
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   I just...
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   I don't have to say...
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   Don't object to it.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   I just...
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   I just want to go out.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.840]   Now that I'm only on the radio, people don't know what I'm doing.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.240]   Yeah, they have no idea exactly.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   Radio's...
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   This is why radio's always been the best medium.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.240]   It's good.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.160]   Hey, Leo, before you play that, I just want to...
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.560]   I want to air a gripe.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.560]   Okay.
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.120]   Now that I have this big platform, because this is like my pet peeve, I love the general
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   idea of four-square.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.640]   I like being able to say in four-square, "Hey, I'm here."
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.520]   And it has tips that it says what's cool, the place you're at.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   And you can be the mayor.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.800]   You want to find friends, and if you stay within four-square, it's cool.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.480]   But there are people who push their four-square where they are and that they've ousted the
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:22.960]   mayor of the Denny's restroom out to Twitter and Facebook, and it clutters up that stream.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:29.280]   And I want to make an appeal to all the four-square, Goala and Yelp users.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.160]   Don't do it.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.880]   It's really irritating.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.040]   I posted my Facebook.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   I should probably stop.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   I'll turn that off.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.040]   Facebook's okay.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.520]   Facebook, I think it fits there.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.520]   Yeah, I don't put it in Twitter.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.520]   It's not a constant stream.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   Yeah, I don't put it in Twitter.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.440]   It's just really irritating.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.680]   I put in my real-time news feed on Facebook, patent-abending.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.200]   So here's the ad.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:56.280]   This will be on Bravo tonight, but you get to see it here first from foursquare.com.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.440]   Bravo wants you to connect with your friends on four-square.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.680]   Where are you going from here?
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:05.240]   Just checking on your mobile using the free guides by Bravo or four-square apps.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.520]   You'll find your friends and the best Bravo Liberty tips on where to go.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   Bravo Liberty.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   What is that?
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.080]   It's your mobile, my Bravo.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.280]   Now that's interesting.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.680]   That's a deal, obviously, that four-square is made.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   Good for them.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   That's the place to have it run.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   Bravo.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   Really?
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   Bravo to them.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   Bravo.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   Like the channel for people.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   Oh, it is.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   So it's the channel for people who go out?
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.680]   No.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   It's a lot like her.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   It's the channel that people watch.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.640]   It gives them stuff to talk about.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:42.520]   So it is for tips to go out and be like, "Did you see Pimp My Runway or whatever the
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   hell the shows are going to hold on?"
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.000]   I was told one of the reasons that we're launching a morning show is I was told several
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.880]   times in many different ways by ad agencies in our own ad reps that 18 to 34-year-old
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:58.680]   people who are the obvious target for go wall on foursquare don't watch TV.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   They don't see ads.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:03.880]   They have no exposure to ads and drives advertisers crazy that they can't reach this
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.880]   group.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.120]   And so they're desperate to reach this group.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:12.160]   And that would be a good reason why these apps might be very valuable for them.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:20.400]   Well, you got to figure if you can get your semi-popular show or popular show onto a
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.520]   social networking application and then integrate it into people's lives, like that's my synergy
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.760]   motion.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.200]   You synergize all of these things together.
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.840]   Nicely synergized.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:37.320]   And then not only are you down at the West End Tavern, my favorite drinking hole across
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.320]   the street from me.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.320]   See now you're going to stalkers.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.240]   You're going to be stalked.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:48.200]   That you're there and other people are there and maybe you're talking about Bravo shows.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   Right.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   No, no, no, no.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   Chanson Hell.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.280]   In related news, the Jersey Shore has now signed a deal with chat Roulette.
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.280]   Okay, let's talk about chat Roulette.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:05.000]   Even my wife even my wife knows about chat Roulette and she doesn't know about anything.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.280]   I was actually on chat Roulette with your wife last night.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.280]   What?
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.480]   Okay, so that would be Jason's last appearance on Twitter.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.520]   Oh, no, we love we love whatever you just said.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.520]   I'm sure is fine.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   So I'm going to go to chat Roulette.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.960]   So what happens with chat Roulette is what you're going to go to chat Roulette live.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   You can't do that.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   Why not?
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.960]   You think there's some naked guys going to be on there?
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   One out of 20.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   Don't do it.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   One out of 20 is a penis.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:30.960]   How do I start this?
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   That's the tagline.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.200]   But it says chat Roulette does not tolerate broadcasting.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.760]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   Right on.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.920]   You can't have everything on the internet have to turn into porn.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   Click play.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920]   Okay.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   No, it's going.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   You have to hit the play on the top left.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   Top left.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   What?
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.920]   The other.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.920]   The other top left.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   He goes on his ball.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   It works.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   Where are you?
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.560]   Where are you from?
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.960]   Hello, we're calling it.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.960]   You chat.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.960]   You type.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.960]   Oh, you're typing?
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   What's the level?
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.960]   She won head.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.880]   Oh, they press next.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.520]   Dude, you just got you just got more clicks than you will ever have in the rest of your
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.520]   life.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:17.520]   All right.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   So I'm going to play next.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520]   So are you pressed next, right?
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   And that's you.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.520]   Okay.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   It only took one.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   You were a little.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.520]   Leo.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   He just realized he's get the dot button.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.520]   If I get it, if I get an FCC fine for this.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.520]   No, there's no FCC.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.520]   It's the internet.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.520]   Oh my God.
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:52.520]   I think that's the first live penis on the wheel.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.520]   I was on this week.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.520]   Oh, no, no.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.520]   Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.520]   I probably should have.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   I should press next and then hit the button to show what's on camera.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.520]   That was interesting.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.520]   This is sad.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.520]   Sad lonely.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.520]   But see, as soon as they see me, she's looking for penises, obviously.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   You need to catch.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   It would be great if you could connect other people.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   So what is this?
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.520]   What is this?
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.520]   What is this?
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:16.520]   You found one.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.520]   Connect them.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.520]   I know.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.520]   Yes, right.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.520]   I know where one is.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.520]   What is the appeal of this?
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   It's a back button.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.520]   Is there a back button?
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   There is no back button.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.520]   Fortunately, there's no back button.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.520]   Oh, no.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.520]   It's a little like a five-button.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   Now, this isn't, now, this isn't new.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.520]   I remember this from a couple of years ago.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   Somebody did the same thing.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.520]   But for some reason, it's just attracted a lot of attention.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   There was one called CUCMe.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   You remember '95, '96, '97?
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.520]   Except that was you could have 20 different streams up at once.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.520]   It was a university project.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:57.520]   Oh, we know where that's going.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.520]   Is that going down?
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.520]   Yeah, he's got his hand.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.920]   His hand was...
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.520]   Where was that other hand?
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.520]   So who does this?
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   Who is doing this?
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:13.520]   It's about 10% female, about 80% penis and 10% other.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.520]   Hey, there's the soundest brothers.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.520]   It's the Jonas Brothers, everybody.
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.520]   Oh, they didn't want to stick around.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   See, nobody wants to stick around with me.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.520]   They see me and they go, "Oh, that's, I don't want to see that."
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:24.520]   But this is what you get a lot of the groups of people.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   So you get groups of girls in a dorm room.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.520]   So what I did the other night was I put Taurus and Fondue on it.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   Oh, that's clever.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.520]   Everybody stops.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.520]   They will not hit F9.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.520]   So get a really cool...
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.520]   Try to eat a dog.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.520]   You need a dog.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.520]   In fact, I should get out of the picture.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.520]   You just have the dog in the picture.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.520]   Or what you could do is you could just route it to a video of like a dog running around a circle.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.520]   And they wouldn't know if you used that video thing.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.520]   Right.
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.520]   You're talking about a video hacker thing.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520]   Let's go.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   Somebody's talking.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.520]   Hello?
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   Hello?
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   Hello?
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.520]   Hi.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.520]   Hi, where are you?
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.520]   Yes, I can hear you.
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.520]   Where are you from?
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   Where's from Denmark?
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   Hello, Denmark.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.520]   I'm calling from California.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.520]   California.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:04.520]   Oh my god.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   That's great.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   Your English is excellent for a Danish person.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520]   Thank you.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.520]   How's the weather there?
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.520]   Oh, it's sunny and beautiful.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:13.520]   How is it Denmark?
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:18.520]   We got snow all over here.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.520]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.520]   How many penises have you seen on?
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:23.520]   No, they disconnected.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.520]   They disconnected.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.520]   Obviously, I wasn't wooing them.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.520]   Wow.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.520]   That's okay.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   I can see why that's kind of appealing.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.520]   I mean, it's kind of frankly, I couldn't stop pressing F9.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:38.520]   Yeah, but where's the revenue stream on something?
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.520]   There's no revenue stream.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.520]   It's a 17 year old kid in Moscow who's doing it.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   Is it really?
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.520]   Yep.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.520]   Wow.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   I mean, you can make this a guy.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.520]   Fred, the guy that's decent.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.520]   What's his last name?
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.520]   Jason Fred Davis?
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.520]   Fred Wilson.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   Yeah, he was a brand new.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.520]   He offered to fly him over.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.520]   Really?
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.520]   But this is a trivial thing to do.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.520]   You could do this with the.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.520]   But he did it.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.520]   He did it.
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.520]   And he created a meme.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.520]   All right.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up because I think that would be more compelling than
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   me.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:38.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:45.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   I'm going to try holding the clock up.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.520]   He looked busy.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.520]   I'm going to have a bet.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.520]   Wow.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   Dorm room.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.520]   I don't know what to say.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   It seems to me, unfortunately,
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   that that's what the Internet was invented for.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:29.060]   That's what the song an Internet
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:33.060]   for the next generation's television.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.060]   Just like when we got, you know, I remember when I was a kid
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.060]   and we got cable TV, it was like we went from having five channels
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:43.060]   to having 35 channels and 30 of them were junk.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.060]   Now the Internet, it's like you went from having a thousand channels
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:49.060]   to an unlimited number of millions.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.060]   Millions.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.060]   Millions.
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:52.060]   And this is what we've done with it.
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.060]   Turned our cameras on and watching random people pop up.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:57.060]   Miguel helped writing in the New York Times this week says
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:01.060]   Intel was also a victim of the kind, almost exactly the same kind
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:05.060]   of cyber attack that occurred on Google and other companies.
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.060]   Intel is, I think, only the second or third company to admit it.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:12.060]   And we're starting to see indications that maybe hundreds of
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:15.060]   companies were hacked by the Chinese at this time.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.060]   Chuck Malloy at Google said the only connection between what we saw
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.060]   in January and the tax on Google is timing, but according to the
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.060]   New York Times, Intel was part of the same wave of attacks that
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:27.060]   affected the Google.
[00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:31.060]   And Malloy said later, based on more research, we can't rule out
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.060]   there may be other similarities between the Google and Intel
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.060]   attacks.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.060]   There's also a story in computer world that says that more than
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.060]   a hundred companies were targeted.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.060]   And if you're a company, you don't want to be on this list because
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.060]   it makes it look like you don't have control of your people.
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.060]   A lot of this was social engineering and phishing.
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.060]   And so I don't see a lot of people wanting to cop to this.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.060]   And yet I'm kind of in a way, I think Google should get some
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:58.060]   credit for stepping forward and saying it happened to them.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   I mean, look, if Google got hacked, these guys are sophisticated.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   Well, and you know, it gave Google a chance, I think, to do
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.060]   something that a lot of its executives had wanted to do for a
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.060]   while, which I think was finding out in China.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.060]   Right.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:17.060]   Walmart adds its clout to movie streaming also from the
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.060]   movie streaming also from the New York Times.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:24.060]   Walmart says it's agreed to buy voodoo.
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.060]   Remember voodoo?
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.060]   Whatever happened to them.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.060]   They got bought by Walmart.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.060]   Well, yeah.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.060]   That's what happened to them.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.060]   It was three years old.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.060]   It was a movie service.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.060]   They were actually building them into Blu-ray players and
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.060]   TVs.
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:44.060]   According to the Times, 60, the price for the company was over
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.060]   a hundred million dollars.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:50.060]   Best by Amazon, Comcast and Echo Star had also shown some
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.060]   interest in voodoo.
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.060]   So what does this do?
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.060]   First thing.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:57.060]   I think it's great because it needs to happen.
[00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.060]   The movie, the movie streaming stuff.
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:04.060]   Well, is this like a Roku kind of thing?
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:06.060]   I love the Roku.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.060]   I do too.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.060]   We're on the Roku.
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.060]   We love the Roku because we're on the Roku.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.060]   And you know what?
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.060]   Here's my complaint about the Roku.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:14.060]   I love it.
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.060]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.060]   But there's not enough movies.
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.060]   There's not enough like Blockbuster movies.
[00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:23.060]   There's plenty of indie films and documentaries and TV shows.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:27.060]   But I want, you know, I want that HBO to go thing, which I
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.060]   actually get now because I have the Fios, Verizon Fios.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:31.060]   You have Xfinity.
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.060]   Yes.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.060]   No Xfinity is the Comcast.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.060]   That's called Verizon Fios.
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.060]   It's test marketing that HBO go.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:39.060]   HBO to go.
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:42.060]   Well, when they say to go, what do they mean to go?
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.060]   Like you could take it with you?
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.060]   You can log into HBO from your computer.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:52.060]   So effectively you could do it at work and waste more time and watch HBO content kind
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.060]   of like you can with the on demand.
[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:56.060]   So I think it's great.
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.060]   It's cool.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.060]   It's for HBO.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:59.060]   Yeah.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.060]   But you know, HBO is the big kid in town.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.060]   So they can be very restrictive with their content because they have very desirable content.
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:11.060]   They're the one company making content people will actually pay for.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.060]   Right.
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.060]   Or wait for.
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:14.060]   There's a lot of people waiting for.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:17.060]   And you just have to prove that you have any HBO subscription to get it, right?
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.060]   That's going to be the plan.
[00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:19.060]   Well, I have to access it.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:23.620]   I have to use my Verizon Fios login email, which I hate to admit this.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   I never set it up.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.620]   So I don't know what it is.
[00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.620]   Just very similar part though.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.020]   I have this problem all the time.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.020]   I use Gmail.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.020]   I can never remember.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.020]   What's my Comcast email?
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.020]   What are they talking about?
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.020]   Exactly.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.020]   When do you ever use your internet service providers email?
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:38.060]   I'm not going to use it.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.060]   So I can have a Verizon Fios.net password or email.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.900]   We're just, we're just, we're not real people.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.900]   We're outliers.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.100]   I like my email portable.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.100]   Like it portable.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.100]   Very interesting.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.060]   I was watching the tsunami coverage yesterday.
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.540]   Of course, everybody was worried.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:54.420]   Their alarms were going off all over Hawaii.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.700]   Everybody was worried that Hawaii was going to get hit by a pretty big tidal wave.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.820]   Thank goodness it did not.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.060]   But what did you see on CNN on all the local stations?
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.860]   You stream stream stream stream.
[00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.260]   Yeah, they were you streaming it.
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.420]   I saw you stream coverage of Chile.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.420]   They go.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:16.620]   They went with quick and Skype and they were talking to people in Chile via Skype.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:23.060]   They were yeah, tuning in to like three or four TV stations over a U stream.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.180]   That was a watershed moment.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:25.180]   I think so.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.900]   Didn't did you stream just got a pretty big influx of cash as I remember.
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:32.300]   75 million dollars from Masa from Softbank.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.420]   Masa, I know Masa is a friend of mine.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:39.420]   He run Softbank in Japan and he was the richest man in the world at one point actually.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:40.420]   Sun saw.
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.060]   Yeah, Sun.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:46.220]   And he's a Korean but born in Japan I believe.
[00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.460]   He's living in Japan his whole life.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:50.420]   He's the most powerful guy in Japan.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:54.500]   And he put in 75 million dollars I think.
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.620]   And he bought most of the company and he is going to be bringing it to China and Japan.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.620]   Interesting.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:00.620]   And he sees it as the future.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:04.700]   So those guys are Brad and his partner and just congratulations to them.
[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:05.700]   Yeah, big big big.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.620]   Of course, we're they're one of our streaming partners.
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:12.020]   In fact, they're the ones that allow us to do live streaming on the iPhone just through
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:17.700]   Safari because they have an H.264 stream which we love.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.260]   So yeah, this is a real business and I didn't know.
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.420]   Do you think they're the winner?
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:23.340]   I mean, we have big gravity Justin TV.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.340]   There's live stream.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.460]   Yeah, they're going to win.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.220]   You think it's because it's 75 million they're going to win?
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.780]   I think they have the best product.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.780]   Okay.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:37.540]   Because I was going to say is it is it no longer that you've got the hippest name for the most
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:41.580]   users is it that you actually have to have the best platform and the best.
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.260]   I think they're all the same platform.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.260]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:46.260]   We use them all.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.260]   I don't think there's that much difference.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.260]   What do you use?
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.260]   You use them all?
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.020]   I use you stream.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.460]   But I think that you stream is a little more robust than Justin TV.
[00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:56.500]   I don't think Justin TV is bad.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:01.980]   Justin TV feels like a lot of people like putting soccer games illegally online.
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:02.980]   Right.
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.820]   That's a big problem for all of these stick ammo is a big problem because they had a
[00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:09.340]   lot of cam girls and it was very hard to live that down.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.860]   You stream feels like they're doing content deals correctly.
[00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:13.860]   Right.
[00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.780]   It's all about the content.
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:16.780]   They have a deal with CBS.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.100]   They can actually put CBS online legally.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.580]   Right.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:21.580]   And they do.
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:26.780]   I hate to see anyone win only because it's good for us that there's some competition
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.580]   and there are different streams.
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:32.340]   If you go to live.tv you'll see along the bottom you can click different streams and
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.700]   find the one that works the best for you at the moment.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.260]   I hate to see one just dominate that.
[00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.260]   It's not going to be one.
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.020]   They'll be the winner but they'll be like winner with 30% of the market.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.020]   Right.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.020]   Okay.
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.020]   Good.
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.020]   That's fine by me.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.020]   No, I love Brad's a good friend.
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:47.020]   He's been very supportive.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.860]   We started streaming on you stream many, many moons ago now.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:54.780]   I think that what they really need to do is just take the top end content and lock them
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:57.940]   in and do like multi year deals with them and just go to somebody like you and say,
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.020]   we're going to buy your stream for this many years.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.020]   Right.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.020]   Just knowing where the direction they're going and they should lock in the top content,
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.020]   the top 10 people.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.300]   It's smart.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.620]   We were exclusive to stick cam for a while and I didn't like exclusivity because if
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.660]   their servers had problems and everybody has problems from time to time, then I would
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.180]   be down.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.180]   But I guess if you have that much money and you have that much infrastructure now, it's
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.780]   not as much an issue.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.780]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:23.340]   Oh, it could still happen regardless.
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.340]   Yeah, I know.
[00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.340]   Welcome to the end.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.340]   I mean, diversity is good.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.300]   That's one reason why your setup is that works well.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.900]   Is it if one doesn't work well, you choose the other.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:32.900]   We learned.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:36.060]   We learned the hard way that that's the that's kind of what you have to do.
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:39.180]   Hey, this portion of the show brought to you by my friends at Squarespace.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:44.220]   They are going to be really a great friend to Twit because it's their offices that we're
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.060]   going to use for our New York venture.
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.860]   I'm very kind of them to step right up.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.820]   They just we're big fans of them and they're big fans of Twit squares.
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:57.060]   I want you to go to squarespace.com/twit and visit Squarespace.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:01.500]   It is a web hosting company slash software company.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.180]   So it's not a content management system alone.
[00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:09.340]   It's also the hosting starts as little as eight bucks a month.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:14.500]   What's great about that, even if you have the eight buck a month system, their virtual
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:20.660]   server technology means you'll never get overrun by, you know, if I should pull up your site
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:25.140]   on Twit or slash dot or dig, you can handle it.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:28.660]   You get the great Squarespace iPhone app, which makes it really easy to post.
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:32.900]   You can import and export content from movable type WordPress type plaid and blogger.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.460]   They've got social media integration.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.860]   Beautiful templates too.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:38.060]   They just really look good.
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.060]   We're moving.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:42.980]   I finally, finally said, all right, we're going to move the tech guy radio show over.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:47.420]   Our company blog is on it inside Twit, which is inside dot Twit.tv.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.420]   That's a Squarespace site.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.180]   But you know, it's what's nice about Squarespace.
[00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.180]   The sites all look different.
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:55.060]   You couldn't tell that one site is a Squarespace site or another.
[00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:59.660]   Many photographers use it for their portfolios.
[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:04.500]   That's because Squarespace has incredible galleries built in.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.660]   It's automatic.
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.620]   You know, it captures your vision.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.180]   You can use the templates.
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.460]   You can customize the templates.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:16.900]   But if you know CSS and JavaScript, you can also do anything.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.100]   You really want to go to squarespace.com/examples.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.100]   Yes.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.500]   That's where you can see how impressive it is.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500]   I don't know.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   That should be the front page of my mind.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   Look at this.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.740]   They're all great and they all look different.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:28.340]   And easy to do.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.340]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.660]   You know, I know those people come to you and say, hey, can you help me build my website
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.660]   and all this kind of stuff?
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.300]   And you're like, it's not what I do for a living.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.300]   I don't build websites.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.700]   Just send them to Squarespace because they get it done themselves.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.220]   You'll save them from having to hire some designer for $5,000.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:44.060]   Who doesn't return phone calls?
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.060]   Right.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.060]   These guys are incredible.
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.060]   Just incredible.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.580]   They do a solid job.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.940]   Squarespace.com/Twit to find out more.
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.740]   And yeah, go to squarespace.com/examples to take a look at these samples.

[01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340]   Don't forget Squarespace.
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.340]   Give it a try.
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.340]   I think you will be very happy with it.
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.740]   By the way, it's free without a credit card.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.060]   So it's like, you don't even need to take your credit card out, which is nice.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.540]   I really like it when people do that.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.820]   It just makes it very simple.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.780]   And I just want to point out everybody in the audience, if you're hearing my voice, it is
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.460]   your geary, your humble responsibility to thank the sponsors on Twitter and Facebook
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.460]   and Buzz.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:34.820]   You just go thanks@audible.ts_com@squarespace and at go to meeting.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.820]   Just thank them.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:36.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.820]   I do.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.820]   I thank them.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.820]   Why do I thank them?
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.820]   We wouldn't be.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.540]   You know, in fact, one of the reasons we can even contemplate this morning shows because
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.460]   the advertisers, all of these advertisers, including Squarespace and Citrix, stepped up
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.340]   and said Ford's going to come along.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.340]   They said, yeah, what is this?
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.340]   I heard about this on the...
[01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.260]   I was listening to this this week in Google and they alluded to it.
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.260]   What is going on?
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.340]   So Squarespace is moving into a new office.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.260]   They have still a long-term lease on their old office.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.260]   It's on Broom Street.
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.260]   It's in Soho.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.260]   It's beautiful.
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.260]   Beautiful.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.540]   And they said, well, why don't you use it for a Twit East?
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.460]   And I said, well, you know what I'd like to do is build a studio out there and hire somebody
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.900]   like, I don't know, Brett Larson.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.180]   And we're talking to other people as well.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.180]   And I won't say names.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:21.540]   And to host a morning show, an early morning show, Daily Monday through Friday Live out
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.060]   of there that is like Twit.
[01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.540]   It's tech-focused, but it's fun.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:28.620]   It's upbeat because we're on all these portable platforms like the iPhone and the Nexus One
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.540]   and streaming everywhere, you know, as soon in the next few months.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.980]   We'll be streaming everywhere.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:37.460]   So couldn't you wake up to a morning show that is on the internet instead of on a radio?
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.460]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.860]   And then you get up, you start making breakfast and you turn on the TV.
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.860]   It's there too.
[01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.860]   You get in the car.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.860]   It's still there.
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.180]   And that's what that's what we want to do.
[01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:49.380]   And I just think that this is going to be not not merely interesting for us, but I think
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.820]   a breakthrough for internet media to.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.820]   I agree.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.980]   It's the one.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.140]   It's the it's the final frontier.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.380]   It's bringing it all together now because it's on all the platforms.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.380]   Exactly.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:08.140]   And it's that that prime market of time as someone who used to employ me once said, the
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.500]   only growth in media is in the morning.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.500]   The morning shows.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.500]   That's where people are getting up.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   And that's where they listen.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.100]   That's where radio makes all of its who is that?
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.100]   Okay.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.100]   That's better.
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.020]   It was just, you know, it's some interference or something.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:24.700]   So I was thinking, I was already got, you know, Kevin Celis who does internet.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.260]   It does a weather podcast.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.260]   He wants to be the weatherman.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.500]   So we're going to have a staff meeting your own just, but then I thought, you know, we
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500]   shouldn't do weather.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.660]   We should do internet forecast.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:37.300]   Well, as we'll look adjusted over a May West and going down to the South.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:39.300]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.300]   That would be awesome.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.620]   So, Leo, are you going to do any, you know, you say it's going to be an internet show.
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.420]   You're going to do any traditional news.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.420]   I think we'll have news.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.420]   You're going to do some news.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.420]   We'll have news at the top of every hour.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:52.420]   Just like you would on a regular radio show.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.300]   Fewer units, you know, we're only going to do maybe five units instead of they do,
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:01.580]   they do, you know, I work in commercial radio still, 19 minutes an hour of commercials,
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.580]   of commercials.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:07.420]   When I take my radio show and edit out all the commercials, news and traffic, a three-hour
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.860]   show becomes two hours long.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:11.420]   So we won't do that much.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.140]   We'll do maybe five units an hour.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.620]   But we will have a lot of those features because it's full service, right?
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.340]   When you get up, you need to know those things.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.340]   Right.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340]   And I think it really do that.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.340]   It'll be fun.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:25.500]   And I feel like if you can give people that information and entertain them a little bit
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:30.060]   and give them a bit of information about a subject that they like, which everybody loves,
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.460]   tech, you're golden.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.460]   Exactly.
[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.100]   Anyway, it's a really exciting idea.
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.860]   And one of the reasons I'm really thrilled to have Brett do this is he's in New York.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.860]   He's cool.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.860]   He's hip.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.220]   And he knows, you know, technology as, and so it's perfect.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.780]   We need people like the funny, lively, interesting young 18 to 30.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.660]   You're still under 34, right, Brett?
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:52.660]   Actually, I am.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:53.660]   Thank goodness.
[01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:54.660]   18 to 34.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.340]   That's why I'm not doing it.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.340]   That's why I'm not involved.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:04:59.820]   I'm too old for this stuff.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.820]   I'm going to become a logo.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.820]   Will it be branded to it?
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:03.820]   I think it'll be called Twit Morning.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:04.820]   I don't know exactly what we're all about.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:05.820]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.820]   Oh, it'll be great to do it.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:10.380]   Wouldn't you listen if it were especially your fun?
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.380]   Of course.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.860]   I'm trying to talk Clayton into doing it with us.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.020]   It's a lot of work to do a daily show.
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.020]   I mean, it is.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.220]   We'll have staff for it because it is.
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.220]   It's a ton of work.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:24.940]   You're going to need two engineers and two hosts and a producer, five people, right?
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.620]   Yeah, that's exactly what we're planning.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:32.140]   Actually, we're planning four hosts, two of them producer types as well as hosts, an executive
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140]   producer, engineer.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:37.460]   And then a lot, you know, what's funny, as soon as I mentioned this, people have volunteered
[01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.460]   like crazy.
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:42.060]   There's so many people in the New York area who want to be part of this.
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.940]   Yeah, there's a lot of talent and it's not like there's any place for them to go right
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.860]   now because Tech TV is gone.
[01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.700]   It really is very little opportunity for an on-air talent.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.220]   The local news stations have imploded.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.220]   Exactly.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.220]   Yes, they have.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.060]   So we promise these guys get, you know, the guys from local TV are overpaid.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:00.540]   Well, I know.
[01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.220]   And I can't pay that kind of money.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.660]   So I look for people who are out of work.
[01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.660]   They have to be entrepreneur.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.820]   They have to want to get a percentage revenue.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.820]   That's what we're doing.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.820]   We're doing a rev share.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.820]   That's exactly right.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:11.820]   Yes, that will.
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:15.740]   You would see that to me is the way it should have always been when I was in radio.
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.420]   I wanted to cut the ads.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:18.420]   Right.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.940]   Give me my, no downside.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:25.420]   Five dollars an hour, whatever the crap money I was making, but give me 10%.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.420]   And you're doing the ads.
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:30.500]   So the results are tied to you and all that.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.500]   What time would you start, Leo?
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   What time would you do?
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:35.180]   That was saying, I was going to say six to 10.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:36.180]   And then Brett says, that's too early.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.500]   Don't be up at that hour.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.500]   Eight o'clock.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:43.700]   The New York Metro is weird though, because it's, it's, you've got multiple, you've got
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.500]   like, it's like multiple rings of people where you've got the people on the island and the
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:52.300]   people in New Jersey, Long Island, not Manhattan, who get up at five to get into the city by
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.300]   eight.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:57.100]   And then as you get closer, your commute, you know, shrinks down.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.500]   So you, your commute times go all the way to nine o'clock.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.180]   Well, and then they'll repeat it because that's why we do it back east.
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.780]   We pre-ed it again for the West Coast.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:06.060]   And frankly, you know, and I think we're going to have a separate channel for it and just
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.180]   repeat around the clock because we have people all over the world who listen, who would love
[01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:13.220]   to get up to this, those girls in Denmark, you know, they had it.
[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.020]   They said they had a lot of snow.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.220]   There's a lot of snow out here.
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.460]   And that mark.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.580]   I know why they didn't have the camera on because, because I could tell they were hot.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.020]   Yeah, they were, they were definitely in a hot tub with snow around.
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:27.220]   Yeah, we are very invite.
[01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:34.220]   We are not going to be a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:41.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:46.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:51.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:56.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:02.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:11.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:16.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:21.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:25.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.220]   little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.220]   a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.220]   than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:33.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:09:15.220]   more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:22.100]   reading things on it, looking at media on it. I think it's a really good device for people who
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:26.340]   aren't necessarily interested in the pain that a real computer can bring.
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:34.180]   I just look at it, well I look at it from how I would use it and I see it as it looks like
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:39.540]   an iPhone that got run over by a steamroller so it looks like a big iPhone and I don't like
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:44.180]   I think that would be kind of nice to take to the gym to watch like a TV show while
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.380]   you're running on the treadmill but then when you're done you got to carry it around if you
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:51.300]   want to listen to your music. Yeah, no I saw it. It's too big for the music.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:55.380]   I think it's going to be a bigger success than anybody realizes because I think there's all
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:02.180]   these individual little use cases like reader, TV, gym and there's enough of those in a lot of
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:07.060]   different slices that people will buy them. I can't wait to play scramble on it and so people will
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:11.540]   buy them and then they'll go they'll be the other uses for it. Yeah, I don't.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:16.740]   What I'm curious to see is what will happen with magazines because I feel like,
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:21.780]   and this is, I'm not looking at a crystal ball, this is obvious, magazines are just
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:28.100]   dying by the waist by last Sunday. I feel like if it was done right, this really,
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.540]   this could be good for me. John Battelle though it wrote and I thought a very good
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:36.740]   point where in which he says, look at this is just more media lock-in. It doesn't make sense in the
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:44.980]   age of the web to lock content into Apple's, you know, 100% right. But there is a browser on it,
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:51.860]   Jason. I know but the problem is the whole selling of content he's going to try to put through there
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:59.700]   like he locked down music and it's just any publisher who supports this is, you know, if it's
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:04.340]   closed like this, it's not a good idea. This is what Jeff Jarvis says, he says it's a step backwards,
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.580]   this is not the web as we know, the open web and in the long run it.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:12.740]   Oh, it doesn't have that, that ebook reader open format?
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:19.540]   It's SportsE pub. Yeah, it's ePub with DRM on it. Oh, there's DRM, not necessary.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:24.100]   On their applications of the books that they're selling it'll be, have DRM.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:28.180]   I think it's- I got some information though that's pretty interesting about this.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:35.700]   I talked to a very large publisher and I was like, how could you give Steve Jobs all of this information
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.900]   without getting the email address of your customers because you're in charge of circulation.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:44.980]   If you give away your circulation, you're crazy. He got any said to me, a major publishing person.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:50.820]   No, we will not do it and I told Steve Jobs we will not do it unless we have access to the
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:59.060]   list of people who are the subscribers. So if you subscribe to X newspaper, the newspaper deserves
[01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.620]   to know who their subscribers are. I think it has fair. Yes.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:05.140]   And Steve Jobs rolled over like a puppy and got his belly rubbed.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:08.020]   Well, he was he wearing that hat that they talked about that he was wearing?
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:12.740]   I don't know. He basically acquiesced. So I think he has to go on. He has to go on.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.220]   Well, he didn't do the music companies. Yeah, this is different. I know it is, but what it
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:20.500]   points out is that he's a great poker player in the music industry and the TV industry or not.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.260]   The TV industry and music industry say to him, if people download our stuff, we get their contact
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:28.740]   info. Right. If he rolled over then he got something as well.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:35.140]   Yeah. But I feel like the example of the music industry, they desperately needed
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:40.340]   something to stop the the Napsters and the in the Lime Wire and all that all this
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:46.100]   rampant free downloading. They needed something and I really feel like Apple provided the best
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:50.420]   service for them. And it was a great obviously great starting point because of all the things
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:55.220]   that have come since with publishers. I'm shocked. I would feel I would feel like they would be
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.820]   rolling over just as like, please help us. Why aren't they more desperate?
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:03.140]   Well, they're not more desperate because they do have an outlet. They do have the web.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:09.460]   Most publishers, I think, have a stated strategy where they'll give you a whole lot of content
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:15.780]   free. They'll give you some that you pay for individually and then to get a really good experience,
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:20.420]   which is what the iPad will do. They'll charge you for those apps. You're going to see the New York
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:27.060]   Times app become a paid app and they'll be selling subscriptions out of that. And so there's like
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:32.260]   a free tier strategy and there will still be the free stuff. I think breaking news is going to
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:36.820]   always be free because that's a commodity. What's happening right now, but as things kind of spread
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:41.380]   out, you get longer pieces and more thoughtful pieces and content that you really can't get
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:46.900]   anywhere, a Wall Street Journal model, you'll pay for that and then you'll pay for great presentation.
[01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:55.060]   And also it opens up the door for some of the larger networks to provide sort of a freemium.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:01.940]   You can watch CNN on your cable and it's great and you can go to our website and get stuff for free.
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:07.860]   And now for a dollar a month, I'm totally making this up, for a dollar a month, you can get access to
[01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:16.100]   our CNN archives exclusive content that you're not going to, they'll stop putting stuff on their
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:20.820]   website to get you to take it. Because I feel like news, the only way news agencies are going to
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:25.620]   make money on the web because of what you're saying news is that just a commodity, everybody's
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.940]   doing it is archives. They got it. They got it. If you put that stuff out there and you could go back
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:36.020]   and watch news back when it was really well done, you might be able to pay for that.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.060]   What was that?
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:43.300]   Although, you know, 40 years ago, for Brett started to realize where he was going with this one.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.620]   It was like, it's been a while. New seconds, though.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:54.820]   Newspapers have been doing this for a while. We put our archives at first behind a wall.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:15:01.140]   You had to register to see it or even earlier days of the web, you paid to get to the archives.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.780]   And slowly, they've kind of been taking these walls off of it, mainly because they thought there
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:12.020]   would be a lot of page views from archives. And it turns out that at least for a lot of papers,
[01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:18.420]   that hasn't happened. Video may be different. It'd be really interesting to see all these archives
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:23.940]   from history on there. But there's also the issue of getting them onto the web, which is not trivial
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:29.460]   when you're talking about video. That's true. But there's got to be a reason to do it. A great
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:35.700]   example that I love to share because I thought it was genius when I was at CBS. A couple of years
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:40.260]   ago, the subway went on strike. And it wasn't the first time the subway went on strike. So what CBS
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:45.780]   did is they dug up, I don't know how, because we had this antiquated tape library that was like
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:51.460]   in a dark, wet room. There was a guy. I know what it is. It's on the buying shelf.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:56.580]   There really was too. God rest in soul. But there really was a guy you'd go and you'd be like,
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:03.700]   school shooting 1974, 104th Street in Amsterdam, go down the hall there, turn left, bottom shelf,
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:09.860]   red tape. But what they did was they put up all the news coverage of the subway strike
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:15.460]   from the 1970s. So when we were doing this wall to wall coverage, which local news is so fond of,
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:20.180]   of the. Oh my God, the subways aren't working. We could also say, hey, you know, this isn't the
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.500]   first time this has happened. Go take a look at what happened and see the resolutions and see the
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.540]   progression of it from last time. That's where you can't just tell people, here's our archives,
[01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:35.060]   dig around. You have to give people a, well, this isn't the first time a president has had a physical
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:40.100]   first time. You know who does that so well is the daily show. I don't know who they've got as their
[01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:44.100]   librarian or their editors. Stepstream. They're using a company called Stepstream,
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:51.220]   base turn Houston. Really? Yeah, that basically does contextual searches within video because
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:55.700]   they can find anything. I mean, they'll pull up and I mean, in real time and almost because I
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:00.740]   mean, it's like three hours later, they've got a clip reel on the daily show and it's just amazing.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:04.020]   Yeah, it's a great company. They've been around for a long time. They started out with a,
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:12.180]   they started out with a product that was similar to Tivo for PCs and they got out of the consumer
[01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:18.340]   market. I think it's TV, Beyond TV is what it's called. Oh, I remember that. Yeah. And they have
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:23.780]   kind of moved out of the consumer market and then are selling this technology to companies like
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:29.940]   to the daily show. So they must have, do they have, is it done automatically by computers or
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:35.700]   they have humans tagging it? It's taking in the closed captioning, maybe marrying it to the
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:41.620]   video stream. Clever. Clever. There are people also who will crowd sources for you real simply
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:45.780]   for a very small amount of money, like tag this. And then what they do is they'll run two people
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:50.580]   against the same program and they'll only put in the tags that match. Then they have a third person
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.420]   look at the deltas and figure out, Oh, well, this person said there's a horse and this other person
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.820]   said, Oh, they're playing basketball. Oh, I see they're playing the game of horse and basketball.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:03.220]   Whatever. So you have basically two people in India or Manila or whatever. It's like it's a
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:07.780]   mechanical Turk kind of thing. Yeah, or America, you know, any place where you have low price workers
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:14.900]   available. Utah Utah. You tell prisoners. J. Callicannus does a host of shows now he's the
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:19.380]   king of this week in you now officially take the title. In fact, you have this week in.com,
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:25.060]   right? I got the clearance from the Godfather. You gave me clearance to bought it and I hope to
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:33.060]   build a couple of shows and everybody's like, you Leo must hate you. Do this to Leo. And I'm like,
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:38.820]   listen, I asked for permission. I genuinely like that. I said, listen, Godfather, I would like
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:43.780]   couldn't stop you. What it? Mel Allen. Ask Mel Allen. He's a guy who owns this week in baseball.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:47.620]   It's the generic, but I'm thrilled that you're doing it. And I'm glad you're doing you do this
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.780]   week in startups. Yeah, and it's doing great. And we do this week in cloud computing and that's
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:55.620]   got sponsors doing it this week in Android apps, right? And this week in Android. Yes.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:59.540]   So I'm just going to do like niche ones that you don't get to. And as you know, I actually even
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:02.260]   clear with you like, Hey, I'm thinking of two of these ones and you're going to do them. So I'm
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:06.100]   basically like, I respect what you've done in this space enough that I don't want to step on
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:11.060]   your toes and there's plenty of room. Believe me, I need more people succeeding in this because
[01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:15.380]   I don't want to be the only guy out here doing it. It's, you know, it's what's happening is it's
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:19.460]   very much like, you know, Web Logs Inc. We have all these blogs started building on each other,
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.900]   you know, you would I get one sponsor then they buy yours and you know, I for it sponsors on
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.660]   QL the time we're educating them on this new medium like, it's worth sponsoring.
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:29.940]   And it's early enough that there's no competition going on. There's no competition right now.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.140]   Yeah. And another two years. Yeah, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you.
[01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:40.740]   Yeah. Jason, the garbage man's coming to take you out in the garbage man. And if you find a
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:45.700]   horse head in your bed, Jason, you'll know, you'll know where actually I'll not clean up begins
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:50.180]   tomorrow. Leave anything you don't need in the drift. Actually, I might this is my prediction.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:54.820]   I predict that there'll be three or four networks like this weekend and Leo's and
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:59.060]   they'll all wind up merging and be like this mega company. Yeah.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:02.900]   I don't want to run it. I don't want to run it. It's interesting stuff. No, I just think there's
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:06.740]   going to be an exit for everybody because somebody will come and say, Hey, let's put five of these
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:10.180]   things together and get scale. You have five things making a million or two million dollars each.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:15.220]   Put them together. All of a sudden you get scale. Great idea. And then everybody.
[01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:19.700]   Maha. Yeah. That's all right. By then I'm old. I want to be on the beach anyway. Mahalo.com.
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:26.420]   M-A-H-A-L-O.com is Jason's human. Human powered website that has great information on it.
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:33.620]   Dwight Silverman is the tech blog at blogs.cron.com/techblog and you can read his stuff there,
[01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:38.180]   including his weekly link role, which Dwight, I have to confess, gives me the the backbone of
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:44.340]   the newscasts for the whole week. You know, I have a great time doing it. I think that I missed a link
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:50.420]   post yesterday because I was helping with our earthquake tsunami coverage. And I felt horribly
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:54.980]   guilty. And I thought of you, Leo. I thought I've let Leo dance. You did. You let me down. I don't
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:59.620]   have any stories from Friday. But we had good coverage from the tsunami and earthquake. So,
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.940]   yeah, you did. I was amazing. Amazing stuff. Really incredible. Yeah.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:10.900]   And really, I really feel like the earthquake in this tsunami, granted we just had it had one in
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:17.780]   Haiti and it was significantly worse. But it really showed the power of the internet and
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:24.100]   social media and cell phones and used like all of the infrastructure that Haiti didn't have that
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:29.620]   had to be flown in. They had. So it was an immediate like, here's what's happening on the
[01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:35.780]   street right now. It wasn't very interesting. It was interesting to watch the progression of
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:42.580]   the news day. And it was also interesting for us because we're here at Houston, Texas and we were,
[01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:49.140]   we normally would have relied on the Associated Press and so forth. But we were pulling in content
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.980]   from Twitter. We were pulling in video from Ustream. We were pulling in. We were grabbing photos off
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:22:01.620]   Twitpick and putting them into a blog. And so it gave us the ability to do the depth of coverage
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:07.940]   that normally a regional newspaper just wouldn't have. Right. Right. Blogs dot cron.com slash tech
[01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:12.180]   blog. Thank you for being here as always. Do I really appreciate you, Leo? And Brett, I want to
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:17.780]   see a lot more of you. I have a feeling in the next months or so Brett Larson is at Brett Larson
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:23.540]   dot com old, good old friend. And it's really great to see you again and look forward to working
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:27.620]   with you more. Thank you, Leo. Thank you, Brian. Here in New York, we I've survived all four
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:33.940]   snowmageddon. And is it? Well, how much snow is on the ground right now? Well, right now there's
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:38.660]   none. It's all melted. It was 40 something degrees today. The snow was actually up to my window
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:45.780]   yesterday because I have a little balcony up to the window. Very nice. And we got 36 inches of
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:49.460]   snow in the month of February. That's in New York City. That's that's something that's really
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:55.140]   awesome. Wow. That's insanity. Thank you all for being here. Don't forget we do this show live on
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:03.940]   live dot twit dot TV every Sunday at 3 p.m. Pacific time at 6 p.m. Eastern time. 2300 UTC if my
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:08.340]   calculations are correct. I hope you will join us then and subscribe to the show. You can get it
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:14.340]   automatically. We've got we're doing redoing the the URLs. I think you will be automatically
[01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:20.420]   resubscribed to the new we're going to do fits dot feeds dot twit dot TV. And I think it all
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:26.020]   happened automatically and certainly doesn't iTunes. But if for some reason any of the twit feeds
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:30.820]   disappear and you don't see it just resubscribe and more video coming from all the shows this will
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:35.540]   be the first are our I believe this week our iTunes video feed will be coming up just in time
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:43.700]   for chat roulette somebody just named the show. This is the best name twit 237 I got one in two clicks.
[01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:54.020]   I can name that in two clicks. Another twin literally in the can.
