[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Let's get the show started.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Here we go.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   He's getting good.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   He's all warmed up.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, he's firing on six cylinders.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   We better start.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   The big story was, of course.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Do we say "divoract.org/blog"?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   No.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Devoract.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I'm drinking, though.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   A little Jack Daniels here.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.120]   here
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:31.060]   Sounds like the big story was of course the HD DVD story and I came out four days before C ES must have put a little
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.780]   consternation in the bonnets of the HD DVD exhib implement voters on the floor more than others do not to interrupt again even
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.820]   am interrupting mood. Go ahead think about the people that had speeches for the party, the whole HD DVD party
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.120]   part to cancel the press conference. Microsoft was going to supposedly going to announce an Xbox 360 with an embedded HD DVD player and never
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.040]   mind. No, that was never going to happen. You don't think that was going to happen? We call BS on that rumor. I always have. Yeah, I wonder. Do you see
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.380]   you don't think so? No, I've never thought so. They made they made great selling $179 HD DVD add on. There's Microsoft has
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:18.080]   absolutely no incentive to add an HD DVD player integrated into the 360. They want to drive cost down. They want to sell more
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.740]   units. That's just going to drive their cost up lower their profit, their margin per device, but they were
[00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.060]   a DVD can they work. This was a good Mac. Well, did you get a chance to Patrick to see Mac? Well, I've seen everything at
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.300]   Mac world. Yeah, what did you did? You like that Mac book air? What do you think of that? I'm actually I was one of the eight people owned a
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.340]   Macintosh duo back in the day. I have no problem with having an optical spindle. I hear one more person. I just have a
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.820]   user who plays about battery. You don't care about that. Well, the one hand, yeah, would be nice to have a user
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.660]   replaceable battery. It's lithium mine as a finite life, the finite life will end faster than you want it to. But Apple says
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.300]   $129 bucks. They'll fix it. Okay, I want to see what the prices like when people actually need to replace them in a
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.740]   year to two years. That's not on you know, it would cost about a hundred bucks to buy one. Absolutely. So a hundred 29 bucks,
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.460]   that includes the installation. That's not personally, I think I basically, you know, I'm assuming it's a it's a lithium
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.460]   polymer batteries, right? Get it take all that that acreage, can't the Z depth really fast. And it's just it's a nice
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.740]   looking machine. Yeah, I just hate to see something like that in your hands though. Because I just know you just like snap it
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.500]   like that. No, actually, are you gentle? I think I've actually had more notes book and saliva than you did. You
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:41.340]   so I have my OLPC if did you guys get your OLPC? Huh? Huh? The give one get one apparently there's some people who are a
[00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.140]   rye rate because they still haven't received their XO laptop. You know, those laptops for one child one laptop per
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.260]   child. You bought one? Yeah. Well, I donated. So I got one give one got one. But I got mine when I got you know, like a
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.540]   couple weeks ago. Oh, it's cute. I should show you have you seen it. It's really cute. No, I'd like to see it. I come by when
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.260]   you take me out to lunch at that restaurant. You can promise me.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.220]   Now what's happened is Robert seamlessly brought his audience over to fast company. So when he negotiated his deal
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.620]   a fast company, as I was saying, you know, each of those people's worth a dollar, I think, you know, per year. So he's got
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.020]   whatever, or maybe two or three, 7,000 people on Twitter, 5,000 people.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.020]   No, no, my stop just paid what a few more than a thousand. Let's get to that. That's the story. And that's the reason you
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.260]   saw. I couldn't think of anybody better to get on. I mean, you guys, this is a fascinating story and and and
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.700]   controversial Microsoft, essentially a hostile takeover bid 44.6 million in cash and stock for billion. Did I say
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:52.820]   beat with a B? Yes. For Yahoo. Now, of course, rumors have been flying for the last two years at Microsoft might take a
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.220]   stake in Yahoo. But this is an out and out attempt to buy the whole kitten kaboodle. Jason, you you're sitting on the
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.580]   sidelines. You probably know better than anybody. What's going on right now? What do you think?
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:10.060]   Well, there the piece of this, that's the most important is the advertising. And so if you look at the advertising
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.140]   space, search marketing, direct search inventory is the greatest advertising inventory on the planet right now. It's the
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.580]   most profitable and the most desirable. And we may have talked about this before, but the reason is pretty simple.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.460]   If you're typing, you know, Nokia N95, people listening to the show are typing that into Google right now, we know
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.060]   they're interested in the Nokia N95. That inventory is actually better than in gadgets inventories in some way, because if
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.900]   reading in gadget, you might be interested in the Nokia N95, but you might not be in the mode to buy it right at that
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:48.740]   point. And then, you know, the after that comes things like social networking advertising, which would be like, we
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:57.020]   know that you. Okay, so offline app, you know, so when when the Google appliance might per seat charge for my, you know, I
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.020]   mean, like, how many times have we watched how many times we watched desktop applications? Like the big thing, like now
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.420]   it's Google is doing, I think cloud computing is happening. You're saying it's that same old thing, thing, client. Yeah,
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.340]   yeah, you're calling it cloud computing, which is kind of like, you know, Web 2.0, we've we've got sophisticated
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.580]   forums. It's better. We have a new name for it. It's better. Yeah. So now it's now it's now
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.740]   it's not just, you know, it's not like server client computing. It's not it's it's not, you know, server hosted
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.460]   applications. Now it's cloud. But wait a minute, Patrick. What do you want? What do you use for your email, Patrick?
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.780]   I use Gmail cloud computing. No, more software as a service.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:45.500]   TML based email. It's software as a service. Look, instead of running a desktop email client, downloading your mail to your
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.420]   desktop and reading it there, you're doing it all in the net. That's the most of it. Not all the
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.660]   that's I could hop online in an application on my desktop. And I know a fair number of people who
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.460]   actually, you know, who actually I know a shocking number of people use Hotmail. Yeah, or you use
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.020]   Yahoo Hotmail and Yannell are 10 times bigger than Google Mail anyway. Wait, what Flickr's doing with
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.300]   photo editing online is a cloud. Same thing. That's, but that's cloud computing, the editing of the photo
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.740]   online. I submit the creating your your your download. I mean, it doesn't doesn't matter where you're doing it. It's
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:24.980]   still a big step for a company to go from, you know, 500, much less 5000 or 50,000 seats of a of
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:30.700]   a office application to, you know, an online application. So you don't think that Microsoft's looking at that at all. You think they're just
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.700]   looking at the online advertising and search. That's I think they're probably looking at advertising revenue in a way to
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:42.180]   amortize the investment into live and some of the other stuff. They're probably looking for eyeballs. They're probably looking for growth that's going to jerk the
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:55.700]   stock out of the, you know, relatively stable position it's been in because as John will probably back me up on the whole point of Microsoft stock was to make up for not paying people a lot of money. The ideas are going to go to work for Microsoft. You'd be a millionaire if you stayed there for 10 years.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:20.380]   This is in honor of DVD HD DVD, which kicked the bucket this week. Dead as a doornail. It was just it was kind of like a dominoes starts with Warner Brothers pulling the plug. Then Walmart pulls the plug. Then Netflix pulls the plug. I love this music. They can't hear it.
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:32.800]   Then Best Buy pulls the plug, and then the final death blow, Toshiba itself kills HD DVD.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.880]   Is it over?
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.240]   It's over now.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.940]   No, no, no.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.100]   Now, the analysis begins.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:46.460]   I have a column running at Tomorrow's PC magazine, where I assert that there was never sincere
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.460]   to begin with.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.940]   It's just all a scheme by Microsoft to screw over Sony any way it could to get market share
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.700]   for the Xbox.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.220]   And some have posited it because if there were a conflict between the two HD formats that
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.660]   downloads, HD downloads would prove preeminent.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.140]   And that's a first Microsoft, right?
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.620]   I think the days of Microsoft being able to orchestrate that level of conspiracy are
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.620]   along behind this.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.620]   People give Microsoft.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.620]   It's not a conspiracy.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.620]   It's a marketing...
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.660]   I mean, it's like saying they can't advertise.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.660]   It was just a marketing ploy.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.540]   I don't think it was much of a conspiracy because there was no real conspiracy.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   Who was it?
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.260]   Microsoft and Toshiba were those the two big players.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.340]   About any much.
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.340]   Pretty much.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.500]   Honestly, I think Microsoft is sad to say that kind of ineptile.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.020]   I mean, their last big marketing attempt was Vista capable.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.900]   So why did all these people pull the plug on HD DVD?
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.660]   Was there something wrong with it?
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.900]   It's a matter of money.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.460]   I mean, if Sony's willing to drop millions and millions of dollars on movie studios and
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.140]   Toshiba is only willing to drop half a million dollars or whatever the case may be or just
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.180]   a tad less than Sony, if I'm Warner Brothers, why would I want to go with the guy who's
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.180]   paying me less?
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.180]   I mean, it's pretty simple.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.980]   It's simply economics as far as I'm concerned.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.980]   I think the...
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.860]   Yeah, not the free market kind of need to live on this rogue kid, you know, rogue trader,
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.860]   you know?
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.580]   That's actually what Blackberry, what RIM is doing.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.300]   They're blaming the techies for the outage.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.740]   This is their second outage in a year.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.740]   This week, Blackberry is down all over North America.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.740]   What is it?
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.740]   What do you have?
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.660]   11 million subscribers, completely blacked out and they're saying, "Oh, it was the geek
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.660]   stit."
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.660]   Yeah, that's always good.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.620]   Throw your tech team under the bus.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.620]   The geek stit.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.100]   Yeah, because they don't have any recourse, right?
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.100]   They're powerless.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.100]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.300]   They have any good ideas about how to mess things up.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.060]   I wonder what happens with it.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.740]   I'm sorry, when the PR, the PR guy's credit rating goes to something ridiculous.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.980]   Yeah, or they're like going to be leaking emails from the CEO or like looking at the
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.900]   CEO's like log files on their browser and sending them anonymously to somebody.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.900]   I mean...
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.460]   I love all the salaries will be revealed.
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.620]   Service goes out, which it constantly does, and my phone has to reconnect to power vision,
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.580]   blah, blah, blah, and the whole thing locks up.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.980]   And then Merlin wanted to bring up the kind of interesting article about Ed Felton, who
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:13.740]   is a great security researcher and has done a lot on this, pointed out and observed that
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.740]   I didn't know this.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.380]   Ram doesn't lose its memory immediately, that even after you've powered down the system,
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.660]   the Ram, it retains the contents for some undetermined period of time.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.660]   He further...
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.780]   I'm sure I could just see the graduate students working on this one.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.780]   He further found out that if you freeze the Ram using compressed air or something like
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.940]   that, you actually have the time to take it out of the old.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.540]   The old system put it in a new system and read its contents.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.940]   And of course, if you've had an encrypted hard drive using TrueCrypt or PGP Disc, or
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:50.860]   a lot of different full disk encryption technologies, including Microsoft's BitLocker and FileVault,
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.380]   which is Apple's OS X encryption, that the keys are kept in Ram.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.220]   So if you can get the Ram, put it in a new computer, read the Ram, you'll get the key
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.060]   and you can unlock the drive.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:07.140]   In other words, this encryption stuff isn't going to be hackable.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.980]   But I have to point out, you also have to somehow get the laptop away from the guy after he
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.900]   logs in, but before he logs out, before it goes back to sleep, you have to take it over
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.580]   to your secret layer, spray it with a Freon, pull it out, put it in another laptop, read
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.300]   it, put it back in, give the guy the laptop back.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.940]   So it's not an easy hack.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.900]   The reason I thought it was complicated than it probably is, and the fact is, drive
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:36.300]   encryption techniques are there to prevent people from reading it if they have physical access
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.300]   to the machine.
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.820]   But it won't work unless you've logged in to the machine.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.700]   In other words, you have to unlock the drive before this technique will work.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.460]   The keys and I thought it was just on the machine.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.660]   No, well, the keys in Ram until you give it the password though, yes?
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.060]   No, the key is in Ram as soon as you turn on the machine.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.060]   Is that right?
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.060]   I didn't realize that.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.060]   That was what they stated in the X-Play video.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:06.620]   When the iPhone SDK is released, evidently Apple is going to turn this into a store for
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.620]   software.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.700]   So is this going to be the same thing all over again?
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:15.260]   We're going to find that out on Thursday, Apple's having a get together at its headquarters
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.500]   in Cupertino.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.660]   We don't know yet what they're going to do.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.060]   It's rumored that they'll require all applications to be sold to the iTunes store that they'll
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.060]   control it.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:30.460]   Steve did say how much he liked the Nokia S60 verification process.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.500]   It kind of indicates he might be kind of going down that path.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.420]   I just saw a rumor today that said, "Well, free applications will be available widely.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.220]   It's just if you want to charge for it."
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.820]   Generally speaking, people who just get on Twitter and they lab about the fact that they're
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.860]   at a stoplight or they want to show out the fact they got a new cell phone that's got
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.100]   a keyboard and they talk about it or they say stupid things and are just like, "Oh,
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.340]   I watched the movie last night.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.340]   It sucked."
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:01.140]   And things like that to me is just a bunch of hot air that is not necessary, that shouldn't
[00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.460]   even be in the cloud.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.540]   But there are a lot of other actual practical uses that people are developing for some of
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.860]   these systems that are actually quite fascinating, whether they're shooting a million photographs
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.580]   and having them distributed over pounds.
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.380]   There's one of them, I'm not sure, but I could see where it could come in handy in the case
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.740]   of an emergency or if you had an emergency crew or there was a police department that
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.180]   wanted to, you know, had a bunch of guys with little cameras and you could coordinate this
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.180]   information.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.180]   It was used as information.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.220]   Yeah, I'm not going to, I mean, I think just part of it's both and part of it's really
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.220]   pretty cool.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:39.420]   But I mean, part of it is surely like, for me, what I find, I think, slightly not annoying
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:45.660]   but curious is that there are so many degrees of doing almost the same thing in a slightly
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.660]   different way.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.380]   Going from everything from like, you've got a blog, which is kind of more like the whole
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.900]   payload thing, it's more long-form, then you've got like a ton blog, which is kind of like
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.460]   shorter, but it seems to be more like a pound stream.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.660]   But the pound stream has got a little bit of like calendar on there as well.
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.900]   And then from the pound stream, you can sort of go on to like Twitter, which is kind of
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.220]   mostly just text anyway.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.660]   But then from Twitter, you've got text messages.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.260]   It seems like there's these, you know, and then at the other end as well, you've got Facebook,
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.820]   which is basically the same friends feed and with all the applications that you've got,
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.060]   you've got adding your photos and all that kind of things.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.580]   It seems like 10 different ways to do basically the same thing.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.900]   I don't think they are though.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.900]   There we go.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.140]   Will Harris, you got your video going.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.660]   Oh, sick.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.900]   I love, I love British people.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.300]   Oh, sick.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.780]   Ah, let me read.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.620]   I'm going to read some of your Twitter posts as this thing developed.
[00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.900]   So you started, I'm not at the Zuckerberg speech.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.780]   I'm leaving Hilton now will solder over there to find out if he said anything interesting.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.980]   Then you say he's giving a lot of PR answers.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.060]   Lacey's asking too many business questions.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.140]   Twitter and Hey, Lacey Sarah Lacey lost control of the interview.
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.780]   Twitter's going crazy with critiques.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.220]   She's getting defensive now.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.780]   Poor empathy for the audience.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.860]   The audience is asking better questions.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.900]   I've never seen such a bad interview of anyone on the stage here.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.900]   Totally disappointing.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.900]   I mean, it's just it's she mad at you.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.540]   Well, she said, yeah, on her Twitter, she actually Twitter toward me and I just put
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.540]   it in apology.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.260]   Is she blaming you for what happened?
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.380]   I think she's very defensive.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.380]   She doesn't.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.460]   I don't think she understood what was going on on stage.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.340]   I think she just didn't understand what the audience was expecting.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.540]   You said it was even worse in the overflow room.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.540]   What were people saying?
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.020]   Well, people were saying exactly that.
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.540]   Where's the hard question?
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.580]   Where's the, why are you asking about billion, you know, being a billionaire or why are you
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:44.660]   asking such softball questions and not forcing in the answer the PR speak that, you know,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.260]   Mark is it possible?
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.020]   Is it possible that's why she was interviewing him because I knew her.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.620]   I don't think so.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.620]   I don't.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.180]   The reason she was interviewing him is because I have the inside line on this, by the way.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.180]   All right.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.180]   Jason Calicanis, what's her story?
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.180]   Okay.
[00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.620]   She wrote a book about like Kevin Rose and Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.380]   And I had dinner with her in France and a bunch of people.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.460]   And she is really into Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.940]   I mean, she calls him like, Zuck.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.180]   And she was like dropping his name, like, Oh, it's not this and suck that.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.540]   I'm going to throw up in my mouth.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.540]   Excuse me.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.060]   I would just, I know it, but I think she really likes the guy.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   She's married.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.060]   She's got her husband.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.060]   I had dinner with her husband.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.060]   It's very cool.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   I don't think it's that kind of thing.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.620]   But as a journalist, I've watched her operate.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.900]   She flirts with people to get information.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.380]   It's how she does what she does.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.060]   And she was in front about that.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.860]   You were taught by Southwest audience would hate that.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.780]   Oh, of course.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.100]   So you have, and then she, I don't think that she's a particularly good interviewer because
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.900]   I saw her do another interview.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.660]   And so being, you know, what makes for a good journalist and print versus what makes for
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.060]   a good host on a show like Twitter or whatever, it's two very different things.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.980]   And on stage and being able to ask hard questions and shut up and let the person answer very,
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.980]   very different skill set.
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.140]   I don't think she has that skill set.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.540]   And she's developed a personal relationship with him, which is really annoying if you're
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.100]   in the audience because nobody knows what you're talking about.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.980]   And if you're a fan boy, then it's even worse.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.340]   I just want to quote in the winter.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:12.740]   Blu-ray encryption cracked once again by those clever guys out of Trinidad.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:13.740]   I'm sorry, Antigua.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   Okay, do the voice.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.220]   Do give us a Trinidad voice.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:21.660]   We have, we have, we have, we have no unprotected B.D. plus.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.660]   Now, okay, never mind.
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.660]   I can do it.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.660]   I'm working on it.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.660]   I'm working on it.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.660]   Redoing it.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.660]   Come on.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.660]   We have unprotected everybody.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.660]   I get Blu-ray.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.660]   So thank you.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.980]   I just have to get the steel drums in my hand and I can do it.
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:44.260]   So apparently, B.D. plus is the, was a very sophisticated scheme and very difficult to
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.940]   crack unlike AACS, which was on HD DVD.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.460]   These guys at Slysoft are very good.
[00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:57.300]   They make a program which will copy Blu-ray discs and they sell it out of Antigua.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.300]   So unexpected.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.300]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.180]   Yeah, that somebody cracked the DRA.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.180]   Oh my God.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.180]   Astonishing.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.180]   Wow.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.620]   They said, admittedly, we're not really so, actually, I don't think they're English is
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.820]   their native language.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.620]   His name is Pier Van Heen.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.900]   Immediately, we're not really so fast with this because actually we had intended to publish
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.220]   this release already in December as promised.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.340]   However, I don't know what an accident is.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.340]   That's a made up.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.780]   It's a combination Dutch German who knows.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.780]   We don't know.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.620]   I'm from an unnamed country in Litchenstein.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.540]   However, he decided for strategic, now it's now his Russian, strategic reasons to wait
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:38.100]   a bit for the outcome of the format war between HD DVD and Blu-ray.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.300]   And then they say, you know, we fully expect them to change it again.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.620]   But he says, we think we can crack it again.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.620]   Well, you know, I'm on their website now and they don't have it on there for sale yet.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.780]   They still have any DVD and they do.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.700]   Yeah, if you get to get to any DVD.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.700]   Oh, here it is.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.700]   I see it.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.700]   HD DVD and Blu-ray.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.020]   The latest version has got to support for amazing.
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.340]   Bd plus copy protection.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.340]   It's amazing.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.140]   I mean, Bd plus was supposed to be Sony's.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.380]   You know, that was one of the pictures.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.740]   Kind of expensive, isn't this kind of expensive?
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   It's $100.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.580]   Yeah, but it works.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.580]   Two Blu-ray.
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.460]   That's like five pounds over here.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.460]   It's only expensive.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.460]   Five pounds.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.460]   It's like 49 euros.
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.860]   I don't know if I guess it's 75 bucks, but it's a...
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.460]   I think that's about 300 US.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.660]   Yeah, and more all the time.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.220]   So, no, but I think that, I mean, of course, it's crazy to want to pirate Blu-ray discs.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.060]   I mean, the blanks themselves cost more than the movie.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.060]   You don't do this.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.540]   Yeah, because you're just ripping it to build a media store.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.540]   That's what you're doing.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.780]   If you're buying some stories, you just want like 720p copies of what you do.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.780]   Does it?
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.780]   You're like psychotic.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.420]   You're just like, I mean, if you're taking, it takes like five hours to copy one of these
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.420]   discs, I think.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.940]   Like, it's for, it takes forever.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.340]   And they're 25 bucks to buy.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.340]   You're basically...
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.340]   Or 19.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.980]   I think they're piracy proof.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.980]   I mean, you're giving nuts to do this.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.060]   What's it called when you're addicted to committing crimes?
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.060]   A kleptomaniac?
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.060]   Have they had kleptom?
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.700]   People that collect things.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   A baron von Munchausen?
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.140]   Maybe someone who's addicted to actually literally taking stuff, picking it up and stealing it.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.860]   Alright, so same thing.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.780]   Criminal addiction is basically, that's what you're basically talking about here.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.980]   I mean, if you're going to take 18 hours to figure out how to do this, you're basically
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.180]   just doing it for the sake of doing it.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.460]   Yeah, and you say, I always felt that...
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.180]   I always felt most pirates were that way.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.180]   They collect stuff.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.180]   They're collectors.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.180]   They're junk collectors.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.180]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.180]   They have copies of all kinds of weird crap.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.180]   They never use it.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.180]   They wouldn't have bought it in the first place.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.940]   I don't count them as against the bottom line.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.900]   Or we'd lost so much money because of piracy.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.900]   They would have never bought it.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.900]   They would never have bought it.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.860]   And these guys are like, I have all 20 seasons of The Simpsons.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.860]   I ripped them myself.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.340]   No, I remember very well in the early days of the Mac.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.860]   I remember a friend of mine, I won't say his name, but he'd opened his closet door.
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.660]   And literally, the closet is stacked from six feet tall with floppy discs.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.300]   He says, you know, I have every Mac program ever made in there.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.940]   You're exactly right.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.620]   It's packrat mentality.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.780]   His name was Steve Wozniak.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.580]   His name was Steve Wozniak.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.780]   I mean, amazing story.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.780]   You know, Woz himself.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.780]   I mean, I don't think Woz ever got off being that.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.860]   Is there a lot of negative to it?
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.860]   Is it neutral?
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.100]   Mark, do you feel like...
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.820]   Are you an optimist?
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.420]   Yeah, I think I am.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:22.500]   I get, you know, it's just increased my sources of information.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:29.100]   And I do think that there will always be an opportunity for good journalists to get paid
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   somehow.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.340]   There will probably be some rough periods.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:40.060]   But you know, with a combination of my using Google search words with RSS and RSSing a
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:46.500]   lot of different blogs and then reading print paper, people have a tremendous amount of
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.220]   variety and control over the news that they get.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:55.860]   And I think there's, you know, there's always going to be a way to make money from that.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.100]   And therefore there will always be a way for good journalists to get paid.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.340]   So in the long run, I am not worried at all.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.940]   In my short term, I think it'll be weird for a while.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.180]   It's going to be weird.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.580]   I know Corey says that too.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.620]   He quotes the other sturgeon and said 90% of everything is crap.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.740]   But that means 10% of everything is great.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.460]   And if you have more everything, then you're going to have more great stuff.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.460]   Sure.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.740]   And honestly, people like some of that crap.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.780]   I'm already making it into a T-shirt.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.020]   I figure 25 hours a Leo is just not enough.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.500]   25 hours of Leo is never enough.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   A week.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.500]   What am I nuts?
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.940]   So I'm going to, so you know what we'll do is we'll stream everything and everything
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.260]   I'm doing all the podcasts, the radio show show.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.860]   I can get ran off on.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.380]   I want to pray here on.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.380]   What do you mean?
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.380]   Prager is listening and he's not on.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   I know.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.260]   He said that he fired up Skype, but he's like, I don't know why he's not getting it.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.260]   I don't understand that.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.260]   This is our third anniversary episode.
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.260]   I told him that.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.500]   If we don't have Prager on, we don't have the third anniversary episode.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.740]   I don't understand that at all.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.100]   Prager, get an airport.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.340]   You still do that, don't you?
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.340]   Prager.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.340]   Prager.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.340]   Hello.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.340]   Hey, answered.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.340]   It worked.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.340]   It still works.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.340]   Nice.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.020]   You go running with Kevin Rose.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.740]   You and Kevin Rose go out and jog.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.740]   You know what?
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.580]   I need to get some more cardio.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.580]   I hadn't been jogging.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.380]   Kevin said he wanted to go.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.380]   He wanted to play racquetball.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.380]   I said, I'm going to go running.
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.380]   He's like, I'll go with you.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.380]   Back at ball.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.780]   You know, in the 60s, the 70s, when did that game die?
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.780]   It's huge.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:32.780]   Never die to get it on back.
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.700]   I haven't learned squash yet.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.700]   I want to learn squash.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.700]   That looks fun.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.900]   You guys are so, so changed from when I knew you and really all you wanted to do was go
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.980]   out and smoke doobies out back.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.300]   Now you're like exercising.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.300]   Next time we have Kevin Rose on, it's going to be talking about being on the polo team.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.540]   Guys, it's time for Bloody Mary's.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:59.820]   Now, Poland never got big with the whole 80s Wall Street, Green O'Felkra.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.060]   Every sport you guys are listing is a very kind of like tenish anyone.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.500]   You guys are talking about tenish.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   We would like to.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.180]   Well, David, I'm so glad we get you on because you're one of the original tweets.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.300]   You were on Twitch zero and probably the first 20 or 30 tweets.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.780]   Now let's plug it back.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.060]   It's been a long time.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   It has.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.300]   This is the third word.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:26.200]   So Microsoft Friday raises its offer $33 a share, $44.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.420]   something billion for Yahoo.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.060]   Yahoo's response.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:35.820]   No, we're worth $37 a share.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.020]   So today, Steve Balmer sends a note to the troops saying we're walking away.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.900]   That's it.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.300]   The Microsoft Yahoo merger over.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   Or is it?
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   What is it?
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   Is what it what or is that's the end?
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   That's it.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.300]   It's story over.
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   Right.
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.900]   But if you were Steve former and you actually wanted a hostile takeover of Yahoo, what would
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:57.900]   you do?
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.300]   You'd walk away from the deal.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.620]   You'd watch the share price tank and then you'd come back in a week later when you pick
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.420]   it up to 25 bucks a share.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.420]   Interesting.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.340]   Yeah, I've seen I've seen a lot of that speculation.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:15.180]   I just feel like Balmer, if anything, you mentioned before the show that you thought
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.180]   he had, you know, big ones, but I felt like when they go and got tough, Microsoft didn't
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.180]   know what to do.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:24.020]   I mean, I honestly read this whole situation as Microsoft thinking that when they went
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.300]   in with their offer for Yahoo that they would be greeted as liberators and that as soon as
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.020]   Yahoo started putting up some resistance, Microsoft sort of panicked and you know, where
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.460]   they were like, well, we really don't want to go hostile because we don't know we're
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.020]   not prepared for that at all.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.900]   Well, I don't think they did want to go.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.220]   I don't think they did want to go hostile hostile because then you piss off engineers
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.140]   and executives and you don't want a company that doesn't want to be part of you, right?
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.100]   What Jason, you said you, what do you think?
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.300]   Well, I was absolutely convinced it was going to happen.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:27:00.420]   And I think the one thing that a lot of people didn't anticipate was that Yahoo's leadership
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:07.260]   specifically Jerry Yang would basically do so many poison pills, basically was so adamant
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.060]   that they not be sold.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:15.060]   So he basically put it at a price that I think Microsoft, it made your scorched earth threatening
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.300]   to do the Google deal threatening to go open search and let anybody have the search results.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:25.740]   I mean, all these things they were doing were basically to decrease the value of the asset.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.700]   So Microsoft wouldn't want to buy it.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.180]   Now they've succeeded.
[00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.980]   It's going to be a total bloodbath this week on the stock price.
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.580]   I mean, it's going to go crashing back down and there's going to be a lot of shareholders
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.580]   who are like, what happened?
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:46.660]   We would have liked the $33 and if Google shares stay at 20 or 22 for another two or
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.260]   three years, which is completely possible or they could go down, there's going to be
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.780]   a lot of upset hedge fund, you know, lawsuits, institutional.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.540]   Oh, there's going to be a ton, of course.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.540]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.420]   Just a total mess.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:06.700]   I basically made a list of people and if who won in this, you know, Google's big winner.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.700]   Google's a big winner.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.700]   This is what Google wanted.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.460]   This is why Google kept throwing little bones to Yahoo saying, come on, you can, you're
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.460]   with boy that.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.460]   Come on.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.460]   I mean, you can just see Google behind the scenes.
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.460]   You're with.
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.460]   You're going to take that from that guy.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.460]   You can listen to that moment.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.380]   Huge winner.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.620]   The VCs and the startup companies, huge winners.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.380]   It's better to have three buyers out for buyers out, you know, better to have three
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.380]   than two, right?
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.380]   In the search business.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.380]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.660]   Much better for VCs and for startup companies.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.220]   For the Yahoo shareholders, they're major losers because they could have gotten 50% premium
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.220]   or more.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.940]   It was actually like a 70% premium.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.980]   We're going to continue with our look at the best of and worst of 2008 and just a little
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   bit.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.820]   But you know, one company that's been with us the whole year.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.260]   Oh, I want to mention audible.com.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.260]   It's a great folks in audible.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.260]   Audible.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.260]   Audible.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.260]   Jason, you think this is.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.260]   Audible.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.260]   I love audible.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:09.300]   You think Jason that I will be more likely to invite you on Twitter if you do this or
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.820]   is this really how you feel?
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.740]   I have always loved audible.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.740]   Everybody knows that.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.460]   I'm a big fan of audible for a decade, in fact.
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.460]   And I love audiobooks.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:20.860]   I live in Los Angeles.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.220]   You said, if I, I think you were doing a stream and you said, and I didn't get there
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.380]   in time, that you would do an audible ad on the stream if I just logged in.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.580]   Yeah, anytime you just give me a phone number to call.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.260]   I'll leave it on your, I'll leave an audible ad on your voice.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.180]   He will call each and every one of you personally.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.660]   We really couldn't do Twitch without audible.com.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.420]   We thank them so much.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.540]   And even more importantly, perhaps we thank all of you who've become audible members this
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.580]   year.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.980]   Because of you, audible loves us and they, and they love you.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.660]   They're really happy to be a part of the Twitch family.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.340]   If you're not yet a member of audible.com, you really have something wonderful to discover
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.500]   ahead of you.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.500]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.740]   It's a place where you can get online.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:11.100]   You can get audio books, 51,000 audio books, just about every title ever recorded.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.500]   Plus, radio shows, podcast comedy clubs, speeches.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.180]   I mean, just a lot of audio content of all kinds.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.860]   It is, it is a treasure trove.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.860]   You're going to find so much there to listen to.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:24.860]   I encourage you to give audible a try.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.540]   We have several different ways you can join audible.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:35.100]   This year, this month, this week, I guess, we're trying a special one called audible 749,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.780]   if that's especially URL.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.860]   It's audible.com/twit749.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.860]   And here's the deal.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.060]   Normally, we tell you you can get one book free.
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.540]   This way, you get three books for half price, which if I've done my math right is the equivalent
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.060]   of one and a half books free.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:54.900]   Three months, three books, $7.49 each.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.860]   And that is a great deal.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.260]   Go to audible.com/twit749.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.740]   Give audible a try.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.700]   If you go to willhallmusic.com, you'll see we have several hundred now, more than that
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.860]   probably.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.940]   Audible picks online.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.860]   Some great books, the twits have supported through the years.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.020]   We're just really happy to be part of the Audible family.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.020]   Thank you so much, Audible.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.820]   In fact, Audible is so happy to have you.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.500]   If you've got another special deal, you don't have to be an Audible subscriber to take advantage
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.620]   of this.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.620]   It's absolutely free.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.980]   You will not have to give them a credit card.
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.980]   It'll give you a chance to kind of hear what it's like to listen to audiobooks.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.060]   If you like podcasts, you're going to love audiobooks.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:45.060]   The special URL for this giveaway, good through the end of the year, December 31st, is audible.com/twit33.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.140]   Audibles acquire the entire library of 33 and a third books.
[00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:56.100]   These are amazing books, one book per album, classic album, from all different genres.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.220]   The one we're going to give away this week is Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited.
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.980]   If you love that album, I know I do.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.420]   You'd like to know how it was made.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.140]   No more about the tracks.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.700]   No the inside story.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.140]   It's about four and a half hours.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.060]   These are incredible books.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:16.500]   A great gift, by the way, for somebody who loves the album, given the album and the book.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.940]   I'm giving my son both to introduce him to the great music of Bob Dylan.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.580]   It's absolutely free.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.580]   No credit card required.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.660]   Now, it's available in the US for sure.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.500]   Some countries, other countries, yes.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.580]   I apologize if it's not available in your country.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.220]   It's due to, frankly, publisher restrictions.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:35.060]   But give it a try.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.300]   If you're in the US, this is for sure going to work.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.300]   Audible.com/twit33.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.460]   Don't forget Audible.com/twit749.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:49.380]   For the three books for 749 each offer.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.380]   Thank you Audible.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   Thanks to all of you.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.820]   Now back to the best and the worst of 2008.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.260]   To give a try, you're going to love it Audible.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.260]   Audible.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.260]   It's awesome.
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.260]   Audible.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.260]   It's awesome.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.260]   I have a jingle.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.340]   Did you know that I have an Audible?
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.540]   Have I ever played this for you?
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.540]   No.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   There's an Audible jingle.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.180]   I think Jeff Smith recorded this for me here.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.780]   Let's just listen to this.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.980]   ♪ On your way to work, on your way to school ♪
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.420]   ♪ When you can't read a book, don't be fooled ♪

[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.660]   ♪
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.900]   Actually, that's Paul Minchal gets a credit for that.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.900]   Paul is great.
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   All right.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:42.300]   More importantly, Houston is being overrun by ants that are eating electronics.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.780]   Can you fill us in on this, Dwight?
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.020]   This sounds like a terrible, terrible problem.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.740]   Well, it's these little tiny ants.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.060]   They're called Raspberry Crazy Ants.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.060]   Oh.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.060]   Oh.
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.220]   They're named for the guy who discovered them in the US.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:02.100]   Apparently, they came over on a cargo ship into the port of Houston and they started showing
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.460]   up on the southeast side of town.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:10.140]   Although I've seen them, I saw them several years ago, I used to live up by the compact
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.620]   campus on the northwest side of town, the old compact campus, and I saw them there.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:19.340]   But they don't move in like the straight little lines that you see ants move.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.900]   They move kind of haphazardly almost randomly.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.900]   They're crazy.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.900]   They're crazy.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.380]   They're crazy.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.900]   And they can cover more ground this way and find food quicker is the theory.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:36.220]   They also are very attracted to electrical current as are a lot of ants.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.620]   In fact, fire ants in the same way.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.300]   I don't know if there are fire ants where any of you guys live.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.700]   They're a real problem down here in the southwest.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.260]   Fire ants suck.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.340]   They're awful.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:51.900]   And you'll see sometimes, and like you'll see the green underground electrical transformers
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.820]   around here, you'll see a lot of times a fire ant mound piled up against it.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.660]   So ants are used to that.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.580]   Or they all answer interested in electrical current.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.580]   But here they've been getting into people's computers if they get in the home and essentially
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.580]   gum them up.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.980]   They'll get into the fans.
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:13.220]   They'll get thick enough in there that they can cause heat problems.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.540]   That's disgusting.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.540]   It is disgusting.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:22.540]   We had in a townhouse I was living in in San Antonio years ago, we had fire ants get
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:28.460]   into an outdoor air conditioning compressor and gum up them.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:35.420]   Sorry, I was envisioning fire ants being shot through your AC at high.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:41.700]   This is worse when the repairman came to take the compressor apart.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.740]   He pulled the motor out and it was sticky.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.740]   So this is, this is, it's combo cast cares.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.220]   I don't know what the, for some reason I'm getting a lot of Tokyo Metro sounds in here.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.220]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.780]   Hello, Frank, are you there?
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.780]   What did you do?
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.300]   Put Seagull poop in my food at the ramp.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.300]   What did you do?
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.780]   All of a sudden I start getting all these emails.
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.260]   There's all these message board posts about some awful incident that happened at the
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.780]   ramp which caused you to never speak with me again.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.180]   I put a restraining order on you.
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.540]   I didn't know what was going on.
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.540]   It was a joke.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.540]   I took it really personally.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:21.060]   I thought that you and I were always BFFs.
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.060]   Absolutely BS.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.060]   And now we are again.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.740]   I'm really looking forward to our cottage that we're going to share up in Mendocino next
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.460]   week and I'm glad that we're back together.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.980]   Twin beds are double.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:37.020]   I could, actually what I could do if I had four T1s or four DSLs.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:41.380]   I could have four computers, one attached to each and then each computer could have
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.500]   its own Skype and then I could do it.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:49.180]   And you just four T1 lines, three craze and a small sack of MIT graduates.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.180]   Right.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:56.580]   And it turns out a guy in our forums noticed it and put a forum message up and said, "Guys,
[00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:59.540]   did you know that your tracker is open now?"
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.260]   And my CTO was on vacation for two weeks in Italy.
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.540]   When was that that he said that?
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:10.460]   It was sometime like sort of like two weeks ago or a week and a half ago.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.460]   Okay.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.900]   No, no, we opened it up the first week of April and it was probably sometime in mid-May or
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.900]   or.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.820]   And so the minute that my CTO got back, like the next day, which was the Saturday of Memorial
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.860]   Day weekend, he, we put the whitelist back in effect.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:32.060]   Right after we put that whitelist in, we started getting the sin flood and we thought
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:38.100]   it was a bunch of, you know, rogue, poor at folks from some shadowy Eastern European countries
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.620]   that were like, you know, some sort of best at us.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.340]   Turns out, no, it was this legit business media defender that, and I think they just
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:49.020]   couldn't conceive of the fact that somebody would use BitTorrent for legitimate reasons.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.820]   And the minute that we shut ourselves down to them, as far as I tell, it appears they
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.100]   just flooded us with Simpack without an optical spindle.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.860]   Did you see that guy who cut his meat with the air?
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:00.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.940]   It was a cake too, so it caked.
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.940]   Meat.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.940]   Meat would be tough.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.420]   Do not use your air to cut meats.
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.340]   In Japan, the MacBook can be used like a knife.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.100]   This brisket is so tender, I can cut it with a MacBook Air.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.700]   I have to say, you think makes Android stand out?
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.820]   Well, the thing that was interesting was that they have gestures, you know, like the
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.860]   ones that we have gotten used to, you know, pinch, et cetera, that are slightly different.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.340]   And they're, you know, they're not the same, but they also seem to work.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:34.300]   In other words, it opens up the idea to developers and users that these tools don't necessarily
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:40.580]   have to have a one common interface that's honed and copyrighted by one vendor.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.140]   And I think that's a pretty powerful, I mean, first of all, it means that every other phone
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:51.660]   manufacturer and play, like starting with Nokia, they've got a big problem because all
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.580]   of a sudden Google is in second place.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.580]   Interesting.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.420]   You know, leaping, leapfrogging ahead of everybody else.
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.620]   I mean, you know, I saw an ad for--
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:05.900]   Is it really Google or is it whoever, whatever handset makes your maker makes an Android
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.900]   handset?
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.740]   I mean, Google's not saying we want to be in this business exactly.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:15.380]   Well, you know, it's very similar to the old Microsoft play with Windows Mobile and,
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.580]   you know, they--except that it seems to have a slightly different kind of feel to it.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.020]   Isn't it more--is it an open source?
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.020]   I mean--
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.020]   Yeah, of course.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.980]   But I mean, let's not go crazy about that.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.980]   It's tied to--you have to use Java in order to write it.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.980]   Ew.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.980]   Ew.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.980]   That's not happy.
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.980]   Well--
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.980]   That's not--
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:34.980]   Things are kind of turning up.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.980]   Now, John, you said that we're going to have a depression by 2010.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.980]   Is that still on?
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:38.980]   And no change.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.780]   Well, that's the beginning of the depression.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.940]   The depression actually is a long-term thing.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.500]   And it hits rock bottom in 2013.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.460]   Now, Andrew, you're actually an investment advisor.
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.180]   Do you agree with us?
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.500]   You know, I think that--it's interesting because John and I have talked about this
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.660]   many times.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:00.460]   And I question always if, in fact, all the stars are aligning and everything looks like
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:05.620]   2009, 2010, or give them a few days or so here and there, that everything is going
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.420]   to just fall apart.
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:10.980]   Wouldn't we kind of be smart enough to get out in advance?
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.340]   And then the question is, isn't that what maybe is happening right now?
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:20.060]   Are we kind of going through the process of lightening up on stocks and various other
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.060]   investments?
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.940]   And I mentioned this to Andrew.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.860]   Jason Calicanis on.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.100]   Mike Harrington kind of broke this and tanked the Yahoo's stock earlier this week when he
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.300]   said Yahoo and Google are about to do an ad deal.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.780]   In fact, Harrington even implied there might be a search deal involved.
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:42.500]   Reuters picked the story up and Yahoo stock.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.740]   And I don't even know if it's come back yet, but it turned out somewhat was true that, in
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.300]   fact, Yahoo and Google did do a deal.
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.860]   I guess somewhat similar, Andrew, to the deal that they had the trial that they had
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:53.660]   done a few weeks earlier.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:55.300]   It looks like an AdSense deal.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.820]   I mean, it's so lame.
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.020]   Using Google ads on Yahoo search results.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.020]   Right.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.180]   I mean, isn't that AdSense?
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.860]   Yahoo's buying AdSense.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.860]   They're buying.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   They're using AdSense.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   We've lined up with a publisher.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.660]   Get rid of the blocker in the world.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.420]   Isn't that kind of a mission that it's not going so well?
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.780]   I'm thinking, it's not good.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.740]   They're going to put on a few of their blogs.
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.500]   You know, they'll get a couple of the plugins.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.100]   But you know, it's interesting to me.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.300]   There's why you're wrong connection.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.620]   The whole thing is a Macguff and it's all set up by the big ISPs.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.580]   They don't pay anything for bandwidth.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.660]   Banwidth is essentially free right now.
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.660]   It's very cheap.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:37.980]   At some point, every one of these guys still have to pay for a loop through May East and
[00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.020]   May West and that costs money.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.860]   Well, but most of their bandwidth is peering relationships.
[00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   That's true.
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.860]   They're not paying attention.
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.660]   But there's an overhead involved here with all those servers and all the connections and
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.260]   all the wires, you don't think that counts for something?
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.460]   Yeah, and then they're getting more than enough already.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:59.100]   Well, that's like saying, well, why should we be paying for water?
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.100]   It rains every year.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.100]   It comes in.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.100]   It's much more scarce research.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.100]   It was resource.
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:04.100]   It comes in.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:05.100]   No, it's not scarce around here.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.860]   It's in the Bay Area or in some other areas.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.860]   There's not scarce at all.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.260]   There's a lot of places where there's plenty of water, especially in the Northern States.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.740]   And why are we paying it all then?
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:16.260]   Because it comes, it rains into the pool and it goes into a pipe and we get it.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.260]   Why should we be paying?
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:19.860]   We should just have a flat fee of five bucks and that'll be the end of it.
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:20.860]   It's the same argument.
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.100]   My argument is you should pay what something's worth.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.860]   I think that in fact, you're right.
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.300]   Water is worth a lot more than bits.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.980]   Bits are virtually free.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:33.340]   These guys are just using this just as they did net neutrality as a way to extort money
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.340]   out of people.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.340]   It's pure and simple.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.060]   It doesn't, there's all this dark fiber under the country.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.660]   This stuff is cheap and getting cheaper.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.780]   They're acting like it's getting to be more scarce.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.620]   They're acting like it's oil, like it's water.
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:46.180]   It's not.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.980]   I'm not taking the sight of the lies.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.980]   I'm just saying it would make more sense.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   But it's based on lies.
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:53.940]   I would, no, it's not.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.460]   I don't have one of my eight arguments.
[00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.260]   There's not one lie in there.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.460]   I don't talk about the shortage.
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:03.460]   No, but it's ridiculous to say, oh well, what we should do is charge people through
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.340]   the nose and then that way spammers will have to shut down because where do I say charge
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.340]   through the nose?
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.300]   Well, because you're saying if you're me, you're selling that.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:14.020]   I'm saying that it should cost you less than you're paying now and those guys who are
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.420]   hogging all the bandwidth should be paying more.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.420]   They should be paying.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.420]   I will.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.900]   There's an essential element of fairness that people who are hogs should pay more than people
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.900]   who use a dribble at a time.
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.620]   And that's fine if you want to have tiered based on speed because the dribble at a time,
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.740]   people don't need the speed and I'll pay more for speed, which I'm doing right now.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:37.580]   But I don't think it makes sense to charge people for the bite because the bite costs
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580]   nothing.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:43.940]   I don't like the idea of having this tiered speed either because it slows down the implementation
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.940]   of IPTV, which is crucial to the growth of this country's telecommunication.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.940]   Well, you're playing with it too.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:52.300]   No, but to meter it with two because nobody's going to download IPTV.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   Exactly.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   If it's going to cost them tons of money per day.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.420]   Why do you guys assume it's going to cost tons of money?
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.580]   Just because somebody says you're going to miss the end.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.540]   Because they want this is all about making tons of money.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.020]   We'll be on something, John.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:09.380]   If I watch more TV than you do and I have every single iPhone real quickly on Monday,
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.900]   Steve Jobs takes the stage and houses what we all knew would happen.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.700]   A three G iPhone came out.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.340]   It pretty much had all the features we expected GPS.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.180]   What we didn't expect is a very low price.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.420]   $200.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:27.060]   That's because according to ours, Technica, AT&T has rewritten its deal with Apple.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.020]   No longer gives them any portion of the monthly fee.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.340]   So it can subsidize the phone price down to 200 bucks for the eight gigs, 300 bucks for
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.020]   the 16 gigs.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:40.180]   The GPS, you know, once you once you hear all the good things, you know, much, much better
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.540]   battery life, lower price GPS, 3G, then come the yes spots.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:51.500]   For instance, yes, but 3G, HSDP is only available in a very limited area for AT&T.
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.460]   Many people won't be able to get it.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.060]   I won't be able to get it up here.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.700]   Yes, but 200 bucks, but you have to pay more money for the data plan.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:04.940]   Now, 30 bucks for the high speed and you get zero SMS messages, which is a major scam
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:12.180]   since SMS is just data now and they're charging you like 10 cents for 140 bytes of data.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.180]   That's ridiculous.
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:19.060]   They also, you know, the GPS, Tom Tom, you know, jumped and said, great, there's GPS.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:24.020]   We're going to write turn by turn direction program for the iPhone only to be held back
[00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:28.940]   by the sudden realization that Apple's new iPhone SDK agreement says you may not write
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:34.260]   under any circumstances, any turn by turn applications for the iPhone.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:39.660]   So as usual, the reality distortion field set by Steve Jobs is kind of a little bit taken
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:44.140]   on by the actual facts, but it takes a day or two for the press to realize that.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.540]   John, you're taking the 3G iPhone.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.540]   Do you care?
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.500]   I thought your summary right there was better than half the reviews I've read of the iPhone,
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.060]   especially the ones in the press as you stated.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.860]   Yeah, it was a lot of yes butts.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.940]   Yeah, no, I was outstanding.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:45:59.940]   Okay.
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.660]   And I think you're dead on every one of those points.
[00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.900]   And, you know, I think the iPhone is becoming a big deal or a bigger deal than it was.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.820]   And it's kind of, you know, eventually they're going to work it out so people are a little
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.020]   more cut loose a little more.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.460]   But I think it is heading toward becoming a platform in it and of itself.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.220]   Well, that's what's exciting about it.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:19.700]   It may not be, you know, it's still not there.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.780]   No cut and paste.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.340]   You know, third party application is limited.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:27.100]   Yeah, you can get super monkey ball, but you can't get GPS.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.300]   But I think as you say, it's kind of a groundbreaker.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.860]   It's what everybody's trying to copy.
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:36.300]   Samsung's new instinct, which looks to be the closest thing, now has visual voicemail,
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.660]   has actual turn by turn directions on it.
[00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.220]   That's coming out soon.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.220]   I think you'll see other companies.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.660]   And what they're doing is they're saying, well, people want this.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.620]   We're going to make it something somewhat like that.
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.620]   Will Harris, your iPhone, junkie, were you excited about the announcement?
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:55.460]   Well, yeah, I'm psyched for it because I guess over here we get a lot less screwed with
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.820]   the data plans and with the general plans.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.180]   I mean, over here, O2 is the sole carrier.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:05.620]   They're still doing all inclusive plans with the data.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:08.500]   Still getting, you get tons of SMS messages.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.820]   You get a free upgrade from your current iPhone to the new 3G iPhone if you're prepared to
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:14.820]   extend your contract.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.580]   Yeah, we get that to the software upgrade, basically.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.220]   Or do you get the new phone?
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:24.540]   And what they're letting you do is take your old iPhone and basically give it to someone
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.540]   else.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.620]   I left it on the network for a pre-pay card or something for somebody else.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.940]   See, we don't even have pre-paid cards.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.980]   They eliminated the Go option, Go phone option in the States.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.180]   So you can now basically, you can now, you know, take that and give that to your misses
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.180]   or whatever.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.180]   They're going to force activation too.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:43.740]   They're going to give you a free one, on certain price plans.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:47.220]   Now, if you're a new customer and you sign up, they'll just give you the iPhone.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.140]   You don't even have to pay anything for the iPhone.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:50.140]   Wow.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.740]   Which is a really chunky, that's a big subsidy.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.220]   But it's obviously because, I mean, previously Apple's business model was to make money off
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.500]   the ongoing subscriptions.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.580]   Obviously, they want to A net, what they want their model now is shifting to getting as
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.780]   many of these things as possible and making money off the app store.
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.020]   I think that's pretty clear what they're going to do now.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:13.780]   If they're taking, what is it, like 25% of every transaction on the app store?
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.780]   Right.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.780]   I like mobile me.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.780]   I like the idea.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.900]   They call it exchange like features for home users, which is essentially the ability to
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.820]   sync your calendar and address book.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.780]   You get 20 gigs of storage, but you have to pay 100 bucks a year for it, which is, you
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.100]   know, the Samsung will do that for free.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.300]   Most phones will do that, syncing.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.740]   I'm my blackberry syncs with Google Calendar for free.
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:38.420]   I want to be with, but the big talk in the investment community last week, I don't know
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:44.460]   if he knows the stock went down after that was not so much, you know, of course, some
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.300]   of the financials, but you know what it was?
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   Steve Jobs' health.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.020]   Steve Jobs' health is looking a little thin.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:53.700]   Thanks to Matt Drudge for that bogus story.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.100]   Oh, you saw me looked a little bit thinner than I'm not saying that.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.700]   He's a freaking vegan.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.900]   He looks like he's living on grass, wheat grass or something.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:06.140]   Well, I guess that's amazing.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:10.580]   If you look at some as a really good story on a wall places valley lag, we had a pictorial
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:14.940]   of jobs over the last 10 years and it's amazing to see him.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.260]   It's a year in skinnier, isn't it?
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.260]   Absolutely.
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.980]   The part of the reason that Wall Street is afraid is because of course he had cancer,
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.540]   had pancreatic cancer, and has been in remission for some time for that.
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.340]   But it's a publicly held company, don't they have to disclose?
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.740]   If he's sick, they said, oh no, he's just got a bug.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:33.740]   He's on antibiotics.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:34.740]   He's already feeling better.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.940]   I don't necessarily think personal health is a disclosure.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.260]   As a matter of fact, it's not a material.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:47.460]   We did a Teresa Pilletti did a story in market watch on this with a lot of reporting.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.980]   And no, you don't have to report that.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.980]   You could be two minutes from dropping dead.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.500]   It doesn't have to go, you know, it doesn't have to be reported.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.780]   Well, this is a case where you should have to because nobody can run Apple.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.100]   Well, you know, he, well, that is an issue.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.100]   This is the problem.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:00.100]   That's a problem.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.820]   Well, there's a couple of things I want to point out about this, the situation.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:07.380]   I talked to John Markoff about it, who saw Steve and asked him specifically about this.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.300]   I was feeling Steve says he's fine.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.300]   I feel correct.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   So what are you talking about?
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.180]   But there was this picture that ran that Reuters had.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.180]   You were terrible.
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.180]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.620]   Well, apparently, according to some posters there, there's two things I learned.
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:22.420]   One, it looks like that picture was doctored.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.420]   Oh.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:28.020]   It made him not that he's not gone, but he's not green.
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.020]   And Markoff.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.020]   They made him green.
[00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.620]   You're saying they made him green?
[00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:36.140]   If you look at the Reuters picture that ran in market watch, which came from Reuters,
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:40.140]   it's a picture of the two of them side by side and on this newer picture, he's got a
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:43.860]   green gray tint to his complexion.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.060]   If they Photoshop that sucker.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.060]   Granny Smith.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.060]   Granny Smith.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:49.060]   That's so anyway.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:50.060]   Oh.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.100]   Did you, as anybody play the Sporg creature creator?
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.420]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:59.460]   Well, Will writes new game, Sporg, which will be out in September.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.540]   They pre-released the creature creator, which is the thing that lets you design your creature.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.540]   You can't play the game.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.540]   You can just design a creature.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.260]   Have you seen the pornographic creatures people are designing?
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.180]   No, that sounds good.
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.180]   Give us a link.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.180]   Yes.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:16.860]   Oh, it's it's it's the really big front hails.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   It's rev.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.900]   Oh, it's worse than that.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.540]   It's actually become quite a meme.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.660]   It's not safe for work.
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.620]   I guess rock rock paper shotgun.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:30.220]   These things I'm not going to I'm not going to show them, but I will I will give you a
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.580]   link in our we're doing this interesting thing now using cover it live.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:39.900]   If you go to twitlive.tv, I'm actually doing the links out live so you can watch our show
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.060]   notes.
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.980]   So go go.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:45.340]   EA bands to spore porn.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.300]   Yeah, well, they may ban it, but it's too late.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.700]   Well, look what you could do with the creature creator.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:50.700]   That's amazing.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:51.700]   Let me see.
[00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.700]   Yeah, they do.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.700]   It's kind of gross.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.500]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:09.180]   I'm reminded of Inca art.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.660]   So you're looking at him right now.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.340]   Yeah, not for long.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.260]   Watch me give you I'll give you a moment.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.180]   It's actually quite humorous.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.420]   So what is Bill Gates?
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:18.420]   What is his accomplishment?
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.740]   I don't think that he really has one.
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:21.740]   I do.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:22.740]   Okay.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:27.340]   Jerry Pournell, what did what why should we credit Bill Gates with anything?
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:33.980]   Unlike jobs, Gates really did have the vision of a computer in every house and on every
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.740]   desk and in every classroom.
[00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.260]   And he really meant it.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.820]   They had that written that was the the mission statement for Microsoft.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:47.860]   It had written in concrete as you as you come up the path that Microsoft and Redmond, but
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:53.300]   people always leave out the last part, a computer in every whatever office home desk,
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.300]   running Microsoft software.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.740]   Well, that's fine.
[00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:02.780]   But the first part of it is the real vision and nobody else had it.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:03.980]   So I want to hear some stories.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:04.980]   I want you old time.
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:06.660]   I brought you old timers on for a reason.
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:10.300]   I want to hear some stories about.
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.300]   Thank you, Jerry.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.300]   I want to hear some share.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.300]   We're going to have to edit your coffee now.
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.660]   No, no, that's that's what I'm sorry.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:20.660]   I need to get a cough button on this damn Microsoft.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:25.060]   I push the button and it flashes red from you.
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.540]   It's not you.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.540]   That's the problem.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.540]   Yeah, I'm afraid.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.540]   That's all right.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.540]   I think it's great.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.180]   As soon as I say all timers.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.180]   There we go.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:37.740]   No, but the reason I got you guys on is I wanted to have people who go back to the beginning
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.820]   with Bill Gates who have some stories to tell me.
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:44.820]   John, you used to make you did a used to go speeches with a video of the Bill Gates.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:48.220]   You'd take his speech and you'd edit it all down and you used a video toaster, which
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.780]   is a precursor to this try.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:57.180]   I actually the one video I made was I caught one of his keynotes at CES and he swallows
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.580]   a lot while he's talking.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:02.060]   He kind of swallows and I think they trained that out of him later and makes a little
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.060]   gulping thing.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:08.900]   And so I edited together so there's nothing but that and it went five minutes.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.900]   It's a good video.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:15.140]   That's five minutes out of forty five was just gulping.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.380]   That's pretty cool.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.380]   He's never been.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.180]   But you know, that's part of his charm.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:23.980]   He's never been a, you know, a great front man.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.300]   He's a geek.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:29.020]   So Jerry, did you have the ability to call Bill at any time and say, Hey Bill, what's
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:32.500]   going on or for a while?
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.500]   For a while.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:37.260]   But I'll tell you something until he got married.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.260]   Anybody did.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.260]   Oh, it was the wife.
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:48.420]   All you had to do was call the Microsoft switchboard at about ten o'clock at night on a Friday night.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.420]   That's who was home.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.420]   Did he answer the phone?
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.420]   Nobody.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.620]   He answered the phone to him.
[00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.620]   Microsoft.
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.380]   Is that your bill?
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.940]   Microsoft.
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:03.260]   I want a hundred dollars from, I won't tell you who it is, but he's a pretty well known
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:08.620]   journalist saying, I can have you talking to Bill Gates.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:13.260]   Tonight, right now, you might tell us, Jerry.
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.020]   No, I'm not going to.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:22.340]   But anyway, I dialed it handed him this guy the phone and said, he'll answer it.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.340]   Microsoft.
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.380]   I didn't want to, well, Bill do my voice.
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.740]   I damn well wasn't going to say anything myself.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.740]   Nice.
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:30.740]   My God.
[00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:31.740]   Can I talk to you?
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:32.740]   You want to talk?
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.740]   I got.
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:34.740]   I got.
[00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.980]   Something just in the chat room.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.580]   Jason Luyo should have their own podcast.
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.180]   They just do stupid voice.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.380]   The stupid voice cast.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.140]   Welcome to stupid voice cast.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.820]   I'm Leo LeBouette and he's Jason.
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.820]   Jason, we're here today.
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.820]   Wow.
[00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.820]   It's, it's Zany.
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:50.820]   It's a Cootie and pay a look at our guest.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.820]   Whoa.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:52.820]   Whoa.
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.820]   Whoa.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.820]   He talks like that.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.420]   Most important radio across America.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:57.420]   Exactly.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.420]   You're mad.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.140]   I just, like, don't you know what Adam Curry?
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:04.860]   Like, I'll have the Caesar salad resting on the side and it's crazy.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.820]   I'll take a refill on this ice tea.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   Wow.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.980]   Leo, off to you.
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.420]   What are you having to like?
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.700]   If you ever didn't work the way they wanted it to.
[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:14.700]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.740]   And Apple blamed AT&T and AT&T blamed Apple.
[00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.900]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:18.900]   There's a two.
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.420]   Oh, that's never happened before.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.580]   It was a two-step process.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.380]   The first step is AT&T has to approve your credit and say, okay, you've got an account.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:30.940]   Then you have to hook the iPhone up to a Mac and iTunes and then the iTunes says, okay,
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:31.940]   you're activated.
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:34.380]   Now, when I did it on Saturday, it took a second for each.
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.820]   It was very, very quick.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.540]   The people were waiting for hours.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:41.500]   Apparently, not just in the US, but all over the world, these servers were crashing.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:48.420]   Not just AT&T's, in other words, but O2, Vodafone, many of the other carriers were
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.420]   also having similar problems.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   It's a phenomenon.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.500]   It's also up to scale for an event like this.
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.140]   Well, that's exactly right.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:57:00.660]   You don't buy bandwidth year round to handle this kind of traffic in one day.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:02.380]   Oh, they should have been able to handle it.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.900]   It wasn't that much.
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:09.460]   Well, and I have to say, maybe there is some credibility in what AT&T's saying because
[00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:15.940]   Apple's own mobile me service, their new.mac, was down for a long time and then very, very
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:16.940]   slow too.
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:19.540]   Mobile me has not been working very well even now.
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:24.940]   Yeah, there's your cloud computing for you.
[00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.700]   But I think I have to say I bought the 16 gigabyte.
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:28.700]   I wasn't going to.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.420]   I kind of got sucked in by this 24 hours of iPhone.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.540]   It was such a great marketing tool for Apple that I actually convinced myself to buy an
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:37.540]   iPhone.
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.140]   But that took a lot of work.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.220]   I wasn't gone.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.220]   I really wasn't.
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.220]   And you know what?
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.860]   We really won me over and it's not the GPS or the 3G because I don't even get me.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.660]   GEDBC just bought the weather channel.
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.220]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:55.140]   They bought the CBS decided to buy CNET instead of the weather channel.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.140]   Is that really true?
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:57.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.380]   That was the choice.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.980]   That was apparently considering.
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:05.580]   So NBC is the runner up.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:07.580]   That must be a good time.
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.580]   Damn good.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:09.580]   Right.
[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:11.580]   As you are the weather channel.
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:12.580]   Wow.
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.420]   It's better than the puppy channel.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.700]   Hey, don't knock the puppy channel them all.
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.060]   But I get arranged things that I was going to come down at 10 stand in line.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.060]   They said, no, no, no, Steve.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:22.060]   No, no, no.
[00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:23.060]   We've got it all arranged.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.540]   You're from like, I said, no, I don't want to pass up other people because that's how
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.540]   I am.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.300]   And they said, oh, no, no, they want you to.
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.100]   The people in the front of the line want you to be ahead of them.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.100]   Right.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.100]   I remember you.
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.100]   I stood by you.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.340]   I would check that post on that blog.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.340]   I remember you.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:37.500]   You told me that.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.500]   You told us that.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.500]   And I got there.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.660]   By the way, I said this comment on the CNET list.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.900]   If you go down to the second page.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:43.900]   Yes.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.980]   I have a post in there that I wrote this morning just before driving to Vegas.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:49.340]   And you know, I went to the people in the front of the line.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.180]   Now, when I got there, I saw four people.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:54.660]   It could be there were some wrapped around a corner that I didn't see some more.
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.940]   But they said it was a short line.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.180]   And I went to those people.
[00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.260]   And they said, yeah, they were OK with me.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.420]   I was chatting with the guy.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.620]   I actually made the guy who was first in the line there before me.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:08.340]   Go in, walk in first and get sort of the good camera publicity, that sort of stuff.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:11.180]   You know, he kept wanting to know, no, no, you're the big man.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.180]   You do it.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.180]   And come on.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.180]   You know, you were there first.
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.180]   And I try to do that.
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.340]   I do not like people who cut.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:20.180]   I know executives that will get products in advance, that will arrange a little black
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:23.260]   door, back door, you know, push out of the audit early.
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:27.140]   I could actually make phone calls and probably get an iPhone, you know, before anyone else.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:28.140]   A lot of different ways.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:29.140]   But I won't do that.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:30.140]   I want to do that.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.140]   I wanted the experience.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.140]   I waited there from four in the morning till whatever.
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.340]   Now I had made arrangements.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.340]   Hold on.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:42.880]   I'm waiting for this story to load and it's refusing.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.400]   Don't worry.
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.020]   We'll just edit this all out.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:51.960]   It's going to really only be like a 10 minute podcast.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:56.380]   John, what are you making for dinner tonight?
[00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:07.060]   I've got some some beef short ribs that came from one of the animals that we've we buy
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.900]   animal off the hoof.
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:09.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.900]   Wait a minute.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.540]   I'm envisioning your backyard looking like some scene out of apocalypse now.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.980]   Do you have a ranch, John?
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:22.620]   No, when you live in Port Angeles, you have a access to people that, you know, grow a
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.980]   few animals and then they split them up.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.940]   And we get fresh.
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.940]   I got a place up there, but you're not there now.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.940]   Not at the moment.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:31.940]   I was there yesterday.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.020]   But you bring meat back with you from Port Angeles.
[01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:37.180]   So Larry is to get it through the TSA.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.180]   Sir, what is this?
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.860]   It's a romp roast.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.980]   I'll bring a suitcase full.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.060]   No, no, wait a minute.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.060]   No, really?
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.860]   A suitcase full of meat.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.860]   What else I got to bring?
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.820]   I got to put some on the plane to get my money's worth of the shipping.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:55.140]   Sure, Mr. Riser, just get right on the plane.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.140]   No problem.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.300]   Actually, haven't you see the, by the way, Kevin, you could just go silent.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:01.900]   You don't have to say anything.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.740]   I know that if, you know, you don't have to confirm it.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.540]   You don't have to deny it.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.180]   I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, but it is.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:11.580]   It would have been that whether you were here or not, it's a big story.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.740]   The rumor was that Google was doing due diligence on a possible $200 million acquisition
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.540]   of Dig.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   Mike publishes this.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.900]   It's the same rumor this time though.
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:22.580]   Instead of just letting it drop.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:26.820]   He actually comes back and said, no, they changed their mind, which as far as I'm concerned,
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:28.260]   he could be making up to protect himself.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.260]   Who knows?
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.260]   But it, but it didn't happen.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.540]   So I guess, Kevin, here's the point where I would say to you, you want to confirm or
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.820]   deny you want to say anything about it?
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:43.540]   Well, I mean, about, I don't know, a year ago or so, we decided to, as a company, just
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.220]   like when any of this stuff comes up, just to never comment on anything.
[01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:51.380]   Now, Jay, Jay denied it once, like vigorously denied it.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.380]   He did.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:55.180]   He really pissed when that came out.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.820]   We did a blog post about it.
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:03.500]   But it's funny because these rumors can come about in so many different ways.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.260]   I remember one time I was on the Yahoo campus and I was just there, we were doing some
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.340]   Biz Dev kind of work and forming a partnership with them.
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:13.220]   And someone sees me on the campus and all of a sudden, they have an ear with whoever
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.380]   the tech news publisher is and then all of a sudden, there's a rumor that we're going
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.380]   to sell the company.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:22.980]   So, you know, we have, I'm friends with Marissa and everyone over at Google.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.020]   I think they're a great group and we're always working on stuff together.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.020]   So,
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.180]   Is Allen and company shopping you around?
[01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.380]   No, they are not.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.380]   Okay, there you go.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.380]   That's all I want to hear.
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:33.380]   That's great.
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:37.820]   So let's talk about Steve Jobs because we did quite a bit on Steve Jobs and the Whipple
[01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.100]   procedure that he received.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.980]   And now the New York Times has finally said, told the truth, John Markoff and Jonah Sarah
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:48.780]   and the Times writing the story that, you know, that's why Apple stock tanked last
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.820]   week despite having the best quarter it's ever had.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.620]   And then Jobs calls no Sarah.
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:00.140]   You know, it's kind of funny because Joe, I would have led with that at the top of the
[01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:04.780]   story, but Joe buries at the bottom Thursday afternoon after I've gotten my final Steve's
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:07.980]   health is a private matter from Apple PR.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.540]   And much to my amazement, I'm reading from Joe's article in the Times, Mr. Jobs, that's
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:17.060]   how you know it's at times they call Mr. Jobs called me.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.060]   This is Steve Jobs.
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:22.580]   He began, you think I'm an arrogant bleep who thinks he's above the law.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:27.420]   And I think you're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong.
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.500]   Steve Jobs talking.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.500]   That sounds like.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   Can you be what a great way to start a conversation with a reporter.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.460]   You're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:42.380]   And he offers to tell him the story, but only off the way is a Sisidman.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:48.060]   He's hired by the city of San Francisco to set up a very important wide area land for
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.180]   the Sis for the city.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.580]   This is how administrators and others are going to be able to, you know, civil officials
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.380]   are going to be able to log into the city's network remotely.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:02.980]   The guy is apparently a brilliant engineer, maybe a little cranky as many Sisidman's are,
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.460]   by the way, belated, happy Sisidman's day.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.260]   We love Sisidman's.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:14.540]   He won't give up the passwords to, you know, I guess a new guy comes in to monitor the
[01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:20.820]   security and the Sisidman says, no, I'm not going to give you the passwords.
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.620]   They arrest him, put him in jail, $5 million bail.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:28.020]   They're afraid that he's kind of holding the system for ransom.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.140]   In fact, they tell the story, well, he was worried about losing his job and this was
[01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:35.660]   a poison pill and they're afraid that he's got people who are going to call, you know,
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.460]   call a special code in and blow the whole thing up digitally.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.620]   Well, midnight all over again.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.820]   Yeah, none of this happens.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:50.700]   In fact, you go on info world and you and he's really got a champion on info world who's
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.940]   telling this story.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:57.460]   And apparently this guy is actually kind of just trying to protect the network that he
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:01.580]   created and he's worried about, yay, who's getting in there and messing the whole thing
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.580]   up.
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:04.380]   Well, they, he finally gives up.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.940]   I mean, wouldn't you, you thrown into jail.
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.260]   He finally gives after what?
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.860]   I mean, he holds out for days.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.620]   He finally gives up gives the passwords.
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.160]   And by the way, if you want to read, read about this, the series of articles by Paul
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.740]   Venetia in, uh, in info world is, is, is what to read.
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:28.100]   So he gives up the passwords and what does the city do?
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:32.140]   It puts all the passwords in its complaint and publishers.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.860]   Oh my God.
[01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:41.180]   The San Francisco district attorney Kamala Harris publishes 150 user names and passwords
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:46.900]   used by various departments to connect that of city's VPN as exhibit a way.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.860]   It was a password or password hashes.
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:56.460]   Well, according to Robert McMillan writing in, uh, info world, it's the passwords.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.100]   That's a, that's a good question.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.740]   It's a play.
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.860]   They place the passwords into the public record.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.740]   I wouldn't want some of my passwords to be seen by a public publisher.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.220]   Well, this guy, yo, that's a good point.
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.220]   What do you use?
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.140]   Kind of like ex girlfriends, things like that.
[01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:13.140]   What do you?
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:14.140]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:15.940]   We're not talking about this.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.180]   Anyway, no, you're right.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:21.300]   I wouldn't want people because passwords are embarrassing, you know, kitty poop and stuff
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.300]   like that.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.260]   You don't want to use, you know, anybody, but nonetheless, I mean, it actually proves
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.700]   if I'm the defend defending attorney, Terry Child's case all along, these guys are bozos.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.860]   They don't know anything about security.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.220]   They shouldn't have these passwords.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:38.300]   Apparently the DA's office did not say what the passwords were used.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.300]   Thank goodness.
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.540]   Now that's a troll.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.300]   I won't be collecting any lulls for that.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.300]   That's my, your honor.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.780]   I did it for the love.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:53.620]   I saw that apparently mobile me is back up again now.
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:55.620]   Legitally.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:56.620]   General, some old friends.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.660]   Cisco Franco's still dead.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:01.620]   Mobile me is back up.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:08.300]   I feel like the, you know, you know, back in the Iraq war where they had that guy, the
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.380]   general who was just the most improbable guy, you know, we are slaughtering them in the
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:13.380]   streets.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:17.260]   The nature of him, just with the caption, like there is nothing wrong with mobile me.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.460]   Mobile me is fine.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.460]   We are all fine here.
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.220]   We are slaughtering the infidels.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   Fine.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.220]   It's fine.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.340]   It's all fine.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.060]   So they confirm there's water on Mars.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.060]   That's good news.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.060]   I'm moving there.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.460]   I thought we already knew that.
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.660]   They kept on talking.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.980]   Every year they have nothing.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:36.660]   Another thing on Mars and every year I think you're talking about this water, you know,
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.660]   you're right.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.660]   Every year.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:41.100]   In fact, two or three years ago when I was up, but tell you right at the tech fest up
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.060]   there, there's this one of the NASA guys.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.220]   It was a Mars expert.
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.860]   I guess he was from JPL was talking about that underneath the surface, there's tons
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.100]   of water and they all know it.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:52.500]   And you know, they now they every time that he comes around, they're finding water.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.380]   We've got more water here.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.460]   So here's the deal.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:00.740]   We've seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the Odyssey, which is the
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.460]   Mars orbiter and in disappearing chunks.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.580]   Remember the Phoenix?
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:08.980]   So those white chunks, it scraped some, some soil and then saw what chunks and then they
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.580]   ablated they disappeared.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:15.060]   You know, you sound kind of like Kenneth Mars, the first person to produce.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.820]   It's right from the producers.
[01:08:16.820 --> 01:08:17.820]   Exactly.
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:18.820]   He's a good man.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.220]   He was a lovely man.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.220]   He was a kind man.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.460]   But just open it up and then you tell me.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:28.140]   You know, you become the world's worst tease.
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:32.380]   Every time you're on the show, you're talking about something you can't tell anybody.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:35.380]   You're now you've got the mystery pictures that only Leo gets to see.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:39.100]   So everybody out there that's listening to this show is going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.620]   So I'm not trying to be a tease.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.580]   Honestly, I'm just trying to get you.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.580]   Oh my God.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.060]   Oh, now it's worse.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.780]   I'm just trying not to get people in trouble.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:53.300]   Like, you know, the people that sent me this stuff, like they trust me not to leak it out
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.900]   on like a mass scale.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:58.380]   So I don't want to like post everything that I get online.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.820]   I'll just say, you know, whatever it is that I get, I'll try and come.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.900]   I have to say, Kevin, as this looks very real, of course, but couldn't.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:07.980]   I mean, you could fake anything nowadays, right?
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:10.340]   Yeah, but look at the fourth.
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.620]   Leo, could you go to that reverse angle for a second?
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.620]   You want to see that?
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:15.420]   Okay, let's we'll do the tight zoom.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.500]   No, I'm not doing that to Kevin.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.500]   Okay.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:23.260]   Because, wow, that's so the thing looks, it looks like it was extruded.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:26.940]   Now I have to say, I poo pooed the new nano.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.420]   I thought, oh, that's a joke because the pictures we saw originally, remember those Ryan?
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.940]   They were just really looked phony.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:32.940]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:33.940]   And it was exactly right.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:38.780]   So I'm no longer basing anything I say on.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:42.420]   So can I say, I can't say even what this document is that you sent me?
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.980]   No, no, I did really appreciate it.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:46.300]   Yeah, because that would kind of give away the source of it.
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.300]   Right.
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.220]   Really, I'm getting more and more.
[01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:55.700]   You can't pull over because you were wearing a rostah hat.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.860]   I got pulled over, well, Ross had baseball beanies.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.740]   I'm going to make them wear the hat and the kilt on the show when I get that off leg.
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:05.180]   I think I'm a Bdu, that was another very popular piece of head gear for a while.
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.180]   Wait a minute, what's that?
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:07.180]   What's a Bdu?
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.740]   Bdu battle dress uniform, basically combat fatigues.
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.220]   And you would take the leg of it and you put it on your head?
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.540]   I had made a pair of cutoffs and turned one of the legs into a hat.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:20.540]   This I gotta say, this I gotta say.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:23.540]   The first incarnation, when this thing came out on Tuesday, by the way, it's Google's
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.460]   new Internet browser, just what the world needs, a new Internet browser.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.860]   It said that everything you create with this browser belongs to Google.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.420]   You still have copyright to it, but we can do anything we want with it.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.180]   That upset people a little bit.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.620]   But you know, I said even at the time, I said, look, this is just what lawyers do to protect
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.620]   you against things like caching.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.700]   They don't want somebody to come along and sue them saying, "Hey, this browser cached
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.580]   a copy of my blog post.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.260]   I don't like it."
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:54.980]   But even Google said, "Yeah, they said to save money, this cracks me up."
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:58.140]   We duplicate the boilerplate from other contracts.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.300]   And it shouldn't have been in there, they said.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.060]   I wasn't buying that argument.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.660]   You're telling me that they go through all this trouble and then they just cut and paste
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.660]   something and, "Oh, oops, oops, sorry."
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.500]   Funny, it was only when the users got upset that it changed.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.500]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.340]   Have you ever worked for a big company before?
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   Because it sounds like you haven't.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   I worked for plenty of people.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.340]   I've worked for a guy.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.180]   This whole thing, if you looked into this IMPC and this, what is it?
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:25.140]   IMPC.lifewithoutwalls.com, which I think what they're going at, by the way, even with
[01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:30.380]   that silly sneaker commercial or the shoe, was all about the fact that a Mac, when you
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.980]   get it, you can't do anything with the Mac.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:37.620]   There's no freedom, but with a PC, you can take it apart, you can put it back.
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.620]   Yeah, everybody talked about the kind of the semiotics of those first two commercials.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:45.540]   If there was a hidden message there, it was so buried, I don't think it was it.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:46.540]   It didn't come across.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:51.660]   It's not like America went like somehow subconsciously absorbed the message of that.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.660]   Let me play a little bit of this.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.660]   This is IMPC.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.260]   Hello, I'm a PC and I've been made into a stereotype.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.580]   I'm a PC and I'm not what you call him.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.140]   I'm a PC and I wear glasses.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.140]   I wear glasses.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.140]   Hey, I wear glasses.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:08.540]   I wear jeans and I study jeans and I design jeans and I design green.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.500]   It's a pretty good ad, I have to say.
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.140]   I play that Steve Bommel.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.780]   You see this on the site?
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:14.780]   Yeah, I'll find that one.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.140]   He says, "I'm a PC, I'm a PC, I'm a PC."
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.140]   It's very loud.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.380]   But here's what's beautiful about it.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:28.980]   They have it so that you can record your own IMPC and potentially be shown on the Times
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.140]   Square monitors.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:35.060]   That's drawing people in who want to see themselves and the narcissists out there and
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.620]   all the other people that want to have their five minutes of fame.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:42.260]   But more so, they also have a live stream of Times Square showing the advertising.
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.540]   I think it's a brilliant idea.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:44.540]   I'm a church going to make people fuck.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.460]   Is it going to sell PCs is the question?
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.460]   A different story.
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:53.020]   By the way, a Mac is a PC, is it going to sell Windows is really the question.
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.980]   I think it doesn't matter.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   It doesn't matter.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.140]   Yeah, I mean, I think this is like Coke and Pepsi.
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:03.900]   I don't think these things are going to affect adoption of the product either way.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:07.500]   I don't think for the incumbent, it doesn't make a difference.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.900]   For the upstart Apple it does, but for the incumbent, I don't think it makes sense.
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.740]   Mike Arrington said an interesting thing.
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:17.420]   He first was going to pan the ad, but then he realized it made him feel like the Apple
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:21.620]   ads were a little elitist and that maybe he wasn't going to be able to watch those Apple
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.500]   ads with the same kind of smug satisfaction as he had in the past.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.500]   Does that make sense?
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:31.340]   Yeah, because also people said that the PC character was actually more endearing than
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.340]   the hipster.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.620]   Well, that was obviously intentional.
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:39.500]   I think Apple was frankly brilliant when they made the PC sympathetic.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.620]   If they'd made it a negative, Windows users would have been pissed off.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:51.260]   But this effectively killed the Apple ad in a way because now every single time the Apple
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.940]   ad is run, you're thinking about this ad.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.940]   That's Mike Arrington's contention.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:58.660]   I only killed it that way, but killed it because you think, "Oh, they're snooty elite.
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.020]   iPhone could very well lose to one of these other competitors."
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.180]   I think if Apple keeps it closed, I'm with Adam on this one.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:08.220]   I think Apple's made a big mistake by deciding to go with a single carrier and making a closed
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.220]   platform.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.020]   It's Steve Jobs and a power grab.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.020]   They're doing the iTunes thing.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.940]   The record labels are moving away from them with copy protection.
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.900]   It's going to fail with the iPhone, not because it's not a great platform, but because it's
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:26.140]   closed if there's an open alternative, people are going to go for it.
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.140]   Apple has no history of being open, so why should they start now?
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:30.140]   No, you're right.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:32.060]   I don't think it's that people even want it to be open.
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:37.140]   I think it's just certainly a lot of the...as far as I can see, most of the blowback on it
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:42.140]   is coming from people like us who are the high tech guys in the developer community who
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.460]   are so fed up with the fact they could develop an app for six months and it might not end
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:47.980]   up on the store.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:52.900]   Either Apple needs to go open or they need to be really, really, really clear about what
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:54.420]   they are going to allow and what they...
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:58.420]   The division that's actually on my panel and I'm doing this on Thursday.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.620]   This is why I'm in town and they said, "Well, you can you prove it?"
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:04.700]   I said, "Well, yeah, I have an itinerary.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.700]   Would you like to see it?"
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.820]   They go, "Yes."
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.740]   And then I said, "Well, hand me my MacBook.
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.100]   I got to go on the internet because it's on my Gmail."
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.540]   So they hand me my MacBook.
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.500]   I plug in my Verizon card.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.660]   I power it up and the first thing Firefox does when I boot it up on my Mac is it asks
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.580]   you to clear private data and just instinctively I click "Yes."
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:26.620]   And then right away they grab my laptop back thinking...
[01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.620]   Deforing evidence.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:31.340]   Yeah, which I wasn't, but that was beside the point.
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:36.140]   So you claimed.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:41.260]   Believe me, if I was going to hide something, the whole hard drive would be encrypted.
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:42.260]   There'd be no forensics.
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:50.580]   I guess what I'm saying is like, this sounds more like a comedy of errors and a bad run
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.580]   of luck.
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.900]   You can't see how the agents might have thought something was going on there.
[01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:55.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.580]   Besides, if the four horsemen are coming after you, you're not going to worry about what
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.580]   kind of wine you're going to get.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.580]   Hey, yeah, I would.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.940]   Dwight, are you there?
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:05.940]   I am.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:10.260]   Are you ready for the end times?
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.260]   I'm ready.
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.260]   Bring on the pestilence.
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:18.220]   They're frogs outside coming from the sky.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.820]   We are in a tech bus.
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.020]   There's no question about it.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:26.980]   In fact, if you go to TechCrunch, they have a layoff tracker.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:32.940]   And according to their layoff tracker, 19,683 jobs eliminated since mid September.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.540]   That's not including the 25,000.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:39.060]   HP is going to lay off as a result of its merger with EDS.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:49.220]   It is including 3000 at Xerox, 9000 at Dell, 1500 at Yahoo, 1500 eBay, six at Mahalo.
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.820]   Makes you sound pretty good.
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.060]   But as a percentage, it's roughly, you laid off about 10% of Mahalo.
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:05.100]   Yeah, essentially, we looked at it and said we have three years' worth of capital F.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.100]   We did something really smart.
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.300]   We raised a lot of money in the upmarket.
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:13.380]   And so as I always say, what smart entrepreneurs do in an upmarket is raise capital and sell
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.420]   their companies for the highest valuation possible.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:19.580]   And then in a downmarket, what smart entrepreneurs do is build value.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.500]   And so we raised money when the market was very hot a year and a half ago.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.140]   And now we're going to build value in the downmarket and not look for an exit or not
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.140]   look to raise more capital.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.140]   So your cash position it gave gives you what you call runway.
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.660]   They call it runway.
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.180]   How many months can you go without raising capital?
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:38.500]   A typical startup company has six to 18 months.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:41.300]   Look at all the great technologies we're still using from that PDC.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.820]   Like, hmm, oh shoot.
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:49.820]   Well, moving along.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:54.220]   So Rafael, how many PDCs have you been to?
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:55.220]   I would say two.
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.220]   OK.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:57.220]   You're the youngster here.
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.220]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.220]   The newbie.
[01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:00.220]   Were you impressed?
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.340]   Was this an interesting event?
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.460]   It was very interesting.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:10.580]   Now we all kind of knew the cloud platform would be unveiled and that we'd be thoroughly
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.580]   confused.
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:14.580]   We thought it would be Strata, but instead it's Azure.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.580]   Right, right.
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:21.420]   Or Azure or Azul, Azurio, whatever that is.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:24.620]   But the failure of the taskbar was awesome.
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:25.620]   The what?
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:28.820]   The unveiling of the taskbar was awesome.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.820]   Really?
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.820]   From Windows 7, yeah.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:31.820]   Is that like a big deal?
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.700]   That's like the big deal is the taskbar.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.300]   And I know it sounds silly, but it is kind of a big deal.
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:38.820]   So what's new about the taskbar?
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.700]   It's glassy and shiny and stuff.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:41.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.060]   Let's take a step back.
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:49.220]   Before we talk about individual features, Microsoft announced basically two big things,
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:52.300]   Windows 7, which by the way is not a code name.
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.820]   This is going to be the name.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.540]   That's the real deal.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.940]   This ain't no Longhorn Chicago thing.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:02.020]   Yes, Windows version 6.1 will be called Windows 7.
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:07.020]   In the world of Microsoft, that actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.020]   All right.
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.020]   All right.
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.420]   Talked a little bit about this on Windows Weekly.
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   And I've been ever since--
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:14.420]   Only Microsoft.
[01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.140]   It's by the way, a great way, better than counting sheep.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:20.500]   Go to sleep, try and account the versions of Windows, trying to get to 7 with the next
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.500]   one.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.500]   And you can't.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:23.500]   You can't.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.500]   For all things pertaining to either book.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:26.500]   Yes.
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:30.580]   And I said to Jonathan, we should probably include a reading of some kind.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:34.020]   Let's drive people crazy and do the 700 hobo names.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.020]   And he was game.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.180]   But I didn't realize so that we weren't going to drive people crazy.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.900]   We were going to drive us crazy.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:40.900]   Right.
[01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:48.180]   Because the idea was we would sit in his-- what was then his office, now his children's room.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:50.220]   And we would record it on his computer.
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:53.260]   While he played-- it was a very low tech corporation.
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.980]   We had a single microphone.
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.140]   And he had his guitar out.
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.900]   And he played Big Rock Candy Mountain, the great hobo anthem of our time.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:04.180]   Behind me, over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:08.580]   How many names per iteration of Big Rock Candy Mountain can you get?
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:13.140]   I'm going to leave that to your listeners.
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.100]   I would like to know the answer to it.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.540]   And I'm not really interested in finding out myself.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.940]   So I'm going to crowdsource this.
[01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.300]   So Google says to Yahoo.
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.380]   You know, the Department of Justice is just a little too hot right now.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:30.340]   That ad deal we were talking about, forget about it.
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:36.820]   So Jerry Yang at the Web 2.0 Summit says, you know, I think it'd be a really good thing
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.420]   for Microsoft to acquire Yahoo.
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   Oh, wow.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.620]   He still thinks so.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.060]   That was bad.
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.740]   How high did that offer get?
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.740]   33 bucks?
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   33.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:49.540]   He wanted 37.
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.540]   And what is Yahoo at now?
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.540]   12?
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.620]   Heading for under 10.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:58.140]   And he still has a job.
[01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:59.540]   This is what's amazing to me.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.540]   It's this company.
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:04.780]   Yeah, but can I interrupt here and just just say what I keep going?
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:08.340]   I'm hearing in the chat room about you just having won an award.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.340]   I don't know.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:11.940]   What is this chat room?
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.700]   The best hat to me.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:14.700]   Not you Leo.
[01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:15.700]   Twid, I think.
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.700]   Marty.
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.420]   Twid won a podcast award.
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:19.900]   We win those every year.
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.220]   Well, what do we win?
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.700]   Round of applause.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:24.700]   Geez.
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:25.700]   A shiny, shiny.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.660]   I'd love to win a podcast award.
[01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:28.860]   A key fob.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:32.500]   See, see, see all the awards in the in the shelf.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.300]   They just do an award.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.300]   Yeah, we know I'm very grateful.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:38.300]   I appreciate it.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.300]   Who's we?
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:42.100]   Oh, he has a mouse in his pocket.
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:45.020]   And if you aren't ready, mayhem ensues.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:49.820]   And what's really great is if you get a phone call from somebody who's just had that happen
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.100]   and they have no idea what was going on.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:55.100]   My toilet just squirted at me.
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.340]   Leo, the best part is there's two settings.
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:01.700]   So the first shows like a letter W, curvy, which is your butt with water shooting into
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:02.700]   it.
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:08.740]   And shows some weird piece of anatomy that is for the front, let's say.
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.940]   Is it identifiable or is it obscure?
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.340]   Well, it sort of looks like a little man.
[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.060]   Sort of like a like a anyway.
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.580]   Are you saying this is there's a we we washer button?
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.420]   There's a wee, we washer button, but I couldn't tell from looking at the icon.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:28.380]   If the icon was made over a modeled after a male or female, I think it's a hybrid.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.260]   So it's sort of like the spermaphrodite.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.260]   It's generic.
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:32.260]   We we.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:35.540]   But it will clean your wee-wee as well.
[01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:38.460]   And anyway, this is what you're in for a Tokyo.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:39.460]   But if you go, you have.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.100]   So I'm excited.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.100]   It's awesome.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.300]   You know, evidently Will Smith is a big fan of these toilet.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.300]   A.A.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.180]   Chen says Google's layoffs appear to be larger than previous reports.
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:52.940]   The original reports are just some double click duplication.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:57.620]   According to Web Guild, since August, hundreds of Google staff have been laid off and the
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:02.500]   number of jobs on the chopping block could rise up to 10,000.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:08.020]   Now, what's the number on, you know, Google's like 30,000?
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.380]   They have 20,000 employees.
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.380]   It cannot fire half of them.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.380]   That doesn't sound right.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:17.660]   Well, one thing is that they first of all, they laid off last week all of their part
[01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:18.820]   time and contract labor.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.820]   That was the first thing they did.
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.700]   That's about 10,000 right there, isn't it?
[01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:22.700]   That's a huge.
[01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.420]   No, no, it was a small number than that.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.820]   It was it was a number.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:28.420]   But I know it wasn't very it wasn't really that large.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:33.980]   Because they like Microsoft and a lot of companies do that little contract employee thing.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.460]   Which is smart.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:38.420]   I mean, that's smart just for this kind of circumstance, right?
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.420]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.420]   But they have it.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.740]   They do have a total of I'm saying 20,000 employees with about it.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:46.420]   But it says according to this story, an extra 10,000 hidden as temporary workers.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.420]   Right.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:50.340]   And that's the one that they said they're going to just take out that that's the one
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:53.420]   that's going to, you know, reduce down by.
[01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:55.380]   And of course, listen, everybody.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:57.980]   I think we get carried away with the Google const.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.340]   I mean, Google is an advertising company.
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.340]   That's it.
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.340]   And I got to tell you something.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.060]   I know some people in a variety of different companies as you do.
[01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.060]   And they're nervous.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:11.900]   I mean, the people that are that are expecting the, you know, to run their companies by advertising
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:16.060]   dollars, don't forget the financial industry is one of the biggest spenders of money when
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:17.540]   it comes to online advertising.
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:20.260]   Now, they're not too, I don't know if you notice this, but they're not doing so well
[01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:21.260]   right now.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:22.260]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:27.540]   And the fact is that you have this situation where all of a sudden they say, wait a minute,
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:28.860]   this company goes out at that.
[01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:30.140]   What do we even do about our revenue?
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:31.660]   We have no other revenue stream.
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:35.340]   Where else does for the most part, where else does, where else does Google get their
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:36.340]   money from?
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.380]   Of course, they get it from their, their search.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.020]   But you know, that's being cut down as well.
[01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:44.340]   And and really the whole thing is all about the advertising.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.940]   There's no secondary opportunities for them.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:52.380]   How many people in California stopped making phone calls on their cell phone?
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.900]   Not my wife, apparently she's calling right now.
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:55.900]   Did you?
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:01.060]   Leo, what is taking so long to throw with Twit yet?
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.540]   Are you still twitting?
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:05.180]   I'll be up in a minute, honey.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:07.300]   She probably got dinner upstairs.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.820]   So we're down in my basement.
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:13.300]   Many people don't know that this whole operation just down in my basement.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.300]   It's weird.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.300]   Actually, be here.
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.580]   I'm going to get lights on those back stairs.
[01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.180]   I know it's a little scary going down there.
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.260]   What about that musty smell?
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.260]   I can't, I tried.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.140]   I can't tell anything about that.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:26.660]   Some say a body was buried here, but I don't think so.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:29.060]   It's, you know, window would be so nice.
[01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.060]   What's a basement?
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.060]   There's no way.
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:33.060]   I can tell you that Patrick Norton hasn't been able to shoot me.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.060]   He killed a little on top of it.
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:35.060]   Maybe it's Patrick.
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:38.460]   You know, I don't remember him leaving after that last time he was here.
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:40.820]   Ah, Patrick's dead in here somewhere.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:41.820]   Oh man.
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:42.820]   That's what that is.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.660]   There was a little bit of a funk.
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:45.660]   I don't know what he's doing.

[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:12.660]   We just scrambled a BitTorrent package if that's what you would think.
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.660]   Because it's not a right.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.660]   It's not a right.
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:20.660]   You can use a BitTorrent, HTTP, HTTPS, and IRC.

[01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:57.660]   We're going down another rat hole that didn't mean to.
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:01.660]   It seems like we've lost control of the actual game entirely.
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:05.660]   We're getting the right build order and getting the right macro set of...
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:07.660]   ...it's bonkers.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:11.660]   Excuse me, I just had a little explosion here.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.660]   My exercise Bob popped.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:17.660]   Too many thumbnails.

[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.660]   Another day with Leo.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:15.660]   I know everything to do with it.
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:19.660]   Long inside, yeah, I'm a twit.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:24.660]   And if I miss one, I have a fit, yeah, I'm a twit.
