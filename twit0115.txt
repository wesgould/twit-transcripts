[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.680]   and be part of the lab with Leo.

[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.000]   In fact, it's a blog post that got his attention,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.960]   got my attention and brought him on,
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.440]   but he also writes for the digital home.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.360]   It does product reviews for a lot of ZD publications,

[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.680]   East Coast, yep. Where's that?
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.400]   New York. New York. New York.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.240]   Just there.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.400]   Were you at digital?
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800]   I'm upstate. Upstate, yeah.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   Did you go downstate for digital life?
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.880]   Yeah, I just got back about three hours ago.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.200]   You too, Roger?
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.120]   Yeah, I was there Friday, Saturday,
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000]   and I just left this morning.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.120]   Is this the old PC Expo rebranded?
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.320]   What is digital life?
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.520]   Don, is it the same as PC Expo?
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.360]   I don't know, I've never been to PC Expo.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.240]   I think that, 'cause PC Expo kind of disappeared
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.160]   and digital life appeared.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.240]   I don't know if it's the same or not.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.440]   Yeah, I mean, it was pretty good.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.000]   Roger, you've been before?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.760]   Yeah, it's if Davis is a convention that,
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.400]   I mean, their take is essentially a technology convention
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.560]   that isn't skewed toward industry,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.840]   but rather consumers might smoke into the public.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.320]   But it wasn't huge.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.000]   It was, I mean, I don't remember.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.400]   I wasn't at the first one, but from what I understand,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.920]   it's gotten bigger.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.880]   Although-- Don, you said it was small lackluster
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.080]   and boring.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.240]   Yeah, you know, I was there for about an hour.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.320]   Well, I got around in an hour.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.480]   Well, that's enough.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.640]   I looked around and I see everyone at guitar hero
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.680]   and everyone flocking to the HDTVs
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.840]   and I'm thinking to myself,
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   what about everyone else that no one's paying attention to?
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.280]   It was really interesting how the dynamic really worked out.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.320]   Well, you also have to take it from the standpoint.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.120]   I mean, you probably have experienced more conventions
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.960]   than most of the average public while we're seeing.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.480]   And for those people to be actually able to go in
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.200]   and, you know, a touch, play, goof around
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.440]   with stuff that they normally just read about,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.800]   it's kind of cool.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.840]   Yeah, I mean, I guess so.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   What was the coolest thing you saw, Roger?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.160]   Um, he had to plug the Army,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.040]   but the America's Army had a really cool booth setup
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.400]   slash, you know, recruiting thing.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   This is the game that the Army did this year,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.040]   what, five years ago, the game 3D first person
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.880]   showed that they--
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.520]   America's Army and what they had was essentially
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.760]   in a pitch black tent, they had these three Humvees
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.800]   and they put three people inside
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.400]   and it was basically three large wide screens
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.600]   in front of each Humvee playing the game
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.240]   and they would actually play in a multiplayer setting
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.600]   with a commander in each one telling them,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.440]   like, you know, drive over there, you know, you got--
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.280]   Well, that's fun.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.120]   Right?
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.640]   So it was a very coordinated kind of thing.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.840]   Explain to me, was the Humvee steering wheel attached
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.720]   as a controller or did you have to sit there
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.120]   with a joystick in your lap?
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.480]   For winners, for them to look like you,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.160]   they were actually driving and then the gunner
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.400]   actually had a gun, you know, on top of the turret.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.240]   You kidding?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.600]   And the swung it around there was mapped to the game control.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.280]   That sounds really dangerous.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.080]   Well, it's not moving, they're all static,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.160]   but the idea is that you have these huge projection screens
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.040]   that project the game onto it, giving you the, you know,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.080]   at least 160 degree frontal arc of imaginary, you know,
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080]   scenarios.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.160]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.160]   you're missing the point, that's not the idea, Roger.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.000]   The idea is the Army, what fun.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.160]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.120]   Roger, did you get a chance to get in the Formula One car?
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.120]   No, I was actually somewhat sidetracked by the Angelina Jolie
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.520]   and Howard Stern lookalikes, which I might add
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.800]   were quite impressive.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   Who was hotter?
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.600]   Who was hotter Angelina or Howard?
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.800]   Angelina, no, you don't understand Angelina Jolie
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   look like, looked like Angelina Jolie.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   Amazing, amazing.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.200]   It's all collagen.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.760]   Don't get fooled.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.680]   And was she at the, I wonder if she and Howard
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.280]   tried the Humvees, now that would have been interesting.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.440]   Oh, well, they were over at the, what's this company?
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.720]   O-O-V-O-O move.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   O-O-O move.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   O-O-O-O-O-O-O.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.120]   What is O-O-O-O-O?
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   It's kind of an I aming service that allows you
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.280]   to send video to one another.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   So there was Web 2.0 stuff there as well.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.960]   Web 2.0 stuff, of course, you know, as Don mentioned,
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.000]   there was a lot of gaming.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.640]   In fact, there was a lot of gaming tournaments happening.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.720]   They had like a guitar hero tournament
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.280]   where people were facing off who could best play the game,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.560]   as well as FPS, think Counter Strike,
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.760]   and a couple of 360 and PS3 games as well.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.960]   What was your favorite thing they're done?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.480]   You're only there an hour, I understand.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   So you're probably pretty much stuck by the Howard
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.800]   and Angelina's guys too.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.800]   I talked to Uma there.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.440]   Uma was there.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.800]   Uma Thurman.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.600]   You're back in the corner.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.960]   Oh, Uma, that's the--
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.640]   Uma's the $500 VoIP device.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.280]   Right, right.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.880]   And you know, that was pretty interesting, really.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.720]   I had a chance to talk to them and ask them about it.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.040]   And you know, they're sending me something this week,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.480]   and it looks somewhat promising.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.520]   It looked pretty good.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.880]   They have a really clever-- I think clever rollout,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.360]   which is that you get to be a free one.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.520]   Is it Uma, you know, beta?
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.920]   I don't know how they choose you.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.720]   Somehow some lucky thing you get a free one.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.280]   I've heard from a number of people who got free ones.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.480]   But what they're doing by doing that
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.600]   is seeding this peer-to-peer voice over the internet network.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.320]   Because they need to have a lot of Uma's out there
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.360]   before the thing works, I would imagine.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.320]   Right, and they also have E9-1-1 running on it.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.760]   So--
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   Really?
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.240]   Now, is that a requirement these days?
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.200]   I thought the FCC said, if you're going to do VoIP,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.480]   you have to have E9-1-1.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.160]   It might be.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.640]   I don't know.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.760]   I mean, she was making a big deal about it when she told me.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.040]   So--
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.440]   Yeah, well, that's an issue for people.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.960]   Because they get VoIP, and then what they don't understand
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.880]   is they take-- they get rid of their landline,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.060]   and then you call 911, and they're
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.440]   9-1-1 has to say, well, where the hell are you?
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.360]   Right, yeah.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.600]   They could send an ambulance to North Carolina,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.400]   and you're Virginia.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.440]   That's not going to help that much.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.560]   So what would you think Uma's for real, Don?
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.040]   You know, I can't tell you until I actually play with it.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.240]   But from what I heard, it sounded somewhat promising.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.560]   I mean--
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.880]   The thing that's scary for people is that $500 outlay--
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.240]   yeah, sure, you get lifetime VoIP,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.000]   but what does lifetime mean for a company like Uma?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.440]   Who's life?
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.680]   The five years it's around, right?
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.040]   Right.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.880]   I don't know.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.040]   I mean, I really want to try it out.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.480]   That's why when I saw it, I said,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.880]   you know, this is something I might want to check out
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.800]   and see what happens.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.000]   But you never know.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.120]   You never really know.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.720]   How about you, Roger?
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.200]   Did you play with Uma?
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.160]   No, I was playing with Palm Centro.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.760]   Oh, the Centro?
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.520]   That's-- it was announced at Digital Life.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.840]   And I mean, if they can actually get it,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.920]   and after the 90-day exclusivity with Sprint,
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.000]   and they can get it out as $100 smartphone,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.800]   that would be awesome, like, you know, unlocked and all that.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.400]   How different is it from a Triya?
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.240]   From my understanding, this is what they were telling me,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.680]   is Cent has all the same functionality,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.800]   except that it is a different form factor,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.080]   and it's kind of skewered toward people
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   who would otherwise pick up like a BlackBerry Pearl,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.800]   or another kind of slim and small smartphone-
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.120]   Right.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   -style device. -But it does have a real keyboard
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.000]   that Triya has to be more--
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.280]   It does have a-- it's smaller, though.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.520]   It's not as wide.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.680]   It's a full-quirty, but the keys are smaller
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.040]   in order to fit the form factor.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.200]   But the real point is it's 99 bucks.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.440]   Yes.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.320]   -It was nice. -It was--
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.360]   -It was-- -Yes.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.040]   Did you type on it, Don?
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.840]   Just a little bit, not too much.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.040]   I think they had it out on a little table there,
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.120]   and I got to play with it for, you know, five, ten seconds,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.560]   after three people were flocking to it, but it was nice.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.000]   I was actually quite surprised, because I'm so used to--
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.240]   I have a BlackBerry Pearl, and I'm so used to typing
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.520]   the same key, like, three times--
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.160]   Right.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.400]   --to get, like, the letter I want.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.440]   And even though I've never actually used that--
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.680]   or that QWERTY thumbboard on the central,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.160]   I got pretty good at it after a couple of minutes.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.400]   So I was able to, you know, do an IM to someone else
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.280]   without too much trouble.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.560]   You know, occasionally, a stray letter,
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.680]   or an earned space would come in, but not that bad.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.440]   And for 100 bucks, you know, hey, I ditched my Pearl--
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.400]   Stop.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   It's also a Palm-based device you can put it up
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.920]   on absent to.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.040]   If all the-- for my understanding,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.080]   or for what they explain to me, any existing trio--
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.160]   or trio, trio--
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.600]   application that installs on a trio
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.240]   will install on the central.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.760]   Wow.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.880]   And we know about screen resolution.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.720]   It's a lot smaller.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.680]   It can't be the same resolution.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.440]   That I don't remember.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.440]   But it wasn't too bad.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.800]   It is definitely smaller.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.640]   I mean, you are dealing with a smaller--
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.200]   I was state to deal with.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.280]   But, you know, if you're like one of those people
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.320]   that need a smartphone but don't necessarily
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.400]   need a big bulky calculator-sized device,
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.520]   that's not a bad choice.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.240]   Well, especially in 100 bucks, it's kind of got a low barrier
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.720]   to entry.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.200]   I mean--
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.080]   Well, I think it's because Palm is getting their butts
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.360]   whooped.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   And they need--
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.040]   I think--
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.080]   Well, for me--
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.760]   I thought the trio was like the smartphone.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.600]   It was the smartphone, but everyone else has been catching.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.520]   I mean, people laugh at Microsoft's mobile OS.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.400]   But there's a lot of phones out there that use it.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:06.900]   Right.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.160]   You can't go on the glass.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   And the mobile--
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.320]   Who's going to--
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.640]   What cell phone company will offer the central?
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.200]   Sprint for the first 90 days.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.800]   Oh, that's hard.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.440]   And then after that.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.880]   But currently, they didn't have a GSM version.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.720]   They only had the CDMA.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.480]   So I'm not sure if they're going to release a GSM.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.400]   Do you think that Apple really has kind of offered an opening
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   into the cell market for companies
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.320]   by charging so much for its iPhone,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.080]   by requiring a two-year sign up with AT&T?
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.840]   Seems like this is an opportunity for companies
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.920]   like Palm to come up with a $100 phone that isn't just Sprint,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.160]   that does most of what the iPhone does.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.120]   Well, that was one of the things they were
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.320]   towning with the central, is that the touchscreen,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.880]   while it isn't as intuitive as the Apple version,
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.920]   you can do.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.560]   You can drag-- they had Google Maps on there.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.280]   The mobile version, you could use your finger,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.920]   and you could scroll and move the map across.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   I mean, that's what--
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.800]   And third-party apps.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.240]   You can add third-party apps for crying out loud.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.360]   Well, the screen is 320 by 320,
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.600]   which is the standard trio screen resolution.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.200]   So it's the same that way.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.960]   It's got camera, micro SD card, buttons all over it.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.560]   I'm a major trio guy.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.920]   I mean, I've got mine with me wherever I am.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.680]   I just love it.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.760]   He keeps it where the sun don't shine.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.560]   This looks very nice, because we're
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.120]   talking about a much less expensive solution.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.440]   And EVDO, the reason I moved from--
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.920]   Oh, yes.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.400]   I was trying to use--
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.720]   I have my BlackBerry as a Bluetooth modem for my MacBook.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.400]   So when I'm at the airport, I don't have to pay
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.400]   their $14 fee to use their Wi-Fi.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.880]   And it's like, SFO, the connection was all right.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.520]   It was like $56K.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.600]   But when I was over in the JFK, I was getting
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.520]   ridiculously low connections.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.360]   Is that Verizon or Sprint?
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.160]   No, it's AT&T.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.600]   Oh, AT&T.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.160]   Right.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.800]   And that's the problem is that right now, the edge
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.040]   technology just--
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.840]   It's about a quarter of the speed of what Sprint and Verizon
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.200]   can do with EVDO.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.320]   And so this-- it doesn't say that it's got Bluetooth.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.120]   I don't see that here.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.960]   But the one point--
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.360]   I think it does have Bluetooth.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.720]   How could you?
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.760]   I think it does.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.920]   Did they mention Bluetooth?
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.720]   Because of that--
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.120]   I was following it.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.200]   Didn't have Bluetooth these days.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.280]   I was thinking.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.680]   Especially as soon as I saw it, the first thing I thought
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.280]   was this is ideal for your young professional just out
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.400]   of college.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.120]   And in a way, I think Apple almost missed the boat on it
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.200]   because at $99, I'm 22 years old.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.240]   I'm getting out of school.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.800]   I mean, and I'm going to the business world.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.200]   This is a perfect, this is ideal.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.720]   Be really--
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.520]   Yeah, interesting if AT&T starts selling this.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.360]   Yeah, I'd say so.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.640]   I mean, they need to come out with a GSM.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.040]   Right.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.520]   Well, you know how hard is that to do?
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.800]   I mean, there are GSM trios, aren't they?
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.120]   Yeah, of course.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.600]   I think there's one, right?
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.200]   It's a pretty phone.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.880]   I have to say--
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.360]   750, I think.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.640]   It looks pretty.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.240]   Yeah, it is.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.360]   It's a nice phone.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.440]   And you know, they hope--
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:12.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.600]   Go ahead.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.520]   And cheap?
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.440]   Go ahead, Roger.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:16.760]   Oh, no.
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.320]   Yeah, one of the points they wanted to make
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.760]   was they wanted to go after the non-traditional--
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.120]   Right.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.280]   --trail by the guys who don't want a big--
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.120]   again, a big bulky PDA slash cell phone.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.120]   I talk to a lot of normal people, not business people.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.640]   And there really is a move toward the smartphone.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.600]   People want at least calendar and address book
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.320]   information in their phone.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.640]   I think that everybody kind of wants that functionality.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.280]   More and more people are using the phone to text and email.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.920]   And unless you're 18, SMS via a standard phone keypad
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.120]   is just hard to use.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.480]   These are ridiculous.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.720]   And it's kind of funny because in Japan,
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.680]   where is the North America and Europe,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.320]   the PC is kind of the main--
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:57.960]   Right.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.200]   --new medium gadget.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.880]   It's the cell phone in Japan.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.400]   Because people set up parties, they set up invites.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.360]   They do everything through their cell phone.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.160]   And people are kind of wanting that here.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.200]   Because instead of looking around a notebook,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.880]   if you just want to get directions or your email,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.840]   why not just keep it on your phone, which is--
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.800]   you pop it in and out of your pocket.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.960]   You pop it open, you turn it on.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.680]   You find out where the best restaurant is
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.760]   and your immediate location, movie times.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.800]   Some of you that you don't have to pull out a notebook for,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.640]   open up, wait for it to boot.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.320]   Find a Wi-Fi connection and start typing.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.400]   So was Palm one of the few companies
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   that made announcements at Digital Home?
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.560]   That's not a kind of traditional place
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.280]   to make product announcements.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   Not in my experience, of course, it's only--
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.920]   I think this is a third year digital life has been running.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.600]   So it's not like there's a huge--
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.040]   It's not a CES.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.840]   But hey, here, what a great chance
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.320]   to put this thing in front of real people in a real environment.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.960]   And good timing for launching this phone
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.560]   is the iPhone stumbles.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.120]   Yeah, it's kind of funny because Devorak mentioned that earlier.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.160]   It would be a boondoggle for Apple.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.360]   It would just be kind of a ball machine.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:08.920]   It might have been right.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.240]   We're going to get to that in just a second.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.160]   But before we do, I do want to talk about Don's blog post
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.280]   at zenet.com.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.400]   Why Microsoft must abandon Vista.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.560]   Don, is it a sinking ship?
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.680]   Oh, you know, it's funny.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.880]   I got an email from a few readers over the past couple weeks.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.840]   And they said to me, have you been using Vista?
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.240]   This is awful.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.880]   So I stopped using my Mac for a while.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.680]   And I said, I'm going to use Vista for the next two weeks
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.200]   and just see what happens.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.440]   And after using it, I just think it's abysmal.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:38.800]   It's just--
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.240]   Awful how?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.560]   What is wrong with Vista?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.600]   In that-- first off, the thing that really annoys me
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   is the user access control.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.440]   Let's say I am installing a Microsoft certified update.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.120]   Why should I be asked if this is what I want to do
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.200]   or this is OK, this could hurt your computer, everything else?
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.440]   When it's from Microsoft--
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.080]   Hold on just a second.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.640]   I'm going to add Patrick Norton.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.480]   I see he just popped on.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.400]   And I want him to be part of this.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.320]   Let's see how good my--
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.400]   Patrick's sixth sound is.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   Hello, Patrick.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   Hey, man.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.280]   Oh, he's sound pretty good.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.320]   He's like, you're on the phone.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.160]   It's a miracle.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.360]   Are you at the hospital, Patrick?
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.640]   I'm not at the hospital yet.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.040]   Is that a secret?
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.680]   Should I not mention this or do people know?
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.400]   People know, but I tend not to talk about it too much.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.280]   We won't mention it.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.560]   It's a complete secret.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.920]   Patrick's got a hernia, and he doesn't want anybody
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.600]   to know about it.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.320]   But we'll let you know in that process.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.200]   It's OK.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.640]   My wife is just edged over to 38 weeks
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.480]   and is looking forward to having a child.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.560]   You've got two more weeks before of marital bliss,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.520]   and then it's daddy this, daddy that.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.960]   Actually, I think it's more of a screaming bundle of needs.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.440]   The language comes later from what I've been told.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.400]   Patrick, you're going to be such a great dad.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.840]   I can't wait to see you.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.320]   Patrick, let me tell you who's here.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.560]   You see Roger Chang, of course.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.160]   Your old cohort.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.160]   On dl.tv.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.520]   And Steve Gibson.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.360]   You may not have--
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.160]   Don Rizinger.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.080]   He's a freelance journalist.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.360]   He's written a lot for CNET and ZD.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.960]   You might have run into him in ZD.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.480]   And we're talking about his article on the CNET Blogs
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:20.080]   this week, why Microsoft must abandon Vista to save itself?
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.520]   You know, I'm not allowed to curse on this show,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.640]   but I'd like to say brilliant, delete,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.560]   ex-lative column.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.840]   I actually-- I stumbled across that in an IRS feed.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.920]   I read the entire thing of it.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.120]   And yeah, Vista's a mess, a wreck, a pathetic joke,
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.240]   in a waste of our time.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.080]   I'm almost, but not quite as maliciously
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.280]   configured as Windows anymore.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.560]   Actually, you know, not at all.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   Vista's just a miserable failure, and me
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.440]   with a delete, explative money graph.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.840]   Yeah, at least-- I mean, Microsoft
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.600]   spent five years building this.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.960]   Don had started before we brought you in.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.920]   Don had started describing why he thinks Vista is bad.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.920]   You said the user access control is part of the problem.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.760]   You were installing a Microsoft certified what?
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.080]   I just saw it as an update.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.160]   And it asked me if this is OK, then it goes through another four
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.840]   or five boxes, pops up saying this.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.960]   I said, did you want to do this?
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.040]   Did you want to do that?
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.360]   You know, what it is, it's just like pop up fatigue.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.200]   And I just start clicking.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.640]   And don't we have to do this to keep
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.440]   protect users from themselves?
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.520]   You know what I think is on Mac?
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.880]   It happens on Mac and whatever else.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.560]   But at least on a Mac, I could put in my password.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.680]   So I actually know what I'm doing.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.720]   I actually know, OK, I actually can stop and think,
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.360]   OK, this is something I wanted to do.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.880]   But on Vista, I just want to click away.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.480]   I just not going to stop clicking until it's over.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.000]   And I just--
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.320]   Go ahead.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.840]   And I know it's 10, I think, at the most, it's what?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.480]   Two.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.360]   You get like, if you download a disk image,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.720]   it asks you that this could be hazardous.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.240]   Do you want to do it?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.600]   Yes.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.560]   And if you install something, again, you just type in your password.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.680]   No, I should say for security, I run both Vista and OS 10
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.560]   in limited user mode.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.640]   I don't run as administrator.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.240]   So it does ask me for my password on Vista.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.920]   It won't if you're an administrator,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.160]   except for a few things.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.280]   And on OS 10, it does ask me for my password.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.000]   But you're right.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.800]   I don't know what it is.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.720]   But for some reason, it's not as annoying on the Mac
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.080]   as it is on Windows.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.120]   OK.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.160]   Go ahead, Don.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.800]   I don't know.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.200]   I don't find it that annoying.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.160]   But they get in the longest I've managed to run Vista
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.320]   before wiping the system and reinstalling XP
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.320]   is about two weeks.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.600]   You know who we're not hearing from?
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.440]   Steve Gibson.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.520]   He's a Windows guy.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.760]   Steve, you-- and also a security guy, I should point out.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.400]   You and I have talked a lot about UAC,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.880]   and do believe UAC is a major security improvement.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.080]   But what about this issue of user fatigue?
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:40.320]   Well, UAC could be engineered to work much better than it does.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.880]   What's happening is that applications
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.080]   are not taking-- essentially, they're not
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.960]   becoming Vista-aware.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.280]   And an application that is Vista-aware
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.680]   can dramatically minimize all of these pop-ups.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.240]   I wrote "Secureable," my little piece of freeware,
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.160]   for the Vista environment.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:05.480]   And it notifies you up front once that you
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.920]   need to get permission.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.080]   And then what it does is essentially,
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.280]   it operates with Vista with the knowledge
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.160]   that it may be running in Vista in order to minimize that.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.280]   And if an application doesn't do that,
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.000]   then essentially it's up to the operating system
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.080]   to watch what the application does step by step.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.440]   And it may be popping up those dialogues all the time.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.640]   Well, isn't that the problem, in general, with Vista,
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.360]   just that applications and hardware aren't really yet Vista-aware?
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.800]   I mean, Don, it's not--
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.000]   Microsoft's fault that manufacturers haven't
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.360]   made their stuff Vista-aware, is it?
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.760]   Yeah, but that's the problem.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.480]   I mean, I think that Microsoft is--
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.840]   they're a victim of themselves in that they have so many programs
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.360]   running on it.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.640]   It's not a closed environment.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.480]   As far as I don't like a closed environment,
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   as you know on an iPhone.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.000]   But to some extent, there's a point
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.760]   where you need to be a somewhat closed
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.200]   and have some exercise, some control over.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.120]   And right now, I mean, it's everywhere.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.560]   I mean, everything's coming from everywhere.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.880]   And there's so hard to control that--
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.240]   I mean, just impossible.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.680]   Why do you hate Vista so much, Patrick?
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.120]   The driver problems, once the applications they use
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.360]   regulate, weren't working on it.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.720]   My primary machine at home doesn't
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.400]   have a powerful enough graphics system to run Vista
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.880]   without either turning off the eye candy or filling up
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.480]   performance.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.720]   I mean, I always--
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.120]   Well, you know, I think what's
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.440]   behind this for all of us is that it's really just
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.080]   a bunch of eye candy.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.640]   It doesn't fundamentally do a lot more for us than XP did.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.400]   And we're paying a huge price for what is essentially
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.480]   round-cornered windows and a fancier UI.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.000]   I mean, that's all it really is.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.560]   You make that point down with the many SKUs
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.080]   and the additional 160 bucks for Ultimate, which is--
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.560]   Go ahead, Roger.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.880]   Oh, no, I think that was the worst mistake they did.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.240]   That's crazy.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.280]   I mean--
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.400]   How many versions of OS 10 are there?
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.360]   I mean, other than--
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.440]   I think a seven or something.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.600]   But other than a server, you just--
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.520]   the copy you get, there's no Ultimate,
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.320]   there's no denuded media version,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.720]   there's no simple addition.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.360]   It's just one.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.360]   You buy it and it's the same one across the board
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.680]   and you update it.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.440]   But Don, what should Microsoft do?
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.160]   Should they just say, oh, we made a mistake and pull it back?
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.400]   It's surely you don't expect it to be right.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   No, that's the thing.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.680]   It's impossible now because all they're doing right now
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.480]   is touting their 60 million sold and everything else.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.040]   But more than anything, they're controlled, to some extent,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   by the delves and the HPs of the world who are saying,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.520]   let's go back to XP and let's see what we can do here.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.720]   Well, in fact, that's what happened this week, Microsoft,
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.560]   which had planned to pull Vista from the shelves in January.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.600]   He said, nah, we're going to keep selling it to June.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.320]   That's an omission, isn't it, for Microsoft
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.320]   that it's not going well?
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.080]   Absolutely.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   I mean, if--
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.520]   Have they said how well it's selling?
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.200]   Is it not selling well?
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.320]   I think they're touting it as 60 million sold
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.120]   and everything else.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.000]   But more than anything, if the business world is saying no
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.720]   and you have, like I said, the delves and HPs
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.840]   in the world telling you no, there's not much they can do
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.920]   in terms of they really rely on those companies
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.200]   and they rely on businesses to sell software.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.760]   And if they can't have those behind them, they're in trouble.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.560]   Do people move to Ubuntu?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.520]   Do they move to Mac?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.840]   What do people do?
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.360]   In my mind, if you're the average user, home user,
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.720]   you just move straight to Mac.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.760]   And you can send your emails to John.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.080]   No, you know what, Don, I'm right.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.400]   But I have been saying this on the radio show for some time.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:48.920]   And really, my mantra has become
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.200]   Windows for Business, Mac for Home.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.800]   Absolutely.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.920]   It seems sensible.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.240]   I mean, there are certainly exceptions.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.160]   If you're a hardcore gamer, obviously, you have to go with
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.200]   Windows, but even a hardcore gamer, many of them
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.280]   don't like Vista so much.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.640]   There's all sorts of video issues with Vista.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.240]   Well, I think most of those videos should be worked up
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.000]   by next year.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.480]   But--
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.160]   Well, wait a minute, though.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.880]   This is interesting.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.320]   Vista went to manufacture.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.920]   The gold came out a year ago.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.480]   We've had it for a year.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.280]   How long is it going to take?
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.720]   Well, how long did it take for Windows 95 and Windows 98?
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:23.920]   Obviously not as long.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.520]   A year seems a long time.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.800]   I mean, if I'm a video card company, why can't it--
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.320]   why does it take me at 12 months to figure out how to get it?
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.040]   But who do you also?
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.640]   You're going to sell it to.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.320]   I mean, what other market are you going to be able to say,
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.760]   hey, why don't you buy this new $600 amazing graphics card
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.080]   because you can get 10 frames more in your Quake Wars.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.000]   I have to say, I'm playing BioShock on Vista
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.200]   with a crossfire system.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.240]   And it works.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.120]   I did have to update the drivers before it worked.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:50.680]   But it works.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.360]   And it works well.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.640]   And it looks good.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.440]   I'm not sure it works better than it would on XP.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.720]   Should people stay with XP?
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.760]   It seems like that's the consensus here.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.280]   Is Steve Gibson, do you think people should stick with XP?
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.120]   Yeah, I really do.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.040]   I mean, it is the case-- and we've
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.720]   talked about this on security now--
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:10.640]   that there's a substantial advancement in security,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.840]   but it comes at a tremendous expense in terms of user
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.440]   convenience.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.800]   Well, especially if you have a lot of legacy stuff.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.960]   If you're starting from scratch--
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.840]   Yep.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.360]   Yep.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.160]   Maybe it's not such a bad thing.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.760]   My question is this.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.480]   And it's been happening for years now.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.320]   But what drives Microsoft and Apple, besides the profits
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.560]   or whatever, to just update these new operating systems
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.120]   every five years or so?
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.800]   I mean, why can't we just stick with it--
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.960]   let's just say XP, right?
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.600]   I mean, we have issues with XP, but at least it's
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.160]   a known quantity at this point.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.480]   We stick with the operating system.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.360]   We update it.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.880]   Maybe we sell some upgrades every few years.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.320]   But why do we need all these constant updates?
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.920]   And we have to deal with all these driver issues.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.360]   I know.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:52.840]   I know.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.680]   I know.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.880]   Patrick Norton, for 50--
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.440]   Look at the revenue model.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.520]   Well, no, it's the maximize shareholder revenue.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.680]   It's not all that good for the customers.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   What's good for the stock price on Wall Street?
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.760]   They do have a fiduciary--
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.200]   --probably with every publicly held company.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.600]   Although, if Dvorak were here--
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.080]   Or maybe I should be.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.240]   --if Dvorak were here, he would point out
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.000]   that Microsoft's stock has just been flat for years now.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.160]   Well, flat is a lot better than dropping.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.720]   OK, good point.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.480]   Well, at least it's not losing money.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.160]   Flat and high, though.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.280]   Yeah, I guess relatively high.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.280]   It depends how long you've had it.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.400]   It hasn't gone up if you bought it in the last couple of years,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:26.720]   hasn't.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.320]   I don't think so.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.200]   Certainly not like Google stock or Apple stock.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.720]   All right, Google stock is a total anomaly.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.880]   It just keeps going up.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.680]   In fact, Apple stock went up a lot this week.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.800]   I think the market liked it when Apple slapped
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.320]   around iPhone users.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.960]   This is the scenario.
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   That's what we like to see as a business
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.880]   protecting its ability to generate revenue,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   no matter what the customers have paid too much
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.880]   for the original release of the product want to do it.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.720]   But isn't that what happens when you go public
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.760]   and you have to start looking quarter to quarter revenues?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.440]   Don't you start looking at, well, we're protecting our revenue.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.600]   We're protecting our partnership with AT&T.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.640]   Yeah, in the long run, customers may learn to hate us.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.680]   But at least right now, we're protecting our revenue.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.000]   That's--
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.880]   Well, this is also the company that's--
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.280]   let's not confuse ourselves.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.560]   Apple's been willing to write off
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.640]   all previous generations of hardware
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.120]   with a major operating or system release every three years.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.480]   But that actually is one of the biggest success.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.680]   That's one of the things Microsoft has not been able to do.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.400]   And one of the reasons why Vista is such a--
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   a clue, just because it's got all this crap hanging off of it.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.800]   So let's talk about what happened with the iPhone.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   Essentially, the iPhone came out.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.600]   No third party applications locked into AT&T.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   Didn't take long for the user community to figure out
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.080]   how to put third party applications.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.880]   There's actually a pretty good variety now.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.320]   Nothing earth shattering, but some pretty good stuff.
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.880]   Navazon, which is a global positioning system that
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.960]   uses cell towers instead of GPS chips,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.640]   claims they've had 80,000 downloads.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.560]   There's some gaming.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.760]   And Apple, for some reason, has never
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.120]   put a game on this obviously great gaming platform.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.040]   So third party apps.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.840]   That was the first step.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.360]   The second step was unlocking it.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.680]   And just the last three weeks, there
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:12.960]   have been three different ways to unlock it.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.600]   Finally, an open source free way to unlock it
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   that worked quite well.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.640]   I'm sitting in front of a T-Mobile based iPhone right now,
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   running a lot of cool apps.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.160]   Apple announces last week says, guys, got to warn you,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.680]   those apps could be a little-- they could be dangerous.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.320]   We can't promise you that any updates that come out
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.360]   won't hurt your phone.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.120]   Lo and behold, on Friday, 1.1.1 comes out
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.000]   and removes all the third party apps, if that's all you've done.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.880]   Removes the ability to add third party apps,
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.760]   if that's all you've done.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.160]   But if you've unlocked it, it turns it
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.400]   into a piece of--
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.240]   Paperweight.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.040]   A paperweight.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.840]   A brick.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.880]   It's funny you should bring this up.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.000]   I happen to have a working hacked iPhone.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.880]   I want to point that out.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.320]   I did not apply the update.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.800]   I just bought DVD John's old iPhone.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.960]   Really?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.880]   Now, did you get him an autograph?
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.760]   And I'd frame that.
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.840]   I got to talk to him for like 20 minutes, half an hour.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.880]   Oh, no need.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.080]   More than enough reward.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.720]   Is that going to be on Techzilla?
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.960]   No, no.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.760]   He put on a blog that he was selling it,
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.600]   and I made an offer.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.520]   He accepted it.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.200]   And this is the one he used to write up
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   the iPhone Independence Day thing.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.000]   If there is--
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.760]   But I was laughing because like--
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.160]   Go ahead.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.080]   If there's ever a Smithsonian for hackers,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.800]   that phone belongs in it.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.880]   No, he belongs in it.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.360]   But the--
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.600]   I was just laughing because like the day I picked it up
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.920]   was like the day the 1.1 release came out.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.640]   And I'm like, I think I'm going to take iBrick
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.920]   and restore it to the 1.0.2 before I activate this.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.080]   So you actually removed all the hacks
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.720]   and went back to the original and then applied the update?
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.560]   I'm actually in the process of doing that right now.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.120]   I downloaded everything and set it up
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.000]   and then found out none of the tools I needed
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.240]   would run on OS 10.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.120]   Right.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.480]   I have one that's hacked.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.360]   And I love the third party apps.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.360]   I love the fact that--
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.040]   They're awesome.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.760]   I mean, I think that it really opens up the platform.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.240]   Here's the question I have for the panel.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.000]   And I don't know--
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.080]   by the way, as we record this, the iPhone dev team
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.120]   says they found a way to roll it back.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.840]   But pretty much it looks like Apple forced an update--
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.560]   or pushed an update.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.160]   It didn't force it.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.000]   You could turn it down.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   But pushed an update that intentionally turned the phone
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.320]   into a paperweight.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.080]   My question is, was it technically necessary?
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.960]   Is this punitive on Apple's part?
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   Or is this something they just--
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.680]   they had no choice.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.480]   They warned you look.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.240]   We're going to update it.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.440]   It's probably going to break things.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.640]   Please don't apply it.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.360]   Is Apple a bad guy, in other words?
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.240]   I think if it wasn't punitive, they wouldn't--
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   if it wasn't punitive, they wouldn't have unleashed the warning.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.200]   They didn't have to do this is what you're saying.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.960]   But they did.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.880]   Anybody think that it wasn't punitive?
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.720]   That it was just an accident or not an accident?
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.680]   No, I don't think it's an accident.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.400]   But I think it was more of an issue.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.320]   You think it was unavoidable?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.920]   It was like, we're going to do these updates.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.160]   And this is what we have in mind when we do these updates.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.320]   And this is the hard work firm or spec we're looking at.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.760]   If you somehow change that, doing whatever,
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.880]   we can't guarantee you nothing bad's
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.400]   going to happen to your phone.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.360]   I would have to say from a technology standpoint,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.040]   we couldn't be definitive about whether this was deliberate
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.520]   on their part or it was an innocent side effect of them
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.320]   changing much of things.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.960]   You'd have to know how the hacks worked
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.640]   and how they were getting around.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.080]   Well, I could tell you how the hacks worked.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.040]   And I could tell you where you might have problems.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.920]   In order to unlock the phone, you
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.520]   have to put new firmware on the modem.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.880]   And then you have to give some commands to the modem
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.640]   to say, OK, now you can run with any carrier.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.400]   So now iPhone dev team, by the way, in these guys--
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.760]   It's entirely reasonable then that that would get flushed away
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.240]   in a benign update.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.160]   Right.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.200]   Or a benign update that didn't reflash the firmware
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.560]   with the correct version would then cause a problem.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.560]   The iPhone dev wiki, the iPhone dev team,
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.720]   people think that it was intentional, that was punitive,
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:15.360]   that Apple was slapping around people who would
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.560]   dare to hack their phone.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.480]   If that's the case, I have to say Apple
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.080]   has way overcept the line.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.480]   Absolutely.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.400]   No one thing-- no one annoyed me the most.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.680]   Well, Apple as a friend to consumers or Apple
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.120]   as a ongoing business that needs to have revenue.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.160]   That's two different apples, I understand.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.440]   But--
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.120]   Well, it's not one single app.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.520]   Well, and we can talk long term, is it bad for--
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.360]   if you slap your consumers around in the long term,
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.760]   I don't think that's such a good thing either.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.480]   It might defend your relationship with AT&T.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.720]   And contractually, they probably had to.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.080]   Anyway, Don, you were saying, you
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.600]   think this is punitive that Apple stepped overcept the line?
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.080]   I mean, at what point are--
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.240]   I've been hearing this number.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.040]   The only 2% of the people hacked their iPhones,
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.840]   only 2% of the people unlocked their iPhones.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.800]   But what-- OK, if that's 2%, and that's 2% of the people
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.280]   who act as the tech guru for families
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.840]   and say, when someone comes to them,
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.280]   OK, which computer should I buy?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.040]   If this pisses them off, they're not going to say max anymore.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.000]   I mean, I think they're in significant danger
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.520]   of ostracizing their core following.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.080]   And if that happens, boy, oh boy, I don't know.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.560]   I mean, you know, the thing that really annoyed me the most
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.280]   though, when it happened, I was at app tapping,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.120]   all that stuff on there.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.720]   And you guys ever play tap tap revolution?
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.840]   Oh, god.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.440]   When that was gone, I'm telling you,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.560]   I don't know what to do with myself.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.240]   Well, that's my point.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.440]   This phone is a great platform for gaming.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.920]   Why Apple hasn't put games on it as beyond me.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.720]   But why--
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.600]   Because Steve Jobs doesn't like games.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.720]   I guess not.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.240]   Well, I mean, the last electronics company
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.600]   that tried to put out a portable game device
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   and then went up against it.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.280]   Every smartphone has games on it though, Roger.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.160]   They may not be great games.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.720]   Well, it's interesting because Sony's done the same thing.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:57.120]   There's a huge underground homebrew community
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.360]   for the Sony PSP.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.920]   And every update, Sony's tried to stamp out--
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.320]   firmware update has tried to stamp out all the loopholes,
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:04.800]   all the--
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.640]   And do they brick act?
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.880]   But have they brick the PSP?
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.080]   In one case, early on, supposedly it would if you hacked it.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.040]   And it would turn your PSP into a brick.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.280]   However, there was a workaround for--
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.320]   They reversed the hackers have always
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.840]   been able to reverse it.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.440]   But it was one of the things--
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.600]   like Patrick mentioned, I mean, they are a business.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.800]   They're in it to make money.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.920]   And you know--
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.080]   But make money.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.000]   As much as Don says that you're
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.520]   going to remove some of those critical voices that
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.080]   support the company.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.040]   I mean, Apple's trying to transition away from just purely
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.920]   tech-con to a lifestyle company.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.440]   That's where they want famous faces with their products.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.840]   They want to be the next Sony.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.960]   Oh, that's a good model.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.400]   I think they want to be associated
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.160]   with a kind of lifestyle.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:00.200]   Why do shows on VH1 and MTV that feature a lot of teenage kids
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.600]   all have designer--
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.200]   Here's my problem.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.480]   I think that people nowadays are smart enough.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.080]   Many people are smart enough and savvy enough
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.880]   to open platforms that they can modify.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.400]   And even if you put out a closed platform, like the PSP
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.920]   or the iPhone, people are going to try to modify it.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.760]   And the problem is, once you do a deal,
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.000]   like you've done, say, with AT&T, where
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.560]   you're forced to slap these guys around,
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.040]   I think you go down this slippery slope, where all of a sudden
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.440]   you look like the evil empire.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.280]   And I think--
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.840]   Patrick, isn't this in the long run bad for business?
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.000]   Well, I mean, here's a $64,000 question.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.160]   I remember talking to Dell 10 years ago,
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.280]   and they said the vast minority of people
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.320]   who bought Dell machines.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.360]   And this is when most of the people buying Dell
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.160]   were experts and enthusiasts and gamers and hackers.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.760]   Never ever opened up the case and modified the system.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.240]   So unless you're a boutique or a niche company,
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.000]   you're trying to target everyone or the largest swath
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.920]   of people out there.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.320]   And I don't think Apple's been beating around its users
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.120]   for years.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.120]   I use it in an analogy.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:06.600]   I'm a blog.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.520]   I'd like you guys to punch a hole in this.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.080]   Here's my analogy.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.280]   You decide you want to sell a cow to me.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.760]   I want to buy your cow.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.640]   And you say, OK, you can buy this cow,
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.680]   but I want you to know this cow is for making cheese.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.040]   And if you use it for anything else,
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.400]   that's a violation of our agreement.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.760]   Furthermore, I'm going to let you
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.560]   graze this cow on this particular plot of land.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.200]   But you've got to make cheese with the cow.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.320]   So I buy the cow, I graze them on the plot of land.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.800]   OK, deal, I made that deal.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.520]   But a little later down the road, I say, you know what?
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.360]   I just want some milk.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.120]   I don't want no cheese.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.440]   And I stop making cheese.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.600]   You come over and you shoot the cow.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.320]   See, I think your recourse is, OK, you can't graze on my land
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:51.720]   anymore.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.160]   OK, I'm not going to do business with you.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.120]   You don't get to kill my cow.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:55.720]   No, no.
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.760]   I mean, that's more along the lines of, well, you know,
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.800]   along with the cow, you get a yearly vaccination.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.720]   And you know, if you do anything with the cow
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.960]   that I told you not to do and I come over to vaccinate it,
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.920]   it falls dead.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.080]   Oh, well, I told you--
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:08.800]   Yeah, OK, good.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.200]   All right, that's a good extension.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.480]   So you decided to put a little poison in the vaccine
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.600]   because I made milk.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.520]   Isn't that wrong?
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.800]   I mean, I'd like the noble attempt
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.400]   to bring the agrarian cred to you.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.240]   A bowline.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   The commons.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.280]   The bowline element touches me deeply
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.360]   in my Midwestern soul.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.920]   But the truth of it is, this is the 21st century.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.560]   We live in a country where the Digital Millennium Copyright
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.680]   Act was protected to protect businesses from consumers.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.280]   We could say that Apple has been actually generous
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.600]   if they haven't sent the--
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.400]   Generous!
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.520]   And no, no, no, no, no, hold on.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.520]   I haven't--
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.240]   Hold on.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.160]   I haven't--
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:55.440]   If you've ever seen Apple cease into this lawyer's inaction,
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.960]   they're impressive, maybe even scary.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.320]   Yeah, I might have made a mistake.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.160]   They were trying to declassify--
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.240]   they were trying to make--
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.080]   they tried in the state of California
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.000]   to shut down the Apple secrets in the Mac Roomba blogs.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.520]   Thank you.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.160]   That's true.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.560]   They haven't sued the iPhone dev team or anything.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.160]   Maybe because the iPhone dev team is overseas or they're--
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.160]   they figure out a way to secret themselves away.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.720]   But quite frankly, Apple, if they
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.400]   want to play hardball, can play a particularly talented
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.960]   version of hardball.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.560]   It's major league.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.240]   It's-- they're all closers.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   And they're kind of scary.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.920]   I think they're playing hardball with their customers
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.320]   here, though, pretty good.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.760]   Well, everybody plays hardball with their customers.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.160]   I know.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.360]   But I think brick in the phone is going a little far.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.520]   Well, you know, here's the thing.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   I think they killed my cow, and I don't like it.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.560]   Well, they may have killed your cow,
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.920]   but it's not about your cow.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.720]   It's about the people who are always
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.600]   going to buy a cow to me.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.000]   To me, it's about my cow.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.160]   It's about about--
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.080]   I know that, but Leo, to them, they
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.640]   want to scare off anybody that looks at a cow and think,
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.360]   you know, I think it cheese out of it.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:56.920]   You're right.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.320]   You're right.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.480]   And now millions of Americans that may or may not
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.120]   buy an iPhone, say themselves, if I milk that cow and make
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.440]   cheese, it's going to die.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.360]   And that may be the most--
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.080]   they may never do anything that bricks a phone again
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.320]   with an update.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.080]   But they now have a public perception, a cooling effect,
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.040]   if you will, to borrow one of our favorite phrases
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.200]   from the EFF.
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.240]   The chilling effect, sorry.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   That discourages people from modifying their hardware.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.200]   Don, what do you think?
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:29.200]   You know, I think Patrick makes a good point in that,
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.960]   to some extent, it's a scare tactic that will probably work.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.840]   You know, if I update my iPhone and it doesn't work anymore,
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.400]   what are the chances I'm going to put something on there again
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.960]   and try over?
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.920]   You know, in terms of business, in terms of--
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.920]   I don't care about my--
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.760]   well, I care about my customers at some extent,
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.040]   but I have to care about my profits or my maximize--
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:51.840]   That's what it looks like.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.440]   --like shareholder value.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.440]   Yeah, it looks like profits over customers.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.480]   That's what it looks like.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.200]   Yeah, which is good business.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.600]   I mean, there's no debating net.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.360]   Short term is good business.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.120]   Right, short term.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.320]   In the long term, I don't know.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.840]   If they keep to play in the bully,
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.600]   I don't think there's anything good coming out of this.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.160]   Speaking of bullies, AT&T has a new--
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.360]   this from Boing Boing, a new terms of service
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.760]   for its internet service customers.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.880]   From now on, AT&T can terminate your connection for--
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.480]   this just smacks the same old thing--
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.440]   for quote, "conduct that tends to damage the name or reputation
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.200]   of AT&T or its parents.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.400]   It's a subsidiaries."
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.320]   How does that mean?
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.920]   So it means if you do a blog on your--
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.040]   and that criticizes AT&T, they can cut you off.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.440]   Cut off your internet.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.080]   This is awesome because of AT&T controls
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.240]   that was published on their website.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.840]   They go from being a networking communications company
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.560]   to a publisher that come responsible for everything
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.320]   on their network.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.840]   And then we can sue them into oblivion at the drop of the hat.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.560]   I like it.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.520]   We can make sure they don't have enough money
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.440]   to pay the lobbyists to prevent any effective form
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.080]   of net neutrality.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.920]   You know what they could do?
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.640]   This is brilliant.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:03.480]   You're not making it too.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.600]   I say we support AT&T.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.120]   Let's say we want to hang themselves publicly.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.080]   Yes, sorry.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:08.720]   I got excited.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.480]   Let's say we do a show that talks about AT&T allowing
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.320]   illegal NSA wiretapping.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.880]   And AT&T decides they're going to block from now on any downloads
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:24.480]   from Twit.tv because it's critical of them.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   I mean, that's basically what they're saying, right?
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.480]   Perfect.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.280]   The whole wording too, so vague,
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.960]   tends to damage the name.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.760]   Yeah, what is tends to damage?
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.640]   Oh, the name or reputation?
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.080]   That sounds like a company that's a little scared, frankly.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.960]   Oh, look, you want to talk about a company that hates its customers?
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   We're talking about a company that hates its customers.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.560]   These are the people who put together technical economists,
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.360]   which is one of the most frightening phrases
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.720]   you can ever bring out in public.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.200]   What is it technical about?
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.080]   Who write about how it was effectively.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.480]   Net neutrality is wrong and impossible,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.320]   and everybody has to be on business accounts
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.880]   and upgrading the hardware isn't wrong.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.720]   And by the way, that stuff we sold you
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.960]   isn't really what we're delivering you as long as you want it in like five--
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   you can have your five megabits per second
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.200]   as long as you keep it at five kilobits, chunks or less.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.040]   You know, you want to talk about a company that's
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.800]   living for its shareholders.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.520]   This is it.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.840]   They're bringing that great customer service AT&T
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.320]   has been known for in long distance and cell phones
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.880]   right to the internet.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.360]   Oh, man.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.160]   Yeah, I think this is a perfect example
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.200]   of what happens when you really don't have true competition
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:33.760]   in the market.
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.040]   That's a monopoly talking to this.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:35.560]   Exactly.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.280]   I mean, if there were actually a choice,
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.800]   and people could say, I'm not going to use AT&T,
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.760]   I mean, even over this policy or in consequence
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.480]   of having their account dropped, then AT&T would go--
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:53.760]   we would think a lot more before driving people to somewhere else.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.240]   But if there's nowhere else to go, then I mean, you're really up the creek.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   Well, the next thing about AT&T being a DSL company
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.560]   and the copper for the phone companies
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.480]   had been coming out of a monopoly
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.240]   is they are required to offer access to that last mile of copper.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.920]   So there are some great third party alternatives
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.040]   or second party, whatever you want to call it.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.200]   At least, I don't know about on the East Coast, but on the West Coast,
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.280]   there are half dozen great companies that do DSL that are not AT&T.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.360]   I think if you want an alternative,
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.040]   if the only decent broadband connection in your town is cable
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.880]   and you want an alternative, if you don't have DSL--
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.800]   Then you're stuck.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.320]   Then you're stuck.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:39.960]   That's really the argument in favor of some sort of prohibition
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.720]   of internet discrimination is that we don't really have competition.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.880]   And people always say, well, the free market will solve this
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.600]   because there's competition and you just go to an internet service provider
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.880]   that doesn't prioritize packets.
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.680]   But for most people, there isn't that kind of choice.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.080]   That analogy works great on Capitol Hill
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:00.960]   when you're taking the $80,000 of $80,000.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.040]   $800,000.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.920]   The 80,000 foot view of your state.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.440]   But it doesn't work real well on the local level.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.320]   We talk about cutting off internet service.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.400]   And actually, I want to get a little serious here.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:18.040]   We're just-- this isn't anywhere under the degree of what's going on in Myanmar
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.240]   or Myanmar, where the--
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.560]   Due to the rebellion in Myanmar, the internet's been cut off entirely.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.920]   For a while, we were able to watch what was going on in Myanmar.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.560]   The bloggers were posting and the government realized it,
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.680]   and they just shut off the internet.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:35.840]   Oh.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   Yep.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.280]   [LAUGHS]
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:43.360]   So boy, that really touches you, doesn't it?
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.920]   Government was cracking down on protesters last week.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.520]   Information was getting out.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.440]   Thanks to bloggers.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.120]   A lot of bloggers.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.560]   I thought that was quite interesting.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.440]   Reporters without borders have been following this.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.160]   They say, by cutting internet access, the regime is trying to operate
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.800]   behind closed doors.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.440]   And that's pretty much it.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.720]   No news gets out.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:03.480]   No one knows what's going on inside.
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.480]   And that's the kind of thing, though.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.160]   You do that, boy.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.160]   You're not just cutting off outbound traffic.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.000]   You're cutting off, really, your country from the world.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:14.280]   But that country's always been--
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.400]   --been cut off.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:20.040]   I mean, even with traditional broadcast communications and stuff.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.480]   I mean, most of the images and information
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.040]   were fed into exile groups based in Europe and North America
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:33.240]   that were resending them out to the major news outlets.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.080]   Anyway, we're very lucky here.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.120]   We might talk about AT&T this, and iPhone that,
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   but we do.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.520]   At least we have the basic freedoms to talk about it.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.640]   And so far, nobody's banned the show.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.480]   Click.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.000]   And if you're listening in, I say, I just--
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.520]   I love you.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.200]   I love you guys.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.280]   You're beautiful, OK?
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.920]   AT&T can buy all the ATF jerseys and all the other stuff that
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.520]   has the ATF logo and scratch up the F and put the last tee.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.160]   Oh, you're right.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.320]   It's just natural.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.560]   How long before AT&T does America's phone company video game
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.880]   where you go around and you shoot people who hack your phone?
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.320]   It's kind of creepy because when mob dope got broken up,
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.240]   everyone was, all right, it's finally done.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.600]   You're back, baby.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.040]   We've completely forgotten the last round of recruiting tools
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   for United States Army.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.800]   Actually, you came in late.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.280]   We were talking about it at Digital Life Expo.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.440]   Apparently, the America's Army had a wonderful booth.
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:27.960]   Cool.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.320]   Featuring hunters.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.480]   Humvees.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.360]   That's right.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.560]   Humvee is a militarized Hummer.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.760]   No, it's the other way around.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.600]   I know what I'm just getting.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.320]   You know, Leo, I just-- when you said that about the video game,
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.760]   the only first thought that came to my head
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:46.800]   is is the game going to crash in the middle of the second level?
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.400]   I mean, that's about AT&T.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.800]   That's pretty much what it does.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.800]   Ow.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.360]   Funny, but ow.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.200]   This story from north of the border,
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.520]   for the Globe and Mail is the only start place
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.360]   that's writing about this.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:04.080]   US Senate has failed to extend a moratorium on internet taxes.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.600]   There's a debate over whether the ban should
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   be permanent or temporary.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.640]   Patrick, you and I have been covering this for some time.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.240]   I remember this was a story on the screensavers.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.640]   The internet taxes are banned.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.200]   They're not banned.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.840]   They're not banned.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.200]   Yeah, what year is this again?
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.480]   So believe it or not, it runs out in October.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.040]   In October, we've got about a month left.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.880]   And they're trying to decide whether to extend it
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.720]   for four more years, or indefinitely.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:29.440]   If they fail, plan on your internet access going up
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:35.440]   by 17% to 20% as states start charging tax on your internet
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:35.960]   taxes.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.960]   I mean, your internet taxes.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.440]   No, no, internet taxes.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.040]   This isn't sales tax.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.000]   By the way, you are paying your California sales tax
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.080]   at all internet purchases, Patrick, aren't you?
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:46.640]   Of course.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.280]   They have a special box put in place at the California state
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.520]   income tax foreign to make it convenient for me
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.880]   as a resident of California to meet my legal obligation.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   I'm glad to hear it.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.640]   As am I, and I'm sure every responsible California--
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.480]   no, we're talking about the internet service--
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:09.000]   the internet service providers tax, tax on internet access.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.680]   And some states--
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.040]   let's see, that's complicated.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.160]   All right, that's enough of that.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.440]   I'll move on.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.520]   I'll move on.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.880]   It's too complicated for me.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.360]   I'd much prefer things like shit Microsoft thumb vista.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.760]   That I can understand.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.600]   Francis Ford Coppola is in the news.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.920]   Did you see this?
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.840]   It's stuff got stolen.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.880]   His stuff got stolen, and he has no backup.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.960]   Sounds like one of his--
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.840]   which stuff?
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.640]   Apparently, he's living-- where is he living?
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.320]   Switzerland?
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:39.760]   Argentina.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.680]   Argentina.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.280]   There you go.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.040]   That's the Switzerland of South America.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.400]   Did you know that?
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.480]   Is that because that's where all the Germans fled to--
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.320]   Yes, that's right.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.520]   Slow it's-- we all talk like this in Argentina.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.480]   That's right.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.280]   You're kind of the exact same thing.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.880]   Apparently, five armed men broke into his house,
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.480]   stole all his computers.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   He says, 14 years worth of stuff,
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.680]   including his most recent script on there.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:08.360]   And I guess nobody explained to Francis about backing up.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.200]   Well, let me ask, the Godfather three
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.440]   came out 15 years ago.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.400]   Oh.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:13.760]   Yeah, he had--
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.360]   I hope it did.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.000]   I hope he lost it, because--
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.160]   I might be the only one who thought it was awful.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.160]   Oh, gee.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.280]   Ooh.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.080]   That's hitting a man when he's down.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.880]   Ooh.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.680]   You fit right into the Twit panel, Don.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.080]   I want to welcome you.
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.920]   Who needs to vorac?
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.160]   John did have to take this week off.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.680]   He will be back next week.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.280]   He's traveling.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.960]   But I do really want to thank all you guys.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.680]   Before we wrap this up, I'll give you one more chance
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.840]   to think of any stories that you want to bring up.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.080]   I do want to mention our sponsor, audible.com,
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.120]   the great folks who provide audio books to the millions.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.880]   I know I'm an Audible fan having for years.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:53.720]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/Twit.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.120]   You can sign up and get a coupon for a credit
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:57.400]   toward a free book.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.240]   There are a lot of really good books
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.760]   that I highly recommend, including
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.040]   if you're a Dexter fan, you're watching the new season of Dexter.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:08.120]   You might want the original Dexter novels by Jeff Lindsay,
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.920]   Darkly Dreaming Dexter, and all of them.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.800]   They're available on Audible.com.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.120]   However, I do also want to remind you
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.960]   of the Chopin manuscript and your chance
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.560]   to download a free copy of the first chapter,
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   even if you're not an Audible member.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.000]   And this is an exclusive for Twit.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.640]   You go to audible.com/freechapter
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.080]   and you can get the very first chapter.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.360]   Most people can listen to it.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.480]   Anybody can listen to it streaming,
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.680]   but if you're in a Twit listener,
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.280]   you can get the actual download and put it on your iPod
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.120]   or your iPhone or whatever else you have hacked.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.400]   That works on 135+ devices.
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.240]   It's audible.com/freechapter.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.080]   And again, Darkly Dreaming Dexter,
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.840]   our book pick of the week from Jeff Lindsay.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.040]   If you like Dexter, which is, by the way, a wonderful show,
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:57.920]   you're gonna love the book that it started it.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.640]   audible.com/twit, we thank them for their support
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.520]   and anybody else have anything else
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.880]   they want to talk about?
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:08.520]   - First episode of Techzilla launch.
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:12.280]   - Oh, how can I have forgotten?
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:13.760]   - I'm so mad at you, Patrick Norton.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.520]   You're getting to work with Jessica Corbin again.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.680]   - Ah, Jessica's fun.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.760]   - Oh, I love Jessica.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.800]   You're in Jessica and it's kind of,
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.520]   I have to say it's kind of that screensavers feel,
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.120]   the red brick wall, similar projects I see in the description
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   that you plan to take calls to.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.000]   - Yes, that's awesome.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   - I love questions.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.600]   I love that we did them on DLTV.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.920]   Roger still does them on DLTV.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.000]   It's just fun, man.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   We're gonna see how much we would want to see
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.400]   how much we can get the actual viewers into the show.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.760]   - What about live, Patrick?
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.280]   What about live?
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.480]   - We're actually working towards live.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.440]   Our studio's not gonna be built out.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.360]   The studio's being built to revision three
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.960]   and the switcher, we don't have a switcher yet
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:56.880]   or the audio board.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.080]   So it's gonna be about two months
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.440]   before all of the hardware infrastructure
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.280]   we need is in place.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.240]   - So you think at some point you'll be able to do it live?
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.360]   - That is one of the options we're looking at.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.640]   Something we'd like to be able to do.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.840]   - Revision3.com, R-E-V-I-S-I-O-N, the number three.com.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.280]   And Tekzilla is TEK.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.120]   - TEK.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.760]   - Z-I-L-L-A, Tekzilla.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.560]   - Not 'cause we're hip, but because Tekzilla was owned.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.960]   - And V-C-H.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.760]   - I like it with a K, actually.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.920]   And look for the lovely picture of the mermaid Jessica
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.800]   on your first episode.
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.960]   Boy, she is cute.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:33.160]   And part two.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.000]   And smart.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.040]   I know, it's a great team, actually.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.000]   I'm really glad to see you guys doing that.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.680]   Roger's still stuck in DLTV, but you never know.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.520]   Some ducks.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.360]   - I love that.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:43.080]   - Still at the house.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:43.920]   - Ouch!
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:46.920]   - Roger Chang and Robert Herron have taken over the helm.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.400]   DL.TV, and you know, I just throw, I think the variety
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.680]   and the quality of tech programming,
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.760]   it's on the net now, it just shows you.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:56.200]   Who needs Tek TV?
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.440]   Take your money, Mr. Allen.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:00.520]   Go somewhere else.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.640]   Build that submarine.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.960]   We don't need you anymore.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.280]   We got our own Tek TV.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:10.800]   So DL.TV, Roger, same schedule twice a week.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.800]   Ever since we lost Pat, we don't have enough bodies
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.880]   to put it nicely.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:18.720]   - Oh man.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.440]   - But don't you feel guilty?
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.280]   - But don't you feel guilty?
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.000]   - I'm sorry?
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.840]   - Don't you feel guilty?
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.680]   - Every day.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.520]   (laughing)
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.280]   - Well, the flip side is that it actually gives us time
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.360]   for me to call more guests and stuff.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.200]   - Yeah, that's great.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.040]   - And I'm trying to get more people in.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.280]   - And believe me, there's plenty of time to watch both.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.240]   And that's the beauty.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.000]   Steve Gibson is of course, has not missed an episode
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.200]   of Security Now and now in 114 weeks and running.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.840]   He is the Cal Ripken Jr. of net casting.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.120]   (laughing)
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.680]   And I love it.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.560]   Steve, it's so great to do the show with you.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.000]   We're next week, we're gonna do listener questions, I believe.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:54.840]   - Yeah.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.280]   - And our last episode was on the potential pitfalls
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.640]   at OpenID, well worth listening to.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:00.560]   - Yes.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.280]   - And that is grc.com/security.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.640]   Now you also find of course his great spin right at grc.com,
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:09.200]   the ultimate disc recovery and maintenance utility.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.120]   And all his great free programs.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.760]   You got a new one we're gonna talk about
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.600]   in a couple of weeks.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   Some cool ideas about how to do very secure authentication
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.360]   for free, like you can do with tokens,
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.720]   but without any hardware.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   I call it perfect paper passwords.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.760]   - I love it.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.960]   We'll have the details in a couple of weeks on security now.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.280]   Don Reisinger, I think you are a twit.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.600]   I really thank you for being here.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:36.400]   You fit the panel perfectly.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.280]   I hope you'll come back soon.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.360]   - Hey, thanks Rem, yeah, absolutely, anytime.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.600]   - You catch his stuff on the CNET blogs
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.520]   and digital home and just all over the place,
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.160]   information week.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.080]   He says, he says, "Google Don Reisinger."
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.520]   - Yeah, just pick when you like.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.120]   - Rei, S-I-N-G-E-R, Don, isn't it great to have a name
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.800]   that nobody else has so you could, when you Google it,
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:58.920]   it's you.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.520]   - Oh, it's great, isn't life is good.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.760]   (laughing)
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.560]   I'm on the way, and just this real quick,
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.760]   a Halo 3, did anyone play it?
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   - Oh, what?
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.720]   The big story of the week.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.360]   - Oh, the 640P.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.520]   - Yeah, well, you know what, first thing I did was,
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.400]   I had to finish BioShock.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.640]   So I-- - Did you finish it?
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:19.720]   - Yeah, I got Halo 3 on Tuesday, of course.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:23.360]   But I pre-ordered it and I got it.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.240]   I didn't get up at midnight, but I did,
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.040]   but I got it the first thing in the morning.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.400]   But I couldn't let myself do it.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.880]   So I finished BioShock, I think on Thursday.
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.040]   Halo 3 is awesome.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.560]   What do you think, Don? You love it?
[00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.880]   - I haven't played it. I'm dying to know.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.600]   - Oh, it's great.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.800]   - It's an FPS.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.880]   - No, you know what, though, Roger?
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.960]   You're right, the single player, big deal, no big deal.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.640]   It's aliens, you're shooting them, you're running around.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.800]   It's pretty, it's HD, it's nice.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.880]   But Halo 3's, Halo's always been about
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:52.000]   the online LAN party game.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.080]   - But it's always been big mainly because,
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.800]   until recently, the consoles have never had a game
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.000]   where you could do multiplayer in that fashion.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:01.840]   - I mean, so great.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.920]   - I think Valve's Orange Box is coming out
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.040]   that has half-life, two half-life,
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.040]   or half-life sorts.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:08.880]   - That'll be fun.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.720]   - Team Fortress 2.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.560]   - Team Fortress 2.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.160]   - Now that'll be good. - That'll be exciting.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.680]   - That game looks awesome.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.800]   - Yeah, that'll be very popular.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.360]   But I have to say, Halo, you know,
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.680]   maybe it's just 'cause of the fond memories
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.800]   I have of being on the screensavers set
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:24.000]   and watching Joshua Brantano wax Patrick's behind
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.640]   with the rocket launching.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.920]   (laughing)
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.480]   Patrick and I would be playing,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.280]   you know, it'd be that we'd be in a commercial break,
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.600]   we'd be playing.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.920]   And Brantano and Kevin Rose.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.520]   - I think he'd be able to ask his hand to us.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.320]   - Yeah, Kevin Rose and Brantano were just like,
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:40.840]   obviously way beyond anything we could do.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.160]   We just get blown out of the water.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.840]   They'd sneak up and they'd put a rocket in your head.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.280]   I mean, they were just mean.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.800]   But I still have fond memories of that.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.360]   And so Halo 3, in terms of cooperative play
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:54.960]   and then the online play is better than ever really is fun.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.000]   - Yeah, in the mood to have a 13-year-old
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.160]   taught me in 20 years.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.160]   - Yeah, that's exactly what happens.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.200]   They're too good.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.440]   - Now I gotta warn you, you know,
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.120]   the deluxe set with a helmet,
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.240]   it doesn't fit your head.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.880]   So I bought it and I was very disappointed.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.680]   It's really, it's a cat helmet.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.080]   - Did you see the, actually,
[00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.120]   - Oh, are you sure? - I see the what?
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.200]   - The, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.800]   The guys, a bunch of students at MIT
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.160]   put a massive cheap helmet on one of the,
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.520]   then Brant on one of the statues on the campus.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:30.480]   - Somebody told me the ending is very disturbing.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.160]   - Well, I don't know anything about it.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.000]   - Don't root it.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.840]   - No spoilers.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.880]   No spoilers.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.480]   I won't say anything about the ending of Bioshock either.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.560]   All I just wanna say that morally, I made the right choice.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.560]   - There's two endings.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:45.000]   And if you, if you, if you pop one of the girls,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.320]   you know, if you go back to a previous--
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:47.920]   - I know I have to go back and kill a girl
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.200]   just to see what happens on the second ending.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.040]   - It's an interesting ending.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.160]   - Like a crying game?
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:53.160]   - Yeah, no.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.920]   No, I was, I was, I say,
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.320]   well, I'm just saying I don't wanna give any spoilers.
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.120]   So I don't wanna say anything.
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.480]   But I had a, I actually really liked Bioshock.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.160]   I really enjoyed it, but Halo 3 is gonna consume me.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.320]   My daughter was out last night at the race for the Cure,
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.480]   which is at All Might Marathon.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.960]   And that didn't stop four of her friends
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.440]   from coming over to our house to play My Halo 3
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   on my plasma TV.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.800]   She said, they came over, I said,
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:18.640]   "Oh, Abby's not here."
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.120]   They said, "That's okay, we didn't really wanna see Abby.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:22.520]   We just wanna play Halo 3."
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.360]   - Wow.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.200]   - Two nagers.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.040]   Patrick, I wish you all the best.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:26.880]   - Thank you.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:27.720]   Thank you very much.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.120]   - And I'm Mark Norton is at revision3.com/techzilla.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.800]   Roger Chang at dl.tv.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:33.360]   Steve Gibson at grc.com.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.480]   Google Don Reisinger.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.560]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.800]   We thank you so much for joining us.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.040]   We'll see you next week.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:38.880]   Another Twit.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:39.880]   - This is amazing.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   - Is in the can.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:51.440]   Round the morning.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:54.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:04.340]   - All right.
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.020]   I should have paid attention.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.020]   I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:08.860]   Too much work.
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:10.580]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.300]   My server's completely collapsed.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.580]   So here's the deal.
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.820]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.100]   but I have a hell of a time.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.260]   What blue screens like, forget it.
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.660]   I'm killing you.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.260]   (laughs)
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.680]   - I'm on the morning.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.360]   - Do it on the Twit.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.200]   - Do it on the Twit.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]   - All right.
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.080]   - Do it on the Twit, baby.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:32.920]   - Do it on the Twit.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   - All right.
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.780]   - Do it on the Twit, baby.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.620]   - Do it on the Twit.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:37.620]   - All right.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.500]   - Do it on the Twit, baby.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.340]   - Do it on the Twit.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.340]   - All right.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.200]   - Do it on the Twit, baby.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.020]   - Do it on the Twit.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.020]   - All right.
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.940]   - Do it on the Twit, baby.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.680]   - Let's go round.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.100]   - Round the horn.
