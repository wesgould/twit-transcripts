[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.800]   Twitter spam is that for real?

[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.840]   Crowdpapa, congratulations.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920]   And not only that, you brought Tristan and Sarah came.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   Yeah, and Sheamus.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   Along with Sheamus.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   We lost Sheamus to Phineas and Ferb.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   That's a good thing.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.880]   Phineas and Ferb is the Twit for the foreign underset.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   Pretty much.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.720]   What am I going to do today?
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.920]   And Tristan who is a week old.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.920]   Yes.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920]   It is beautiful.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   Thank you.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.920]   Beautiful.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.200]   And I can't believe that Sarah's up and about and just looking great.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.640]   Sarah was up and about the day the baby was born.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.640]   Really?
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640]   I'm impressed.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.200]   She was just like hassling the doctors like, can I go now?
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   It's been mad at here.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   It's been 12 and a half hours.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   I'm done.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   I can go in 12 hours.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.400]   Well, that was also because when we had Sheamus, they had two nurses, one for Sarah and one
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400]   for Sheamus.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   And they had this really amazing system going.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.480]   We're 29 minutes after Nurse A woke up Sarah and Sheamus to take Sheamus' vital.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.400]   Nurse B would show up and wake up Sarah and Sheamus to take Sarah's vital so they had
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   it really worked so that everybody got woken up every 30 minutes.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.680]   Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.600]   You really do want to get out of there, don't you?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   Anyway, congratulations to you.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   That's so great.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   Such great news.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.680]   The Norton family is growing, growing, growing.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.800]   I remember going to your wedding and tweeting pictures of it against your will.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.520]   No, one picture was fine.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.160]   They just all ended up on a guy's website in Oklahoma helping to make his...
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   Sorry.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.120]   No, no, no, it's awesome because someday I will be driving through Oklahoma again and
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.400]   I will make a pit stop.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   And he will learn the wrath of Norton.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   When, what was the year that you got married?
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   2004.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.960]   So it wasn't Twitter.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   I think, you know what?
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   I put them on my mowblog.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.680]   Whatever happened to mowblogging, that, that's what happened to mowblogging.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.480]   Also with me from CNET and the editors round table, Mr. Ray Finidlman, good to have you.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   Good to be here.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.040]   You were at that sad day this week, the last buzz out loud.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.040]   That was weepy.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040]   You was weepy.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   Tom was there and...
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.040]   Jason was there.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.160]   Jason was there, of course, and as was Veronica and Molly.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.120]   It was very emotional.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.360]   That was the 1,588 episodes.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360]   Wow.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   I know.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.720]   We got a long way to go before we catch up.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.960]   Well, just starting out.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   Yeah, we are.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   Okay.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.440]   Molly's going to go on and do another show.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.280]   Yeah, she's in the show called Always On, which looks like a lot of fun.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   We've seen the trailer.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.840]   CNET kind of backed off the live stuff, but they're still doing plenty of...
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   We're doing a ton of shows.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.880]   I'm doing a reports round table, which I'm on, like, episode 115 or something.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   Right.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.000]   And that was live, but now it's going to recorded.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.240]   We've discovered this.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.080]   I put a bet on live because I want people to watch live.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.720]   I think people will watch live, but it's expensive and it's not necessary.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   It depends.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   Because most of our...
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.640]   Most of almost all of our views are downloads.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.160]   I like the flexibility of doing a recorded show because I can get guests whenever they're
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   available.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160]   Right.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.040]   Yeah, we have to have you here at 3 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.280]   But I'm going to miss being...
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   Have the chat room.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.120]   No matter how old that is, the live studio audience makes all the difference in the pace
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   of the show.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   So I'm going to miss that.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.280]   I think that's the real argument for doing live is the interactivity.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.280]   Yeah, it makes the show...
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   It's just a different show.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.280]   Right.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.960]   But it is much more complicated and costly.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.680]   And really, it's a small number of people that watch live.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.920]   We have, I don't know, how many thousand, maybe a couple of three thousand right now
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.560]   watching, we'll get to maybe five or six before the end of the show.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.920]   It's not a big number compared to the overall down money.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.320]   But you were streaming live off and on?
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.480]   We did it once in a while.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.440]   It was a DLTV we did live, but it was kind of funny because there was always like, "You
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.440]   should do it live."
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.240]   And I was like, "Well, we always do it live because we try cast her and we have to do
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.720]   it in one take because we can't edit it before we post it out."
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.320]   But it was so funny because I remember explaining to people, especially from the magazine side,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.440]   it's like, "Okay, we got 5,000 people watching live.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.000]   We're getting it 500 to 2,500 downloads for every person watching live."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Right, exactly.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.120]   It's a small number.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.280]   I like it because I like to have that.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.320]   You know me, I like live TV because of certain energy.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.440]   I also like it that you can't force us to do a second take because it's done.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.320]   And I don't want to do another take.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.000]   Well, there's also the whole things go sideways that go unbelievably sideways.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Right.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.800]   Like I remember explaining to you, "What happens when you make a mistake at work?"
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   Well, I cleaned it up.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.680]   And I make a mistake at work and it's live.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.320]   I've shared it with thousands or hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.800]   Who can forget that time that you opened up a hard drive and took a hammer to what turned
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.920]   out to be glass platters inside.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Nobody do that.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   Right.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.160]   And it's lucky that I didn't lose an eye, but I didn't.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.960]   Next time I'm going to wear an eye, I got much better about wearing eye protection.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.880]   Also with this IAS ACTAR, who is one of our hosts on TNT and IAS and I are going to be
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.040]   launching a new show a couple of weeks from now.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.960]   Patrick, don't feel bad, but IAS is going to play the role of Patrick Norton.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   Yeah, I'm working on that.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.680]   I'm not going to be using a sledgehammer.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.880]   I'm going to be using a spudger because you know what?
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.360]   It's all tailed in there.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.360]   It's all about spudging.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.200]   And a heat gun to make sure he can unglue everything.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   What are you going to be doing?
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.040]   We're going to do a how-to show, kind of like you and me, where he's going to break
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.880]   glass in my eyes, things like that.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.880]   That'll be fun.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.520]   That's why I never do have eyewear.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.160]   No, we've one of the things that I built the studio is I really wanted to have the space.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.400]   And you know, you guys on Twitch, every time you're in studio with Ryan Shroud, it turns
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.160]   into the screensavers, where it's that real kind of, "Here's how it works.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   Here's look inside this box."
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.720]   You got like 23 cameras in here.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.000]   Yeah, we can do it here, finally.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.800]   So we want to do a help in how-to show and IAS has been pitching it for a while.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.960]   So we're going to launch that.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.800]   I won't say the name until we reserve the domain.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800]   Okay, Doug.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   That's a hold off on that.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.840]   I've learned my lesson, but I'm excited.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.200]   I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.880]   Let's see, lots to talk about this.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.360]   We get his Easter Sunday as we record, so I thank you for being here and we have provided
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.480]   peeps for anybody who wants some of Cadbury eggs.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.920]   What are these real ones?
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.560]   I saw the New York Times story this morning and how they make these.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.560]   Well, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.080]   They go, "Pole opens from the seventh level of hell and the peeps march out every spring."
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.360]   You can tell, even, you know, I think the whole thing about peeps was they designed the
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.400]   process first and then they named them later.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.320]   Yeah, it was probably an industrial accident.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   They stuck eyes.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.880]   We could get all the eyes on it.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.600]   And they said, "It's made out of sugar.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   What could go wrong?"
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   That's right.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.160]   Plus, I mean, the poops just wouldn't make them fly off the shelves.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.200]   So go ahead, have all the peeps you want.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   We'll make more.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   Patrick.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   Anybody?
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   Candy.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   I am in sugar shock.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.760]   I've been eating candy all day and I am just literally, I'm in insulin high here or
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   lower.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   Curtis Peeps, right.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   They should do an Angry Birds version of these.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.960]   They could re-invigorate the brand.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   Angry Peeps.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.960]   There were Angry Birds candies.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.960]   I saw the community.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960]   I have to tell you.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   I was like, "No."
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.960]   I did not buy them.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   It was like, "Please take my money."
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.880]   There's going to be an Angry Birds movie.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   There already was.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880]   Team parks, wasn't there?
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   No, no.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.080]   I think that, no, I like a feature film.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080]   That there already was.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   But Rio was based on-
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   Rio is not Angry Birds.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.520]   They made an Angry Birds Rio, but there's going to be an actual Angry Birds the movie.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.760]   Oh, so they each got one?
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   Wouldn't that be good?
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.480]   With Tippy Hendrin?
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   That would be good.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.560]   James Cameron directing.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.160]   I think I would like that.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.280]   We're going to be, let's see, going to NAB next week, one more program note.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.760]   I'm doing a whole week of shows starting the 16th, 17th, 18th.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.040]   I think the 19th, we're going to do some shows from the National Association of Broadcasters
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.040]   Show.
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.360]   Lots of gear there, lots of stuff.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.040]   It'll be a lot of fun.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.840]   We're the official streaming partner.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.200]   Tuesday, I'm doing an event with New Tech called Broadcast Minds.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.040]   Kevin Pollock will be there.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.880]   The number of others we're going to talk about, you guys will be interested in this, Internet
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.720]   TV, doing it on the cheap.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   If you want to find out more, I think in order to go to this, you have to reserve a seat.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.840]   You can go to newtech.com.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.240]   Do you know what the URL is, Eileen?
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   I think it's-
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.240]   Don't-
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.080]   I think let me see if newtech.com broadcast Minds works.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.040]   I can tell you that our schedule is on our inside.tv page.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   There you go.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.000]   We have free passes to the NAB show as well.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.160]   So if you go to there, you can use the pass, but you do need to reserve this Tuesday, April
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.160]   17th, 16th.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   We will stream it live.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   But did you see who is going to be there?
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.120]   Kevin Pollock, of course they've changed it already.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.600]   Let me go back.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:31.240]   Jeff Jacobs, Bill Chapman, Jeff Hawley, it's going to be a very interesting event.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.320]   And we will stream it as well.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   Some really interesting people.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.400]   Kevin's, of course the comedian who does Kevin's chat show.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:44.000]   Jeff Jacobs, the senior vice president for MTV for production planning, Bill Chapman
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.080]   from Turner Broadcasting, Jeff Hawley from Yamaah.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.040]   So how did you TV, the future of TV?
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   That's fun.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.120]   I'm looking forward to that.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.280]   All right, enough of that.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   Let's get to the news.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.920]   The top story.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:04.600]   Nokia and Microsoft introduced brand new Lumia 900 in stores today.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.800]   The stores are closed.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   What the heck were they thinking?
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   It's okay.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.760]   There's no apps anyway.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.160]   My friend Paul Thorett who does our Windows weekly show tweets.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   That's it.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   I give up.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.280]   He's so frustrated.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   What the heck?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   No lines.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.280]   You know opportunity for lines.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   I love this phone.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   It's really?
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   Have you played with it?
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   It's a nice phone.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   It's a nice interview.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.480]   It feels good.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.680]   It's a 4.3 inch OLED screen.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.000]   It's gorgeous screen.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   You're about to explode.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Why don't you like it?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.920]   I haven't actually, fair disclosure, I haven't actually tried this particular phone, but I
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.160]   have another Windows phone.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.760]   Well, you don't like the OS.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.360]   I don't like, it's not true.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.160]   I think the OS is really beautiful and different, which is great.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.120]   It's just without the apps, it's impossible to get excited about it.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.120]   85,000 apps.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.560]   There's plenty of apps.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.600]   There's no Pandora.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.000]   There's no Instagram.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.080]   There's Angry Birds, but only one Angry Birds.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.440]   I mean, there's apps.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.440]   There's Evernote.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   There's a lot of the apps.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   There is there.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.440]   There is Evernote, which makes it okay.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.520]   It's in better shape than Android was when it launched compared to iPhone, where iPhone
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.440]   was when Android started picking up the name.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.400]   Yes, but when Android launched, there was no Android.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.560]   So these guys are kind of...
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.560]   They've been around for a little longer than...
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.080]   I think what David Polk said I thought was fairly interesting.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.000]   He actually did a good review in which he talks about...
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.720]   He says it's 200 dogs produce, is it in time?
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.120]   But he talks about the big complaint, which is the app complaint, and lists the apps that
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.120]   he uses on his iPhone.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.040]   Of course, he's an iPhone user that are there and the apps that aren't there.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.520]   So he says, "Many of the essentials are there.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.760]   Netflix, IMDB, Flixster, Yelp, OpenTable, check-in apps from Delta and American Airlines,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.040]   Groupon, Four Square, Kindle, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook."
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.520]   But then he says, "The only bank is Bank of America.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:07.760]   No American Express, no HSBC, no Capital One, no Chase, no Citibank, no words with friends."
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.200]   So it is a hit and miss thing.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.920]   I think that this phone is spectacular.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.000]   I think it's very nicely made.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.840]   It's got a great camera.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   It feels good.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.040]   You think the phone is really good?
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   I mean, they didn't bother...
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.320]   No, you didn't bother to put in anything fancy.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.080]   It's the same old hardware and another body in a big plastic shape.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.600]   I think blame Microsoft on that.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   Why?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   Because Microsoft is...
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.040]   And they're responding to the fragmentation in the Android market.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   They have very specific standards.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.440]   There is no dual core Windows phone.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   The screen resolution is what?
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.640]   It's 800 by 940.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.040]   It's not because it's a Windows phone and Microsoft's controlled this.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.320]   Don't get us a need fancy.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.760]   No key needs a product that's actually bought by a bunch of people at this point.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.760]   And so does Microsoft.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.000]   So it drove me nuts is that this is their flagship phone.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   This is their premium brand one.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   It's only $99.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And I know that's affordable.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.360]   It's affordable, but if this is your top of the line thing, maybe it should look like
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.600]   it's in line with the other stuff, kind of anchor the price and then go to $800s of
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   the $99.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.200]   But no key doesn't want us.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.240]   They don't want somebody who's the worst person for them.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   Who do they want is the question.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.000]   They don't want you because you buy a phone every six months.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Although they would like to have you.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.440]   No, I should buy a Nokia phone every six months.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   They want you.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.560]   It's like a whole slew of people who got started buying their phones.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.040]   They're doing the Google strategy.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.080]   They want dozens of manufacturers, you know, $100,000 of apps sold on all the carriers
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.080]   everywhere.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.560]   And that's a strategy that has worked for Android and they want to do without the fragmentation.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.400]   Who is the market for a Windows phone?
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400]   Everybody.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.640]   Who's not going to spend $400 on an iPhone?
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.480]   I don't think anybody who's ever used an iPhone is a market.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.240]   In fact, Walt Mossberg made that point, which is if you're used to doing it the iPhone
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.520]   way, Android is fairly similar.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.840]   The Windows operating system is so different that you will be at C and media.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.880]   But Android can be a very frustrating.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.880]   I mean, I like Android.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.880]   I like Android.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.480]   I like very frustrating experience.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.440]   Fragmentation, UIN consistencies.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.680]   So they might get some Android people who are frustrated with the Android.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.600]   People who would otherwise go to Android as everybody.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.840]   They're never going to get an iPhone user.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   I think it's mostly Android.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.520]   Mostly, people who have not purchased a smartphone.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   Yes.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   But just a lot of people.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:10.880]   You know, Android and, you know, Android and iOS have basically destroyed the rim market.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.120]   They've taken out smartphones are 50% of the phones sold in America right now.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.720]   That means there's 50% of the people buying phones right now are still buying, you know,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   traditional cell phones.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.640]   That means there's a huge number of people who don't want to say, "Rafel, you know,
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   you said it.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.640]   They don't want to spend $400.
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.640]   They don't want to spend $300.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.640]   $100.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   They know Windows.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   Hey, why don't I try it?
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   That looks really cool.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.040]   Something that's really going to take off when Windows 8 finally hits.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.920]   And you see all this tiles everywhere.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.720]   When you go, "Oh, this looks familiar.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.360]   I already know this."
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.000]   It's like, it's almost as if Microsoft's got this reversed.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.600]   They have to teach with the phone first and then go with the operating system.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.760]   When the operating system hits and I think it's late this year, then people will go,
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.120]   "Oh, this looks really familiar.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.120]   I get this."
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.400]   And I think that's when it's really, it's got a better chance.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.000]   But right now, it's just kind of like floundering while we're waiting around.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   So that's...
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I don't think it's floundering.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.640]   I think what's going to have is going to hit it as 100.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.400]   By Christmas, this is going to be like 50 bucks or 25 bucks or a gimme on the signup
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.880]   for the cell phone service.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.080]   And then they're going to have another phone that's going to come out that's going to
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.640]   step it up or they're not going to care.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.600]   They want volume at this point.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.320]   Nokey is used to huge massive volume and that's really what they care about.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.520]   Everything I said bad about Windows phone at $50, I take it all back.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.960]   Well, $50 is that's an...
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.640]   It's $50 at Walmart right now.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.880]   That's an amazing deal.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.600]   And that's the Walmart audience, isn't it?
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.720]   Is somebody who might wander in who has a Nokia candy bar phone and you still see them
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   everywhere.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.600]   Well, I might say, "Gee, I'd really like to say use Twitter."
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.120]   Twitter has really started to appeal to a very mass audience.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   I'd like to use Twitter.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.640]   Can't do it on the candy bar phone.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   "Oh, I could do it on this phone.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   It's 50 bucks.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   Maybe I'll do that."
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.600]   What they don't see though is this data, this sudden jump in their bill, monthly bill,
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.160]   because they're now going to be paying for a data plan.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.960]   It's another 30 bucks.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.520]   And I think people are sensitive to that.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.760]   I would guess that most of the people who don't have a smartphone don't have a smartphone
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.000]   because they don't want to pay for the data plan, not because they don't want to pay for
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   the phone.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Maybe.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Maybe.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.480]   People still get so hung up on the retail price of the phones.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.400]   There's free Android phones, aren't there?
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   Yes.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   Crap.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.400]   But we know that, but they don't know that.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400]   People still get hung up on that.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   Even though you're right, the real cost is in the data plans.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   The real profit is in the data plans.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400]   No kidding.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.640]   The Lumia is 800 by 480 as are all Windows phones.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.840]   Compare that to the iPhone 960 by 640 or the Android phones.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.040]   They're now 1200 by 720.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   720.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   I mean, that's 800 by 480 is, but you know what?
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   It looks great.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   You don't notice.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.040]   Let's see.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.360]   Again, this is Microsoft's chosen partner, right?
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.880]   They could have done something different.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.240]   They could say future proof this phone.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.160]   Yeah, right now we can only take advantage of that one core, but in one year or less
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.280]   than a year when we come out Windows Phone 8, this phone will still be relevant because
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.000]   this is not going to be relevant when Windows Phone 8 comes out.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.200]   This thing is going to be deprecated entirely.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.360]   It's going to get in the hands of people at that price, but at what cost in your future?
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.840]   I mean, the thing is this is not a future proof phone.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840]   This is like this is good for right now.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.840]   No one is future proof.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.880]   Well, isn't that a better iPhone in four years?
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.160]   Well, isn't that a bit of a problem?
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.160]   Because the people...
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.720]   I'm at one though.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   Okay.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   That's the thing.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   I don't buy phones very often.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.080]   But that's a huge problem because no matter what phone you get, it's going to be out of
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   date long before your two year contract is up.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   That's what should change.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.640]   Phone companies, I would love to see that change because the phones...
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.200]   Updating people's phones is actually a very good thing to do for the telcos because they
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   get more data use.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   They get more use overall.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.520]   The apps guys sell more apps.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   So why we're still on a two year cycle in this country is just not so.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:38.600]   Well, and I had thought that Microsoft was really making an effort to change the way
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.960]   cell phone companies work.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.680]   One of the problems that's holding back Windows Phone is that AT&T just wasn't recommending
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680]   it.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.320]   If you go into an AT&T store, they'd say, "Seg and iPhone."
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.160]   Much more likely to say an iPhone than they even mentioned the Windows Phone.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.760]   And I heard from lots of people who went in to say, "I want to buy a Windows Phone."
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.920]   They said, "No, no, no, no.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.920]   You don't.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.560]   You want to buy an iPhone."
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.840]   Or maybe an Android phone, but you definitely don't want a Windows Phone.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   Microsoft's trying to change that.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.760]   They're giving big payouts to employees.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   They're giving phones to employees.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.440]   They're doing all, they're pulling the strings.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:19.520]   And then AT&T says, "And by the way, day one Easter Sunday when no stores are open.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.600]   No lines guaranteed because nobody's open."
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.760]   And it just shows that you could try all you want.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.200]   These cell phone companies have 10 years.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   They don't care.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.520]   They don't care.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.920]   They hate you all more than you know.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   They hate us all.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.720]   I don't think I all agree on.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   I want to take a break.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.040]   When we come back, I want to talk about the hottest fashion accessory.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.880]   We'll all be wearing these sometime next year.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   Are you excited about Google Glasses?
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.760]   I can just see you in a pair of Google Glasses.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.960]   I think it's a wonderful concept.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.600]   Actual engineers say it's they're two years out.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   Max.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.240]   Robert Scoble was hanging out with Sergey Brin.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.160]   And Sergey was wearing them.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.040]   Did Sergey let Robert put them on?
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   No, he didn't.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   I wonder why that is.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   You think they were non-functioning?
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.480]   He was just wearing these ugly glasses around.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.960]   I'm not that cruel, but it wouldn't entirely surprise me.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.160]   We'll talk about it in just a bit.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.800]   The Google Glasses are here, but first, a word from our friends.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.360]   It's Citrix and Go to Meeting.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.640]   Do you work in a company?
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.320]   Are all the employees in the same building?
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   Rarely, right?
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.040]   Nowadays, we've got colleagues, clients all over the world.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.240]   It's almost impossible to have a meeting unless you use an online meeting service and Go to
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.240]   Meeting is the best.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.440]   Share screen, yes, but even better.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.440]   Video.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440]   HD Faces.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.760]   This is something new in Go to Meeting, and it's just fantastic.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.360]   If you visit GoToMeeting.com, you can actually see it in action.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:00.600]   The HD Faces works with the camera in your computer or this is new in the iPad.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.840]   You can actually attend a meeting from the iPad using the iPad camera, the iPad headphones,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.120]   the iPad microphone, and you can join this meeting.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   People will see you.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.000]   I got to tell you, seeing your clients and colleagues is so important.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.160]   We're attuned to seeing facial expressions.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.040]   We're attuned to body language.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.520]   Those things mean so much.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.160]   You're pitching somebody to frown or folded arms or a smile means everything.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.040]   Go to Meeting is really exciting.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.600]   It's a very cool way to make those meetings come to life.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.400]   I want you to try it free for 30 days, including the HD Faces.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.200]   Just go to the website, GoToMeeting.com.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.680]   Click this orange, try it free button.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.600]   The offer code is TWIT, T-W-I-T.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.080]   When you sign up, you'll get 30 days free.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.880]   By the way, the iPad app is free.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.480]   You don't have to pay extra for that, so it's all part of it.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.200]   Go to Meeting.com, try it free button, that orange button, and use the offer code TWIT
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.800]   for 30 days free, really the best way to meet.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.360]   Now that it's got iPad, you could be meeting anywhere.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.880]   You could be in the John, frankly.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.600]   I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.040]   Don't flush anyway, because that's rude.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.640]   How long before go to meetings on Google Glasses?
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.880]   You've seen all the parodies of Google Glasses videos, have you?
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.480]   Have you seen the original video, the Google Glasses video?
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   It's gorgeous.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.160]   Yeah, it's totally bogus, right?
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.040]   Except that it was in the New York Times, which gives it some credibility.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   I like the write-up on the Verge, where there's no evidence that Bryn's unit was fully functional.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.320]   The one Sergio Bryn was wearing.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.400]   Robert Scobel said they saw light being emitted from it, but he wasn't able to try it on himself.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.320]   Indeed, Bryn commented to Verge that it was basically just reboots right now.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.960]   Wow!
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.440]   That's not good.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.600]   It ties into a phone, it has its own software.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.720]   That's funny that he was wearing it at a foundation for fighting blindness.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.880]   That looks really like a raw prototype.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   Is it shining?
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   Okay, here's my question.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.120]   When you look at the video, it looks like it's a heads-up display.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.120]   But it doesn't look like it...
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.640]   It looks like he's looking past it.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   How is it...
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.160]   I hope it's not beaming stuff into my retina.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   No, you're looking...
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.720]   You can make it...
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.440]   You look up to see the display?
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440]   So it's just...
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:29.240]   I mean, that looks like it's hovering over a part of your vision, which means it will...
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.800]   No, it won't vanish.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.360]   Because every time your eyes...
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.160]   Yeah, so I'm curious, maybe that's problem number.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   Numero Uno, let me show you.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.680]   I don't think the optical problem is that big a deal.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.680]   Okay.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   Because it can be solved.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680]   We have...
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.240]   You know, I mean, you see these guys in the Apache helicopters with the giant heads-
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   Right, yeah.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.760]   But that's a giant headset.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.760]   I know, but you...
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   Well, that's not an actual...
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.760]   Well, it's been an actual...
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.800]   What PC were like wired when too much people, they went to Blair McIntyre, the director
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.640]   of the Augmented Environments Lab at Georgia Tech, quote, "In one simple fake video, Google
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:06.040]   has created a level of over-hyped and over-expectation that their hardware, assuming their hardware
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.280]   cannot possibly live up with you."
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.560]   And he may be doing that just to piss off the engineers and make them actually deliver
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.160]   the product because anybody can spend their way delivering this project.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.160]   It's Google.
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   But that's...
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.640]   And I think that this product, I don't believe, is undoable with...
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.640]   And not very long.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.200]   I mean, optically, that's solvable.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   It doesn't have to have...
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   It's dumb for Sergey Brin to wear them today, though, because it's like, "Well, is it work?"
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   We're talking about it.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   He's an excited geek.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.400]   I think he's gonna have a version that's close to working.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   It'd be him.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.800]   So it'd be like, "Did somebody in the lower end like, "Oh, yeah, you'd go test out one
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   that works really well."
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   Now, Sergey wants it.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.880]   Yeah, he's gonna get one that almost works in reboots.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.960]   And it doesn't have to be optical recognition.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.760]   So here's a redo of the original Google video.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   The guy gets up.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.440]   He's wearing the glasses and he's walking around.
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.440]   He sees his coffee and then...
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:55.440]   This is the original.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.440]   Actually, this is the original.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.440]   It's working well.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.200]   It does look like it's a heads-up display on life.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.440]   So it's giving him the weather and the temperature.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.440]   He looks...
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.080]   He's eating a sandwich and somebody says, "You wanna meet up today?"
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.960]   And he can reply just by speech.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.680]   It says, "Meet me in front of the bookstore."
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.920]   This is the sanitized Google version.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.360]   I've got the parody.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.520]   Do you have the parody?
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.360]   Here's the parody version.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   Same idea.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.360]   Really, really short.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.800]   Oh, no, not this on my soul.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.960]   This is another one.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   [laughter]
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.440]   He keeps running into people.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.600]   There's ads.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.000]   It's hitting people because the ads are taking over his vision.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.960]   The police request access to your life log.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   This request cannot be declined.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   That's one.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.160]   And then there's another one where it just pops up adsense everywhere, which seems much
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.160]   more likely.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.560]   What's the minority report moment that always struck me as being terrified as the ad?
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.040]   The billboards are reading, scanning is retin...
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.360]   "Lio Lebort, would you like a pair of pants today?"
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.480]   As he's walking through the mall.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.120]   Somehow I feel like that's...
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.560]   Jimmy Kimmel has a good one too, where the guy picks up the ukulele and then falls down
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.280]   and fly to stairs and it's just hard.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   This is...
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.920]   They call this "admented reality."
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.960]   Same idea, but...
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   So he's having a cup of coffee now.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   He gets a Starbucks ad.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.560]   He's having an Egg McMuffin, a McDonald's ad.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.600]   Of course, his girlfriend's name, Jess, which means he's going to see a lot of ads for new
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   girl.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.240]   Subway service suspended.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.520]   Well, no problem.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.800]   Let's find...
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   Shoes.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.720]   Now, that's...
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.640]   You know, I think this is actually fairly realistic.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.480]   I could totally see Google popping up adsense ads as I wander around.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.240]   It's going to be the net zero approach, which is completely subsidized by all the ads.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   That's the one you get.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.080]   And you get free data forever.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   Google will be more subtle than that.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.320]   They won't do this until they can figure out a way to weld these things to your head
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   so you can't take them all.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.280]   Right, because otherwise you'll throw them over the parapet and disgust.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.920]   I love the...
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.440]   So Jessica wants to talk.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.440]   And she says, "What's up?"
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.040]   And now you get all these books with "What's up?"
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.600]   in the title.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.320]   He's playing the yuke for it.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.120]   It adds for ukulele.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.840]   Including, of course, an ad for new girl.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.240]   That just felt real to me.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.080]   You can't get away from her.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.920]   All right, so we think this is doable.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.080]   I think so.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.320]   But we also think this is stupid.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   I don't know if it's...
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.960]   Look, I love the idea of having that level of access to data, right?
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.800]   Because everybody knows whether you're on Android or iOS or Windows.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.760]   All the interfaces are perfectly worked out.
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   They're easy.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.760]   They're accessible.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.280]   They're not able to drive your ability to drive a car or anything, right?
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.280]   Yeah, everybody's...
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.280]   Sure, sure, sure.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.520]   No, I think it's a great idea.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.360]   I would love to actually see it in the wild.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.720]   I want the cocktail party version of this when I go into a room and I forget your name.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720]   That's what I want.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   This is Patrick.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   As we all get older, these are gonna...
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   This is Patrick.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   He has two children, Tristan and Sheamus.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   His wife's name is Sarah.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   His birthday.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   And then I can say...
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   Patrick, there'll be a slight lag.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   But that's a job category.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720]   Patrick!
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   That's my assistant over my shoulder, but now it's in my glasses.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   But I would like that.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   I would love to...
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   Because I can't remember people's faces.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   And that would be really nice to have...
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.240]   The problem is I'm envisioning this where I'd be like, "Tell Bob, meet him at three.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.600]   It will orp and at seven."
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.960]   Well, that we already have.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   That's called Siri.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.760]   Well, Siri, make me a sandwich.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.280]   I can't do that right now.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.120]   I've been using Siri a lot because I just want to give it a shot.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.240]   And the real problem with Siri is it's too good.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.080]   And then when it doesn't work, which is about half the time, it makes me mad because it
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.080]   should work.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.920]   And the other thing is you're adding stuff to your grocery list and you have to wait
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.880]   like 30 seconds while it confirms it, spells it wrong.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.480]   And by the time you're done, it's like, "I should have just written this on a piece of
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.720]   paper."
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:56.280]   This is Larry Page's conclusion of his first year as CEO.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.760]   He has written a nice little email to the investors, his 2012 update.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.120]   It has been a very mixed year for Google.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.800]   And I don't know if we can give Larry an A+ in his tenure as a CEO.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:17.320]   This is the year Google launched Google+, killed a lot of kind of moribund projects.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:26.480]   But it's also the year it got a lot of black marks for breaking iOS's privacy for the Kenya
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   thing.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.880]   I mean, there have been a number of really nasty stories about Google this year.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.760]   But the iOS thing seemed like it was just a workaround and they were stuck with this
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.760]   safari.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   Didn't do what they wanted to do.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.760]   And they got around it.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.760]   I'm sure a lot of sites did that.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.200]   Google gets the worst news about it because they're Google and they're watching you.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   Everything you're doing is evil.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.960]   But I mean, it's only been a year.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.840]   And the thing is when I saw when Page was going to take over at all, taking over for
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.880]   Schmidt, I'm like, "Well, can this company survive now?
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   Because Schmidt was totally different."
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   Well, he's done better than you're right.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.000]   He's done better than you maybe thought he was going to do.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.080]   Because I mean, like, let's put an engineer in charge after having a business guy in charge
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.480]   for a very long time.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.840]   You know, that basically put a grown up in charge for years.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.600]   And it's like, "Okay, well, you go back and take it over."
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.640]   I was actually really surprised that it worked as well as it did.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.880]   This is a great article from Kim Mycutler and TechCrunch.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.640]   "Larry's Year by the Numbers."
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   30 products killed.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.080]   100 million active Google+ users.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.680]   That's a brand new product for them.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:25.240]   850,000 Android devices activated each day.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.480]   And that may be out of date.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:36.240]   55 Android manufacturers, 300 carriers, 200 million Chrome users, 350 million Gmail users,
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.240]   800 million YouTube users.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.720]   And of course, the latest on YouTube is 24 hours of video.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   Is that what it is?
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720]   24 hours every minute?
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   Something like that.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   Now with 3D.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.640]   They have 3D now?
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.360]   They're auto-converting stuff to 3D.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   Oh, God.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   And a short form 1080p clips will be automatically turned into 3D.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.920]   It was a beta feature and they decided to make it for anybody.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   I honestly thought it was a joke.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.120]   It was just a couple of days after April Fool's.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   That's the problem.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.560]   You can't tell.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.760]   Half of the stuff Google like these glasses, half the stuff they do, could be a joke.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.360]   I'm skeptical of this 100 million Google+ user thing.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.920]   I bet they count me and they shouldn't.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.960]   I go in like once every month when somebody flags my name.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.920]   How many people go into Facebook every day?
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   What percentage of the users?
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.640]   Well, the problem with Google+ is you're a user of Google+ if you just sign up for a
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.640]   Gmail account.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   It's automatic.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   I don't know if it's meaningful.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:32.040]   Well, there's 350 million something Gmail users, at least 350 million Gmail users.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.840]   Well, they all have Google+ accounts now.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.880]   But they're only counting 100 million Google+ users.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.720]   I don't know how they act like them.
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.360]   They know better than we do.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   I don't know.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   Do you Google+ a lot?
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.720]   I was really excited when it came out.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.760]   The discussions were great and so forth.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:51.920]   But it kind of got dominated by animated GIFs and just a few people.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.560]   And frankly, I've gotten a little less interested.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.560]   And I don't use it as much.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   You know what's funny?
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.800]   I hate to admit it because I was really a naysayer.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.280]   But Facebook seems to be the platform at this point.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.280]   Getting there.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.440]   I keep end up using Google+ because that stupid little red one or two will be up there.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440]   Can't miss it.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.600]   My Gmail and I'm just obsessive about it.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   So I have to keep pressing.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   What do they say?
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   What's going on?
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   It's like, oh, that was useless.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.440]   But that counted, I pushed the button because I'm like a like OCD.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.440]   The Google psychologist have got your number.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   They got me.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.160]   He's got a nice white background and there's a red thing.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   That came here.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   Like red buttons.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.960]   You have shiny red buttons.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.520]   One thing Google did this year that is getting some discussion is they started charging some
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.720]   of the biggest users for using Google Maps.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   Whoops.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.280]   Four Square stopped.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:39.840]   Apple very noticeably in their iPhoto app used to open street maps with their own dressing.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:44.840]   And now Wikipedia has announced they're going to start using open street map, the open source.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.720]   They should have used it all along instead of Google Maps.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.120]   Well, it wasn't a lot to use in the early days of open street apps.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   You can use it?
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.360]   The reason this all works is because the economics of mapping have been changing.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.160]   It's because mapping has become wiki-like and it didn't used to work that way.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.120]   You used to need something like Google in order to do a mapping enterprise.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.840]   And it's very expensive.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.360]   But that's what's cool about open street maps.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.520]   It is the Wikipedia of mapping.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.080]   It's contributed by people who have GPS's.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.040]   They'll drive around and automatically get uploaded.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.520]   If you look at your neighborhood and something's wrong, you say, no, that's a one way.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.920]   It's one of those things you don't think could possibly work.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.920]   And it does.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.920]   I suspectacular.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.120]   I love open street maps.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:31.080]   So Google started charging in March between $4 and $10 per additional thousand loads to
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:37.160]   any site loading more than 25,000 maps a day, which is probably a lot of sites.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.080]   And of course, Wikipedia decided, well, we shouldn't have to pay for that.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.800]   But I frankly think it's a really good thing because after all, it's the Wikipedia of mapping.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.320]   Yeah, it makes perfect sense for them.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.960]   A lot of apps are starting even on iPhone are starting to use open street maps.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   I think it's a great--
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   Well, Apple obviously wants to get off of the Google crack.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.960]   Right.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   Yeah, they're doing it.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.720]   And they can afford it, but they can't afford to be in Google's pocket.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.360]   I think there will come a time sooner than later that the iPhone has no Google on it at
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   all.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.080]   I think that's their goal, right?
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.800]   Although another interesting story Larry Page the day before his anniversary gave an
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.840]   interview to Business Week Magazine.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.440]   And one of the things he said is, oh, the Apple thing, it's all theater.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.080]   Apple doesn't really hate us.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.840]   It's designed to rally the troops.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.600]   It's not, don't look in your notes.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.520]   I'm making this up as I go along.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:30.120]   Now Larry, if you go on Larry Page Business Week, you can see the interview.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.760]   Larry does not give a lot of interviews.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.640]   I have a feeling this is one of the things his advisor said, you got to talk.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.960]   So April 3rd, the day before his one-year anniversary gave the interview.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.680]   And he says basically, in fact, it's in the second page, it's right at the bottom or the
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.160]   last page here.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:52.320]   Brad Stone, formerly of the New York Times Now Business Week asked the right question.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:58.680]   He says that he asked him, did you go to talk to Stephen Jobs for advice?
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.840]   According to Steve Jobs' biography, when you became CEO, you went to Jobs for advice.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.360]   I know you had your differences at the end around Android, but what did you take from
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.560]   him as a mentor and a friend?
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.240]   And Larry kind of offhandily says, well, I think the Android differences were actually
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.960]   for show.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.520]   He talks about his relationship with Steve.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:19.360]   And then Brad says, wait, the fury around Android was for show?
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.840]   Yeah, I think that served their interests for a lot of companies.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:28.360]   It's useful for them to feel like they have an obvious competitor and to rally around
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.360]   that.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.040]   I personally believe it's better to shoot higher.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   You don't want to be looking at your competitors.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.560]   You want to be looking at what's possible and how to make the world better.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.040]   Yeah, like Google's not looking at Facebook.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   Right.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   I love Google+, yeah.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.360]   Oh, no, we didn't think about Facebook.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.000]   So do you think that's credible that, you know, because Steve Jobs basically said, I
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.400]   will spend every penny in our considerable coffers and I will work to my dying day to
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.120]   destroy Android.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   He said that.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   Probably a little of both.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:05.080]   I mean, it is an effective rallying cry to engineers and everybody at a company to say
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.680]   this is enemy number one.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.680]   Right.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.240]   I mean, Walter Isaacson said, but he's like, I don't know what Larry Page is talking
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.240]   about.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   No, Jobs hated them.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.040]   I don't know why he didn't understand.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.400]   But I mean, I could see it being both ways.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.520]   I mean, Jobs would go every which way in personality and things.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.240]   He'd pull every lever he'd get, right?
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.840]   So I mean, with iOS team fighting the Mac, OS team happens right now, let alone with the
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.240]   original development of the Mac, where he's like, I'm going to split you guys up and
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.280]   I'm going to make you fight each other.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.640]   It'd be easy to go.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.200]   Those guys fight those guys.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.440]   And then also still go.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.880]   So the first iPhone, how would the maps have worked if there was no Google Maps?
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   Right.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   I mean, things change.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.640]   Are they going to go to Nokia and get the Nokia Maps?
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   Whatever.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.640]   I mean, so they needed each other.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.640]   They still need each other to an extent.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.240]   And over time, the companies tried to try to pull each, pull apart from each other.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   It's going to happen.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   I'm willing to bet.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.160]   I'm willing to bet Safari makes a considerable amount of money using Google search as we
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.680]   know Firefox does because of the Google search bar.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.880]   That's a hard thing to give up that hundred million or two.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.880]   Or even if you're a multi-billion dollar company.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.120]   I think Steve Jobs said anything you needed to say at any given moment to get the result
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.040]   he wanted for the vision in his head.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   Period.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.120]   And it's very famously, it was at an all hands meeting that he said, Google stole Android
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.440]   from us.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.440]   That was to rally the troops.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.960]   On the other hand, when he's saying to Walter Isaacson, literally on his deathbed, I will
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.400]   spend every dollar I have to kill Android.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   That sounds real.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.120]   That doesn't sound like something he's saying for effect.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:35.400]   Well, if he wants to spend every dollar, want to just spend every dollar to kill Android,
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:41.680]   selling these high end phones, it's, it's, it, I don't know, they've got such different
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   strategies.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.400]   I mean, the Android strategy is to get it out to everyone.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.400]   Right.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.800]   The Apple strategy is to control the market and have the right, totally experience.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.800]   And the experience.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.000]   It's their totally different, they're completely different ideas.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   But they're both phones.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.440]   Nobody who's going to want an iPhone is going to want an Android phone and vice versa.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.440]   Is there much overlap, you think?
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.840]   In the markets, I don't think so.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.840]   I use both.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   I don't know.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.000]   I mean, I think as a geek, I mean, the, the iPhones experience is so beautiful and the
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.440]   Android experience is so flexible.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.440]   Right.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   Exactly.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.160]   There is a bit of a line of which one I'm going to be today.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   No, I use a galaxy.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.600]   Now, some days I get up and I take the galaxy note.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.160]   Some days I take the iPhone.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.040]   I think it's the reason why I think Android even picked up any steam was because the iPhone
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.040]   was exclusive to AT&T.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.520]   So you go to Verizon and go, what do you got that's like the iPhone?
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520]   We have this thing.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520]   Right.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.520]   It's like a screen.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520]   Okay.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.400]   Facebook, Facebook, Twitter, check the out of these check marks.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   Like close enough.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   Angry Birds.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.480]   Got a lot of people were like, that's good enough for me.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.640]   And then Apple waited for a very long time before they put out their phone everywhere.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.880]   Now it's still picking up steam.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.640]   What's what's Brent and all these local carriers getting it to.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.320]   That's just how Nokia is going to take over the smartphone.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.320]   Right.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   With Windows.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.320]   Somebody got this like this.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.080]   Oh, it's not like it at all.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   All right.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   We're going to take a break.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.680]   We've got a great panel from CNET.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.560]   Mr. Rafe Needleman.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   Is it reporters round table?
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.960]   What are the other shows reporters round table?
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   That we do.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.960]   That you do.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   Do you just do that?
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   I do that.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   That's it.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.120]   And I do a radio minute on mobile apps and some of the CBS affiliates.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   That's fun.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   That's really fun.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   Keep picking app every day or app a week.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.840]   Oh, we I'm working up to one a day.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.800]   You know, my my syndicators want me to do one a day.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.280]   It's like I can't do a minute a day.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.080]   I mean, that's too much work.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.080]   There's enough apps.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   I'll tell you that.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.080]   That's true.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.080]   Bad ones.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   I would love to do one a day.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   That's a good point.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   They get to them.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.080]   Do you only do the good ones?
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   The crap app of the day.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   I'll tell you why you do the good app, but I'll do the crap app.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   All right.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   No, I want to do the bad one.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   I'm too nice.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.160]   Well, you see, that was good when it was, you know, because Molly would rant and you'd
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.360]   be nice.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   Cramp my style.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   You don't want to be nice.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.800]   Also, Patrick Norton, proud new father.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   Tristan's over there.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   He's sleeping very nice.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   He's out.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   He's out cold.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   I held him for a little bit.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   That was great.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   God, sure.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.720]   We're giving you Veronica back, by the way, you can have her.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.280]   That's kind of a cold way to put it.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.280]   Wow.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.400]   I got a lot of tweets because, well, because we canceled Game On, which is the show she
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.400]   was doing for us.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.760]   Oh, you didn't hear about that.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.880]   And I got a lot of tweets saying, what will Veronica do?
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:19.080]   And I had to reply, well, I think she has a day job called Tekzilla and she's fabulous
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.080]   in it.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.080]   And Sword and Laser.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   And Sword and Laser.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   Have you seen this?
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.480]   Have you gone over here to see the sword laser set with the mechanical dragon?
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   This is like jazz.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.320]   And like space mead hall bar.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.760]   Yeah, she doesn't cry to us.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   She doesn't need us.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.320]   Every castle needs an airlock.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.880]   Yeah, it's got an airlock.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.880]   It's a dungeon with it.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.880]   So you've been over there, too.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   I saw the trailer.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.880]   Did you beam in?
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   You could beam in.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.880]   Next time you don't have to drive up here, just beam in.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.040]   That was like a laser set.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.560]   It's got its own transporter.
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.960]   No, Game On was really expensive and it wasn't just wasn't getting traction.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.840]   So as much as I love it, it's really breaking my heart.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.840]   You know what?
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.440]   I always said we'd never do gaming.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.520]   I wish I'd listened to myself.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.120]   It's a hard nut to crack.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.680]   It's an enormously difficult market.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   You guys do.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   Originally in three-dism gaming shows.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   We do.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   We also burn up success with them.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   And you have success with them.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.680]   The biggest gaming websites out there.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:11.680]   Right.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   That's the problem.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.680]   I can't.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   I can't.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   The Structoid helps as a brand when you're moving into the gaming market.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   I can't help.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   I can't compete.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.920]   However, I, as an I, are going to launch a great new show.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   It's not gaming.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   It's not gaming.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.520]   It's not gaming.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.000]   I, as will be the host and I will be the interlocutor.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.280]   That's whatever that word means.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   Sure.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.280]   That's what I'll be.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.800]   I, as also, also reports on news Monday through Friday on TNT with Tom and Sarah.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.320]   Actually, before we go much farther speaking of TNT, are you curious?
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.160]   Would you like to know what stories you'll be covering?
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.800]   I'd love to know what we're going to talk about next week.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   Let's find out, Mr. Tom Merritt.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.640]   Thanks to John for filling in for me last week.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.560]   Coming up in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:56.520]   Sunday, April 8th, AT&T begins unlocking off-contract iPhones, the HTC Titan comes to AT&T for $200,
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:01.200]   and the big one, the Nokia Lumia 900 launches for $99.99.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.600]   Coming up Tuesday, April 10th, Lenovo's K71 Smart TV.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.840]   That's the one we saw at CES is launching in China and then looking a little farther down
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.240]   the week, Thursday, April 12th, Google has its earnings call.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:17.600]   Sony's new chief, Cosurai, will outline their new strategy and its Yuri's Nighiri Gagarin
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.200]   became the first human in space in 1961 on April 12th.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.880]   All that and more coming up on Tech News today this week.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.600]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.160]   It looks like Tom brought a gun to a knife fight or something.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.680]   I don't know if you're saying that.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.720]   What happened there?
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.960]   If you saw, if you saw, if you, first of all, this is for video only.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.240]   If you watched the show last week, you know what was going on.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:44.360]   If you're watching video, if you're on audio, what are you talking about?
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.240]   This show brought to you today by carbonite.com automatic backup.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.600]   I was just pricing some of the other guys who do cloud storage.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:57.720]   Pretty typical, a couple hundred bucks a year for cloud storage.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:02.320]   Carbonite does backup and gives you cloud storage, 59 bucks a year.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:06.080]   That's less than five bucks a month and it's not for 50 gigabytes or 100 gigabytes.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.640]   It's for whatever's on your internal hard drive.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.320]   $59 a year.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.480]   Carbonite is backup done right.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.120]   Anytime you're online, you're automatically continuously backing up to the Internet.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.520]   So your data is always safe.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.240]   You can access it even before disaster happens.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.680]   From any computer you log onto your carbonite account or you use, they have a smartphone
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.600]   apps, they have tablet apps and there's your stuff.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   So it's cloud storage plus backup.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.280]   And if disaster, what am I saying?
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.920]   If when disaster happens, you just go to your carbonite account, you log in, you restore
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.320]   it all just like that.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.920]   You're always safe.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.480]   If you've not been backing up, you've got to do it and carbonite's the way to do it right.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.640]   Go to carbonite.com.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.480]   They've got the $59 plan is for your internal drive.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.600]   If you have multiple drives or external drives or multiple computers, they have plans for
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.880]   that to just look at the different plans.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.840]   Use our offer code TWIT to sign up for two weeks free, no credit card needed.
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:57.840]   Just TWIT.
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.320]   That's it.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.360]   And then if you decide to buy, use TWIT again, you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:10.080]   One of the features I know you, smart people are interested in, carbonite does support encryption.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   You keep the keys.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.480]   They have no access to your data.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.880]   So absolutely private, strong encryption along with everything else.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.880]   You got to try carbonite.com offer code TWIT.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.480]   Don't come wanting me if you lose your data.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.080]   I told you carbonite.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.000]   I get calls every week on the radio show if somebody says I lost everything.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.400]   He went called me.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.560]   She said, I got a new computer.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.840]   I gave my old computer to a friend.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.920]   He said he'd back up all my data and give it to me.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   And he didn't.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.760]   And I said, and you didn't have a copy?
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   No.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   Okay.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.240]   She says, it's been eight months.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   Is there anything I could do?
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   I said, no.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240]   What's he talking about?
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.000]   Of course not.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.240]   You nuts?
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.880]   But then she said I had a massive database with 360 records.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.880]   Ooh.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:03.480]   In the year of big data, 360 records is not exactly massive.
[00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.600]   So Mac and Tash, this is the end of innocence.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:13.160]   I've proclaimed it before, but it really is now according to the most of the security
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.680]   experts, Dr. Webb, which is a Russian security site.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.920]   If that's not an oxymoron, I don't know what is.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:26.560]   Dr. Webb has now detected over 600,000 Macs infected with flashback that 57% in the US.
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.560]   Many of the rest in Canada.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:34.960]   This was originally a Trojan horse that started last fall with a fake flash installer.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.360]   But it's been morphing like crazy.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.000]   The latest version uses a hole in Java, a hole that was fixed by Oracle, which of course
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.440]   I remember brought Sun and isn't responsible for Java.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.560]   In February, Apple didn't fix it till Wednesday.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.600]   But they finally fixed it.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.760]   If you have a Mac, you should probably run your update and get the latest Java.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:59.680]   Meanwhile, if you go to a F-secures website, they have a couple of terminal commands that
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.240]   will tell you whether you've been infected or not.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.920]   I don't know why they don't just build a little thing that does it, a little program.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.920]   I mean, it's easy enough to do.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   I'll tell you why.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   And there are.
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.840]   Dr. Webb has a program, the number of people have written Apple scripts and stuff.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.440]   The problem is it's really risky.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.640]   And I feel like Apple users are going to be more vulnerable to this because they've never,
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:23.520]   they're innocent, wandering in this terrible landscape that Windows users have been suffering.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:30.480]   And the problem is Windows users, no, you don't download a fix from a source that says,
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.880]   "Oh, yeah, you got the Trojan, well, I got something.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.160]   This will fix you for you."
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.360]   And you'll run the program and the Trojan's still there and you got some more.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.680]   So it's always a little nerve-wracking to run a script.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.920]   It's two terminal commands.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   It's very straightforward.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.160]   But yes, there are scripts out there.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.560]   Dr. Webb has one.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.680]   If you trust a Russian security site.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.720]   What do you got against the Russians?
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   Nothing.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   It's just that it seems--
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.720]   They write the viruses.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.720]   They should fix them.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.720]   Exactly.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.720]   Exactly.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.960]   Their virus virgins says, "Walfly in our chat, right?"
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.960]   Very true.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.960]   You virus virgins?
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.440]   It's kind of scary.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.560]   But this kind of also answers the question that has been going around for a long time.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:10.800]   Are there no viruses on the Mac because it's inherently more secure or because nobody cares
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.040]   about the Mac?
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.440]   And it's not inherently more secure.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.480]   I think we can see, we can acknowledge that, right?
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.960]   At this point, I think at this point it would be enormously difficult to prove that one
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.960]   is more secure than the other.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   I think Windows was working a lot harder at it.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   Well, I think that's what happened.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   I have to.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.800]   I think that the virus authors said, "Well, I'm not going to spend any effort on a 5%
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   platform like Macintosh."
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.800]   It's such a rich ground--
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   It's such a subtle territory.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.840]   But this is what's happening.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:36.840]   It is very fertile.
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.600]   It might only be 5% of the market.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.120]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.600]   But these 5% of the users, how many of them are running antivirus apps?
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.600]   None of them.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.600]   Three of them.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.760]   And 80% are more of Windows users now using antiviruses.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   Yes, for you.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.360]   As you say, are battle-scarred veterans.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.840]   They know not to do some of these.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.760]   And they're used to their computers running slow, so they don't even notice.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.920]   That's why I think so much malware is being written for phones, really.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.000]   That's the computer for everybody.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   You don't know what you're doing.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   I'm going to hit install.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.800]   Why is there malware written for phones?
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:06.800]   Yeah, lots.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.840]   That's interesting, because I have yet to see any big exploits.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.560]   You need to talk to the people over-- some friends of mine started to look at mobile
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   security.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.560]   Look at it's great.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   I used to talk to those guys.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.740]   Well, but I never trust people like that, because it's in their interest to scare people
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.740]   that there's viruses.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.740]   True.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:22.740]   But you know them and you trust them?
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.400]   Yeah, I know John and those guys personally.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.800]   So I give them more credit now than I did.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:33.640]   At some level, yeah, security people want you to buy security software, especially on
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.040]   the Mac platform, because if you go to one of the great Mac word moments, literally they
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.720]   have something leap in front of me, is your system perfected?
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.720]   And like, no.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   No.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.560]   You should try this, it's going to save your life.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.420]   And yeah, that's a hard, broad corn to ho.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.060]   You know, when you're trying to sell Mac antivirus.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.700]   Not anymore, it's a little easier.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.700]   It's a little bit easier.
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.700]   600,000 infected Macs.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.500]   Do you have any virus on your Mac?
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.460]   At one point, I was running antivirus on my Mac.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.860]   But now, who's here is using AV on their Mac?
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:01.860]   I was.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.860]   Not now.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.860]   I'm not.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:04.860]   I'm thinking about it though.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:05.860]   I don't use AV on any platform though.
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.860]   I sophisticated users generally don't need AV, because they--
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.260]   Right, until that time, somebody clicks on a page and you're machining you come back.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.020]   Well, you don't let anybody use my machines.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.720]   And I know what not to do, right?
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.360]   If you know what not to do, do you need any virus?
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.920]   You sound like the perfect victim.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   I know.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   I'm wide open.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.920]   Here's this U.S.E.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.920]   Flash Drive.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   Use this all day.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.400]   I'm wide open for-- but I haven't had a virus in a decade.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:33.280]   The only issues with the Flashback Trojan was that-- like, there's about 5 million links
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   to this.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.280]   Right.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   These sites.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.640]   So I think even some of them originally at D-Link, you know, the very famous--
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.640]   Well, that's what happened back in the--
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   Well, that's what happened back in the--
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.880]   If you don't-- if you aren't secure on your website, and I know about this, because ours
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.660]   have been attacked, people can get in and they put stuff on there.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.100]   So you go to a reputable site.
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.980]   D-Link didn't intentionally put any virus on there.
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.500]   But because their site was hackable, somebody was able to do that.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.500]   That's the kind of thing, though.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.140]   Even if you know what you're doing, you're like, "I'm going to check the latest drivers
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.140]   from my D-Link router."
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:59.820]   You're like, "Oh, I clicked the wrong thing and now I'm redirected."
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.500]   Because this was working off a Java.
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.660]   And you didn't have to do a whole lot to even get infected with this.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.220]   But I believe the botnet was taken over by authorities anyway.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.220]   So even if you were affected--
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:09.220]   Right.
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:10.220]   It's pretty safe.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.280]   But if you were thinking you're in this Mac bubble and you're safe, you're not.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.680]   But one of the coolest things I heard about this virus is that when it was loading, first
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:20.480]   it would scan for antivirus.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.920]   And if there was one, it would just abort.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   Walk away.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   Greener pass.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   Little Snitch was the one it was looking for.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.160]   Now, Little Snitch is kind of interesting, because it's not a traditional antivirus.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.920]   All it does is let you know of some program or process on your computer is trying to
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.200]   contact the outside world.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.000]   And of course, modern viruses, they have to do that.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.400]   That's how they get their commands.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.080]   They join a botnet.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.400]   And so Little Snitch would be very effective, not preventing the infection.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.500]   You'd get the infection, but you'd get a warning.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.700]   So as soon as it saw Little Snitch, flashbacks said--
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.700]   Never mind.
[00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.500]   And somebody may own size.
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.500]   So that-- yeah.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:57.100]   And that just shows you how it probably is a good idea to have a little something.
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:01.140]   Little Snitch is a good program, but there are antivirus programs.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.660]   And T goes around for a long time.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:06.220]   We have an advertiser, ESET, that makes a very good one.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.860]   You use .432 on Windows, right?
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.860]   Or you've used it.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.860]   Back in the day.
[00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.240]   And they have one for the Mac.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:18.800]   Facebook ID threat, according to somebody on CNET.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.120]   Threatens-- it's Don Risinger.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.560]   Threatens all iPhones and Dropbox.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.860]   So this is nice.
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.580]   This is a Dropbox vulnerability.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:35.800]   What happens, what they're reporting here, is that applications-- if I get this right--
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.640]   phone apps that use Facebook login--
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   Which they all do.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.340]   They are exposing your login through-- the apps are exposing your login.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.240]   They're not supposed to, but there's a flaw and they do.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   And it's just something that--
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.400]   So Facebook is self-secure.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.040]   But if you sign on to, like, what's that game, draw something.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.040]   Right.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.600]   Then that using Facebook sign on there will expose-- people can then get your Facebook
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.080]   credentials from that sign on.
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:03.000]   And that is a flaw in iOS and Android?
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   I don't know if the flaw is in the OS or is it the way Facebook handles its security
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.480]   or whatever, but it's patchable, which I guess they're doing.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.480]   Right.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:15.600]   But according to the next web, you don't have to be jailbroken.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:20.120]   Yeah, the original thinking and what Apple was-- was an Apple or Facebook was saying
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.360]   was saying that your only vulnerable if your phone is jailbroken.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.000]   But then people checked and said, "No."
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:33.640]   So apparently the Facebook token is saved in a P-list on iOS, which is not secured.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.640]   Right.
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.120]   So others could access the P-list.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.680]   At least that's what I'm reading.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:38.680]   Maybe misunderstanding.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:42.720]   Which highlights the whole problem of using third parties as authenticators.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.720]   Right.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:48.680]   I mean, they try really hard to be secure, but I guess it's harder than it looks.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:49.680]   Right.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:53.040]   And whether it's Facebook or Twitter or Google, you know, that you-- going on to any of those
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   sites, totally secure.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:53:01.520]   I like to say, in modern mobile operating systems, the iOS is really a big culprit because Twitter
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.520]   is everywhere.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.720]   You-- Twitter authentication just kind of persists throughout the whole phone.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   I'm a new app.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.000]   I installed a new app in my iOS and it says, "I want to-- can I access Twitter?"
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.160]   And I say, "Yes, it doesn't have to ask me for anything because the iOS is already authenticated
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.160]   for Twitter.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.720]   iOS authenticates it and says, "Yeah, yeah.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.720]   Take his Twitter credentials.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.600]   It's to be-- enjoy."
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   Right.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   And that app makes me--
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   That makes me very nervous.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   And that has access to Twitter.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.080]   Well, that app doesn't actually have access to your Twitter password.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   No.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.080]   Twitter is managing the authentic--
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.080]   It's got a lot.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:34.080]   It's got a lot of authentication, though.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.600]   And that means it could read and write my Twitter feed.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.680]   And I mean, this is the problem.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.200]   On the one hand, there's a real advantage to having single sign on.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.200]   It sure saves me time.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.680]   And on a mobile platform, you don't want to be entering passwords every time you use
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.920]   an application.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.520]   So the idea of connect through Facebook and connect through Twitter is great.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.360]   So now we're going to have a password manager inside of our cell phone operating system.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.360]   You know our--
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   So Steve, don't have one already?
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.360]   Steve Gibson, our security guy on security now, on this week's security now, rated a
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:04.240]   bunch of password managers for iOS.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.600]   And only a handful actually secure the password.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.920]   The most of them are just either completely unsecured password stores or barely secured
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.440]   password stores.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:19.040]   So you got to be really last pass, which is something we've recommended for a long time,
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.040]   is fine.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   Oh, thank God.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.040]   Thank God.
[00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.160]   The drop-backs of app for Android is secure now and they're working on a fix for iOS.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.520]   And that's another thing to do with the Android marketplace.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.160]   You can just put out a new fix immediately without having to deal with--
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   I know.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.160]   We're going to review this.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.160]   We have to take this down or not.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.800]   So drop-backs will work on their iOS fix right now.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.600]   And Facebook, I don't know what their official position is right.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.280]   Other than they're saying jailbreaking is the problem.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:49.520]   Wall Street Journal, which we've talked about on this show before, really seems to be making
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:55.160]   a lot of hay, accusing others of failing us in privacy.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:57.360]   I mean, they did the whole thing on cookies.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.640]   Now they're talking about Facebook applications and how they might leak your data.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:07.480]   And yet they looked at 100 Facebook applications and found no problem with any of them.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:13.280]   And still went ahead with the story yesterday about how it could happen.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:20.360]   And it just seems like there is also a certain amount of hysteria going on around this as
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   well.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:27.200]   And there's a lot of pressure on any publication that wants to generate clicks to say, "Oh,
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.200]   you're in trouble.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.840]   Oh, it could be bad."
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:34.680]   Was that also because of the Facebook IPO and the Wall Street Journal's sort of primary
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.800]   target being people who work in the financial industry?
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   I don't know.
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.920]   Here's an article from ZDNet spreading Facebook app FUD.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.760]   The backlash to the backlash.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.320]   The backlash to the backlash.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:49.120]   Selling you on Facebook, which is the Wall Street Journal article from yesterday, or the
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:55.920]   seventh, yeah, that's yesterday, ironically found no problem.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.760]   A Wall Street Journal examination of 100 of the most popular Facebook apps found that
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.560]   some seek the email address's current location and sexual preference among other details,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:09.640]   not only of app users, but also of their Facebook friends, but don't get them.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.480]   Good for you, Facebook.
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:18.960]   All right.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:19.960]   I don't know what to say.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:23.280]   Clearly, we live in a world where your stuff is leaking everywhere.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.840]   Yes.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.680]   Do you give up?
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:27.680]   What do you do?
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   You go offline?
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.320]   There's certain stuff I just don't put online.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.120]   I assume everything I'm putting online is public.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   That's a really good assumption.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.280]   But I had a political science professor 20 years ago who was like, "Assume everything
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.280]   you're saying is being recorded."
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.280]   Ooh.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.600]   Because he had worked with people who had spent a lot of time working in the Soviet Union.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.840]   And in some situations, they knew everything they were saying were being recorded as soon
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.680]   as they left the certain secured areas.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:54.600]   There will always be an underground.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:57:00.680]   And there always has to be an underground because you just can't assume that what you say in
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:06.160]   any physical form or any online form is totally as safe as you want it to be, or is only going
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.960]   to the people you want it to go to.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.720]   And that's so true online.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:10.720]   Right.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.360]   Especially with Facebook and people sharing things that you say and putting it out there.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:17.040]   What you put out there, you cannot be retrieved.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.960]   It's funny because I think we learned about the privacy settings and all that stuff a
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   while ago.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:23.120]   And now the general public is seeing what's going on.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.560]   They're like, "Oh, I'm supposed to be paying attention to this."
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.880]   So we get these incredible sensationalistic headlines.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.840]   We're like, "Oh, you're putting all this data about you."
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.000]   And we knew this for a long time.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.360]   We just kind of like, "Yeah, duh."
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.360]   We just have to go into the settings and do this.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   And the other thing.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:41.120]   And so this general hysteria is about almost educating the regular person.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.160]   It's like, "Oh, I didn't realize that.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.160]   I had no idea."
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.600]   But the people who are getting this data are being so incredibly smart about it.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.520]   It would be so easy for a company or an application that is getting data from Facebook
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:58.360]   or Google or your ISP or whatever to do such stuff that is so horribly awful that there
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.560]   will be a giant outcry.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.520]   But most of the companies that get this data are so subtle with what they use it for and
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:08.960]   how they let you know or don't let you know that they have it that people are like, "Yeah,
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:12.880]   I guess I'm technically concerned about privacy, but I haven't really been affected.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.240]   So whatever, I'll keep putting my kegher pictures on Facebook."
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.960]   What would it be to be affected?
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.760]   What would that look like?
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:21.760]   Money.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:22.760]   Money.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.080]   Not being able to buy a house because your credit rating has been damaged somehow that
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.080]   you have no idea.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.120]   Yeah, but God, your credit rate gets damaged if you just look funny at it.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.120]   I mean, it's so easy.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.960]   Well, I mean, it doesn't.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   It doesn't.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Or maybe you know...
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   Not a good job that you don't know about.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   You find your life just going south of you.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   You don't know why.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   Would you know?
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.400]   But then that's the question is, would you know why your life's gone south and you have
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   no idea why.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400]   I don't know what I did wrong.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.400]   What did you do wrong?
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   You were a publisher.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.600]   In my opinion, it's a little gay.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.600]   But okay.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.600]   Just saying.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.440]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.440]   I'm just kidding.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.440]   No, you can't take that back.
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   And now you're a homeless woman and you can't read back.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:55.440]   I think he said it was broadcast.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:57.440]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   And the Senate knows about that.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.760]   Is it lavender or is it purple?
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   That's lavender.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   That's what I thought.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.760]   It's a lovely color.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.760]   I wasn't going to say for Easter.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   I'm sick of it.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.760]   It's the name.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   My Easter shirt.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.760]   Oh, you look like an Easter egg.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.480]   In fact, you match the peeps.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   That's it.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   Peep-a-plosh.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.080]   Peeps exactly the same color as the peeps.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:20.440]   I'm not hard at this for a Jewish guy to wear an Easter shirt.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:25.040]   Eileen said, how are we going to get a panel on Easter Sunday?
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.240]   I said, just ask Jews.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.480]   There you go.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:31.760]   And then ironically Joshua Topolsky had to cancel.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.920]   So anyway, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:39.680]   I know I'm just offensive and horrible and please watch Game On instead.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.680]   Oh, sorry.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.680]   You can't.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:46.920]   There's a lovely Don Rickles documentary.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   It's great.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   It is actually.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   It's great.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   And there's one on Joan Rivers.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   Have you seen that one?
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.320]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.280]   Are you guys, that sound was my focus tone.
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.280]   It's focus.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.200]   Eileen is like, instead of a dog collar shot.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.840]   That's the focus tone.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   That's the focus tone.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.680]   Tech, tech, tech.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.760]   I blame it all on the peeps.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.000]   I had too many and I'm crashing right now.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.800]   And you had a mocha and you had the cupcake too?
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.800]   I did.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.800]   I ate a cupcake.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800]   That's a good producer.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.800]   You got like a list of this.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.800]   And now I feel nauseous.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.800]   10 minutes.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.520]   Do you guys get Twitter spam?
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520]   I thought it.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.120]   I thought the idea of spam and Twitter, they just don't.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.520]   You couldn't have spam on Twitter.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.520]   Yes, there is.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.320]   I mean, it's always up every few weeks, like little waves of it.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.320]   So what does that mean?
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   Twitter spam.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.800]   You just get links to things that are, what's the one someone is saying bad things about
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.800]   you?
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.360]   Click this link and then you get the virus.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.360]   And they use the @ reply?
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:39.360]   So they're like that, Rafe.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.280]   They want you to click on a link.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.560]   So that's how, because here's the issue for me with Twitter and spam is you follow
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.680]   people, right?
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.680]   So you don't follow spammers.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.680]   You only follow people.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.840]   Yeah, but your Twitter app will show you every time you're added.
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.200]   @Rafe will always pop up.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.200]   Well stop that.
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.200]   And stop that.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.200]   What?
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.480]   I don't want to see when people are talking about me because I'm a narcissist, aren't
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   we?
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.480]   No.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.800]   So you, but I mean, you say, are you looking at people who are at replying you or even
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.040]   just anytime people follow you?
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.400]   Somebody can basically be like, you know, they don't have to follow you.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.920]   Yeah, those guys say like, you know, they say, you know, @patrick Norton and then the funny
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   one.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.400]   So they're putting this in the @ reply.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.960]   That would be a, that would be a normal way of doing it.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   Anything with the word iPad in it.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.960]   And same thing.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.960]   Let's see.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.960]   You get one of the new iPad three or four.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   Testing.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.960]   And you get, you always get Twitter.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.600]   So every time I write about it, I have to make sure I'm spam.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.480]   Just put iPad, iPad.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   What else?
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.480]   What other shit, what other shit do you put in?
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.480]   Viagra.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   Or maybe I should just say I'm, I'm not, no, I probably shouldn't say that.
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.480]   No.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.480]   No.
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.920]   I, you know, I, I think testing Twitter, iPad, Viagra, loan.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920]   loan.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.920]   I need a loan.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:50.320]   I need a loan, a home mortgage.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.320]   And let's just sit back and watch.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.320]   We have an, anybody else have a spam that can even have recently?
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.320]   What other spam.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.040]   What, how it's going to trigger some spam.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.920]   Um, John C. de Vorex in the audience.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.160]   No one gets spam.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160]   This is epic.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.160]   Okay.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:03.520]   I'm just going to hit return on this now.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.760]   What you're saying is because I tweeted that, and by the way, I probably lost a thousand
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   followers right now.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:08.760]   They really leave.
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.960]   You've been hacked.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.920]   As I tweeted that I presumably now I'm going to get a bunch of that replies that say free
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:14.920]   iPad.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.920]   Yes.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.920]   All right.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920]   Oh yeah.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920]   Look at that.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   Seriously.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920]   I'm going to be like somebody retweeted me.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920]   Probably.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   You're right.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920]   There it is.
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.920]   Get your free iPad here.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.920]   I don't know if that guy is just messing with you with stops.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920]   Open thing.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.920]   But see, I wouldn't, I'd be stupid to click that.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   But obviously that's still spam.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.320]   If you're like, what's your on an iPad?
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   Are you doing, do you see me?
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.320]   You're on the OS 10.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.320]   Can't be heard.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.440]   What can it do?
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.680]   I'm getting more spam for people watching the show deciding that they want to be on Twitch.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.680]   I'm not a spammer.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680]   Yeah, nothing.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   I got nothing.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.800]   Where's one?
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.320]   Have a free iPad, google.com.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.720]   I think that's a fake.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:59.600]   So anyway, Twitter has spent $700,000 pursuing spammers in federal court.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   That's nothing.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.320]   I know.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.800]   They filed lawsuit against companies that create tools to automate posting to people on spam
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.200]   on Twitter.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.400]   That's what would presumably, that's where I would have gotten flooded is just this automated.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.560]   Oh, he said, I bet.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:22.120]   So they named five defendants tweet attacks, tweet at her, tweet buddy, and then two people,
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.280]   which Twitter says are the biggest defenders in the spamming racket, arguing they're the
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.760]   arms dealers to those who fill the surface with fake profiles.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.880]   Go after the guys who provide the tools.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.840]   And you know, you shut down the tools, you might shut down the spammers.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.400]   So this is good.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.280]   This is, yeah, something they should have done.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.960]   I mean, tweet, Twitter spam is especially annoying because it feels like such an intimate
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960]   medium.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   Right.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   And we don't, and the filters aren't set up there.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:52.320]   So every time you see at your name, it's like, oh, this is jolt of excitement.
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   And it's like, right.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.880]   I think it would hurt Twitter if they didn't go after this because if you did have that
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.840]   constantly, they're like, oh, everything I'm getting a spam anyway, I'm not going to
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.840]   use it anymore.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.880]   And then you lose all your, all your users.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.840]   And then you complete your businesses is completely screwed.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:10.320]   So the irony is I'm getting more spam in my chat room, offering free iPads than I was
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.320]   getting on Twitter.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.560]   I don't get a lot of spam.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.320]   Maybe I don't, maybe people don't know.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   Don't notice me.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   I don't know.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:17.880]   Um, I are C spam.
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.480]   New iPad Viagra app.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.480]   Get it free now.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:29.000]   See none of this big gay porn iPad with free Viagra and fried spam on the side.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   Boom.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.400]   Just give it 24 hours.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.400]   All right.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.880]   Get the new Google glasses right now.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:42.680]   I, I don't click here for an app to make your iPad growth three inches in just two weeks.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   Guaranteed.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.080]   That's the iPad transformer.
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.440]   So I'm not actually getting a lot of spam, but maybe I just, I've led a clean life.
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.320]   And, yeah, I'm going to try to fish for spam.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.920]   So you fish for spam on your account.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.680]   I'll let you, I'll let you take it.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:04:59.680]   I'll find spam anyway.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.680]   So why not?
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.000]   Um, I'm a, uh, let's take a break.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.360]   I want to talk a little bit of a Pinterest.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.320]   I'm getting calls from people who are worried about using Pinterest saying, you know, because
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:15.080]   there was this, uh, lawyer slash photographer Kirsten who said I'm deleting my Pinterest
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   account.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.360]   I can't use it because I could get sued.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.520]   We'll talk about that.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.040]   Well, we've got Australians in the audience.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.240]   So we're going to talk about how the Australian government invented Wi-Fi.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.520]   Isn't that, isn't that cool?
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.520]   Thank you.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   Or not.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   Or not.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:38.920]   Uh, and the latest on mega upload there, they're pissed.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.680]   The mega upload, dikim.com is mad and not in English.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.520]   And he's, and he's going to take a step.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.560]   That's before we do that, talk about what to do if you want a new iPhone, a new iPad.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:58.000]   How many of us have a gadget closets or drawers or in Patrick's case, entire rooms filled
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   with old crap?
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.960]   Sarah actually made me get rid of most of that.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   Is she?
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.880]   Now I hope she sent you to gazelle.com because you could have gotten cash for that, right?
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.680]   No, the stuff I had.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.960]   We tried to give away.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.360]   We actually tried to give away a box of your, we had a lot of people in the box crap.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.760]   I just didn't want to pay for the shipping.
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.800]   That's the problem of the 45 pound box of tech crap.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   Sarah's on it.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.680]   Aren't it?
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.520]   So gazelle.com go there right now.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.560]   Their whole idea is get those gadgets moving so you can get the new gadgets that you want.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.560]   Visit gazelle.com.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.000]   Now I have to say one thing that they've done is they've, they've reduced the range of
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.040]   products to basically the stuff that most of us have, the Apple stuff, blackberries,
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.480]   lots of people with blackberries, uh, androids from the big manufacturers in Nokia.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.240]   So they've really kind of narrowed it down.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.280]   That actually makes it a lot easier because if you have an iPad, for instance, you just
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.080]   click iPad, click get an offer.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.200]   And then you've got a whole menu of items here.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.800]   I have my 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi iPad.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.000]   How much is that worth?
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.240]   Hey, I'll take it.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240]   I'll take it.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.240]   280 bucks.
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.200]   Now you can get paid with cash by a check PayPal.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.840]   My suggestion to do the Amazon gift card because it gave, give you a bonus 5% when you
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.520]   choose Amazon.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.200]   Whether a data specialist will remove your data, you don't have to worry about that.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.200]   And you get the cash to buy something new.
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.600]   They pay the postage even.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.840]   So you know, and if you can say, is it good or is it flawless?
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.880]   It's 20 bucks less if it's good.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.880]   Be honest.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.240]   They'll, you know, that's fine.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:29.960]   Sometimes I've actually get, get a lot of messages from people say, you know, I said
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.760]   it was kind of flawed condition.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.840]   They said, no, no, this is fine.
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:38.600]   They gave me more money than I thought.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.680]   Sign up for the gazelle account or give them your email address.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:44.120]   They'll send you shipping details and they'll show you how it's going as this stuff is on
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.120]   its way to you.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:50.920]   Gazelle is really a great way to trade in your old stuff and pay for your new stuff.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.920]   It is fantastic.
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.720]   And I want you to try it right now.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.800]   Gazelle.com G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.600]   Don't sell it.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   Gazelle it.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.360]   See if Patrick could only know.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.800]   You have literally $5 or $6 with the stuff you could have.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.280]   It's only Gazelle it existed.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.640]   Do they're bowling balls in there?
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:11.640]   Things like that?
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:12.640]   No.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.640]   Cannon balls.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   Hammers.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.440]   Hammers we keep.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:23.840]   Mega upload says, you know, this is the company that was shut down by the feds for piracy.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:30.960]   They say we're going to erase our servers because we aren't going to get a fair trial.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.520]   Mega upload has, now these are servers in Virginia.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:39.080]   They asked the Virginia judge overseeing the case to spare the data on its servers from
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   deletion.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:48.120]   They had at least 1100 servers holding 25 petabytes from Carpathia hosting in Virginia.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.080]   The government froze the assets.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.080]   Mega upload couldn't pay the bills.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:57.800]   Carpathia said, hey, it's costing thousands of dollars a day to maintain these servers.
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:03.520]   And they go to the judge, say you either give us money or give us permission to re erase
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.760]   them and reuse them.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:11.840]   What I don't understand is why mega upload, mega upload is saying if that data is erased,
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.680]   we can't defend ourselves, which makes perfect sense.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.080]   But if that data is erased, can't, I mean, it's habeas corpus, the prosecution also
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.080]   has nothing, isn't it?
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080]   Right.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.080]   So I'm a little confused.
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.560]   Well, the government ejected and said, no, there's, there could be child pornography on
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.560]   here.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.560]   They won't.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.560]   They won't.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.560]   Don't erase it.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.560]   Okay.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.800]   Not that that's what they're actually going after mega upload.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800]   It's very confusing.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:33.800]   You're right, Brake.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.800]   I don't understand it.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.480]   You have their own copy of the some of the stuff on the servers anyway.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.000]   So the fact is there's two copies right now.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.680]   There's the one the government has and there's the one that's on Carpathia's servers and
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.800]   that's costing like 9,000 bucks a day to keep.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.560]   The government has copied selected data.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.560]   Right.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.800]   And that's why mega uploads afraid of this because if they lose everything they have,
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.400]   they're saying that, oh, what are we going to do now?
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   We can't say that.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.800]   Yeah, we, the majority of our stuff was, and this is how the US is going to be very selective
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.800]   on.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800]   They've cherry picked right.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   Right.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800]   They, they, they save all the illegal stuff.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800]   Look, we found a movie.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800]   We go to jail.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   Right.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:04.800]   25 files.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:08.760]   We found 25 files were well, so mega uploads saying that the, that the feds should pay
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.200]   for the server, the data to be saved because in fact it's part of their defense and it,
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.600]   and a defendant has the rights to have that evidence preserved.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.720]   It's in the hands of the feds, preserve that data.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:25.520]   If the government won't pay the bill, mega upload says, we'll cover the cost from our
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.640]   own funds, but in order to do that, you have to unfreeze our funds because we don't have
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   any money.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.240]   But this is a mess.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.720]   And, and the feds are saying, no, no, no, we're not going to, we're, we're, the feds
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.280]   are basically saying scorched earth, we're not going to give an inch.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.800]   We're not going to give mega upload.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.400]   That's worked out so well in some of these lawsuits.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.280]   Well, it's also, I mean, you look at this and it's like, okay, so, so when are they
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280]   going after iCloud?
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   When are they going after Dropbox?
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.760]   When are they going after any tool that could potentially be used to violate copyright?
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.760]   Right.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.160]   Because the other thing that the side of this, yeah, okay, a lot of people, maybe a lot
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.320]   of people doing nefarious stuff on mega upload, but a lot of people are just storing stuff
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.320]   cheaply there.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.680]   And they cannot access their data.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.080]   They are locked out.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.080]   Right.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.920]   And that's just messy.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:19.960]   Apparently the Australian government, they're not storing my data.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:27.600]   Invented Wi-Fi, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is going
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:36.600]   to get a fairly massive payment, $229 million settlement from Broadcom, T-Mobile, AT&T, and
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:47.800]   Lenovo, because Siro had also got $205 million in 2009 from similar settlement in East Texas,
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.480]   because Siro invented Wi-Fi.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.280]   Apparently.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.680]   Somebody had to, I guess.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.920]   I always thought it was an open standard.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:00.920]   I thought so too.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.920]   I understood that 11.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.480]   There'd be his Wi-Fi.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.400]   So Siro was founded in 1926 as the Australian government's research lab.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.880]   Yes, we have Australians in the audience who are nodding.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.160]   So it must be true.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.080]   During World War II, it focused on things like food preservation, but they've researched,
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:20.280]   it's kind of like they're DARPA, right?
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:21.920]   They've researched all sorts of stuff.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.960]   Most of the budget comes from the government, like the National Institutes of Health.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.800]   6,400 employees, most of them are scientists.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:37.360]   Siro astrophysicist John O'Sullivan was tasked in the early 90s with building a high-speed
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.680]   wireless network.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.840]   You know about this.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   This is famous in Australia.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.600]   Nobody else has heard about this in the US.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.120]   After many of the key technologies already existed, and the ultimate relevance and success
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:53.280]   of O'Sullivan's project is now one of the most heavily litigated issues in the history
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.920]   of technology.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:04.080]   But these companies, not Acer, Atharos, Wi-Fi chips at Broadcom, Wi-Fi chips at AT&T, Gateway
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:13.440]   Lenovo, T-Mobile Verizon and Sony have agreed to pay $229 million to Siro.
[01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.400]   Siro now says 90% of the Wi-Fi enabled device market has licensed its patent.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.400]   Did you ever heard of this?
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.400]   Mm-hmm.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.400]   That's amazing.
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.320]   Congratulations to the Australians.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.520]   Yes, there they are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.320]   I want my peeps back.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.760]   No, that's great.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760]   Fascinating.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.960]   I had no idea.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:38.040]   The Australians have been in Wi-Fi.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.200]   Are they asking for an ongoing consideration?
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.960]   I read somewhere they wanted like $4 per Wi-Fi chipset.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   Wow.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.760]   They've gone way down from that.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760]   Okay, wow.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.240]   According to the article, it's kind of, it's OFDM.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.120]   It's basically orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.120]   Yeah, for now.
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.120]   Focusing and both interleaving.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.120]   I'm sitting between two very smart people.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.000]   I'll just let you two talk.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   He's smart.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   I'm reading.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   OFDM.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   Wow, that's interesting.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.200]   But basically it's just one of the key ways the wireless communication works with inside
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.200]   of Wi-Fi.
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.600]   I wonder if they invented this little thing.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.420]   This is something that was reported in the Brian X Chen writing in the New York Times
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.920]   Bitts blog said, I know.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.660]   He's actually talking about Justin Watt, who's a web engineer who was staying at the courtyard
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.820]   Marriott in Manhattan.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.980]   And he noticed something odd on his personal blog.
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:29.500]   There was just kind of this blank line.
[01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.260]   And he realized he's spent some time on the coding for the web.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:39.340]   He realized the hotel's internet service was injecting code into every page he visited.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:44.340]   A little research, a conversation on Hacker News, and it's turned out that there is a
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:47.060]   company that does this.
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:55.500]   It's a revenue extraction gateway or an RXG from a company called RGNets.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:00.060]   The system rewrites every webpage you're using on the free Wi-Fi at the hotel on the
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.780]   fly so that it can include a banner ad.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.780]   Oh my God.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:08.180]   I don't think the Australians patented this.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.180]   They wish they had.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:11.300]   Some guy in Jersey patent.
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:17.540]   It's the online store selling the hardware to hotels to provide the service calls it web
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.180]   experience manipulation.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.420]   They admit it.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   That's good.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:26.380]   So apparently the courtyard Marriott's marketing director referred inquiries from the New York
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.380]   Times to the head office.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:33.700]   And in New York, and the spokesman said, I'll have to talk to the national office, the
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.820]   automated phone system at RGNet hung up on them.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.620]   And they didn't respond to email.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:40.620]   It's Jersey.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.380]   Apparently, no ads.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:44.860]   Just there was a bla-- at this guy, so it was smart enough saying, well, there shouldn't
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.660]   be that extra space in my blog.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:48.660]   Is this really that bad?
[01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.660]   I mean, if we're getting free Wi-Fi.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:50.660]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:51.660]   You're getting free Wi-Fi.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.140]   I mean, I know I was in an airport and they're like, you're not free, buddy.
[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:56.660]   You have to watch an ad before I can get Wi-Fi for free at the airport.
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:57.660]   Same thing.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:58.660]   And I was like, OK.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.660]   It's a little more obvious.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:03.660]   But I mean, I'm just wondering how often when we sign the back of something on-- like,
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.940]   oh, I'm going to get my hotel room.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.740]   And there are all these things I'm not reading.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.740]   Right.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.740]   What if it's actually included in there?
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.140]   And people are going to say, I had notice.
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.020]   I am not going to read a Yule to check into hotel room.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.100]   People don't do it with car rentals either.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.100]   Oh, yes you will.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.820]   All those terms and car rentals and nobody reads those.
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:20.340]   I know.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.340]   They obfuscate them to hide everything in the--
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.220]   But eventually, you just like, oh, I don't care.
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.580]   I want the hotel room.
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.420]   I want the Wi-Fi.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.260]   There is a difference between a pre-roll.
[01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.940]   So you sign up to the Wi-Fi and you've got to watch an ad before you get online.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:31.460]   Fine.
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:35.140]   There's a difference between that and actually messing with the pages themselves.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.380]   That's breaking the net.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   I kind of agree with you.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.380]   Because who knows what can go wrong?
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.820]   When you get in there and monkey with code.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:45.140]   Maybe it's going to be having advertising inserted into a web page when I'm using the
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:48.820]   hotel Wi-Fi is probably the least scary thing about using a hotel Wi-Fi.
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.460]   That's absolutely true.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:54.580]   Hang out with like-- you know, hang out at Defcon, hang out with Darren over a hack five
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.940]   and start finding out what people are doing when you don't even have to.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:00.540]   If you open your iTunes at a hotel, you could see everybody else's iTunes.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.740]   You know, we're all on the same network.
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.260]   Right.
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:08.860]   But just to be clear, what-- where this gets really hairy is, OK, so your page is now
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.620]   has an ad put in the middle of it.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.740]   OK, that ad-- who is running that ad server?
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.940]   What code is running that ad?
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:14.940]   That's the question.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:15.940]   What is that code?
[01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:16.940]   Yeah.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.780]   You know, you're wide open.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.620]   They're inserting code into pages.
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:20.820]   And that's exactly--
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.820]   It's like--
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:22.820]   How?
[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:23.820]   --going to Twitch.
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:26.300]   You never know what you could trust anymore.
[01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.820]   That's exactly how that flashback Trojan worked.
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:32.340]   And it inserts code when you went to the-- what it was in that gear, dealing site, and then
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.340]   inserted code.
[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:34.340]   And there you go.
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:37.020]   So I should take all the computers off the network now for our own safety.
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.020]   I'm never going to--
[01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.020]   There you go.
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.020]   That's on network everything.
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.980]   As long as I can still use Pinterest, I don't care.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.580]   Let's go back and sneak your net and it'll be OK.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:50.340]   How many Pinterest users are there here?
[01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.340]   Active users.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.340]   High lean.
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.340]   Or account holders.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.340]   High lean.
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.340]   Is the only one?
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.340]   No.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.340]   No.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.340]   That's the man in the audience who is--
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.340]   And one guy who's wearing a lavender shirt.
[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.340]   And after that, it's a-- no.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.340]   In fact, it's only--
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.340]   How did you know?
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:07.780]   It's only 57% of Pinterest users are women, which means according to my careful
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.780]   calculations, 43% are men or--
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.780]   Or others.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.780]   Or others.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.260]   I have a Pinterest account.
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:23.860]   There has been some talk lately that Pinterest is kind of letting you take the risk.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:28.060]   Apparently, when you pin stuff and then the youla and so forth, there's a big warning
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:33.020]   now that if you put copyright material on here, it's on your head.
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.660]   Let it be on your head.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:40.900]   And there's a lawyer and a photographer named Kirsten, who's gotten a lot of attention,
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:46.180]   because she's saying she's tearfully deleting her Pinterest account.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:50.140]   I think this is great social engineering on the part of Pinterest.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.140]   I think it's going to happen.
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:53.660]   I think it's going to be a paper wall between--
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.780]   A thin-- and when I say paper wall, I mean paper wall in front of a Mac truck.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:01.740]   I think if somebody decides to sue Pinterest because of copyright violations, the one
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:06.140]   line in the youla that says our end users are responsible for what they post, not us.
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.140]   Talk to YouTube.
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.460]   Talk to Google's lawyers about that.
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:13.500]   Every site says you're responsible for copyright violation.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:14.500]   Don't do it.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.980]   Pinterest does what YouTube does.
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.420]   They offer a DMCA takedown, so they're covered.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.060]   It's safe harbor.
[01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.940]   This is just the usual hysteria.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:26.220]   Why I tearfully deleted my Pinterest inspiration boards.
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.820]   Well, this person is a lawyer.
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.420]   And lawyers look at the world differently from the past.
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:34.020]   They say, well, he doesn't like people.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.900]   If you've read a friend go through law school, you spend like six months of your life hearing
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:42.180]   about torts, which is basically like why a five-year-old getting caught in railroad
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.380]   tracks in 1903 changed everything about seat belts.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:48.580]   And you're sitting there and they map out this really insane thing of logic.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.300]   It's a different way of looking at the world.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:53.860]   And then you realize that the law controls you because we're a republic.
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.620]   And then you twitch a lot for a while and then you realize your friend's insane because
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.300]   they're in law school and you move on.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:03.940]   So this woman's like, I'm posting images from this website that I think are pretty, but
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:09.180]   they're telling me that I am personally responsible legally for posting those images.
[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:12.380]   And if they decided to sue me, then I'm SOL.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.900]   But the problem is you already are SOL.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.820]   The mere act of creating anything.
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.820]   And nobody's going to say--
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:18.820]   So you come on.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:19.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.820]   Except for the RA, the MPAA, pissed off, 20 photographers.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.940]   Well, don't put songs on Pinterest.
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:25.940]   OK.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:26.940]   And don't put movies.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.260]   And don't put pictures.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:30.940]   You can put pictures until people start suing over that.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:31.940]   Right.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.980]   I mean, this has been the case for anybody who's ever blogged ever.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:34.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.980]   You go.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:36.980]   And so this is the weird thing.
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:37.980]   It's like, oh, it's on Pinterest.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:38.980]   So now people are freaking out.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   I mean, it doesn't make a difference.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:40.980]   I've been through law school.
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:42.780]   And the thing is, I'm like, you know what?
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.780]   Go for it.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:48.740]   If I already know that I'm responsible for this, every single time you do almost anything.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:52.660]   If I start humming a song or I talk about a baseball game, I'm breaking the law all the
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.140]   time, apparently.
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.740]   But there are chances--
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:57.820]   You're a chance that you take and a chance that you don't.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:02.620]   And no judge is going to say, oh, I as, you put a picture on there on your site.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:04.460]   You're in deep doo-doo.
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:07.420]   Maybe if it's the most famous thing and I deleted all the rest of them, you could never
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.420]   get it.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:10.420]   And I've done something amazing, which would be very impressive.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.140]   Roll a thumb, Mr. Attorney, I as actor.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.140]   Which I will not give legal advice.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.140]   No.
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.140]   This is not-- I'm not asking for legal advice.
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.140]   I'm not an author on this show.
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:18.140]   He's already a guy.
[01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:19.780]   He's a disclaimer.
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:24.980]   But isn't it the case that if I'm not either taking credit for something I didn't create
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:31.220]   or making money on something I didn't create, that probably the damages are de minimis.
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.700]   Nobody-- no court's going to give me-- give anybody anything.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:36.660]   It's a frivolous case.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.660]   Well, technically--
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:41.060]   It's different if I'm claiming responsibility-- like playing I did it or I'm making money
[01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.060]   on it.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.060]   Technically, you'll be infringing, right?
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:44.060]   Because you're part of the thing.
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:45.060]   You're infringing, right?
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.060]   You broke the law already.
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:47.060]   The question is, will there be anybody--
[01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:48.060]   But no damage.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.060]   --cutting after you?
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:50.060]   Probably not.
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:51.060]   No.
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.060]   Because there's no damage.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:53.060]   It's de minimis.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:54.060]   The no damage thing.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.060]   No.
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.060]   Minor.
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:57.060]   Minor teeny-weeny.
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:22:00.460]   But yeah, so I mean, it's still risky to take when you bother to do any of this stuff.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:04.340]   I, you know, taken the moral high ground in front of a couple of lawyers that generally
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:06.300]   won't catch you very far.
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.860]   That is the truth.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.300]   Pinterest-- one of the reasons it's of interest at all.
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:12.300]   I mean, Tumblr's the same.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.700]   But one of the reasons it's of interest at all is because Pinterest is now the number
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.460]   three social site.
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:24.860]   This year, it went from 50 million users to 11 million users in February 17.8.
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.420]   Let's scratch that reverse it.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.420]   50,000 to 11 million.
[01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:29.820]   Yeah, 50,000 to 11.
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:30.820]   It's ramping.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.820]   I'm off 17.8.
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:32.820]   It's a walk-in.
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.820]   It's a newsroom at CNET.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.460]   And some two people are talking to each other and say, oh, send me that recipe.
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:38.260]   And the other one says, no, pin it.
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.260]   Like, don't pin it.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.860]   I like such a thing.
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:42.860]   Number one is Facebook.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:43.860]   Number two is Twitter.
[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.860]   Number three is Pinterest.
[01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.500]   Number four, LinkedIn.
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.100]   Number five is something I've never heard of.
[01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:51.100]   According to my experience tagged.
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:53.500]   Oh, tagged is the real deal.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.180]   Then Google plus MySpace, MyYearBook, MyLife.
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.820]   My Yearbook's around still.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:22:59.820]   And Tumblr.
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.860]   Tumblr's a social network.
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:02.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:03.860]   You can follow.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.860]   Tumblr's very social.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:07.940]   In fact, most of the features of Pinterest are really Tumblr.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.940]   You can reblog.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.140]   It's Tumblr without a focus on it.
[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:15.100]   I did a story on why the whole world, everything on the web is starting to look like Pinterest
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.100]   right now.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:18.020]   Isn't it delicious trying the same thing a while ago?
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:21.780]   And after there's other guys, YouTube founders bought Delicious from Yahoo.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.140]   They showed this graphical way that they wanted to show links.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:25.460]   And it looked a lot like this.
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:28.140]   There's a JavaScript construct, I forget what it's called, which is going to get me in big
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:32.820]   trouble, where the whole idea of the half even grid where it's even this way, yeah,
[01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.420]   out that way, has been around forever and Pinterest has just made it gigantic.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.220]   It's like the newspaper.
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.220]   It's a newspaper.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.220]   It's a magazine.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.220]   I still think that it's brilliant.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:46.980]   Once they put ads in there, you won't know what's your friends pin, what's your ad?
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.220]   You're like, oh, that's really cool that Nike ads.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.220]   Wait, it's a Nike ad.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.220]   Why am I on fab.com?
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:52.220]   No, it would have been.
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.860]   It just seems like it's really so funny.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:00.620]   I want to end this with something that I think it's just was a matter of time.
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:03.180]   And I'm glad it finally happened.
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:11.580]   Randy Zuckerberg launching on Bravo, a new reality show called Silicon Valley featuring
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.540]   and I'll show you who it's featuring because I have a link here of the seven stars from
[01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.260]   Business Insider.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:27.780]   I believe these people perfectly represent the people we know in Silicon Valley.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:33.420]   This is Hermione Way, a video director at the next web and founder of newspaper.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.420]   She's a real matter.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:35.420]   She's a real person.
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:36.420]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:37.420]   Ben Way.
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:38.420]   I don't know.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.420]   Are they related?
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.420]   Must be founder of Rainmakers.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.420]   That's her brother.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:42.420]   Her brother.
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:47.860]   Kim Taylor, account director at Ampush Media.
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:52.340]   They say she's the female RE gold.
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.220]   Moved to California to do a startup with three ex-wall streeters who wanted out of
[01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:59.140]   finance after the crisis recruited her from Chicago.
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:04.500]   Jay Hollanda, model producer and founder of a stealth startup from LA.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:06.700]   Marcus Lovengood.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:12.380]   I'm not, I'm, I'm not.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:16.180]   Founder of Future Leap, a social media production company.
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:20.140]   Dwight Crow, he's a programmer.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:24.420]   He's a founder of Car Sabi.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.340]   David Murray.
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:27.420]   Also a pro.
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.420]   There are only two programmers.
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:29.420]   He's this guy in this guy.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:30.420]   He's a programmer.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.420]   Like I just say, like bronies.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420]   I was like, is that a thing?
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420]   He's a programmer.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.420]   Look at him.
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.420]   That's a programmer.
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.900]   If there ever was one, I guess there's one.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:42.060]   And Randy, who's not going to be on camera, she's Mark Zuckerberg's sister, she'll be
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.340]   producing the show.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:45.060]   Are we ready for Silicon Valley?
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:46.060]   About time.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.060]   It's a bad time.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.660]   I don't care how inaccurate, how good looking it is.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:51.780]   If it makes, you know, brings glory to the geeks.
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.180]   Yeah, because what?
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.100]   Orange County Housewives brought glory to.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.460]   Now, how are they going to do this?
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.460]   Are they going to put them all?
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.340]   Well, if you're going to go there.
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:00.340]   But it's, but it is.
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:05.180]   But that's the whole point of reality shows is, is, is, is bringing out, bringing a
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:10.380]   particular blend of people to bring out the worst possible combination of human characteristics
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:14.620]   and then editing it carefully to make sure everybody looks awful.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:18.180]   And it started, I, I, I, I have this, I have this feeling, if you go back like the original
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:23.700]   MTV houses, that there's going to be this link of KAs that, that ended up as producers
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.220]   that ended up working at other networks.
[01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:30.540]   And you can probably chain this entire diagram of the entire sort of ecosystem of television
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.540]   production around reality.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:32.540]   How do you make this?
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:34.900]   Now, see, I haven't seen the housewives show.
[01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:35.900]   They don't all live together.
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:36.900]   No.
[01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.540]   And big brother, they're all like living together.
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.540]   Right.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:40.540]   How will you make this?
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.540]   So, so what do you just, how do you connect the dots?
[01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.220]   They all live together?
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.260]   Or are they, are you just following them around and they?
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.260]   That's the magic.
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.980]   I don't understand.
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:51.500]   You put them on an island?
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.500]   I don't understand.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.500]   I don't know.
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.500]   I think they're just following them around.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.500]   They just follow these people around.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.140]   And their paths intersect and they hook up.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:58.140]   Right.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.140]   Obviously.
[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.140]   They hook up.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.140]   You got to have hookups.
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:02.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.140]   Okay.
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.140]   Well, here it comes.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:08.180]   How did Bravo going, go from being like the prestige?
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:13.060]   Like we're going to do operas and cultural events to this?
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:16.780]   But you have to see the trailer for, this is just one of five shows and they're all
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:20.300]   reality shows about industries like fashion or restaurants.
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.300]   Oh, interesting.
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.300]   So, that's the new Bravo show.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.300]   And they all look exactly the same.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.700]   I mean, you take these people and you put them in the, in the restaurant show.
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:26.700]   I mean, these are real people.
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:27.700]   You put them in the restaurant show.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:28.860]   It'd be the same show.
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.260]   I only heard the trailer because it was playing on somebody else's computer.
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.500]   I thought it was a parody.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:33.500]   I flat out thought.
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:39.100]   I remember this, it was the same old reality formula, the same like sound bites and everything.
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:40.820]   And then Tom, tell me, no, it's real.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.580]   This is the, they're really doing this on Bravo.
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.580]   Like, oh, really?
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.220]   I mean, if you look at the Bravo list, is this it?
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:46.220]   I want to find it.
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:50.740]   Can you imagine doing a reality show based on what Silicon Valley is really like?
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.100]   A bunch of guys sitting around programming all day.
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:54.660]   Well, it'd be really boring.
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.660]   I'd be getting tacos.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:56.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:58.700]   I mean, or pitch meetings or VCs.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:00.860]   No, I happen to think pitch meetings are fascinating.
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.420]   And I, you know, so, but I don't know.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   I do with the Shark Tank.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.420]   But then the Shark Tank Dragons thing.
[01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   The Shark Tank Dragons thing.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:07.420]   The Shark Tank.
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.420]   The Bravo trailers.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:09.420]   And this is what I found.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   Those are awesome.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:13.660]   I can't wait to watch that.
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.740]   I love watching that.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.380]   I love the internet.
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:18.380]   Okay.
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.660]   I found apparently a company that makes trailers.
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:21.900]   Is it Rio Bravo?
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:22.900]   No.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:23.900]   It's BravoTV.com.
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.300]   Is that, is that where the trailer is?
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.140]   I love looking at the list of shows around the world.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:35.140]   The show is a lot of people who are watching the show.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:38.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:41.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:43.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:46.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:47.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:50.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:51.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:54.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:55.140]   I'm going to show you a couple of videos.
[01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:57.140]   Well, MSNBC, what changed MSNBC?
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:00.140]   Yeah, we were there.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:06.140]   Thank God, because I wouldn't be here if MSNBC hadn't gone real.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:09.140]   I can't find it, but we'll leave that as an exercise for...
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:11.140]   Actually, I'm sure the chat room is founded by now.
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:12.140]   Yeah, here it is.
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:13.140]   I should just...
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.140]   I'm in the middle of the video.
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:15.140]   That's the problem.
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:16.140]   I'm starting to find it.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:18.140]   Well, I see I as I see your post.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.140]   Is it there?
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.140]   Yeah, there's a video.
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:23.140]   Bravo announces new shows returning.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:25.140]   But it's in the middle of the video.
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:26.140]   I just don't know what time it is.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.140]   They all look the same.
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:31.140]   Well, we can just run the whole thing except that Bravo would then pull this off of...
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:33.140]   You can be moving badly to Silicon Valley version.
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:34.140]   Don't run.
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.140]   They're put on your Pinterest.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:36.140]   I'll Pinterest it.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.140]   Bravo has the shows you love.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.140]   That's too fast.
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.140]   I can't follow it.
[01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.140]   You're the YouTube pull down.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:47.140]   Yeah, well, we will, of course, but that's all right.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:51.140]   Because you'd think Bravo would want us to air a promo on our show.
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:52.140]   It's odd.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:54.140]   Then they do the five promos on this one.
[01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.140]   Oh, this is...
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:30:03.140]   I saw Charlotte who works in a gallery.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:06.140]   So this is the art world.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:08.140]   And then we'll move along and see what it is.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.140]   This guy didn't work for me.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.140]   He was like the starting star and wanted to be just around him.
[01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:13.140]   They're all the same.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:14.140]   They're seven people.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.140]   Somewhere.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:17.140]   That's the restaurant one.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.140]   Seriously?
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:19.140]   Seriously?
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.140]   It's crazy stuff.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.140]   It's insane.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:23.140]   They're going to change the internet.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:24.140]   Oh, here it is.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:29.140]   It's high school, but it's only the smart kids and everyone has a lot of money.
[01:30:29.140 --> 01:30:30.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.140]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:32.140]   My vehicle.
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:33.140]   It's a vehicle.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:39.140]   I'm in the other Silicon Valley, the shadow Silicon Valley, where not everyone is brilliant
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.140]   and we don't have a lot of people.
[01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.140]   We'll have a living.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.140]   That's right.
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:45.140]   Yeah, I must have missed this Silicon Valley.
[01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.140]   Wow.
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:50.140]   Well, the one they always talked about on TechCrunch too, where every so often I'd read about an event on TechCrunch
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:53.140]   or somewhere and I'd be like, really?
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:56.140]   I was at that event, but it was completely different for me.
[01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:57.140]   Where was the hot tub?
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:30:59.140]   Yeah, it was Sergey Brinkley's class.
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:02.140]   It was it was Scoble and Shell in the hot tub, so you know, okay.
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:06.140]   Yeah, you don't really want to see that.
[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:07.140]   That's still a cone valley.
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:09.140]   It's a whole nother show.
[01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:12.140]   I want to thank Rafe Needleman for joining us today.
[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:16.140]   Rafe is at CNET, where he produces the reporters round table and many other things.
[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.140]   Of course, his writer also for CNET.
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.140]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.140]   Anything at all?
[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.140]   Startup secrets.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:31.140]   I'm doing this series on Rafe's radar, which is www.raferadar.com, where you can see tips and tricks from people who are in the startup world for real.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:32.140]   Oh, I'd love to know that.
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:34.140]   He had to put the WWN.
[01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.140]   WWW is required.
[01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.140]   Is that a CNET thing?
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:39.140]   No, that's because it's my domain.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.140]   I haven't mapped it yet.
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:42.140]   Brian Wong, I love Brian.
[01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:43.140]   He's awesome.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.140]   He's like 20 years old.
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:45.140]   He is exact.
[01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:46.140]   He is in fact.
[01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.140]   You have to see the picture of him.
[01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.140]   He says, "You kid."
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.140]   Well, he doesn't show on our network every once in a while.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:53.140]   He does a bunch of young people.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.140]   There he is.
[01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:55.140]   He's great.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:56.140]   I said, "Brian, I'm going to take your picture."
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:57.140]   He does that.
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:58.140]   I know, that's Brian right here.
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.140]   I love Brian Wong.
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:01.140]   Kip is his startup.
[01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.140]   So this is good.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.140]   So these are people doing startups.
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.140]   Startup secrets.
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.140]   I like it.
[01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:11.140]   Raferadar.com, or just go to CNET and look for Rafe Needleman.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.140]   Thank you so much, Rafe.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:13.140]   Thank you.
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:18.140]   Brian Wong.
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:22.140]   I asked Raferadar, who is a regular right here Monday through
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.140]   Friday on our TNT show, Tech News Today.
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:28.140]   He also hosts a, I don't know all that.
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:30.140]   It's a bizarre show in other news.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:33.140]   Yeah, there's a lot more comedy on it than news nowadays.
[01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:36.140]   So every week we cover a bunch of serious stories on Tech News
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:37.140]   Today.
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.140]   And then there are these stories that get bumped off the table.
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:42.140]   Because there's all kinds of big shifts in patent wars and
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.140]   in other news.
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:45.140]   And occasionally we show you some inside, twit stuff.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.140]   And it's a lot of fun.
[01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.140]   If you want to watch it, watch it.
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:49.140]   It's on YouTube.
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.140]   Love it.
[01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:51.140]   Thank you.
[01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:52.140]   I asked for being here.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.140]   It's great.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:54.140]   And watch for our new show, which will debut a couple of weeks
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.140]   after NAB.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.140]   We're going to debut that show.
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.140]   It's a how-to show.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:59.140]   And our first episode is how to roll your own cloud.
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.140]   That's right.
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:01.140]   How to roll your own cloud.
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.140]   It's how to do your own cloud.
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:06.140]   Not, not be, not rely on Dropbox, but how to do your own thing.
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:08.140]   I've rolled my own to make clouds.
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.140]   That's different.
[01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:11.140]   That's not what you mean, is it?
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.140]   No, okay.
[01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:14.140]   The other Silicon Valley.
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:15.140]   Yeah.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.140]   Okay.
[01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:18.140]   Patrick Norton is at techzilla with a K.com.
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:22.140]   He's also a host on our own this week in computer hardware with
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.140]   Ryan Shrout.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.140]   I am.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.140]   You can find that at trip.tv.
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:27.140]   That is a crowd pop.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.140]   Congratulations.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.140]   It's nice that you could spend your Easter with us.
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:31.140]   I really appreciate it.
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.140]   It was fun.
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:36.140]   It's really nice to see Sarah and the kids.
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:38.140]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:39.140]   We really appreciate it.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:41.140]   We do this show every Sunday, 3 p.m.
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:42.140]   Pacific, 6 p.m.
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.140]   Eastern time at twit.tv.
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:45.140]   You can watch live.
[01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:48.140]   We love it if you do, because then we can see in the chat room.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:50.140]   But if you can't watch live, we make audio and video available.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:51.140]   I do apologize.
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:53.140]   You know, I got an email last week and it was actually right on
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.140]   saying you did the April Fool's show and it was half video.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.140]   And I'm listening and I don't know what the hell's going on.
[01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:00.140]   And you're right.
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:03.140]   And I promise you, audio is still number one for us.
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:04.140]   Paramount for us.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:05.140]   And I apologize.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.140]   I will try to, whenever we show video, describe what we're doing.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:12.140]   We will not get rid of the audio versions of our shows ever.
[01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:15.140]   You know, I come from radio and I think that audio is it.
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:18.140]   So the video is, I apologize about last week.
[01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:20.140]   The video is not the most important part.
[01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:24.140]   So from now on, listen, you could watch too if you wanted to.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.140]   You got both.
[01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:27.140]   As long as you subscribe, I don't really care.
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:31.140]   Thanks to Eileen Rivera for putting this thing together.
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.140]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:34.140]   Our top notch producer.
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:35.140]   Stay tuned.
[01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:40.140]   The last episode, the Easter edition of Game On, it has risen and now it's over.
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:43.140]   We'll be on and we'll say goodbye.
[01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.140]   And they have, they've actually put together a great farewell episode.
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.140]   It's going to be a lot of fun, some surprise guests.
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.140]   And I'm sad about that.
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.140]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.140]   We'll see you next time.
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:53.140]   Another tweet is in the game.
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:35:00.140]   Another tweet is in the game.
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:07.140]   Oh my God, is that a butterfly knife?
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.140]   It's Norton's.
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:09.140]   What do you expect?
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:12.140]   He's gone from a hammer to a knife.
[01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:16.140]   At first time, you see somebody's finger taken off from the deck of the sailboat.
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:18.140]   You get really serious about the knife.
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.140]   Henry, this morning he says, I say, what is this?
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.140]   Are these brass knuckles?
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.140]   Yeah, I got them in Chinatown for 20 bucks.
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:26.140]   Watch.
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:27.140]   And it has a knife that flips out of it.
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:31.140]   He actually has to get rid of that today because if they pull him over, that's what I said.
[01:35:31.140 --> 01:35:33.140]   I said, it's exactly what I said.
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.140]   I said, do not ever take that out of this house.
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.140]   It's illegal.
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.140]   No, it's illegal in your house too.
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:40.140]   Well, I know, but they're not likely the police will search his room.
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:41.140]   Facebook, not yet anyway.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:44.140]   Yeah, but for some reason, now that's he trying, is he old enough to drive?
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:46.140]   Yeah, but he doesn't have a license.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:47.140]   That helps.
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.140]   Yeah.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:51.140]   Tell me, no, I told him, no, I know how dangerous that is.
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:52.140]   It's completely illegal.
[01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.140]   Profoundly illegal.
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:54.140]   Profoundly illegal.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:55.140]   Like felony illegal?
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.140]   Hey, that's not good.
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:03.140]   Let's just say if a member of law enforcement needed an excuse to make your life difficult,
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:05.140]   that would be a particularly difficult excuse.
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:07.140]   But now they can strip you just for pulling over for a jail thing.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.140]   Yeah, yeah, can you believe that?
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:11.140]   No, no, that's different though because the guy was in jail.
[01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:13.140]   They could strip search you if you're putting you in jail.
[01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:15.140]   They can be being arrested.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:19.140]   If you're arrested, but not even charged, now they can strip search you.
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:23.140]   Yeah, because it's going to protect them in the jail in case you got something up your butt.
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.140]   You know what?
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:28.140]   It's the whole mistake in arrest that's the scare.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:30.140]   This is going to be bad for protests.
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:32.140]   Oh, yeah, because they'll strip search you.
[01:36:32.140 --> 01:36:33.140]   Sure, that's right.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:34.140]   But it's not a cavity search.
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.140]   It's just a strip search.
[01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:38.140]   When they get to the way where they are allowed to strip search you otherwise.
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:42.140]   How do you think they find things in your cavity without searching them?
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:43.140]   Look.
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:45.140]   Well, yes, that would be nice.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.140]   But then we have to have x-rays for all the systems.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:50.140]   And suddenly it's, you know, no, this is in New York.
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:53.140]   The police take DNA if you're arrested for anything.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.140]   Is that legal?
[01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.140]   Sure.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.140]   That's not.
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:57.140]   That's like we're taking a swab.
[01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.140]   That should be illegal search and seizure.
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:01.140]   Yeah, but it's yeah.
[01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:03.140]   Bloomberg's got a really interesting.
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:06.140]   I see the thing is the cops can strip search you.
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.140]   They don't have to.
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:11.140]   So hopefully there are some reasonable people out there that are officers.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:14.140]   They have a felony camp for illegal weapons, so I will throw that out.
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:19.140]   So we need consultants to make you for protesters to make you unstrip search.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.140]   Search attractive.
[01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:22.140]   Dress like this.
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:26.140]   Of course he drove home from Chinatown with them.
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.140]   Right.
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.140]   Yeah, good.
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:29.140]   God.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.140]   Well, but yeah, to put this into first of all, yeah.
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:32.140]   17 year olds.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.140]   If they were, if they were fiberglass at all.
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:38.140]   Here's the thing though, if they were fiberglass brass knuckles or carbon fiber brass knuckles
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:40.140]   they are legal under California code.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:45.140]   Under California code, if you're in, if you have baseball equipment.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:47.140]   I started.
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:54.140]   I have a, no, I have a, what happened was, was somebody got into an argument and we started
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:58.140]   researching because of a friend of mine does really air.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.140]   So what is, what is illegal?
[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:01.140]   What material is it?
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:03.140]   Baseball equipment is illegal to carry in your car.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:06.140]   If you are not going to and from a game or a practice.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   That's because if you have a bat in your car you could be using it.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:14.140]   Yeah, basically there's a lot of stuff as, so that's up to the police to determine is that,
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:17.140]   you know, he's got a baseball bat big deal.
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:18.140]   It's doing the morning.
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:19.140]   We're going to practice.
[01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:20.140]   That's what I got.
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:22.140]   I mean, 24 hour batting cage.
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.140]   Exactly.
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.140]   What is it?
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:28.140]   I did tell him that as soon as I saw I said please do not take the ever take that out of the
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:29.140]   house because you will be arrested.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.140]   Yes.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:32.140]   He also has a laser.
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:34.140]   I mean his, his life is now complicated enough.
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:37.140]   Should, should he have testosterone issues?
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.140]   Exactly.
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:41.140]   You know, because he's young and you know, and he's stuck into a scrap and he's studying
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:42.140]   mixed martial arts.
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:43.140]   Right.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:47.140]   Then he, then, then in some parts of the world it gets really complicated.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.140]   So.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:52.140]   No, my son is not committing an ongoing felony with a demonstrable evidence still in my
[01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:53.140]   home.
[01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:57.140]   I'm relaying and am using anecdote of a hypothetical situation.
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:58.140]   Thank you.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.140]   Ken from Chicago, I owe you.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.140]   And what did we talk about today?
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:05.140]   I have no idea.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:10.140]   We talked about Google glasses, Twitter spam.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:11.140]   What else?
[01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.140]   The Trojan virus.
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.140]   And Mac Trojans.
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:16.140]   Okay.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.140]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:19.140]   Ralph Knudel.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:21.140]   Ralph Kugel Knudel.
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:22.140]   It's.
[01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:25.140]   Oh, we're having fun this week.
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.140]   It's time for Twit.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:30.140]   Ralph Needleman joins me with Patrick Norton, my old buddy, and of course I as actor.
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:34.140]   We are going to talk about the latest news, including Twitter spam, Pinterest.
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:37.140]   I don't know what the hell I'm going to say.
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:38.140]   Google goggles.
[01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:44.140]   Google goggles, Google spank, Google glasses, Twitter spam, and the Trojan flashback.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:44.140]   Okay.
[01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:45.140]   Okay.
