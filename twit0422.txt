[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.720]   Since the 49ers are in halftime I think we can do like a five minute show real quickly
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.520]   before the second half of the game. I'm Leo LaPorte. Joining us from imore.com we thought
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.960]   he'd be here but he's decided not to come to San Francisco for iOS 7 but he does have
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.960]   all the colorful bubbles Mr. Renee Richie.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.560]   Please check out our website at www.mooch.com.com. You can't get invited anyway. We're just
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.560]   going to watch the iPhone event. Stay in Montreal. Also with this we haven't seen him
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.280]   in a while. I'm glad to have him back to Anne Patterson. Was it NBC, CBS, some network radio?
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.760]   ABC. Some network radio news operation. Then Occupy Wall Street happened. You did an amazing
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:54.280]   job of covering that on storeify using new media entirely to cover it which was awesome.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.320]   You've since you've gone the freelance route which is I think so commendable. You're trying
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.960]   to reinvent journalism.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.040]   Well, well trying. I did exactly what we talk about pretty frequently on the network
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.440]   here which is I left my job at ABC intentionally to run a podcasting network last year and I
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.880]   made just enough money to successfully run a failed company. You got to start somewhere
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.800]   and I did that all within the studios here at Summall in New York City and now I do data
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.120]   journalism. We're provided big buckets of data by partners like the Clinton Foundation
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.440]   or Ashen Kutchers. We are Thorne. They give us big buckets of data and say, "Find stuff
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.880]   in here." I work with a team of analysts to go through and find really interesting stuff
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   about the spring. I studied the spread of child pornography on the web and right now I'm studying
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.600]   the spread of prescription drugs and how the web influences that. Really fascinating stuff
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   now.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.520]   No kidding. Dane Atkinson, of course, Summall is a sponsor. We got to distinguish Summall.com
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.760]   which is the sponsor. Frankly, they're a great company that offers free sophisticated business
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   analysis to customers. You work for the Summall Foundation, the nonprofit arm, Summall.org.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.360]   Yeah. I certainly don't want to plug anything or get those wires confused. We talked about
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.520]   in the pre-show kind of subsidized journalism that there has to be a space for interesting
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.560]   long-form work to exist and they are subsidizing this work.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   Well, we just want to say that this show brought to you by KitKat and...
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.280]   Why would sponsorship ruin anything? Anyway, we're thrilled to have you, Dan. It's really
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.200]   great to have you and see you again. I'm seeing you in ages and I think we'd like to see more
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.760]   of you. This is a great opportunity for us to get your services. I have to say that this
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.800]   is a fascinating area for journalism to explore. This idea that big data might offer up nuggets
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.200]   of information that isn't immediately obvious. Yeah, right, exactly. And that we are living
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.560]   in the age, particularly with wearable computing that I think we'll talk a little bit about
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.880]   later in the show. This isn't the day and age of bending the data curve and using information
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.080]   instead of big, scary buckets of data making it personal and accessible.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.400]   Yeah, I love that. Well, great. It's good to have you. Appreciate it. We wanted to give
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.000]   people the disclaimer up front, not that we'll be talking about Summall in any way.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.600]   There is so much big news. I don't even know where to start. This is the week that Microsoft
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.520]   bought Nokia. Android announced version 4.4 of Android KitKat in a deal that they say
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.960]   no money was exchanged. Yeah, right. Apple has a little bit of a party coming up on Tuesday.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.760]   We could talk about that. And we found out that the NSA knows a lot more about us than
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.520]   we even thought. Not to mention the Galaxy Note 3, the Galaxy Gear and all new Kindle
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.360]   paper wipe potential for a free smartphone from Amazon. The Yahoo logo is here. But most
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.960]   importantly, CBS and Time Warner have finally buried the hatchet. What a shock. The week
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.520]   before the NFL season kicks off. Shocking. Shocking. I don't know. I don't know where
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.640]   to start. What's the you pick Renee? What's the big story of the week? At least what
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.200]   story number one here. Is it Nokia? Yeah, I mean, I guess it has to be Nokia just because
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.600]   it changes the Intel. Apple's going to announce a new phone. Google's going to put out a new
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.280]   version of their software. But Microsoft is buying a first party hardware manufacturer.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.120]   Yeah. And it's it's it's it's it's such a perfect encapsulation of bombers job at CEO
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.840]   and reminds me of that karate kid movie where you know you either make the software yes
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.120]   or you make the saw the hardware no, but he's always kind of so so about it. Yeah, in fact,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.720]   according to all things D they've done a lot of all things D seems to have a lot of information
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   about what happened in the behind the scenes negotiations, which makes me think that perhaps
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.920]   they're being feathers information from Microsoft. But according, I think it was all things D
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.640]   that said that that that bomber was the one who actually initiated this conversation with
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:16.600]   Nokia back in January. And it was a they met at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, which
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   was in the spring and had a lot of difficulty coming to any kind of agreement at all. In
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   other words, Microsoft wanted Nokia long before Nokia could see their way clear to selling
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.720]   to Microsoft. And it was interesting that maps was a huge sticking point. It just shows
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.520]   you the value of service as compared to hardware these days. Yeah, Microsoft wanted the here
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.200]   maps. They use it in Bing. It is their mapping tool. And Nokia was completely unwilling to
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.920]   sell. In fact, that was the thing that was the final piece of the deal that made it possible.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.800]   Nokia licensed access to maps to Microsoft and Microsoft agreed to so that Microsoft could
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.600]   modify it, but they agreed to contribute back, I think any modifications they made into the
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:09.680]   code set. Well, the license. Yeah, it seems almost as though Microsoft bought established
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.480]   systems. And I know that this idea has been floating around for the last week or so. But
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.160]   but I mean, Nokia had to retain some sort of identity. You know, they can't just be a
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.080]   galoshes manufacturer go back to that and they had to retain something. And IP seems to
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.480]   be the thing or at least the the software in here seems to be the thing they they really
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.480]   stuck on. But Microsoft was able to get these established systems and we we can kind of
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.200]   assume that they also got things like supply chain and they'll be able to make their their
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.720]   process more efficient by this. But they didn't really get anything that that would do anything
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.880]   more than kind of make them feature complete within an already crowded marketplace.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:09:00.280]   Was it the joy of tech that did the cartoon that implied that basically, e-lop was inserted
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.360]   into Nokia to make sure that the company failed so that Microsoft could get a good deal from
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.640]   them? The evaluator. I don't think that's what happened, although you might be a little
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.920]   suspicious about the whole thing, right? It's hard to see what benefits Nokia in any of
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.160]   this. I mean, I think Ben Thompson made that argument that, you know, this helps Microsoft
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.720]   because Nokia was not doing well with Windows phone. Arguably, they might have been they
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.960]   might have done better with Android because their claim to fame was always fantastic hardware.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.960]   And given the marketplace for Android, they could have been the premier Android manufacturer
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.400]   with the best hardware, the best cameras all around. And that might have been a much better
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.520]   business for them. And if that changed hands, Microsoft would have very little visibility
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.920]   and smartphones because Samsung and HTC are not falling all over each other to make Windows
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.080]   phones anymore. And but Microsoft, you know, they get to solidify their place in the market.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.960]   Now they get to make sure that Windows phones keep getting produced and they have the money
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.880]   to do it. Well, and Nokia kind of existed, you know, in the early days, the gestation
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.000]   period, the first, you know, maybe 18 or 36 months of Android, Nokia was still kind of
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.800]   dinking around with their own operating systems and they didn't really integrate with Android
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.240]   at what could have been a very pivotal time. And now they almost need this as or needed
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.200]   this deal with Microsoft to have a purpose. Did they though, you know, what one of the
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.120]   things that might have triggered this negotiation is the fact that Nokia's deal with Microsoft
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.680]   ended at the end of next year and of 2014. And of course, there were a lot of rumors.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.200]   It's probably too late, by the way, if it were to end the end of this year, then maybe
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.560]   it would have made sense for Nokia to pivot into Android. I mean, I would buy a 1020
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   based on Android and a hardy because of the great hardware. Nokia makes great hardware.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.840]   They've always been a crappy software company. They made the first smartphones. I owned a
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.080]   few of them like the E7 and Migo and Symbian was great. Migo, I kept buying these like
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:03.000]   the N900 and the crap software really killed what was brilliant hardware. They still have
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.600]   OSHA, which is an inexpensive platform popular in places like India.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.200]   The big knock against them was that they were an engineering led company. The engineers would
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   figure out the hardware and they'd try to slap some software on it to make it work.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.800]   And that wasn't going to be viable in a post-I've had post-Android.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:24.160]   Had they been able to adapt to Android like now? Wouldn't they have a chance, a shot
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.680]   at or is it just, is it too commoditized in operating system? There's too much competition.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:36.440]   It might be. It might be exactly that. Samsung really, really did this forward leading very
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.840]   aggressive strategy a year, year and a half ago. And that might have just made it more
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.040]   difficult. Yeah, it might have been just too late. Microsoft also might be getting, I
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:52.000]   mean, this could be a little too out there. But Nokia is also very well entrenched, particularly
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.040]   with distribution into the developing world. And Microsoft could have seen that as an opportunity
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   to say, "Well, okay, Europe, North America, maybe we can't fight the fight here, but we
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.600]   can certainly weave our fingers into the rest of the world." And that's certainly something
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.240]   that Nokia has done competently for a long time.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.200]   Here's, by the way, the best, this all things D-piece is great. I mean, they actually cover
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.000]   this from beginning to end. But the best part is the meeting on the weekend of May 24th
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.840]   in the London offices of Microsoft's law firm. On Friday, May 24th, a potential deal
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.500]   was starting to get some momentum in some areas, they write. While other topics remain
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.400]   sticky, by evening, the parties from Microsoft and Nokia were the only ones left in the building.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.920]   Each side had retreated to separate parts of a floor to go over what the other side had
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.240]   presented. At one point, Ballmer and Smith were walking back to their conference room
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:54.520]   together. But in Ballmer, in a moment, he was gone and there was a loud scream, the kind
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:01.200]   of yell that only comes from the uncommonly strong lungs of the voluble Microsoft CEO,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.680]   the roar startled the Nokia team who figured Ballmer had reacted particularly negatively
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.440]   to one of their proposals. While those in the Microsoft conference were
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.840]   been no idea what was going on, they heard the sound of people running. It turned out
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.680]   Ballmer had walked into a clear glass coffee table and had tripped on it and cashed his
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:24.160]   forehead. The Microsoft security team ran off in search of a first aid kit. They patched
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:34.040]   him up and negotiations continued. So this was back in May, it goes back and forth. They
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:41.080]   met in Botvik, which is a small town 30 kilometers west of Nokia's offices in Finland. This
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.400]   sounds like something straight out of the girl with the dragon tattoo. I could see them
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:52.080]   coming in a train to a snow drift to town. Anyway, they eventually were able to work
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:14:00.120]   out the details just recently. So this isn't this was a Ballmer deal, maybe his last deal.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:06.200]   A lot of people have wondered if perhaps like much like the Apple acquisition of next, they're
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.120]   getting not only an operating system, not only a phone man, well, they're not getting
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.160]   an operating system, a phone manufacturer, but also getting a CEO. Does this is next?
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:21.040]   This puts Steve and Eli, former Microsofty running Nokia in as the front runner now.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.280]   Is this the next CEO at Microsoft? Oh, puts him in the mix. I don't know about the front
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.840]   runner, but he's running the devices and services division.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.520]   His huge jobs came back to Apple and he brought a culture with me. Steve Jobs had a singular
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.200]   vision of focus and he created he turned Apple into a product. There's no evidence at all
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.480]   that Steven Eelop is anything like a product visionary or a cultural phenomenon like Steve
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.520]   Jobs. Far from it, actually. Yeah, his turn is a Nokia got money out of this and they
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.920]   apparently already accessed their line of credit and they needed money badly. So you can see
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.520]   it from Nokia's point of view. But in my West Wing reference for the week, there's no indication
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.080]   that Microsoft will be Microsoft. Let Microsoft be Microsoft. They're so obsessed with being
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.680]   Apple. I mean, granted IBM is not a sexy computer saving customer saving facing business,
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.560]   but it's an amazing business and Microsoft is with this move saying we don't want that.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.680]   We don't want to be enterprise. That was what was in their consumer.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.400]   That was in their future until they did this. And they say, you know, Microsoft says we're
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.480]   a devices and services company devices, Windows Phone, Surface tablets with Windows RT. Now
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.120]   nobody's going to make that except Microsoft and Nokia. In fact, you can pretty much kiss
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.520]   goodbye. The other one is going to make Windows phones, right? Why would you make Windows
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.080]   phones if Microsoft owns Nokia? That's it. So nobody's going to make RT. Nobody's going
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.320]   to make Windows phones. Microsoft's going to make Windows in office, but that's kind
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:50.080]   of is that the services part of the business? This is this is Microsoft in a Hail Mary.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.800]   It almost feels like. Office 365. I mean, that's their best product right now. Asia
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.200]   is a fantastic product, but it seems like they give it very little attention compared
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.600]   to failed tablet and phone projects, which is very interesting given. I mean, they have
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.400]   never made good devices. Even Xbox was an accident and came with tremendous write downs.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.040]   And it's a small niche category, much smaller than smartphones. And it's interesting to
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.200]   see them put so much focus and so much of this on an area that it's like Apple with
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.800]   Internet services and area that they've been so unsuccessful in their history.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.040]   So is this good for Microsoft or bad for Microsoft? What's what's what's something
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.880]   I mean, Leo, you could be absolutely right that this is a Hail Mary and this. I mean,
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.760]   this might not be a binary. This is absolutely Hail Mary for Microsoft, but it's also a company
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.320]   that is really good at landing those Hail Mary's right? I mean, for for whatever reason,
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.160]   they've been able to stick around. They've never been the sexiest. They've never been
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.040]   the most innovative or at least for 20 years hasn't haven't been the most innovative,
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.640]   but they have always been able to kind of march with iterative change successfully.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:55.000]   It's the same. To me, this really feels like Internet Explorer 1 to Internet Explorer 5,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.880]   right? Both were kind of junky, but they did something and they stayed relevant. Nobody
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.120]   cared, but they, you know, or a few people loved them, but they stayed relevant.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.680]   Well, and then you also have to look at the fact that Microsoft has given a seat on the
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:16.600]   board to an activist investment group value act, a hedge fund, as bomber steps down,
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.720]   Value Act was threatening them with a proxy fight, which apparently Microsoft thought was so
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:29.240]   scary that they're giving a seat on the board to this value act. Now, Value Act owns less
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.520]   than 1% of the company, but it's still worth billions. I think they have a $2 billion stake
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:38.440]   in Microsoft, $2.2 billion at current prices. It's hard to see where this
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.320]   is successful. I mean, if three years ago, Microsoft had put out an X phone and an X
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.880]   slate that had Halo and Gears of War and fantastic exchange and office support and,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.640]   you know, SharePoint and everything like that and really leverage the things that make Microsoft
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.840]   great could have been a fantastic product. It could have been on the shelf. It could have had
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.000]   Call of Duty special edition right next to an iPhone, but it's hard to see what they can do
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.720]   so many years later when iOS and Android are so far ahead and everyone HTC making fantastic
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.160]   phones that are as good as Nokia phones, you know, where they're spaced for them.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.000]   According to John Petchkowski writing on all things D, the number one thing Microsoft is going to add
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.640]   to Nokia, they're going to get better names. Steve bomber says, I think we could probably do
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.360]   better for consumer names than Nokia, Lumia, Windows Phone 1020. Oh, good.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.560]   It's a Windows phone. It's a problem though. This is from the company that created Windows XP 64
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.280]   bit edition for 64 bit extended system, says Petchkowski. These two companies belong together.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:43.880]   Holy cow. You know, it's such, you saw so many editorial cartoons, one in the new, I think it was
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:49.480]   the New York, I know it was the Economist, two giant fishes swimming along Google and Apple.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.640]   And then these two little fishes, Microsoft and Nokia and the Microsoft fishes eating the Nokia
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:19:01.000]   fishes like not even players in this game. You know, it's the 4% company bought it buying the 2%
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.480]   company. Still interesting to watch. You know, I'm rooting for them. Let's, I'd love, you know,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.760]   you know, Microsoft people think I hate Microsoft. Microsoft made the PC revolution without somebody
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.520]   a company coming along and saying, this is a standard that developers can write to.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.560]   We would not have the PC revolution. This is an important company to the ecosystem.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.920]   And, and, and, and frankly, if you're a Finnish, I imagine you think the same of Nokia.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:34.120]   So let's hope for the best for both. Nokia, does they still have the Galash division?
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.200]   Or do they get out of that entirely when they moved into phones?
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.240]   I have no key in tires on my car, winter tires. Do you have Nokia tires?
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.360]   Really? No key in. Yeah, I think the brand has changed slightly, but I believe they
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.440]   oriented it in the same place. Ooh.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.840]   There's 150 year old company. There's the Galash's. It's 150 year old company. The phones are only the
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:04.520]   latest. It just cracks me up. Nintendo was a playing card company. Yep. Yeah. It's only
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:10.360]   a made typewriters. Yeah. IBM made typewriters and calculators. We're talking about the
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.640]   week's tech news. I've got KitKat bars and we're going to, we're going to share them with the
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.000]   entire crew and just a little bit. But first, let's take a little break and talk about square space.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.560]   Dotcom, the greatest place to create your new website. Squarespace is hosting. When you say
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.640]   hosting, that sounds boring. It's just the best hosting that never goes down that you ever saw.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.680]   And you put on top of that the amazing Squarespace content management system. Now you got something
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:39.880]   really amazing. A beautiful looking website that never goes down. Great for bloggers.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.080]   Great for people who are selling products because they've got commerce. Great for somebody who
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.920]   wants to create a site as a portfolio. If you're a photographer and artist,
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.640]   you've got to take a look at squarespace.com. We've been asking people because we want to see
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:59.080]   their sites, your sites, to tweet us with a link to your Squarespace website. Use the hashtag
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:06.360]   twit squarespace. Hashtag twit squarespace and we'll take a look at your website. Every
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:11.560]   Squarespace site is mobile responsive. That means all you hear, I'll tell you what, let's do it.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.200]   Let's go right here. So go to squarespace.com. Click to get started. You get to start a site for
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.240]   free. First two weeks are free. So you can really play with the engine. It does have importers for
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.200]   all the major blog APIs. So you can import all your content, all your images, all the links are
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.720]   preserved. Even the comments get imported. Let's pick a template. Here's momentum. Now one of the
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.360]   first things you see when you go through the templates is other sites designed around that
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:43.640]   template. And it just shows you that every Squarespace site is unique. Your design style will come
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.280]   through. You don't have to be a web designer. You can do this all with drag and drop, introducing
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.960]   the Portland press. This is cool. This is great. I don't even know what they make and I like them
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:22:02.360]   already. It looks like they make felt buckets, but that can't be that can't be true. Coffee
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:10.200]   making equipment for the home. It's a French press for a mason jar. What? See, you see, you see,
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:16.600]   look, they've got an embedded video on the Squarespace site. They've got a gallery and there you go.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:23.160]   I mean, this is amazing. Squarespace.com. So pick that template, customize it all you want. You can
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:28.200]   hook up all of your social media. You can have it all flowing into there. I mean, I'm telling
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:34.040]   you, the first day you'll be amazed at what you could do. And the beauty is the content is completely
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:41.720]   separate. Isn't that funny? The content is completely separate from the design. So you can play with
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.280]   all the designs. Do whatever you want. Once you've got the site, play with it for two weeks,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.800]   if you decide to buy, then take a look at the amazing pricing. Squarespace starts at just $8
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.000]   a month. If you want, that's if you buy an annual plan for the unlimited plan, which is the most
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.560]   popular unlimited pages and galleries, unlimited blogs and bandwidth, unlimited storage,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:09.000]   $16 a month. That's amazing. That includes a custom domain when you get the annual plan and
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.920]   they'll hook it all up for you. Commerce is just $24 a month. They don't take a cut.

[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.880]   products. You also get things like inventory tracking, tax and shipping calculations, coupon

[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:07.800]   by Hershey, but it's actually a Nestle brand. And just it's a pure coincidence that the letter K
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:15.080]   is the next letter in the Android Galaxy. And we thought it was going to be key lime pie
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:22.280]   in a surprise announcement this week. Google says Android 4.4 is KitKat. They also said no money
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:30.520]   changed hands. Do you believe that? Barter economy, Leo? Yeah, right, right. They didn't give us any
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:36.600]   money per se. You will be able to buy specially marked KitKat bars with Android logos on it and
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:43.880]   play coupons on the inside. But they're not giving us any money for it. It's just like old school.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.800]   Barter is the name of the game. It's like old school radio. That's exactly how this deals.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.200]   Yeah, it's fun. I guess it's fun. That kind of bugs me because I feel like open source product
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:59.400]   should not be named after commercial products. But I guess it's Google's to name. And it is tasty.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:08.040]   What does Google, I understand Nestle's, you know, there is some risk, I guess, if KitKat is a
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:14.840]   bad OS. But where is this just a quirk of Google? That's what I've been racking my brain trying to
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:20.040]   understand. Yeah, this happened. Right, right. The details seem kind of fuzzy, although I mean,
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.760]   they are emerging. And I like the fact that they say at least no money changed hands and then does
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:31.000]   seem kind of fun. But also, I mean, there's money changed hands. Consideration changed hands.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.800]   It's very disingenuous of Google to say, well, they didn't actually give us any cash.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.760]   Because there's definitely this is a commercial. Well, they're spending money on promoting
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:47.000]   Android on their packaging. And do you think that every time I say Android 4.4, if I say KitKat,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.520]   do you think people are going to not eat an ungodly number of KitKat bars just by just by the power
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:59.160]   of suggestion? I've already had four just during the show. This, you know, the Willy Wonka thing with
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.720]   the, you know, the giveaway that could, you know, the golden ticket. Yeah, right. Yeah, I mean,
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.480]   that does feel very old school radio. Of course, like maybe no cash changed hands, but this seems
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.680]   like a very odd promotion. When you're rich, you're eccentric. Okay, Leo, it's not crazy when you're
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.200]   rich. It doesn't, it bugs me a little bit. Now I shouldn't be bugged. I mean, we were thinking of
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.920]   selling naming rights to the studio. I mean, I'm commercial. I have to make money. I understand
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.560]   that. It just, it seems like I don't want to support this by saying KitKat every time I talk
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.760]   about it. I'm going to say Android 4.4. This is not two. It's not, it's not 5.0. It's 4.4. They're
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:42.120]   sticking with that four. And what's going to be little Debbie Snack cakes? Life savers?
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.920]   Give me a break. Give me a break. Break me off. He said that KitKat.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.800]   Yeah, see what I'm saying? This is the, if that's exactly, if I'm Nestle, this is the best deal
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.960]   they have ever made. If they gave, if they gave Google no money for this, this is the, I bet you
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.120]   already, I would love to see the numbers. Get, get to work, Dan. It's also, I would love to see the
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.760]   KitKat sales and how they've been impacted by this. It's one of the big problems that Google
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.400]   faces is the Android brand because people go in looking for Samsung phones or maybe HTC phones
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:16.520]   or maybe a Nexus and the Android, normal human being, civilians, doesn't have a very big profile.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.680]   But now you've got the little green Android character on every KitKat bar and people,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.760]   oh, wait a minute. There's this Android thing that actually runs my phone. This is clever, isn't it?
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.280]   Yeah, it's a very clever deal. It's just, it's a weird deal. I mean, of all of the news stories,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.960]   we kind of could have predicted coming this year. This is one that I, I mean, right, this is open
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.120]   source software and it is something that while Google is kind of funny, it's weird to see this
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.560]   type of brand association. How many of you in the live studio audience are craving a KitKat bar right
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:51.880]   now? See, it works. Here, here I have. It's also, it's also not open source. It's opening. I mean,
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.440]   yeah, right. Honeycomb was never open source. So there's, there's, I'm making friends by throwing
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.480]   candy, ladies and gentlemen. I know. All right, well, here, pass this around. You can.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.680]   Did everybody get one? Anybody want one that didn't get one? Oh, I'm hitting the lights.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:17.400]   You know, shortly, the very smart people at Google want to quantify this in July, right?
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.800]   Don't hit Chad. Don't hit Chad. I'm sorry. What'd you say? Dan, I was busy throwing
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.480]   KitKat bars. It says an Oprah, you're not going to get a car. Okay.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:34.680]   L is for Lexus as one of our audience members. I'm going to wear the hat.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:41.320]   I don't know. I, I think it's a little annoying, but I guess I can't really complain. You got an
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.760]   advertising company. Some people are pointing out, in fact, another joy of tech, uh, comic that
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:55.560]   Nestle is not the cleanest brand name in history, is it? Nestle associated with
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:04.360]   selling baby formula in the third world, associated with some nasty labor practices.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:10.840]   Here's a, here's the joy of tech comic. Mommy, mommy. I'm scared. What's wrong, honey? There's a
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:16.360]   green ghost on this chocolate bar. Oh, don't be silly. It's just a Google Android. It can't
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.400]   hurt you. So I shouldn't worry that an omnipresent technology company that knows everything we do
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.280]   online and with our phones is joining forces with a multinational food corporation that has a long
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.760]   history of nefarious activity, including child labor, the promotion of infant formula, over breast
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.640]   feeding, rainforest deforestation, price fixing, and who CEO once said the idea of water as a basic
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:44.280]   human right was extreme. Daddy, daddy, we're scared. I think that says it isn't necessarily the cleanest
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:51.320]   brand to be associated with, but who doesn't love Nestle, right? Nothing to say, huh? That
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:57.240]   dramatic radio rate reading choke you up. All right, enough to say about KitKat. There is other,
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:04.200]   there are other Google stories. In fact, uh, an interesting revelation about Google Chrome apps,
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:12.680]   and I'm really curious what you guys think about this. Google has launched Chrome apps for Windows
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:21.880]   8, perhaps revealing their secret plan all along. I kind of mocked the idea of Chrome OS,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:28.760]   but these are essentially taking the extensions that you add to your Chrome browser in Chrome OS
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:34.680]   and making them apps. They're going to do it on Mac too. They haven't yet, but they currently are
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:40.600]   apps on Windows 8. Is it native cliently? I wasn't sure. Yeah, you don't. Well, you have to have
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:47.320]   browser, the browser in store installed, I believe. But I don't think you, yeah, they show up as like
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:53.800]   little there it is in the docs. They show up as little mini apps. It's like the next client for
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:31:00.280]   a while. Yeah. And it seems like the next iteration of you remember Chrome tabs as apps that you could
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.240]   save as a desktop. And you know, initially with HTML5, they were supposed to function much like a
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:12.280]   native app. And this seems like the next iterative step for that. It does. But okay, so no big deal,
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:18.520]   or does this kind of make Google's Chrome? What it tells me is that Chrome is where Google's put
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.920]   knowledge. It's IE6 plus ActiveX all over again. Oh, God, I hope not. I hope not.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.320]   Yeah. Close internet. Okay, never mind then. Well, I mean, Google is, I mean, they went,
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.240]   they forked WebKit. They made Blink. They've been doing V8 for a long time. They've been working
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   on native client. And it looks like they're going to be doing technology that requires you to write
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.040]   to Chrome instead of to write to the right to the web, which was an open platform. And for a company
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.560]   who historically superficially embraced the open web, it's a sign. I mean, it's that whole Adobe
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.480]   thing, you know, don't be locked down to a platform be locked down to our platform.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.520]   Yeah, I don't like that. Yeah. Vertical versus horizontal lockdown.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:57.720]   Yeah. And it also increases the top of mind, right? And the more these things function much
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.880]   like apps. And I see them in that context outside of just the browser context. The more I think about
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.400]   and simply interoperate with the Google ecosystem. And it's one more, I don't think it's a big deal,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:15.480]   like this is a huge deal. But it is a big deal in that this is one more big footstep of Google
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.000]   into your life. And once that step is taken, it's hard to bring that back.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.920]   I mean, like some people have said that it's open source. So other people can go ahead and
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.680]   make Chrome maps or at least add like Safari could theoretically add support for this.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.280]   But when you're in the real world in the pragmatic world, Apple and Microsoft,
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.240]   I don't know what Firefox would do, we'll probably don't want to introduce competitors
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.480]   technology into their products. They would do it if the worldwide web consortium came out with
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:42.760]   a native client standard. So it's again, it's filling space in the market, but it's doing it in a way
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.880]   that's particular to one vendor, which is always dangerous on the web. Google also, when they
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:52.440]   rolled out KitKat, you know, and they, as traditionally, they put the statue on the Google lawn of the
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.280]   KitKat, you know, Android, they have jelly beans, they have donuts, they have eclairs.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:05.000]   I'm not sure if they did this on purpose. My guess is they did. There's a happy go lucky fella
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.560]   in the rollout video, taking a picture with an odd looking Nexus phone. Let's go, let's zoom in a
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.480]   little closer. Why that looks like not the Nexus four who very, by the way, conveniently the young
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.800]   lady next to him is using. So for comparison purposes, this guy doesn't even look like he's
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.680]   paying attention. It's looked like somebody said, okay, run out there and hold up the phone and
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:32.280]   pretend you're taking a picture. This is it feels to me like an intentional leak of what I guess
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:37.800]   would be the Nexus five. At the same time as this happened and Google pulled down the video from
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:43.720]   YouTube. Oh, well, oh, oops, oops. The same time this happened. The FCC got a filing for a phone
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:50.680]   that interestingly enough matches this exactly. And people were able to piece them together and
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:57.160]   and show that they are in fact the same bigger sensor, bigger phone screen obviously looks nice.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:06.200]   When when will it now see now I'm sad because I got Jeff Jarvis to open his Moto X on this week
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.760]   in Google on Thursday and he's gonna be mad at me because he's been waiting for an excess five.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.400]   Is this in fact an excess four is out of stock in the eight gigabyte level? Is this so that means
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:21.960]   a five is imminent? It seems like it and it's it seems that Google is at the very least committed
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:27.400]   to an iterative process with these these very pure experiences. But surely this is they're going
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:32.840]   to wait for something after Apple and then try to write well unless they announce it the same day
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.920]   I would love to see that. Yeah, right. Right. It feels like Google's powerful enough to start
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.080]   doing the Apple with the old thing on Apple is that they would always do something to spoil CES
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.000]   or to spoil whatever keynote was it? CS and it feels like Google and Android are powerful enough to
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.880]   give them a little bit of their own medicine which isn't about the thing. You think Tuesday they'll
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:53.720]   announce the Nexus 5 or Wednesday or the iPhone 5s review day. I mean there's a lot of opportunities
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:35:01.880]   to screw them a little bit. Oh, I want to see that. That would be funny. Samsung of course jumped
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.960]   the boat a little bit and I think you have to figure that their September 4th announcement date
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.120]   has something to do with a September 10th announcement day for an iPhone. They wanted to scoop them a
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:17.800]   little bit. They announced the Galaxy Note 3 and it kind of an incremental improvement on the
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   Note 2 a little bit bigger 5.7 inches a little bit thinner a bit much better. Yeah, now what the hell?
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:31.640]   It's got a stitched leather like is it leather? You know, it's faux stitched leather. You can get
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:37.560]   it in pink faux stitched leather if you like. It's got a pleather back with stitching. This was an
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.000]   iPhone thing. I mean, I think this event was scheduled for a long time. This is just their
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.200]   cycle for the iPhone. It's at EFA and that's when EFA is. Yeah. Yeah. Although you got to think that
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   Apple's announcement September 10th which coincides with EFA was planned at. Well, again, like they
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.560]   have had that event the first week of September or five years. Come on. You got to let me have a
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.640]   little conspiracy theory. The Nexus 5. There's your conspiracy theory. Yeah.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.080]   Are you excited about the Note 3? Is that look like something to pay attention to? I can't wait to
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:16.600]   feel the rich feeling of pleather in my palm. You know, I really am shocked at least anecdotally
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.920]   the degree to which I will see a note. You know, I'm here in New York City and I see
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.880]   almost every device conceivable in the subway and I see that note and note too
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:31.560]   on a daily basis. I love it. Right. I would be very surprised if this doesn't sell well and it
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.280]   seems like it's carried by professionals or people who are, you know, doing something that does require
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.000]   that additional screen real estate which makes it a little less silly. I think pink might be
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.400]   targeting. I think it's always a perfect place for this because you don't want to carry a
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:51.160]   tablet but you want to kind of have a phone with a little more space on it. Particularly if
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.760]   you're a professional and you need that extra time, right? This is going to have windowing.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.880]   It's got the stylus, the S Pen and some new stylus features hovering and so forth.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.280]   But I thought the most interesting feature written about by Kevin Fitchard at GigaOM
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:11.640]   is this new chip from Quantense. This will be the first appearance of the Quantense E-T
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:18.280]   chip. It's an envelope tracking chip which could make a significant difference, he says,
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:25.880]   in battery life. It modifies how the radio works with LTE. As anybody knows,
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:32.920]   who got an early LTE phone, that is a real power drain. It's because of the very
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:40.440]   peaky nature of the LTE signal. In order to maintain a uniform envelope of power has to kind of
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:48.040]   overdrive the phone. This Quantense chip allows the radio to fluctuate in response to the signal
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:53.880]   fluctuation and apparently can save a significant amount of juice. LT is funny in that if you're on
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.200]   a really good LTE signal, it's much better for battery because the chip powers up, it sucks down
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:03.000]   the data quickly and powers off. But in areas where you're close to LTE and it has to drop by,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.640]   anytime the radio screams for a signal, it's bad. The interesting thing to me about this though is
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.720]   that in North America, big phones haven't historically done as well. The iPhone,
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.760]   mostly if you look at AT&T or Verizon figures and certainly Apple Store figures, it outsells
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.400]   all bigger screen phones combined. But both Sasha Sagan and Ben Thompson turn me around on this.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:26.680]   When you look at outside the US markets where people, a phone might be a primary computer and
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.920]   people can't necessarily get a phone and a tablet, to them the computer part becomes more
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.400]   important than the phone part. And that's where devices like the Galaxy Mega and the Note 3 and
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.360]   the LG, I forget what it's called, the giant LG phone become much more important to emerging
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:45.560]   markets. Yeah. You know what's interesting in Japan, of course, phones are very different because
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:51.080]   of this. People tend to have a smartphone, a sophisticated smartphone computer instead of
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.120]   having a desktop or a laptop computer. I think that that's TV antenna.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:59.880]   Pardon. It has a TV antenna in Korea and Japan. Whenever they come back like the LG models we
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.760]   get from Korea have pulled out TV antenna. Oh, that's I want that. That sounds great. Yeah.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:14.440]   They claim 25% overall device battery life improvement with this Quantansi G-chip on LTE.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:19.480]   I'm in an area where LTE is up and down and I in fact, I often go into the phone and turn off LTE
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.040]   if I can because it really can't kill the battery. So solving this will be good. This will not be
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:31.160]   exclusive to the Note 3. It's just the first one to have it, but that's encouraging. They also announced
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:37.560]   right. I don't know what to call it. It's a watch. I guess it's a watch. The Galaxy Gear.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:43.880]   Watch. It's a big ass watch. And it will only work with the Note 3 initially,
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:52.920]   although they say with the update to 4.3 on I guess it needs Bluetooth low energy, right?
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:57.880]   So the Galaxy S4 will work with it. And maybe even the Galaxy S3 once the update to the Android
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:03.160]   comes. It has two or three. Pardon me? There are two or three models that
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:10.040]   work with all Samsung. Although it's not clear. It's possible that this will work
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.960]   with a non Samsung device at some point. It might do basic Bluetooth stuff with a non Samsung,
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.400]   but none of the special stuff. Well, how special is this special stuff?
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.440]   This is exactly what Apple is not going to make for a watch.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   This is like smartphones right before the iPhone. You remember all those mock-ups of the iPhone,
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.480]   right? That's exactly what this is like. It's people who can't really conceive of something that
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.560]   is elegant and game-changing, just putting the entire kitchen sink on your wrist.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:43.160]   You're seeing the rubber band has a camera on it on the front part. Now, that means you can
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:48.680]   only wear it on your right wrist unless you want to take a lot of selfies, which given the state
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.440]   of the internet, that actually might be the intention. I don't know. It's not a super good
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   camera, but hey, you got a camera. You can also talk into the phone. It's got a microphone and
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:01.320]   speaker. So you could use it, Dick Tracy, watch style, but it does need a telephone
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.920]   to bind to for internet access, right? And for phone telephony, obviously. There's no radio in it.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:12.280]   No radio. Is it a touchscreen? Yes. Okay, that's an improvement, at least on the pebble.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:18.520]   I don't know. Yeah, I mean, it depends if you value the E-ink display for its longevity,
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:24.280]   rather than the capacitive touchscreen for its performance. They're claiming pretty good battery
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.680]   life more than a day. The problem with the battery life, when you get to manufacturers,
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.280]   and they say 24 hours of battery life, almost every one of them include eight hours of you
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.760]   sleeping in that measurement. And if it's 48 hours, it's two days of you sleeping. So that translates
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:42.040]   usually into 10 to 16 hours of real life. That's truly true. Because I think these things don't
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.920]   really use much juice when you're asleep, when the screen is off. Yeah.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:51.480]   What will be most interesting with this is perhaps on the business angle, simply the packaging of
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.080]   this, how, how, I mean, selling this as a standalone device seems like a non-starter,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:04.360]   but packaging it with something else subsidized. I can see that working, maybe not in North America,
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:09.400]   but I can certainly see this bundled with whatever else you get for free if you're buying this
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:15.480]   somewhere. But I mean, how they intend to market this just seems like it'll be a lot of fun to watch.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.720]   They're telling me in the chatroom that the screen flips around. So if you put it on your
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:25.400]   left wrist, you just flip the watch band around and the camera'd still point out and the screen would
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.720]   just rotate. Do you remember Leo, right when there was a lot of iPad rumors, Steve Bombers stormed
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.960]   the stage at CES and showed up the showed off the HP slate just so Microsoft could be first,
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:37.880]   which was never released, right? Yeah, it was released and it had a little drawer. You could press a
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.280]   button and it would pop out and give you your certified Windows sticker.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:48.840]   That's the state we're in right now. Yeah, it's really seriously, there's some magic thing that
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:53.720]   Apple could pull out that will make a watch that an eye watch or whatever that will be so awesome,
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:58.840]   so amazing that it will be light years ahead of this thing. I mean, really is that magic?
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.880]   Is that lightning in a bottle going to happen again? Apple could certainly do that. They could
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.520]   certainly create something that captures the imagination. It just may not capture the
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:14.440]   imagination like that real dopamine spike of the first iPhone release and the iPad release.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:19.880]   It will be something that makes some people go, huh, kind of cool and it will be more elegant
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.840]   than this, but it's not going to be the kind of thing that make us all go OMG.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:30.280]   Yeah, I mean, Apple's thing isn't that mean the iPhone accidentally did that in the iPad a
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.880]   little bit, but we discussed last time Leo. A lot of people said the iPad was unimaginably
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:40.040]   just a big iPhone. Apple will do something that they hope watches are a much smaller category than
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.280]   phones or tablets and consumer electronics. They'll do something that they think a lot of mainstream
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.000]   people for whom a smartphone is too much technology. Maybe they still want to have a feature phone,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.080]   but they want either the informational benefits of all their stuff being displayed on a small
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:58.120]   screen or the health stuff like the glucose reader, blood pressure reader, and it'll look more like
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.720]   a band than a phone. It probably won't look like a watch. It'll have a watch app the way the
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:06.280]   iPhone has a phone app, but it'll be a very different thing. And Tim Cook will have to make
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.840]   the case the way Steve Jobs did with the iPad that this exists underneath the phone category.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:17.240]   Yeah, absolutely right, Renee. It seems like Apple might kind of they might be self aware of the
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:23.160]   expectations of releasing something that shocks the world and instead may go the exact opposite
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.960]   direction and drill down onto that health vertical and say, no, this isn't something for
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:33.560]   everyone, but if you are in the health and the quantified self and then this is maybe for you.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.840]   We know it'll lead us to have that because they they've hired that guy, the guy.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:44.120]   I'm like, yeah, right from, right. And a bunch of health health scientists who did sensor work.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:49.560]   Right. I feel like that I do feel like we're in a position now with wearable computing much as we
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.880]   were before the iPhone came out where the idea was persuasive. You know, the idea of wearable
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.840]   computing is very exciting has been for years and persistent as well. It just won't go away. And
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.560]   I do believe I think it's going to be a huge category, but it remains for somebody and I don't
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:10.440]   know if it's going to be Apple, but it remains for somebody to solve this, right? Look at the
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.680]   iPhone compared to the iPhone 5 Leo and the original iPad compared to the iPad mini.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:20.120]   The first one is usually clunkier and thicker and it still was a breakthrough though. The iPhone
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:26.440]   yes. I mean, I waited in line six hours for that first iPhone. It was quantifiably better than
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.480]   anything that had come before it. It changed the word technology. Yeah. And so we need to do
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:36.600]   something like that if the if Apple is to be the one that that reinvents this, you know, much like
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:42.520]   the Fitbit. The Fitbit is a wonderful product, but it is a product that becomes self evidence,
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:48.360]   self evident once you've used it. The iPhone is something even the iPad and most of it.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.440]   Right. You see it and you know what it does, right? But a Fitbit you kind of have to use
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.080]   for a month or two before you go, ah, light bulb. I see why this is wonderful. And I think that might
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:02.120]   be the this, you know, the Apple is aware of that with a quantified self product.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.600]   It's also a different world. I mean, you've got Google Glass. You've got some very credible
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:11.720]   competition. I don't know if Apple is the leader in the horse race at this point.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.840]   The iPhone Leo, we had trios or blackberries before that and the original iPhone was nowhere near
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.480]   his feature complete. But Steve Jobs showed right inertial scrolling and the bounce back and
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:27.320]   pinched his zoom. No stylists. I mean, you know, yeah, it wasn't as functional, but he made the
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.880]   experience look so compelling. Same with the iPad. He sat there and browsed the web and used,
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   you know, Mike Mattis, his little photo interface where you could peek inside photos. And that
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.440]   was appealing to not, you know, geeks, certainly the geeks like us, but to the mainstream people.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.360]   When I went to the iPad to line up, I saw all my old high school teachers there. It was 90%
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.800]   people 10 or 20 years older than me. And that's the people that they called to.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:53.720]   Yeah, not the Galaxy gear market. Right. It may not be feature complete, but it's the features
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.760]   you want. And those features are very easy for the mainstream to say, I definitely want that.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:04.280]   And and quantified self might just take a while. That's an interesting idea. I, yeah, I, yeah, I,
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:10.200]   I mean, I'm bullish on it. In fact, I think we're looking at doing a show on mobile computing plus
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:15.640]   wearables because I really feel like that's where all the excitement is going to be over the next
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:21.320]   few years. What's next? But what, but I'm waiting, right? That nobody's cracked that yet. And I don't
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.480]   know if Apple has the mojo to do it or not. But the nice thing is what you said, Leo, is that now,
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.960]   you know, Google's at least it is absolutely as interesting a company as Apple right now. And
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.840]   the dynamic between them and who knows what young upstart or startup company or other technology
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.240]   company will come out of nowhere. And it's a Apple doesn't have to do it alone. There's a better
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.560]   chance for it happening because there's more competitive companies. Right.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:47.800]   Let's take a break and talk about Apple because we've got a little bit of a party
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.680]   coming up on Tuesday. And we'll Renee Richie's got the best connections in the business about,
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.600]   you know, what, what's coming from Apple. I got Kit Kat all over myself.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:03.640]   Get rid of this thing. I kill you Google. I kill you. Our show today brought to you by
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:08.760]   Carbonite online backup. I tell you, when I spilled water two weeks ago on this computer,
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:14.520]   I got a little scare, but I realized I don't have to worry. And it's kind of nice. I haven't
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:18.840]   had to worry in a long time because I don't have to worry about my stuff being backed up. It's up
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:25.320]   there. It's in the cloud. Thanks to Carbonite online backup, $59.99 a year to backup everything
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:30.920]   on a single computer. Great for a laptop. Mac or PC laptops get lost. Hard drives die.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.600]   Here's the deal. Automatic. You don't have to think about it. Secure. Your files are encrypted
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:41.560]   and backed up safely off site. That's nice in this day and age. It's very affordable. That's
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.960]   a five bucks a month per computer. And if you're a small business, you really ought to check out
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.160]   the small business solutions for Carbonite. Just like the individual solution, it's a single
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:59.560]   yearly rate for as much data as you have. Easy file recovery. It'll backup external hard drives.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:05.160]   They've got a kind of a career, a cool thing for the home premier and up. They have a career
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:11.000]   recovery service. They'll bring you a hard drive. If you're in this for a small business, it's great.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.760]   If you've been using Carbonite and it's been backing up, you got your counselor,
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.120]   receivable, your client list, all that important stuff, if there's a fire,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:24.760]   they literally will courier you. You're back up on a hard drive. So you're backing up and running.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.880]   I just love Carbonite. I want you to try it right now. For free, no credit card needed.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:35.240]   Just use our offer code TWIT. You'll get two months free with purchase if you do that. Carbonite.com.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:43.720]   Spend more time making memories than backing them up. I love that idea. I almost attempted to
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:49.800]   just try it. Oh, my hard drive. Here's your hard drive. Love that.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.480]   September 10th, you didn't get an invite. Andy and I code did. It's a small venue.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:03.880]   150 people. The last time I was at Apple's Town Hall, and this will tell you how long it's
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:11.960]   been since they've used it, was the big iPod sock announcement. And the iPhone 4s.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:18.120]   I wasn't invited to those. Yeah. So it's very tight. So a lot of people aren't invited. So
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.400]   you don't have to feel bad. Always a bridesmaid, Leo.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.400]   [laughter]
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:29.320]   We will be covering it. Well, it starts 10 a.m. Pacific. That's 1 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.640]   Our coverage will begin a little bit before. We're going to have Scott Bourne. The original
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:39.480]   iPhone Fanatic will join us along with Chris Breen from Macworld, Sarah, and Tom and I,
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.080]   our live coverage. We don't know yet. Do we know if Apple's streaming it?
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.160]   We don't. They did not stream the last event at Town Hall, but they've been streaming
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:50.760]   more events recently. Right. Seems like this would be a good candidate since it is such a
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:58.440]   small venue. We know it will be iPhone Renee? Yes. No question. No question.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.800]   What do you think you've got the invitation behind you? What do you say?
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:07.960]   It's something to brighten your day. Something to brighten your day. Yes.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.400]   I have it on good authority that the graphics department, after they put out these invitations,
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.840]   sits back, grabs an adult beverage, and laughs at the internet trying to sell some of those things.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.040]   [laughter]
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.760]   What does it mean? What does it mean? Oh my God. They're going to have two LED flashes on the
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:28.680]   iPhone 5. The iPhone's going to be a circle, circular display. Are they talking about iOS 7,
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:33.640]   I would guess, right? Well, they use dots at WWDC as well. It's a motif. They've been, I mean,
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:37.240]   a couple iPad events ago, they used a bunch of dots as well. It's something that they like
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:43.160]   visually. Maybe they're talking about the brand new gold phone. That would be nice. And the
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:50.360]   fingerprint reader that's coming with it. All right. Let's talk about this. I'm sorry,
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.440]   I got to fish my kick out. Google one. They can't.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:52:03.400]   Fingerprint reader on the face of it's exciting. In fact, Mike Elgin months ago,
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.960]   credit to Mike, was one of the first to report a fingerprint reader. Everybody go,
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:13.640]   in fact, you were an A and Andy and I sat here saying, "No, I never do that." We knew they had
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:19.240]   bought Apple had bought authentic last year for billions of dollars. So they had the technology,
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:25.320]   they owned it. Mike Elgin speculated if they'd put it in the iPhone, it would be a revolution
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:30.520]   for authentication. And authentication is critical to online payments. Payments of any kind.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:37.160]   If I'm going to give you a charge card, the most important part of that transaction is
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:42.120]   that you know I am who I say I am, that it's my card. And you know what? If you're buying things
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:47.880]   online that you are who you say you are. If both ends are securely and accurately authenticated,
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:55.560]   it makes online currency transactions friction-free. But currently, there's no way to really do that.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:00.760]   There's a certain amount of trust that's involved in using a credit card. If Apple could get a
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:07.720]   reliable, I mean, I would have to be very reliable, right? Accurate fingerprint sensor on that phone
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:14.040]   that could transform things. So that's what Mike's contention. But I have to say having,
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.520]   and I'm going to say like Mr. Apple knockers here,
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:24.200]   I think that was Marilyn Monroe's first film actually. But that's another story, another kind.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:29.880]   But I'm not, but I'm just pointing out that it happens. Every company does it, where they come
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:36.280]   out with something that is potentially huge, but execution lacks. And it's just another thing.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:42.040]   You can say, Siria Leo, it's okay. Siria is a very good example. If this thing isn't exactly,
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:48.120]   if it doesn't really, if it's on the screen, it says, put your finger on here or give us your
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:53.480]   pin to unlock. That's not it. Well, you need the pin, for example, if you want to give your phone to
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.720]   Lisa, she doesn't have your conference. I always need a backdoor for people who aren't you using
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:04.280]   advice, but it has to be 100% reliable, secure, and dependable. And even if they do that,
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.600]   it also has to have the back end merchants have to support it. There has to be, they have to take
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:15.000]   a past book and make it, you know, have money in it. There's no money in it right now. It's just
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.640]   fandango tickets and things. Starbuck's standing is that it will pass,
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.080]   pass book was written, I think it's called pass book kit or something where it's highly abstracted.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:26.840]   So you know, this iOS seven apples adding some things to it. Eventually they could add NFC
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.760]   or they could add the fingerprint reader. It's very easy for them to do that because they built it
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.000]   in a smart way. What I've heard so far is that they're testing it with a ton of people because
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.400]   it's not a trivial problem. People really do hold their phones differently. People have different
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.280]   sized fingers and they left handed or right handed. And there's all sorts of things and they could
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.760]   either make it very secure where it requires a high level of certainty to unlock your device,
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:53.080]   in which case it will have false negatives, or they could make it much lax or they need fewer
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:58.280]   points of identification, in which case it's it might rely on it, which shouldn't. But it won't,
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:02.120]   well, I think Apple's usually consumer focus. So if you start getting frustrated, you can't open
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.200]   their phone, that's bad. If a theoretical one out of a million other people could open it,
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.280]   that's probably less of a problem where they're where you're concerned. And for people who are
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:14.600]   really security conscious, they could probably say you need a thumbprint and your pin code. So
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:18.520]   it's something you are and something you know, and then you're you've got two factor at least
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:24.040]   working for you. Dr. Mom, one of our regular chatters who's a physician says that they use
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:30.600]   fingerprint readers in the hospital to unlock narcotics. And she says even there, they're only
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:37.080]   about 75% reliable. And that's an interesting, the flip side of this where people might get upset
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.320]   about it is that it establishes your identity in a good and a bad way because if you unlock that
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.480]   cabinet, get the narcotics, they know it's you, there's no deniability there. And if you've got a
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:50.440]   fingerprint on your transaction or your email, and that's ever an issue, you've got no excuse
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:55.640]   that oh, my friend downloaded that mp3 file. You know, what it reminds me what I'm concerned
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.760]   about is, you know, many Android devices have face unlocking, where you know, this was a cool
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:04.760]   thing for Samsung to show off. You see's your face and then it unlocks it. Google showed it with
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:10.840]   4.2, I think. Nobody uses it. No, it's ridiculous. And so with a photo.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.520]   Well, it's just it's just dumb. It's done rely. It's not reliable enough to count on it.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:21.800]   It's not it doesn't just work. It takes a long time. It's so much easier to enter in a pin
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:27.960]   that it just doesn't make any sense. So my question is, is this going to be a great thing?
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:31.880]   And Apple's done this in the past. You know, everybody goes, wow, that's neat. And nobody uses
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:37.640]   it. Or could this really be a significant? Yeah, the degree to which this is a gimmick versus
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:45.000]   something that is deeply integrated across the platform. And and all of the negatives aside,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.400]   this is something that if it permeates the Apple environment within the next, let's say,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:55.000]   two or three iterations of iOS devices, it is something that really does have the potential
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.520]   to change the landscape entirely. All of these other hang ups, however, really increase the
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:06.040]   likelihood that this is a gimmick like Siri was. Right. Yeah, I mean, I think I've heard and I
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.160]   know other people have heard that Apple has been testing it in a wide range of things and it could
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.320]   just unlock the device that might be at this time, but it could also become your Apple ID. So instead
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.640]   of putting in your iTunes password, you can just authenticate with your thumbprint, which is
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.320]   entering passcodes on mobile sucks. It doesn't matter what platform you're on. You can't put in
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.800]   a secure platform horrible. And then, you know, the next step is integrating it with Passbook,
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.240]   but it's like, you know, Ford and cars will tell you that people are adverse to change and
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.240]   adverse technology. And you have to walk them through things slowly. You know, they just don't
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:37.720]   want the car to drive on its own the first day. So it could be that Apple slowly rolls out features
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.960]   over the course of the next few software updates. Yeah, and limiting it also limits consumer
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:47.240]   expectation while also allowing consumer imagination to flourish. Right. If it is something that just
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:53.880]   unlocks your phone or replaces a password in just your iTunes and App Store transactions,
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:58:00.200]   then that's something where people are more forgiving with failures and also can see the future where
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:06.680]   it is an improved device. But if this is something that Apple really presses as the differentiating
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:12.440]   feature between this and the five, it's which it seems like they will. This really could
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:19.400]   fall into novelty like, okay, QT territory. Right. It's not all bad because all they need is that
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.560]   demo. Like you buy your new iPhone, you go and show your friends, look, it's got a thumbprint
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.680]   reader. You really don't care that it works. You care that you have something cool to show your
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.880]   friend and Apple has the Santa Claus commercial where like Scrooge can't get into your iPhone
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:36.440]   before Santa can unlock it. Get the Christmas list and save Christmas. And that's all they really
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:41.320]   need is that one feature to show off a visually not very different phone and that Christmas commercial
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:47.240]   and that's their holiday season. Yeah. And even as poorly as Siri worked two years ago, it was
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:52.440]   exactly what you're saying. It was that feature that let you say, this is what differentiates my
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:59.640]   4S from your very similar 4. And poor working is Siri was it really helped drive interest in that
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:06.360]   product. Is there a bingo chart that we could keep for Tuesday watching? What are we watching for?
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:12.200]   What are we looking for? What things will tell us, oh, this is a big deal or not a big deal?
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.920]   Partnerships. I mean, it's being held in Cupertino. So it's not going to be it's not small.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.000]   The iPhone six event. Yeah, small event. It's going to be an internal upgrade. It'll have a much
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.800]   better chipset, much better digital signal processor. It'll have the gold and maybe the steel coloring
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.080]   as well. So at least people will because one of the big problems with the S lines is people got
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.560]   upset that no one could tell you had the new iPhone. So gold and maybe steel will at least let your
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:40.040]   friends know that you have the new iPhone and it's a hugely popular color. So it's an incremental
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:43.960]   update, but you know, Apple doesn't intend for anybody but as geeks to buy phones year after year
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:49.160]   anyway, it's mostly for people on a 4S or a 4 still. Yeah, right. Yeah. And that's, you know,
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:53.240]   what's most interesting. I know that we've probably been saying this a lot lately,
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.040]   but what's most interesting is you remember three years ago with the discovery of the iPhone four
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:03.880]   and that even then leaks were something that happened. You know, there are few and far between
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:09.000]   and the degree to which this is last year maybe, but this year is really the year where we know
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.080]   so much about this product before it's announced, you know, and that really the change in how Apple
[01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:21.720]   controls its, you know, the the entire chain has really changed a lot. And it's not being
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:28.440]   discussed very much. Will there be one more thing? Will there be a surprise at all?
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.160]   No. No, we didn't hear about. I mean, the finger remeter could have been a surprise,
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.840]   but they've ended up putting it in the code for iOS seven. So I gave that one away.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.560]   And of course, as you point out, damn, because they can't control China, they can't control the
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.520]   manufacturing and they need to make these all ahead of time. That's we would know if there was a,
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:51.080]   I mean, the surprise may be a November or October event like we've seen in the last,
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.840]   you know, occasionally in the last couple of years, I think the time we would see an eye watch
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:59.960]   would mostly be in the spring where they can test out products, right? But no, there is no,
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.600]   you know, we would have indications there would be signals within the noise here and it seems like
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.400]   it'll be a fun event, but nothing, nothing surprising. What about the rumors that there would be a new
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.360]   Apple TV? Those have been thoroughly debunked by now, yes. What's your definition of a new app?
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.560]   I mean, Apple TV is getting that's one of the things that problems with the news cycles.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.320]   Apple TV is getting iOS seven. They don't call it that, but it gets whatever the new software
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:26.520]   built for other iOS devices is and that really knows radio. Yeah, they call it something dumb.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.520]   I for it has two different OS names, neither of them are the proper OS name. I don't know why they
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.560]   do that, but whenever a new beta comes out for the phone or the iPad, that same beta comes out for
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:40.600]   the Apple TV. And when the release comes out within a few days, the Apple TV is updated to
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:45.720]   the same basic structure of iOS and that can that's to allow for compatibility and features like
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:50.440]   AirPlay and AirPlay mirroring to work. So it'll get a new OS and it'll get iTunes radio and it'll get
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:56.040]   some other stuff. You know, one thing I could see, we haven't discussed this very much, but one thing
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.120]   I could see that is a surprise could be plastic back iPod touch. You know, we kind of look at the
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.960]   shrinking iPod market and particularly the price of that device, you know, that's an entry level
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.760]   device for a lot of people who don't want to get tied down to a contract. And it seems very obvious
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:18.520]   that a touch with the plastic back is something that is, you know, it's a no brainer. It would
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.640]   make the product cheaper and easier to access. And the iPod sales are tanking. I mean, you
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.280]   season after season. Last year, Apple did iPod's the same time they did the iPhone and we've had
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:33.080]   very little leaks about anything new in the iPod space. And it could be that they're getting so
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.560]   small that the traditional gateway drug to the app store into iOS is going to be replaced with the
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:42.120]   iPhone 5C. And one of the things we don't know because Apple doesn't have to get it out to partners
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:47.320]   that early is what the price tag on that will be. Because if it's $450, which is one of the rumors,
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.120]   that's pretty close to Apple subsidies. So could it be $0 in subsidy markets? Does Apple want to
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:58.040]   maintain perception of value, make it $40 or $100? And then does all those trade-ins and refurbs go
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.920]   even below that in cost in Latin America and Africa and countries like that. And Apple starts to have
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:06.920]   a range of pricing and especially in emerging markets. So there's a lot of small things that are
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:12.360]   still interesting. When does Apple stop making the iPod? Never. Never.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.120]   Hence which one? They'll still make a touch, right? Because that's just the phone without.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.040]   Right. Yeah. It's like whether the classic survives 128 gigabyte iOS devices will be interesting to see.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.040]   Do people still buy those?
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.920]   It feels like buying a fax machine. 160 gigs, Leo, all your music in your pocket.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.000]   Yeah. No, it wouldn't even fit all my music.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   And then what about this 17 watt adapter? Do we even... This is apparently Apple's making...
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.160]   The regular adapter for an iPad is 10 watts. 17 is not enough for a laptop. What is a 17 watt
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.640]   adapter doing in Apple's lineup? Apple TV. So probably the iPads in October. 13-inch iPad?
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.640]   Yeah. That's probably an October thing more than a September thing.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:04.520]   Anything else to say about Tuesday? You'll be... We'll get John Mac break weekly right after the
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:09.880]   announcement. Absolutely. Do Kit Kats give you hiccups? I think they do.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.160]   Oh, the chat room is asking new Macs are probably not at this event either. Apple has...
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.280]   They have iPods, iPhones, iPads and Mac product lines. And last year iPads and Macs were both in
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:25.320]   October. It sounds like... Sorry, Mavericks will be in October. Haswell chips still aren't plentiful
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.640]   at that product range. So Macs are probably going to be an October thing. Yeah, we want
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:37.880]   Haswell MacBooks. MacBooks on Mac mini. This is a Haswell Air. And I do love that. And you know,
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.480]   the more important thing that they did, which didn't get enough attention, and I'd love to see
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:46.040]   this in the MacBook Pros, and I'm sure we will, is they moved the SSD off the SATA bus and put it
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.440]   on PCI Express. And this is the fastest hard drive I've ever seen in that by itself.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:55.240]   Forget anything else. I mean, 12-hour battery life in that make this very desirable. But it
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:00.120]   drives me crazy that it's not a retina display. I have the same one Leo and the battery life is
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:04.760]   amazing. So amazing. The screen and the typing is nowhere nearly as good as it is on my MacBook.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.680]   My retina MacBook Pros, I keep going back. It's frustrating. If they're so close...
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:17.560]   Soon. Soon. Next month, maybe. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by Audible.com. Are you an

[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:06.040]   be yours to keep. I read a lot of political stuff too. There's Underfire, the untoward story of the
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:12.840]   attack at Benghazi. That sounds interesting. This new first novel by the 21-year-old Samantha
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.920]   Shannon is getting a lot of attention. The bone season. Did you read that, Chad? Yeah, I'm over halfway
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:25.240]   through. This is such a good book. She's 21. It's gonna be a seven book series. I'm so, it's funny.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.040]   Because I'm right at the point in the book where either it could start wrapping up to be like the
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:34.680]   end of the book and the end of the series, or like you could set up for the rest of the seven books.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.080]   It's gonna happen. And I'm just like, I so hope that this is a multi-book series. Sounds good.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:45.000]   The year is 2059 and Paige Mahoney is a clairvoyant living in a dystopian London.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.920]   The world that she creates is so good. There's these clairvoyant people, there's different levels
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.000]   of clairvoyants, there's card readers, there's like, it's such a great book. I've been-
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.920]   Make you mad that a 21-year-old wrote this. Yes, it really does. It really does.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:07.160]   Inspiring. Oh man. Oh yeah, inspiring. That's it. Yeah, it's inspiring. It literally makes me
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:12.040]   want to keep cleaning my apartment so that I can just do something while listening to audiobooks.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.640]   Oh yeah, well that's what's great about Audible. You drive around the block an extra time. You
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.960]   sit in the driveway with the engine running. You're doing extra half hour in the treadmill.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:25.080]   I'm gonna add this one to my cart too. It's so good. Audible time.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.040]   Coms like really, you really liked it. I'm still loving it. It's about 14 hours,
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:36.120]   actually around 15 hours and every second of it is so, so good. I can't wait.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:41.560]   And it's really fast paced. It's not super slow and you get right into the action.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.680]   Audible.com/twit2. I'm looking for books to take. I'm taking vacation.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.680]   This will be one more twit with me next weekend and then Sarah Lane's gonna take
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.840]   twit in two weeks. Tom Merritt's gonna take twit in three weeks and Father Robert Ballester's
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.160]   gonna take twit in four weeks. I'm gonna be gone for three twits. But hey, we've got a deep
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.440]   bench now. I'm really pleased. We're gonna have a great time. So yeah, I'm stocking up on books,
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:11.080]   downloading all my music and my books to my phone and stuff like that. You do the same.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:18.360]   Audible.com/twit2. Hey, let's see. This would be a good time. Yes, I gotta go get some more
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.640]   KitKat bars. So let's see what you missed if you missed this week on twit.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:30.600]   Previously on twit, twit live specials. It's the true companion for your note.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.160]   Making sure you never miss it. Or your note. It's really isolated to the note.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.160]   That's a disappointment. That's awful. There's a lot of people with S3s and S4s that would
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.800]   probably buy right into this. Windows Weekly. I don't know. You look at the world of today and
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.920]   it's hard not to say Android has done to iOS with Windows did to the Mac. Why is it Microsoft doing
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.360]   that? Well, Microsoft's doing the Apple thing. In fact, more and more it looks like Microsoft's
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.240]   restructuring. Microsoft has never succeeded in being Apple Leo. That's the problem. Twit live
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:02.040]   specials. We wanted to take it up a notch and we've done that with our holographic virtual set.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:07.080]   It allows you to take the panoramic picture and then you can take that image and create a virtual
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.720]   set. And I think we've got Leo report. Hey, Kiki. Wait a minute. She's over there.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:20.680]   Put down the cake and tap the twit. Awesome.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:25.880]   They're a plot because I have five kick-cap boys in that time.
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:34.520]   It was a good week, wasn't it? You in NSFW had a great rap group, Turquoise Jeep. We'll have that
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.880]   in the next publish that in Tuesday. That'll be awesome. Let's see what Tom Merritt has coming up
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.480]   in the week ahead. Tom. Hey, thanks, Leo. Here's a look at some of the stories we'll be keeping an
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.280]   eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today. Monday, Cloudbeat Conference kicks off in San
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:56.040]   Francisco Tuesday, September 10th Intel IDF 13. Anything else going on? Oh, right. Apple has their
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.360]   big announcement. Probably going to get new iPhones and good looking stuff, maybe some retinomack
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:07.320]   book pros. Wednesday, September 11th is Patriot Day. Thursday, September 12th, Google is removing
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:14.760]   video responses on YouTube. So don't do any after that. LinkedIn opens to 13 year olds and older.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:20.520]   Geek Wire Summit kicks off in Seattle, also kicking off Thursday, September 12th. Derek,
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.760]   starring Ricky Gervais begins streaming on Netflix. Friday, September 13th,
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:31.160]   Ariel comes to Chicago. And it's the anniversary of the launch of Super Mario Brothers in 1985.
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:37.160]   That's a look at the week ahead back to you, Leo. Thank you, Tom Merritt and the TNT crew,
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:42.840]   every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time on Twit.tv for your daily
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.800]   dose of tech news. So what is that? They're killing video Chad, Chad Johnson. My producer
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:52.440]   also hosts our show on YouTube this week in YouTube. YouTube's killing video responses.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.520]   Yeah, so that seems like a big part of YouTube. It really was. So back in the day,
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:01.800]   you know, vloggers would upload a video and then you could make a video in response to that
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:05.640]   video and it would show up underneath and make it easier. It's like a comment, but it's a little
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:11.560]   more than that. Right. And so they're getting rid of it, which is really, I mean, if anything else
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:18.280]   has been sort of an outline of where they want to go in the future, they do not, they don't like
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:23.640]   this whole social network stuff that's going on on YouTube. That's terrible. Yeah, it's really
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:30.680]   kind of disappointing because that's how I got into YouTube is from making my own video responses
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.640]   and it's completely gone. And they've been downplaying it for over two years now. They've been
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.600]   moving it lower and lower on the page. You have to go to a separate little tab. And then they say,
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.800]   oh, we're killing it because we have a .0004 click through rate. Yeah, because you hit it.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:52.680]   Exactly. Yeah, I think you're right. I think this is more of YouTube trying to be professional.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.640]   Yeah. But that's not what people want. I think that's a mistake. And truly, I hope that someone
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.920]   else comes up with a better product. Yeah, is that they say, you know what, if you want to
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:09.080]   socially make videos together, here's what you should use. Well, you know, much like RSS, you
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:15.720]   know, Google saw this rushed RSS in the mid 2000s and then built reader and then promptly abandoned
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:22.120]   reader. This reminds me of, you know, remember, low East company, proto comments was a seismic and
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:27.640]   companies like 12 seconds. They really did kind of help Google make space for this type of video
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:33.160]   comment only to see them kill it. Yeah, of course, seismic went out of business. So did 12. I don't
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:38.440]   think 12 seconds is around. Nevertheless, vine is huge. Right. 12 seconds was just too long.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.680]   We want six seconds. That's the key. I still don't understand the vine thing. I don't.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.640]   The kids love it, Leo. The kids. It's all about the kids.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:54.520]   Big story. We're going to talk about it on Wednesday. I had Steve Gibson's talking about it on the
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:14:04.200]   radio show. More of the Snowden leaks are coming out. And now this most recent story is essentially
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:12.040]   that the national security agency has done a huge amount to bypass privacy on the web,
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:20.440]   to undermine encryption. They dedicate according to the story as much as $250 million a year
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:29.160]   of their secret budget to subverting companies like Microsoft. They literally are planning
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:35.560]   agents within these companies to put back doors in their encryption. They've subverted the national
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:41.800]   Institute for Standards and Technology, which is a standards body in the United States that,
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.880]   among other things, create standards for government encryption.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:53.400]   It seems as if we've got an out of control surveillance state.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:15:03.320]   You're not an American, American, Renee. You're in Montreal. From outside of the US,
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:08.520]   what does your take? What do you see going on here? My real concern, I think this is Bruce
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.920]   Schneier and others have raised this. My real concern is that the United States is in effect
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:21.320]   undermining the basis of the internet. And it's making United States products, if nothing else,
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.400]   if you're not worried about privacy, it means that no nation outside the United States should
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.960]   even consider a United States product. The US government told us last year, don't buy phones
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:35.640]   from Huawei and ZTE because they're made by the Chinese government in effect. And they're spying
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:42.600]   on us. We're doing the same thing. It's interesting to me because exactly what you say, there are a
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.680]   lot of states in which you live under the presumption of surveillance. A lot of people in England say
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.520]   their laws are written in such a way that this is perfectly legal and they don't understand the
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:56.360]   outcry in North America. We have CSIS in Canada, and I believe part of their purview is domestic
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:01.800]   surveillance. So there's a lot of countries where you can barely do anything without the oversight
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.480]   of the government. But the difference in the United States is that theoretically, this should not
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.760]   be possible. And if they're government, sorry, if agencies want to do this, they should go and pass
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.880]   the prerequisite laws required to make this legal and allow people to, or the Congress and the Senate
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.400]   to vote on those laws. And if it's not legal, they shouldn't be allowed to do it. I mean, they
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.360]   should have to go and make their case in a free society to a Republican, sorry, to a Republic society
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.880]   and make it legal and then go ahead and do it. But what it does is exactly what you said about
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.280]   China, you can't have confidence in buying a Chinese device because you found spyware on
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.720]   the photography frame that you bought at the local Costco or whatever it is. And the same thing
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.840]   now is true. I believe that it's so badly broken that I'm just never going to trust any technology
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.880]   company or any technology product ever again, because it's the kind of trust that once broken,
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.160]   you can never get back. If they can lie about spying now, there's no point in them saying we've
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.000]   stopped doing it because you'll never believe them. And it undermines not only the internet,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.800]   it undermines your faith in any product you use on any service ever for the rest of time.
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.800]   Bruce Bruce Bruce Bruce says it undermines the very fabric of the internet.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:16.280]   It is doing huge damage. Now Gibson came on and said, look, a lot of this is essentially
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.560]   link bait from these news agencies. He says, understand what's happening here.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:29.880]   And Schneier says this too, the math is still good. Strong encryption has not been cracked.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:36.360]   There's no reason to think that the NSA has such supercomputer powers in the basement there,
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:44.440]   that they're able to get through, you know, 2048 or much less 4096 bit, you know, RSA encryption.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:51.160]   Strong encryption still works. But the NSA realized before 9/11 and stepped it up after 9/11
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:56.440]   that the internet was rapidly going dark for them. And so has created an effort in which they
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:03.640]   spend a quarter billion dollars a year, at least, to get around this. And so they talk about a very
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:10.840]   commonly used telecom program that has been the NSA placed a backdoor in. I'm presuming it's Skype.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.400]   You have to presume that any closed source encryption like Microsoft's BitLocker or Apple's Fire Vault
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:22.840]   could very well have a backdoor in it. But Steve pointed out, and this is absolutely true,
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.000]   if you're using TrueCrypt or OpenPGP, if you're using an open source solution,
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.280]   you're likely still able to send secure messaging. Go ahead, Dan.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:40.120]   Well, I think much of what's happening here is confusing and it can be perceived as
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:47.880]   clique bait. But this is an incredibly James Bamford, who you can find his books on Audible,
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.800]   is a security researcher who's come to many of the same conclusions that, you know, you have on
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:01.160]   security now. And that is what's happened here is far more than simple failings of technology or
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:07.960]   or the ability of technology. What's very scary about this is policy decisions that led to
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:14.840]   infiltrations within the technology industry in the late 90s and early 2000s. It is not simply,
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:19.960]   it's difficult to articulate how important this is without seeming hyperbolic and clique bait
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.840]   yourself. But this is an incredibly important story, not just because of the technology components,
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:30.920]   but because of the duplicity involved and the secrecy involved in infiltrating on a human level,
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:37.320]   the entire industry. From pro-publica, cryptographers have long suspected that the NSA planted
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:42.840]   vulnerabilities in a standard adopted in 2006 by the National Institute of Standards and
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:50.680]   Technology, the US encryption standards body, and later by iOS, which has 163 countries as
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:57.400]   members. Classified NSA memos appear to confirm that the fatal weakness discovered by Microsoft
[01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.600]   cryptographers, by the way, in 2007 was engineered by the agency. They're actually subverting NIST.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.560]   The NSA wrote the standard and aggressively pushed it on the international group,
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:14.680]   privately calling the effort in these memos, quote, "a challenge in finesse." They created the standard.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:18.440]   There's two scary things about this is not only that they created backdoors,
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.880]   there's no guarantee that other people haven't found them and used them. I mean, just because
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:25.400]   the NSA is using them doesn't mean people that you'd be much more worried about than the NSA
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.720]   aren't using them. And also they store this stuff. So while the strong encryption is good now,
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.640]   who knows how good it will be in five years with the advances of computers or 10 years?
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:37.400]   But I do think that it's nice in America at least that there's a debate about this stuff going on
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:41.800]   because in a lot of countries, it's just assumed or your government is legally allowed to do this
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:46.280]   thing and there's no dialogue going on about it or people are just not aware about it. And at least
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.920]   here, and I don't know if it's clickbaity or not, the level of awareness to a culture that usually
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.160]   doesn't care about anything because privacy is, they'd rather have convenience and privacy. I'm
[01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:59.640]   really glad that debate at least is going on. Well, and we are living through a moment where we
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:05.720]   are learning incrementally almost week by week, we are learning things that either confirm things
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:11.000]   that we've thought in the past or simply are, I mean, some of the comments in here were that when
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.080]   the NSA showed this to their counterparts in Britain, that they were quote unquote "gob smacked" by this,
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:24.040]   particularly the ability to decrypt things from the past. And this is important because if you think of
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:30.040]   the degree to which the, and I'm very nonpartisan, but you'd think of the degree to which the Bradley
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:35.080]   Manning files really set off a firestorm because of the cables and what was revealed in those
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:41.240]   cables. That was a very small, very small amount of documents compared to what we are now able to
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:48.120]   access. This is akin to unlocking the past. We are able to see many of the secrets that were kept
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:55.160]   in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, and that really does inform our policy positions going forward.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:22:01.880]   With our allies and our enemies. Well, and even more securing, we've, I'm sorry, securing,
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:09.400]   even more scary, we've been assuming that SSL is secure. Yeah. And it looks like it, Steve had
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.920]   hypothesized this in on security now that the agency was looking for SSL certificates from
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:19.560]   companies like Google. Should they be able to get those certificates, they'd be able to unencrypt
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:26.280]   all SSL traffic to and from Google. And apparently they have been doing exactly that.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:35.000]   Now, interestingly, Google's response, one of Google's responses is to encrypt traffic going
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.600]   from server to server in Google. They're trying to foil this. And what's, I'd be very interested to
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:47.320]   see if this is seen as an unpatriotic move by some, you know, to thwart the NSA spying. Is that,
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:54.520]   is that to thwart our own interests, national interests? I believe that we have the right to
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.640]   privacy from these police agencies. And I also believe, and I think this is very important,
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:04.280]   that once a state becomes a surveillance state, there's no going backward. You don't go back.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:09.400]   V for Vendetta. It's almost always the first step toward a totalitarian government. We are able to
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.240]   have this conversation. Thank God now without worrying about people banging down our doors.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:19.000]   But we're moving in the very much the wrong direction. If you want to do something about this,
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.600]   Representative Rush Holt, who is a Democrat from New Jersey in the House of Representatives,
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.840]   has introduced a bill called the Surveillance State Repeal Act.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:35.880]   I think good timing, it would repeal the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:41.640]   I don't know if this thing has a chance in hell, probably not when you have a Congress
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:48.120]   or, well, it's apparently in the back pocket of the NSA. But I think you should write your
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.880]   member of Congress. One thing we know that they do care about is their constituency. And if you
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:57.800]   write them and say, please support the Surveillance State Repeal Act, if enough people write to
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:02.200]   them, I think they start to pay attention to this. This is really scary.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:09.400]   CTech Astronomy. Say again? CTech Astronomy. That was that Robert Redford movie, Sneakers,
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:18.600]   when there was no more secrets left. I would encourage people who care about this enough to
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:23.160]   want to know more about the technology to watch Wednesday on security. Now Steve's going to go
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.440]   into great detail about, based on this information, what he believes the NSA can and cannot do.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:38.360]   But I gather from him that PGP and open-source solutions like Open PGP and TrueCrypt are still
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:45.480]   reliable. Unless the NSA plants a guy saying, yeah, they're reliable. That's a problem with
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:48.520]   the open source though, right? I mean, that's the beauty of open source.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:53.480]   Yeah, people say that, Leo, but how many people are, I mean, like, I'm not a Steve Gibson level
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:58.360]   engineer, so most people can't. Yeah, Linux is great because you can hack the kernel if you want.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.280]   I can't, you know, I can't verify PGP. You have to take someone's word for it, and then it comes
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.040]   down to the trust of the person who gave that word. I think there are sufficient people in the
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:11.720]   open source community to look at this code and to vet it. I do believe it is secure and safe.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:18.440]   This is a big community of people who feel very strongly. I think the privacy is important.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:25.400]   I think it would be more than difficult, impossible to get a backdoor into open source encryption.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:31.240]   And that's the key. By the way, Rush Holt is a physicist, so he's somebody in Congress who
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:39.000]   actually understands all of this stuff. Wow. He says that the NSA is overreaching and could hurt
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.280]   American interests. And this is the way to attack it in Congress anyway, including the
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.920]   reputations of American companies whose products the agencies may have altered or influenced.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:53.960]   Holt says we pay them to spy, but if in the process they degrade the security of the
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:26:00.280]   encryption we all use, it's a net national disservice. And I believe they're also charted
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.840]   with protecting our security of our community. That's the ironic part of it is the NSA really
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:11.240]   has two missions. One is to keep us to keep our security up to make sure we are protected,
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:14.200]   as well as to find terrorists and so forth.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:23.720]   There's widespread Dan Kaminski, who's a great security researcher, a great hacker. He said
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:28.600]   there's widespread disappointment among internet security experts. This has been the stuff of
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:35.240]   wild eyed accusations for years. A lot of people are heartbroken to find out it's not just wild
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:43.160]   eyed accusations. Sasha Meinrath, who's director of the Open Technology Institute,
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:47.880]   a research group in Washington said the reports were a startling indication the US has been a
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:56.920]   remarkably irresponsible steward of the internet. You know, this is this is stuff that I've I've
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.960]   been covering the United Nations and politics for the last seven years. And I'm generally I've had
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:09.000]   all partisanship beaten out of me. And I'm not inclined to wear a tinfoil hat yet this is stuff.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.560]   You know, if you're interested in this follow @jackrice on Twitter. He's a colleague, former
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:18.520]   colleague of mine who was in the CIA for years and Jack generally is able to, you know, get rid of
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:24.280]   the FUD and get down to the brass tacks on issues. And this is the kind of stuff that is as close to
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:30.920]   tinfoil hat reality as I can remember seeing in politics and government. It is legitimately
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:38.040]   frightening. Yeah, sad that we've gotten to that point. But it's not too late. It's not too late.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.320]   Let's let's, this is please write your member of Congress go to EFF.org. They always have great
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:47.880]   political action information who to write to how to write to them how to make it work.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.720]   And I'm, you know, at this point, we ought to be pretty damn glad that Edward Snowden did leak
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:00.040]   what he leaked because boy, the more we learn about this, the worse it's sounding.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:06.520]   Moving on, let's take a break. When we come back, we have a new Kindle, the paper white,
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:12.440]   shipping September 30th. Amazon should do events. You know, I think Jeff Bezos on stage could have
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.720]   some fun. He did. He did the Kindle HD event. That's right. Why didn't they do event for this?
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.240]   Well, anyway, Amazon also, and then people like it, asking what he's going to do with the
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:31.480]   Washington Post. And Jessica Lesson writes that Amazon looks to be offering a free smartphone,
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.240]   even if you're not buying, you know, not even subsidized, just free free.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:44.840]   We'll talk about the new Yahoo logo and more. Go to meeting from HD faces are sponsored today.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.040]   The folks at Citrix have created the best way to meet online. Go to meeting. You've probably
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.040]   heard about it. It's been around for some time. It just gets better and better. One of the beauties
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:58.520]   of go to meeting is, you know, every time you start a meeting, you'll get new features, new benefits.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:05.400]   Meetings, I hate to admit it are an essential way to getting things done. It's how ideas get
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.120]   shared problems get solved. You cut through the bureaucracy and you get things done.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:16.120]   Creative solutions. It's hard with the team spread out. Everybody's in different locations.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:22.280]   We're all global now. We use go to meeting with HD faces a lot, not just to present to
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:27.080]   clients, but to meet with colleagues. I know, I know teams that keep going to meeting running all day.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.960]   With no matter where you're located, go to meeting allows you to share the same screen,
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:37.720]   making it easier to be on the same page. And with HD faces, you see the other people you're
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:42.840]   meeting with. You need crystal clear HD video. What's cool is you can do this even on an iPad or an
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:47.640]   iPhone. In fact, you could present from an iPad. They'll see your picture. It's really cool. I want
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:53.080]   you to try it free. 30 days free. Go to meeting.com. Click that orange try it free button there and
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:30:02.040]   enter our offer code to it for 30 days free. Go to meeting.com.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.720]   So let's see. Paperwhite. Have you anybody seen anything played with it? What is new on the new
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:17.800]   Kindle paper? I like the paper, the first paperwhite. It had a very nice glowing backlight that made
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:22.840]   it very legible. And unlike other kindles, you could actually use it in the dark.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:26.840]   Apparently a proofed touch screen faster processor.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:34.200]   Integration with Goodreads. Amazon purchased that. They now own both Shulfari and Goodreads, both
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:40.440]   of the big social reading networks. And there's a kid friendly mode called free time.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:47.560]   I don't know what that does exactly. I think that's similar to the Kindle Fire HD,
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:51.240]   or you can give a kid a specific amount of time that they can use things on the device.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:55.640]   Hey, I want my kid to read as much as he wants. Yeah. Not sure. I'm not sure.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:00.520]   I'm not sure. You're reading too much, Charlie. Start playing more video games.
[01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:07.320]   $119 with advertisements, $139 without advertisements available, September 30th.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:13.880]   So I like this story. I don't know, Jessica Lesson, who used to work at the Wall Street Journal,
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:18.520]   is apparently on her way to a new enterprise as a blog right now, Jessicalesson.com.
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:24.360]   She and Amira Friday are writing some pretty good stuff. Initially claimed that they were
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:29.000]   going to do a free phone. Amazon's now saying, no, no, no, no. We're not going to do a free phone.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:35.960]   Is it? But this is the challenge that Apple faces. Companies like Amazon and Google
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.760]   don't need to make money on the hardware, do they?
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:44.680]   The interesting thing is that Microsoft disrupted the entire industry with really cheap software
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.440]   a long time ago. And now Google's come in and they did free services because their business
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:53.720]   does not depend on services revenue. And the same way Apple devalued software on the app store,
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:58.680]   so it was complimentary and they could sell more iPhones and iPads, Google and Amazon are
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.680]   devaluing hardware, which is dangerous for Apple because that's how Apple makes all their money.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:07.880]   And after cheap, the next step is free. And that's really interesting because a company like
[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:13.800]   Apple can't go there, but Google and Amazon theoretically could. And it's not really a disruption
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:19.480]   because things go in cycles and you can compete with free by having better. But it's a dangerous
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:23.240]   territory because very few other companies can afford, I mean, it's destroyed Microsoft's mobile
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.400]   business, those models. There you go.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:31.800]   Now this was a big story all week. Everybody's talking about this and then Amazon didn't comment
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:38.440]   initially. But today they said, no, we're not going to launch a smartphone this year. And if we did,
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:43.880]   it will not be free. So yeah, they might as well have attacked on a nope, not yet to the end of
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:48.920]   that. Is that what it is really not yet? It sounds like it. And I think, I think for all the
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:54.680]   reasons that Renee pointed out, this is, you know, we've seen this, this erosion in the cost or at
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:33:00.840]   least the perceived cost of hardware. And Amazon is, is I think dying to go all in with a free,
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.640]   very low cost device to acquire that market. Right.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:07.960]   The problem with Amazon that Google doesn't have is that Amazon can't put devices in many
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:12.360]   countries because they care, they count on the contents. Yeah, they don't have, I mean,
[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.120]   Apple was super lucky that iTunes was there with cash registers everywhere when they launched
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:21.560]   the App Store. Amazon got five countries with the Kindle Fire and there's no way they're going to
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:25.640]   go easily into China. Google can't even, you know, do a lot of services in China. So I mean,
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:29.800]   there's, there is some protection, but in countries like America, it's a very interesting model.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:35.320]   I actually see that as being the one of the huge selling points and maybe the buried lead of the
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.840]   Kindle, the paper white and the Kindle readers themselves. Although it's not a sexy device,
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:47.240]   the standalone single purpose devices really can get so cheap that they allow Amazon into these
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:52.760]   other markets where, you know, a mobile device or a tablet, you know, a phone and a tablet are
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:59.320]   perceived so differently than a dedicated reading device. You know, who could, who could, and should
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:05.880]   offer free phones worldwide, these companies that are doing online payments, they become,
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.880]   in Africa, I can't remember the name, I never remember the name of the company, but these companies
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:17.640]   really are how people get banking done. Yeah. And make money and they could easily put a phone
[01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:24.040]   in people's hand and everybody's hands for free. It is. That's it. And PACE, a huge company.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.840]   Well, it's interesting to their Leo's that if you remember the joke from last week,
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.000]   or Amazon said no comment, the story about them saying no comment, this time they didn't say no
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   comment, which I think is interesting in the itself. Yeah. And by the way, this year is only
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.360]   got three months left or four months left. It's not exactly not till not this year is not exactly
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.960]   a blanket denial. Well, maybe in the spring, who knows, I don't know. And Facebook is still
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.000]   looming with a Facebook phone. I mean, there's so many companies that could do so many interesting
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.320]   things in the phone, right? They don't need to make money on the hardware. I got a love Marissa
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:00.440]   Meyer who has used tumbler of all things. And now that they own tumbler, I guess it makes more sense
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:08.680]   to get the corporate word out. Yes. She has a great blog post on tumbler on the new Yahoo logo. I
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:13.640]   can't get really excited about the new Yahoo logo. They try to gin up some excitement by having a
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:20.280]   different typeface every day for the last 30 days. But this is it the official Yahoo logo. Wow.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:28.040]   It's purple. It's horrible. It's just it's not it's a new typeface. But I fell in love with it a
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:34.360]   little bit more because Marissa Meyer did a great blog post that is the ultimate geeky blog posts.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.120]   Right. She focused on the typography. I mean, that was a huge part of her post.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:43.960]   Who loves this? But she didn't. She did everything but I mean, this is offensive to designers, Leo,
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:48.280]   because she took a bunch of people in a put them in a room and thought that you could manufacture
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:52.920]   design by committee. If you took the same people and said, yeah, hold the next version of Yahoo,
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:56.520]   or people would, you know, they would come out with a useless product, but people would be offended.
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:03.240]   But design is equally as important to marketing and to development. And this is so badly done.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:07.640]   Should they have hired? Should they have hired Paul Ran and just let him, you know, do whatever he
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:13.240]   wants? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, one of my early radio mentors, when I was very young, trying to
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:18.840]   be a program director, he said, you know, you hire a music director, you like, or you fire him
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.840]   and get one that you do. You never program a radio station by committee. Yeah. Right. And
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:27.000]   the same thing with this. You don't, you don't do a logo by committee. Although, you know, I love
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.720]   that she used Tumblr and an old school Tumblr theme to write a book. No, this is like a really
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:36.040]   old theme. So she writes on a personal level. I love brands. We knew this about
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:41.960]   Merci Mar. On a personal level, I love brands, logos, color design, and most of all, a dobe illustrator.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:47.000]   What? Right. Yeah. That when I read that, I thought, whatever's coming is going to be different.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.080]   I think it's one of the most incredible software packages ever made. I'm not a pro,
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.640]   but I know enough to be dangerous smiley face. So,
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:59.080]   what is she ever? So you really hate this, don't you? That's interesting.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.920]   I know. Well, she math, like she makes this big point about mathematical alignment,
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.280]   which a first year design student has beaten out of their head because you need optical
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.400]   alignment. Right. Because people have eyes. It's not math. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:15.160]   So she writes one weekend this summer, I rolled up my sleeves and dove into the trenches with our
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:21.800]   logo design team. We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish.
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:26.120]   She spent a whole weekend doing it. What are you talking about, Renee? And we had a ton of fun
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:31.560]   weighing every minute detail. So we didn't want any straight lines in the logo. We preferred letters
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:37.080]   that had thicker and thinner strokes. Serifs were a big part of the old logo. We felt it was wrong
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:43.160]   to give them a ball together. So we went for a sans serif font with scallops. All right. All right.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:49.400]   Our existing logo felt like the iconic Yahoo Yodle. We wanted to preserve that and do something
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:55.320]   playful with the O's. The funniest thing is that they, our last move was to tilt the exclamation point
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.720]   by nine degrees to add just a bit of whimsy. Nine degrees of whimsy.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.960]   I love him. tumblr.com.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:11.960]   So a bunch of people in the room let them run Yahoo for a weekend. Yeah.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.800]   But I, you know, I, you know, I, I mean, I don't think the logo is that big a deal. So I'm not
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:22.040]   going to slam around. I love it that she put this post out. It's particularly geeky. And then,
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:25.880]   and then she said, here's a fun video created by our amazing intern Max.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:30.600]   It feels like a startup, doesn't it? This is what a startup would write.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:37.160]   And they show the whole process in the blueprint. But really now, I see, did you study design, Renee?
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:41.240]   It sounds like yes. I have a design background. Okay. There you go. Nothing is bitchier than a
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:47.320]   designer who has been wronged. So, so you feel that this demeans the profession?
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.840]   No, it's the same thing when you get a bad press release. You're like, you know, you get those
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:54.920]   badly written and it's such an easy thing to get right. They almost have to go out of your way to
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.640]   get it wrong. And I feel bad for Yahoo as a brand that she let them go out of their way to get this
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:05.800]   wrong. Does it matter? Come on. It's just a company. It's purple. It's got a CorelDRAW
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.880]   bevel on it. I mean, it doesn't really matter. It is kind of a CorelDRAW bevel, isn't it? Yeah.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.040]   That's a good point. Now I hate it too. It didn't happen.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:19.160]   You've convinced me. Oh, well. I want Yahoo to do well. I mean, we get this knock. All the time,
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:23.640]   people say we hate Microsoft and we hate Google or we hate Apple. And we love all these technology
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:28.120]   companies deeply. That's why we do this. And we get upset because we want them to succeed
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:32.280]   phenomenally. And you know, we get bitchy when they disappoint us. It's like a movie critic.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:37.160]   You know, you don't say movie critics hate movies. No, they love movies so much. They get upset when
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:43.800]   they're bad. Yeah, exactly. So that's really what we are in a way is we're tech critics.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:50.680]   I mentioned CBS and Time Warner made a deal. So good news if you live in LA and Dallas and
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:57.320]   New York City, you can watch the NFL on CBS. They ended the blackout this week, right in time for
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:02.760]   the football season. What a shock. I think the CBS just knew they just don't want to just sit it
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:08.840]   out. They'll come to the right. There's no, you know, we got this clock ticking. So
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.440]   nobody's saying what the deal is, but I got to think CBS got what I wanted. And you know,
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:16.440]   just all time Warner has to do is pass along to the consumers.
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.720]   Yep. Yeah. You know, the irony about that is I live in New York. So I've been watching these
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:27.080]   wonderful ads that they're bitching at each other, aren't they? Yeah, right. But they've run them.
[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:32.680]   Some somebody did great traffic on this and program them right next to Amazon Prime under the dome.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:38.760]   So like, it's like, you can watch TV on the internet like it was made to be watched.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.880]   Right. Right. Exactly. You know, they'll run a spot that says, you know,
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:48.600]   bring CBS back, bring it back or just get Amazon Prime and you'll be fine. Unbelievable.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:55.080]   One fifth. This is a, this is a story that's a little close to home for me. According to courts,
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.840]   one fifth, actually it's not courts, but the court story quotes,
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.880]   page fair, which is a service websites used to measure the extent of ad blocking.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:13.240]   22.7% of people who visit websites block the ads.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:18.760]   Page fair estimates. Now remember, this is their business. So they're, you know,
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:22.920]   there may be some conflict of interest here, but they say one of its typical clients with a
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:28.600]   25% blocking rate loses about half a million dollars a year due to ad blockers.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:35.480]   Websites are most, website ads are most often blocked when they tend to cater to the technologically
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:40.680]   savvy. So this is a graph of ad blocking by site category. Number one, gaming sites,
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:47.320]   one out of three visitors block ads, technology sites, one out of every four. For travel websites,
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:51.320]   it's only 5% one out of 20 because those people don't know how to block. Why isn't
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:58.280]   the NSA fighting this Leo? Yeah. Well, what this, what this does not address is very, you know,
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:02.520]   there's certainly, you know, the integrated type of advertising that you do here in Twit,
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:07.080]   but this doesn't address native advertising that has been pioneered by BuzzFeed and Huffington
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:11.480]   Parlison by native advertising. That is the jargon the industry, the media and advertising
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:16.760]   industry term for advertising that looks and sometimes is almost indistinguishable from the
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:21.240]   content that you will also find on these sites. And in fact, these, these companies in particular,
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.320]   but others as well have started creating native advertising for other publishers,
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.960]   for other media publishers. And so although we are seeing this, you know, at scale, of course,
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:36.840]   the cheap remainder to ads are blocked. Of course, this, this doesn't address the massive rise of
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:41.800]   native advertising and how that's influencing the content business as a whole. No, and that's
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:47.080]   the big point is that if you don't like banner ads, you're going to hate the sneaky ads they're
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:51.480]   going to resort to because you're blocking banner ads. You have a young junior eating a
[01:42:51.480 --> 01:42:57.640]   Burger King burger on the Iron Man movie. You know, it's no accident that Nestle is paying
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:03.400]   Google for a kick. This is what happens. I think I might have another little rush.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.240]   That's why we can't have nice ads. And there are studios. Now, I'm not saying this is bad,
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:10.920]   and I think this is just fine. It's an evolution, but you know, at Gawker and
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:17.080]   Huffington Post and BuzzFeed, these companies have studios that create native advertising.
[01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:22.120]   They create this is product placement on crack. It is advertising that looks and feels
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:28.680]   and is placed on sites so that it should look and feel just like content. That is something that
[01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:34.680]   is here to stay and going to become even more right. We'll see more of it.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:40.040]   But it's advertisers fault because they made the obnoxious belly fat ad that you got a block
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:45.960]   because it's the most disgusting thing ever saw. And punch the monkey. I don't I understand
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.840]   why people block ads. They're hard. Right. Of course. It's a transition thing.
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.360]   Remember that magazines for a while had ads that people got confused and they had to put
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:58.280]   this thing at the top. And this is a paid advertisement for. Yeah. So the same thing will happen.
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:05.640]   And I don't think so. I don't think the FTC is going to is going to end up regulating this.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.480]   I don't think it's huge. I'll try it. It was a huge icon. I forget the outlet was the Atlantic
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:17.080]   that had the Scientology post that looked like a real estate. They had to apologize. Yeah.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:23.960]   It was terrible. It was a pro Scientology article on the Atlantic. And they had to
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:28.760]   had to apologize. It was a terrible thing. But look, I certainly can't blame media companies for
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:33.560]   doing what they have to do to to sell advertising. This crap ain't free. You know, I got to pay
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:39.240]   for the kick. Exactly. I ran a company based on advertising last year. And so I got to work
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:45.640]   out for it. Yeah. Right. Right. Not that much. We have our talk mobile sponsored by Blackberry,
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:51.320]   but at the very top, it says sponsored by Blackberry. Right. You know, somebody wrote me an email.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.400]   I can't remember her name or I give her credit because I was complaining about this KitKat thing
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:01.560]   on Windows Weekly, one of our shows. And I mentioned that we were considered studio naming. And she
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:08.120]   was all upset that I would mention studio naming or consider selling the studio name.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:13.880]   And I want to say, you know, this, I spend literally millions of my dollars a year in my own money
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.920]   to build the studio to do all this stuff costs a lot of money. And we need to monetize it.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:21.480]   You don't get free internet content
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:27.080]   without somebody paying for it. Now, I think advertising should be handled,
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.920]   should be done ethically. It should be. And when we do ads, I think it's pretty clear it's an ad.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:37.400]   We don't let it influence the content. We certainly don't sneak. I know I think it should
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:46.680]   never be sneaky ads. You know, ads should be clearly ads. But I know if people walk ads,
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:49.640]   you're going to something's going to have to happen. Either these sites will shut down. We
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:56.760]   don't have Dan's podcast anymore. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's that's a microcosm of exactly what's
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:00.760]   happening. I mean, I walk down St. Catherine's Street, the biggest street in Montreal,
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:05.000]   and I see the Molson Stadium and I see the Scotia bank. There's no longer the movie theater. It's
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.040]   the Scotia Bank movie theater. That's a little that's ridiculous. Absolutely. But that's what's
[01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:14.120]   happened with all these because they can't afford to do it without turning to some form of monetization.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:20.360]   Anyway, you know, something's going to break. Something's going to go here.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.960]   NASA launched a new lunar mission to investigate glowing moon dust.
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:34.200]   John's so excited about this. The Laddie blasted off a couple of nights ago.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:41.720]   John, you're going to have to explain this to me. There's apparently been a question for 40 years
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:49.080]   back to the Apollo 17 mission. Eugene Cernan saw what he described as streamers and Aurora
[01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:55.400]   Borealis effect bursting from the lunar horizon. And we've never in 30 years, 40 years figured
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:47:04.120]   out what the hell's going on there. So we we've launched a program, Laddie, to try to solve this
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:10.760]   mystery. So there, NASA still, NASA's still alive. It's going to use a laser based. This is the
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:16.760]   thing that's really cool. John's so jumping up and down a laser based communication system,
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:25.480]   basically giving us broadband access to the moon at 238,000 miles away. That's pretty cool.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:31.240]   So Laddie will be collecting information and sending it back here at megabits a second.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:37.800]   But we still can't figure out how to get high speed internet in half the country, but that's,
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:41.160]   you know, lasers. I don't know. Alex Lindsey's up there doing a hangout for the whole time.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:48.360]   But he is no one Alex. He's on his way. We will be we will be covering, as I mentioned,
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:55.000]   the live announcement at the Apple Town Hall. We can't be there, but neither can you. You can be
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:02.360]   there together with us watching as it happens, starting 930 AM Pacific 1230 Eastern time on Tuesday.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:07.160]   Please join us for our roundtable discussion right after Mac break weekly. Renee Rich, you'll
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:14.760]   be here for that. Sir. Also, we have the usual cast and Yannaco. You see, I think he got an
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:20.600]   invite, right? He's flying out. So he'll be in there. Correct. Yeah, we should call him. We will.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:26.840]   We'll, I want him to, you know, and you know, so we remember Becky Warley, FaceTime does from the
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:31.800]   demo area. And as Steve Jobs walked by, she said, Mr. Jobs, Mr. Jobs, and asked him a question.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.720]   Now that's reporting. And he says, Oh, I'm gonna wait. I don't want to offend anybody. No,
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:41.240]   offend them. The long game. He's playing the long game. See, I offended them and now look at me.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:48.200]   I'm sitting out here at the on the step looking in. Join us. It'll be a lot of fun.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:53.800]   Hey, thank you so much for being here. Dan Patterson. Thank you. You want to know more
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:59.640]   about what Dan is up to? You can visit the Sum All Foundation at sumall, S U M A L L dot org.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:08.600]   So then a lot of the news is coming from this is you. Yeah, much. Yeah, most of the content there
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:17.480]   is and my stuff I'm writing at medium and Twitter. But right, it's it is really this idea of of
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:21.800]   maybe not explicitly subsidized journalism, but that's effectively what we're doing. And that is
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:26.840]   that we have access to data. And we have the ability to analyze that data. And I have the ability to
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:31.800]   write about it. And so somebody should be doing that. So hopefully we can set some type of template
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:38.840]   where I mean, I'm writing about other fun stuff as well, video games and tech products for sure.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:45.160]   But this is one way to say, all right, let's let's see if people really are into learning
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:50.360]   and understanding about the nuance of issues, not just the superficial, you know, clickbait based
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:57.800]   on big data like this visualization of the serious Syria crisis timeline based on you have
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:05.160]   United Nations casually count cross referenced with refugee count, trend volumes of tweets and
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:11.720]   Google plus search or Google searches, most shared articles, the timeline of the war and you've
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:16.920]   correlated this. This is fascinating stuff. I mean, the the merging of big data with news
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.000]   reporting just fascinating. Really cool. Thank you, Dan. I
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.400]   appreciate it. Well, hopefully we can continue to do more of that.
[01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:28.440]   Some all that work. And we'll have you back soon at Dan Patterson on Twitter.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:36.200]   Renee Richie, he's going to be with us on Tuesday from imore.com. You also be doing your own live
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.280]   coverage of the event. I don't want to undermine that. Where should they go to to watch that?
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:45.800]   It'll we have imore.com slash iPhone dash events. We've got a big super page up there. And we've
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.680]   been putting I don't like to call them previews because nothing exists yet. So it's imagining the
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:58.280]   iPhone 5s. Will you have a live blogger in the all? No, we will be doing meta coverage, which
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:01.640]   we like Apple can do can tell their own story. They're really good at it. So what we want to do
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:06.760]   is provide context, color and analysis of what they're saying, you know, just to make sure
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:11.240]   that it drives us what we understand to be regular person reality and also how it fits into the
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:15.720]   bigger market. We're doing meta meta coverage. So we're going to take all the meta coverage.
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:20.440]   And we're going to cover that. It's like bidding a dollar on prices rightly. You just scooped all of
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.880]   us. And you'll be one of the sources for the meta meta coverage. Great. It's great to see you
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:31.960]   again, Renee. We'll have you for a Mac break with me right after the announcement. Thanks,
