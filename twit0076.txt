[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Time to Twit and a great panel joining us back from
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   the dark side John C. Devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Oh John, I haven't seen you in three weeks.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   You've been on a boat.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I was on a boat. We did a twit on a boat.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And right in the middle of the twit, the captain gets on
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   for six minutes to give us a scenery brief.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Man, I had to edit that part out.

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   She is the queen of buzz at CNET Buzz. CNET.com.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Hey Molly.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Hello.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Welcome back.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I'm in love in Buzz Out Loud by the way.

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Oh thank you.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   You do every day what we try to do once a week.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We do it a little shorter than you.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   That's why.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   You have a studio too which helps.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   That does help.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And it's right down the hall.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Hello Will.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Good morning.

[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Great enthusiast site which I really enjoy reading.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   In fact we're going to talk a little later about a great column
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   you just wrote this week on why Dual-Core is a good thing for gamers.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Oh there's a fantastic column so I'm glad.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah I'm really excited by that.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   But first of all I'm leaving out our newest panel member.

[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Yes nice to be here Leo.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Brian's actually co-author of the new Vista Secrets with my buddy Paul
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Therat who does our Windows weekly podcast.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And that'll be out just before Vista comes out.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And also you've got some news.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You've got your Windows Secrets newsletter which has a quarter of a million
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   listeners now, readers now has merged with the Langer list.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So that's a lot of readers.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Congratulations.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   That's right starting on November 16th.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Congratulations that's one of our first merge newsletter.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And you're on for one million subscribers.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   That's it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   You're on for that reason but also because this was the week that Microsoft
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   after five years of struggle finally went gold with Windows Vista.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Is it a big ceremony when they do that?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Do they have a guy with a briefcase and handcuffs, a golden ticket, anything
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   or is it just kind of quietly slip cert to seriously slip to FedEx?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   They actually had a power outage in the building that they were making
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   the final gold CD and they couldn't do it one day.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So that was one of the day of the delay right there.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   They would think they'd have a generator or something.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Well it's not Florida.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So they don't expect those things up in Washington state.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But I don't know about the men with the briefcase and the handcuffs but
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   they presumably have some way of getting it to the manufacturing and
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I am told that it takes about three or four weeks to make all of the CDs
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and then they have to truck them to stores.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Meanwhile corporations are going to be starting to get their own master
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   copies of Windows Vista and will be installing it at November.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   But the consumers supposedly will have to wait until January 30th to
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   stand in line in the freezing cold to be the first to buy their copy of
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   this to end a store.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   It's been five years since we had a Windows launch.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Will there be a big launch event as there was with XP and 95?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I remember 95s.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Microsoft has an event in New York City on November 30th that is for the press
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and I don't know what they're doing in January.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You would think that they would have had a big event if they were in time
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   for the Christmas season.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And I think a lot of people are crying that they didn't have it out
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   before Christmas because buying a computer in December with XP on it
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and getting a coupon to get Vista installed later is really not as much
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   fun as seeing a computer with Vista on it under your Christmas tree.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You agree John?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You think it's fun getting a computer with Vista on it under your Christmas tree?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   God no.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   When are you running out to buy your copy of Vista?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Why?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   When will they send it to you?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Let me put it this way.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   When will you install a machine or get a machine with it?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I probably wait until the machine comes pre-installed with it
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   when the next couple of rounds.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   There's some new machines coming out.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   There are some new chips coming out at the end of the year from both AMD
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and Intel that might be good for Vista.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And there's also the issue of the hybrid hard disk.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Those haven't really gone into full production yet.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I want to wait for those.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Will you'll probably have one as soon as they're available for review?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   It'd be good to finally get hands on with the final code and really see how it all panned out.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I'm more anxious about installing it seeing how it works on my MacBook.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Right.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Because from my point of view, the problem with Vista,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   well not the problem with Vista, but Vista comes with DirectX 10 and of course,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   there's no DirectX 10 games yet for quite a while,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   so for gamers and enthusiasts, there isn't really much reason to upgrade to Vista.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I'm thinking I'm going to build a quad core 64-bit machine,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   get a GeForce 8800 and Vista,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and then just wait until something I can actually run on.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I don't think I can actually work on that platform.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But boy, it'll be a nice platform.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Look at it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Yeah, that's all I'll be able to do actually.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I agree with the hardware, but I'm not sure you'd eat Vista for it right now.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I've got one of those up and running in the office,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and it's very nice indeed, but not with Vista.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Actually, Steve Gibson on Thursday will do a Vista security summary,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   and not to steal his thunder too much, but the main point he makes,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and I think Brian, you'd probably agree with this,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   is that if you want a secure Vista, 64-bit Vista is the way to go,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   even though it doesn't run stuff as well,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   hardware won't work as well, there may not be drivers yet.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Security software doesn't work, but that's the way to go secure.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   64-bit Vista requires special 64-bit hardware,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   which many people don't have in their PCs,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   but it will be much more secure than the 32-bit version.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   That's because Microsoft has been able to take advantage of the hardware
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   and keep applications that are not part of the operating system
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   from making changes to the operating system kernel.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I think Internet Explorer 7 will benefit from that too,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   with its patch guard technology that prevents a website
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   from changing virtually any of your system settings or your registry,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   and of course a lot of websites out there
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   would very much like to change your registry
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and make their own code run every time,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   so they can be monitoring your keystrokes
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   and stealing your passwords and things like that.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   If you have IE7 now on XP, it does not do that.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It will do that on Vista.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   It will do it on 32 as well as 64-bit Vista, is it?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Only 64-bit Vista.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Well, Internet Explorer has some security features that require Vista
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and don't work on Windows XP,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   but Internet Explorer 7 will benefit from Windows Vista's security features
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   that only work on 64-bit hardware.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I see.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   So, you know, we can go into that and draw a chart
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   of what Willon will not work.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   No, please.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   You're better off with IE7 than with IE6,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   and you're better off with 64-bit hardware and 64-bit Vista
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   than without.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I would caution consumers not to just go out
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   and buy 64-bit hardware and 64-bit Vista and install it
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   and expect everything they're using today to run.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I don't even know everything that won't run.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   On 64-bit hardware, it's really a crapshoot
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   whether things have been upgraded to work with 64-bit hardware today
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   or not.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And if you really want to experiment and you know what you're doing,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   do buy a 64-bit system and do install 64-bit Vista on it
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   and see what will work and don't.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And let me know.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Right on the list.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And send it to Brian, WindowsSecrets.com.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Well, did you see that Jim Olch,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   who was the sort of outgoing head of the platform group, isn't it, Microsoft?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Who said he was quite happy to run, to let his son run Vista
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   without any antivirus software installed.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That's how confident he was about security.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   He doesn't say if it's a 64-bit version, doesn't he?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   He doesn't say that now.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That's true.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Plus, he doesn't say whether he'd last his time to have email or serve the web.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   My son is only playing living books, but he's safe, boy.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It's just a mind-sweeper.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   This, where the headline writer really has not accurately described the content of the story,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   because what Jim Olch and said in the story is that his son is restricted
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   to only using sites that Jim Olch and has approved using parental controls.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   So yes, if I can restrict my kid to only visiting Disney.com,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I wouldn't have to use an antivirus program because I think he won't get a virus from Disney.com.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Yeah, although he did say that he wouldn't say the same about Windows XP though.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Well, Vista XP doesn't have parental controls, so you can't restrict which sites a person is going to,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   or if XP does have parental controls, a seven-year-old would certainly be able to disable them.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Here's a feature that he talks about I had never heard of called ASLR Address Space Layout Randomization.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   He says that the address space is different on every Vista machine.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   That's bizarre.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Well, that's a very good feature, actually.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   If I could say something from Windows Secrets, a lot of viruses do take advantage of the fact
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   that the operating system has code that's in a specific place and memory every time.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So, a buffer overflow can jump to a specific address and know exactly what's going to be at that address,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   and know it'll get executed.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Well, if the virus runs one time, it can patch that executable in memory,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and then the next time that you open Notepad or something,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   running the virus, that's oversimplification of what's actually happening.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   With address randomization, the virus doesn't know that patching a certain address in memory
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   is actually going to be some executable code that the operating system needs to run.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   That's a very good feature.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I wouldn't say that just addressing your space randomly makes you invulnerable to viruses,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   because any spyware that you download and you click OK, and you say,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   "I will let this program run."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Does it then program then runs?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It doesn't need to patch a space in memory because you just let it run.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So, you haven't really made yourself invulnerable.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   It does eliminate a class of viruses that do patch Windows in memory.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   We are getting ready for at least six months to a year of Vista Vista Vista.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   John, are you dreading that?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Oh, I'm already dreading the way this conversation's going on this show.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   You're forced already.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And it's just beginning.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I mean, really, this is the beginning of it.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   On the other hand, Brian, you've got to look forward to it because,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   "Hey, it's been five years.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   There's probably not many secrets left in Windows XP."
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Well, I didn't think there were any in the first place.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   So, I've written a ten books called Windows Secrets,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   and I declined to write a book called Windows XP Secrets.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Somebody else did, and it was a bomb.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   But I thought that XP was a terrible implementation because the ActiveX features that they put into Internet Explorer 6
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   were very dangerous, were certain to be taken advantage of by hackers,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   and that's exactly what happened with XP.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Microsoft said XP was the most secure version of the operating system ever,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and those were lies.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   They were not secure.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   They didn't know the operating system was secure, but they marketed that way,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   and they have egg all over their face for having thousands of virus writers all over the world
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   taking advantage of their terribly insecure operating system.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I think Vista is much, much better.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   That's not saying a lot, but being much, much better than XP does make it an operating system that I would like to see people buy.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   As soon as they buy a new computer, they should really get Vista.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   They shouldn't buy a new computer with XP on it these days.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Speaking of, you know, Dell is a sponsor on this program.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I don't know if Dell pays President Bush.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I know that Michael Dell is a supporter of President Bush.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You know where I'm going with this, Molly.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Yes, indeed.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   I want to play a little clip of it for you of the President's remarks in which he essentially plugs Dell.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   But do you think it was...
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Do you know what I'm talking about, John?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Have you seen this video?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   You probably put it on your blog.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   No, I didn't put it on the blog.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I'm familiar with it.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And there's actually some sort of a violation, by the way, that did this kind of thing.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   He says people will be watching it on their Dell televisions.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   He says, "Oh, I meant to say televisions, but I started saying "deliv--" and then I stopped and I said "tell--"
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Although, when you watch the video, I watched it a couple times just to make sure because it was so odd.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   And I actually had it on in my office live and remember turning around going, "Did he just say..."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It sure sounded like it.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It doesn't seem like a stutter.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It doesn't really seem like it starts to say televisions.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Well, I'm going to play a little bit of it.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And it's tough in a time of war.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   When people see carnage on their Dell television screens, you may think about it.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   That sure sounds like Dell television screens, doesn't it?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's absolutely deliberate.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Well, on the time, it sounds like maybe he went to say like a curse word starting with these real televisions.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   He was in a dead--
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   You know, Dell is a big company out in Texas.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   He's got a dozen Austin.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   They give a lot of money.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Michael, tell us a big push supporter.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   When people see carnage on their Dell television screens, you may think that sure sounds like Dell television screens.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I will say that of all the things that were happening that day, it is amazing to me that Dell would be that top of mind for the President.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Well, what's really amazing is how much press they got.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I mean, even if it wasn't this statement, they sure got some mileage out of it.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I think I can't imagine him actually trying to say give Dell a surreptitious plug.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   That's it.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Yeah, that seems a little fun.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   They do make televisions.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   They do make televisions.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   They make televisions.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   They make HGTVs.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   You bet.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   You can buy a Dell television and watch whatever you want on it.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Okay, where can you buy it from, Leo?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Why Dell.com.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   In fact, if you go through Leo's pics page, I'm sure you'll find a great deal.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Well, they're getting a big plug here.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I was thinking about--
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   They're responsive, Ryan.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   They're responsive, Ryan.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   We make sure we say their name is often as possible.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Twit.tv/dell.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Twit.tv/dell.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.560]   No, actually, I think they got a bigger plug from President Bush than they'll ever get
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.080]   from us.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   John--
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.080]   No comment.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080]   No comment.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.560]   I sent to John-- I sent you all my-- I went to NPR called and said, we'd like a review of
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.360]   the Zoom on all things considered.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.760]   I said, I'd be glad to do it, but I got to get one first.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.000]   Send a note to Wagner Edstrom saying, I'd like a Zoom.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And they come out.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Zoom comes out Tuesday.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   It's coming soon.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Haha.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   I had to get that.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   But I'm bummed.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.840]   And I got in return a Zoom reviewers kit agreement, which I sent to you all.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.000]   It's kind of restrictive.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.840]   I find this thing very weird as a former reviewer and someone who's borrowed a lot of products.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.040]   I've never seen anything like that.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.560]   Have you seen a lot of these, John?
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   Have you seen anything like this before?
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.960]   No, this is the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen coming out of Microsoft to be
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   honest about.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   They should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960]   Seriously.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.680]   In reviews, you must only reference the name of the device and services in the following
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   way.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.360]   Zoom, Zoom device, Zoom marketplace, Zoom software, Zoom.net.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.960]   And you may not refer to the Zoom reviewer kit in any way.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   Haha.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   What?
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   I don't know what that goes on and on.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   It's worse than the thing is unbelievable.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.040]   It says, you can't take it apart.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.680]   It says, you have no permission or right to disassemble the Zoom device.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   To what extent?
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.080]   I wonder, can you take the battery out?
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   Apparently not.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   No.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   It's very common on enthusiast websites to take apart devices like this and show what's inside.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.720]   You know what this says to me?
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.560]   Somebody got in the company either at the PR agency or at Microsoft or somewhere with
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.040]   their, I don't know what can I say, their heads up their ass.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040]   Haha.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.720]   And they did this as some sort of an initiative.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.120]   Nobody caught it because I don't believe for a minute that the top guys in Microsoft
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.240]   wouldn't fire somebody over this note.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.960]   I mean, this reminds me, I'm going to give the anecdote that I mentioned earlier.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.600]   When years and years ago, and somebody might remember the name of this product, but Xerox
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.040]   had a desktop publishing package that was competitive with all the other ones back in
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.920]   the day and the early days of the laser jet.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:05.160]   And they were letting people review it and they sent out some similar documents such as
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.120]   this to reviewers.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:14.920]   And apparently it was just done by some lawyer who just rewrote some old nondisclosure agreement
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.680]   that has something to do with copying machines because there was a number of provisions in
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.720]   there about how you're going to hold the company blameless if you get injured by the
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.520]   product or if you drop it on your foot.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   It's software.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.240]   Maybe it was a big box.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.080]   And it was an incredibly stupid document that really didn't even let you review the product.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.320]   And it was just like I ended up course writing a column about the document because it's more
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:45.120]   interesting to readers to know what kind of shenanigans these companies do in the background.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.120]   And it's just foolishness.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.080]   Well, needless to say, I didn't sign this nor did I review it and I'm not going to be
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.400]   reviewing it on Regis and Kelly or on the NPR.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.320]   But of course, by talking about the document, you are breaking the terms of the document.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.320]   No, because I didn't sign anything.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   I could sign it.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.720]   It's like Fight Club or something.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.240]   You can't sign those documents and then you don't have to worry about it.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240]   They give you the document.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.200]   They don't make you sign a nondisclosure before you get the document.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.800]   You can't disclose the contents of this document.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.360]   You have to sign that first.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.360]   That'll be correct.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360]   They'll go.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   I forgot to send this to you.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   Have you?
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.320]   They don't want you to disassemble the Zoom because you might find out why it's almost twice
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.280]   the bulk of an Apple iPod.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   It is, isn't it?
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   And I'd like to myself.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.880]   I'm sure that somebody will take it apart and they've used old Flash RAM or something that
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.160]   is making it a lot heavier and a lot thicker than the iPods.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.000]   You would think that Microsoft would be able to buy better technology.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.080]   It is bigger, but I like the rubberized plastic.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.080]   That's the new thing now.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.040]   It's this soft rubberized plastic and it does have that.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.680]   Have you held one, Molly?
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.240]   I have to admit.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   I mean, I liked that, but I was so distracted by its sheer hugeitude that I was a little
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   distracted by that.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.880]   There is a reason for the curiosity.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.040]   It's got an extreme.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.520]   The video looks good on it.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.320]   I think it's got a good user interface.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.960]   I should mean the depth, the thickness of the device.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.080]   The screen could be six inches, but it could be one tenth of an inch thick.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.400]   I found it surprisingly.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.240]   To me, it was much more...
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:21.480]   I found it more comparable to an Arcos device, like a portable media player, than strictly...
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.800]   And maybe it's just possible that it's been cast in the wrong light and it should be more
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.240]   fairly compared to portable media players than to an iPod.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.120]   But it's way too large for me to ever want to buy.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.480]   Poor Arcos had us sent out a press release saying, "Wait a minute.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.720]   We've got a Wi-Fi device.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.240]   We've had one for you."
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.160]   They're just kind of lost in the fog.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.960]   Have you played with this Zoom yet?
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.960]   Will Harris?
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.440]   No, well, unfortunately, we were a bit stuffed over in the UK because they haven't...
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.400]   Or rather, a Microsoft board came out and said that we weren't likely to see it over
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.600]   in Europe until early 2008.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   2008 was a great rubbish.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.600]   Not next year.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.880]   I'm sorry to report that the document that they sent Leo also says, "In no way could
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   he send it to you."
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880]   It does say that.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.880]   I can't...
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.920]   It says specifically, "Will Harris cannot have."
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.120]   Well, the problem is that they've...
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.240]   Apple obviously took a while after rolling out the iTunes music store and the States
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.320]   to roll it out across Europe and then all the various different countries.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.200]   Or Microsoft is only just now sort of starting on that tech.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.520]   So they've got it all sorted out for the States, but they don't have to sort of get someone
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.120]   to build a store in the UK then get someone to sign up on it.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   And that's the thing I don't understand.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.720]   And then do all these different things.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.600]   They're starting from scratch with the Zoom.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   There's a new store.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.040]   It won't work with Windows Media Player 11.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.280]   David Ewald on Forbes.com writes Zoom stinks.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.000]   And he says, and it's not about the hardware.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.520]   He says the fact that it doesn't...
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.520]   You can't use Windows Media Player 11.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.280]   You have to use the new Zoom software.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.360]   The slogan for the Zoom store is "Welcome to the Social."
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   Remember these have socials, like Ice Cream Socials?
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   In the 20s?
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.240]   Is that their idea of hip?
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   Welcome to the...
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   I don't know.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.600]   That concept may be developed by the same idiot that did that non-disclosure agreement
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   they sent you.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.600]   And then get this.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   And this is from Ewald.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.240]   By the way, as soon as Ewald wrote this in online at Forbes, hundreds of pro-Microsoft
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   comments.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.560]   Like, "You idiot!
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.560]   You moron!
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.560]   Zoom's great!"
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   Came in.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   Really?
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   Munchkins are back in work.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   Well, they're aiming the Zoom kids, I guess.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.560]   Here's...
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560]   Get this.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560]   He says...
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.240]   This actually Walt Bosberg's writing this in the journal, but he quotes MOSSPARK to buy
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.000]   a 99 cent song from the Zoom store.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.800]   You can't just give them a credit card number as you can in iTunes and buy a song.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.000]   You have to purchase a block of points from Microsoft.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.200]   And it has to be five bucks or more.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.520]   And then the weird thing is the points don't equate to cents.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.400]   Things which are 99 cents are 79 points.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.360]   So you have to figure out what a point is compared to a cent.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.400]   Well, it's weird and it's the same system they use on the Xbox 360.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.480]   That's who's figured it out is the Xbox Live kitties.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   They get it.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.600]   Well, Nintendo is going to do points with the Wii 2.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   Absolutely hate.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:15.200]   Well, you know, I was ranting about this and a stoop listener wrote in to tell me that
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:23.200]   the reason why is because none of the increments ever add up to a zero, you know, a zero sum,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.200]   or a zero dollar amount.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:30.360]   So that you either always end up giving them some money or you end up buying more points
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   in order to complete a transaction.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   So it's just a constant...
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.280]   Don't they have enough of our money that we don't have to lend them four bucks to buy
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   a 99 cent song?
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.120]   And this is the prime number of some sort.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.760]   There should be a way to get the thing to zero balance.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   But it might cost you thousands of dollars.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.920]   Well, let me say, yeah, around 79.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.920]   What is...
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.160]   John, figure out what is the largest common factor of 79 with a zero at the end?
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.920]   You'll get there, but you'll be bankrupt.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   The zero is six.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.920]   Go ahead.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.480]   Oh, I was going to say the most sort of dumb-founding thing to me about all of this is that after
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.840]   spending so much time and energy creating the plays for sure DRM scheme and sort of,
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.680]   you know, an alternative to the iTunes universe, then they just come along and create a brand
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.480]   new closed ecosystem that doesn't even support music that they themselves have been selling
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.440]   at the MSN Music Store, which is now gone.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.520]   It's crazy.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.520]   It just goes on and on.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520]   It's ludicrous.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.400]   Doesn't that suck for people that have bought music from the MSN Music Store?
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   You can't buy a song.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   Big time.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.400]   You know when you use it?
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   Big time.
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.320]   Or people who have bought music from any of that or have a few subscriptions library from
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   Raps like that.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.840]   It sounds like the Keystone cops.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   It does.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.480]   But once you guys bump it into each other, they don't know what they're doing.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.120]   They're sending out that idiotic document that you got.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.640]   They can't get their act together.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.320]   It's an incredible, I'm telling you.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.080]   It's just this company has got nothing but these kinds of problems.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.520]   If it wasn't for the Xbox people who seem to be the only group that they're acting
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520]   together.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   It's Jay Allard who did this.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520]   That's what I don't get.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   He ought to know about it.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.000]   Well, Leo, you'd have to buy 495 songs.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   There you go.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.360]   Before 99 cents would add up to an amount of this, a multiple of $5.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.440]   I'm glad we have somebody who does, who can do math on this show for the change.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.360]   But he and Microsoft knows that people spend more money when they're spending points than
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360]   when they're spending dollars.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.120]   This is why you have tickets when you go to the Amazon market and you get tickets and
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.480]   you go on the rides and you get how much you pay.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.440]   Yeah, they don't pull the shit man against one of the most sophisticated and attractive
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.120]   stores on the internet, which is the iTunes store.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.840]   They are not going to make much headway with this kind of a pricing model when you can
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   just go to options.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.200]   Hey, can I throw in something here on this idea that you buy more with these points and
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   you do with real money?
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.920]   There's another aspect to this called barriers to entry.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   That's true.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.840]   And barriers to entry, which is another marketing concept, is when the more barriers to entry
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.600]   that you create, the less sales you get.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.640]   And this is a barrier to entry in a big way.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.120]   Look how simple it is to buy as Brian is saying.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.840]   Look at how simple it is to buy something on iTunes.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.640]   You click it, you own it.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.080]   They've got your credit card number.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   You do have to give that.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.080]   You have to sign up at first.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   But once you've signed up, it's painted as I know, because I keep buying songs I wish
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.480]   I wouldn't.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.400]   It's painfully easy to buy a song.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:17.000]   Well, and I will say that even though the masses are not totally aware of the DRM loop
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.680]   that they lock themselves into when they buy music in a closed ecosystem like this, they
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.720]   are starting to become aware.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:26.760]   And so I think it's a really bad time actually to launch a store that basically just locks
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:32.160]   you into yet another digital rights management and content protection scheme that is locking
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.320]   you into buying music that may in the future become obsolete.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.480]   People are starting to catch on to the fact that actually that's not that cool, whether
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.720]   it's iTunes or Microsoft.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.040]   I just want people to know it's not.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.880]   I'm not saying this because I'm bitter that I didn't get a zoom to review.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.240]   I'm not bitter.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.800]   I probably will buy one on Tuesday, although now as this goes on, I'm getting less and
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.720]   less interested.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.680]   It's a letdown.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.480]   I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt on the zoom, but boy.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.640]   Now you talked a little bit about this on Buzz Out Loud and I'm interested on your take
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.600]   because I know Tom Merritt disagreed with you.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.080]   Microsoft, not the first time I understand.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   What happens?
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   Microsoft.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.320]   This is the most amazing thing on the zoom has agreed to pay universal music group a fee
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.520]   for every zoom sold.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.800]   We're not talking about a cut of sales for the music.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.240]   We're saying that every time they sell a zoom, they give universal a buck.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.760]   The presumption being this is going to be, people are going to use a zoom to pirate music.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.440]   I don't think so.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.920]   So we ought to get our money out of this.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   I think it's unbelievable.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.960]   I think it's a horrible, horrible precedent for hardware makers to basically saying we
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:46.520]   will allow you to extort us on the assumption that every single one of our consumers and
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520]   customers is a part of it.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.520]   They're all thieves.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.520]   It happened in Canada.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.320]   The music industry got this done in Canada with blank media.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.160]   CDs, well, happened here in the States with that tapes.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.080]   They weren't able to get it on blank CDs.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.760]   But every time you buy a blank CD in Canada, you're paying the recording industry a little
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.840]   money because they presume, well, the only reason you'd want a blank CD is to steal from
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.160]   us.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.880]   I think Canada also had or was trying to have an iPod tax.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.600]   Isn't that right or was there another country?
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.800]   I don't think that was based on a similar.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.240]   Do they do anything like that in Britain?
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.760]   No, thankfully, just ridiculously high rates of sales tax.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.360]   Oh, you got the VAT.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.920]   You got the VAT.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.520]   But no, thankfully, it just strikes me as amazing, doesn't it?
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.880]   That Microsoft would even, there was a story that was saying Microsoft had gone out and
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.320]   talking to other record industry labels about this.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.120]   It's like, why would you go out and offer this?
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   Get this.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   I don't understand.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.400]   CEO of Universal said, "We felt that any business that's built on the bedrock of music,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   we should share in."
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.640]   Well, of course, they felt that way, but the card was not applied in Microsoft degree.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.280]   I think honestly, Microsoft probably feels, and maybe it is true, that this is the only
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.200]   way they can make the content deals that they need to make, especially by, and it probably
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.680]   extends to their ability to offer those movies and television shows for download on Xbox 360.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.120]   It seems to me that they're trying to get as cozy as they can with the content providers.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   Well, it sets a precedent.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.640]   This is no more than no less than a bribe.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.240]   Morris said, "We have a current contract with him, Steve Jobs, but at the end of that,
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.800]   I'm sure we'll negotiate."
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.240]   In other words, there's a strong signal that we expect the same thing from Apple.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   Yeah, I don't understand that.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.840]   You're really confusing thinking about this Zoom.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:33.040]   For me, Leo, I really can't understand why they are not using Windows Media Player after
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   their battle.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.480]   This horrible antitrust situation with the European Union and made such a horrible fuss
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.360]   over, "We have to have Windows Media Player in Windows," and you can't use the Zoom with
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.640]   Windows Media Player to load it with music.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.600]   Microsoft has shown again and again that its products don't do well in the marketplace,
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.360]   unless Microsoft can use its domination of Windows to bundle the feature in with Windows
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.360]   itself.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.520]   Now, they have a lot of products and they have a lot of products that are successful.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.720]   Microsoft Office, for example, is on so many people's computers, but they bundled Microsoft
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.120]   Office with a lot of PCs that were sold to people, and it came with Windows in Office
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.200]   the first day that you got your PC.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.560]   I can't understand how the Zoom can be successful without Microsoft bundling it with Windows,
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.080]   and if you have Windows, you can use your Zoom, and if you have a Zoom, you can use it with
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   Windows.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.240]   They just seem to have forgotten what makes their products successful, which is their
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.280]   monopoly bundling of products with each other.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.480]   Well, it would be good for them.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.800]   I don't understand why they did.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   It's just crazy.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.760]   Well, I like to say, when you turn their agreement back over to them, I'm signed.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.800]   What the hell were you thinking?
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.200]   I like the Zoom when I first saw it, but I have to say now with all of these issues,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:47.120]   I have to say, it doesn't sound like a very attractive deal.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.400]   On the other hand, speaking of Microsoft Office, at the same time as the announcement, it kind
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.880]   of lost attention because of the announcement of Vista, but they also announced that Office
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.800]   2007 is done.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.240]   In fact, it got out of escrow a couple of days before Vista.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.600]   I guess they had a little race with the Vista developers to see who would ship first.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   A lot of excitement.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.800]   I think Office 2007 is going to be successful.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.080]   They might have taken a few extra days there before the RTM to hide the menus even deeper
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   in the user interface.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   I'm with you.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.080]   I like menus.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   I'm with you.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.640]   Well, we've learned menus.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.720]   We've probably used menus for 20 years.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   We're wimps.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.440]   We like the Windows interface and the mouse pointers and all that jazz.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:41.120]   People are going to have to use some imagination to understand Office 2007 because a lot of
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.120]   the menus are hidden.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.840]   Then you'll have toolbars and little buttons that do things and things that you hover over
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.160]   and they do things for you.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   I turn menus right back on.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.800]   As soon as I start using Vista, I turn every menu right back on because I like it.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:59.000]   If people learn to use this new way of using Office 2007, maybe they'll think, "Oh, I
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.240]   would never want a menu because I just have this toolbar here."
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.520]   I got a little taste of this with IE7 and it's very confusing.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.320]   You look for menus on IE7 and they're hidden.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.440]   They're not where you expect them to be.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:16.120]   You have to click things like a star with a circle or just strange places they've put
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.120]   these menus.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:23.360]   Well, in Internet Explorer 7, I guess I've gone to the Tools toolbar, pop up and pulled
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.600]   it down and said "Menu Bar."
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.400]   I just turned the menus back on.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   There we go.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.200]   Then I have the same old file, edit menu.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Classic menu.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   That's the one I had before.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   Oh, it's back.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.680]   Ryan, that was a secret.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.240]   I've learned a Windows secret.
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.440]   Well, I don't think we even have that in our book because you know, obviously.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   It's so obvious.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.840]   Fling down the Tools menu and turning on the full menus.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.320]   Okay, all right.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   I'm a little slow.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   It's not.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.120]   Well, you're not our target audience.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.720]   Neil, let's put it that way.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   But the morons?
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.240]   That's the Dummies book.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.000]   You've got to write a Dummies book for me.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.160]   My friend Woody Leonard is coming out with Windows Vista for Dummies.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.160]   Okay.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.160]   I'll look for that.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.520]   I'll graduate the secrets later.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:14.400]   Interesting ruling in a Brooklyn federal court, the presiding judge in a RIAA lawsuit has
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:23.720]   held that the plaintiff, actually, sorry, the defendant can, you know, I'm sorry, RIA
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.800]   is asking for $750 per song.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.200]   That's their standard statutory damage request.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.760]   The defendant said, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.600]   Who says it's $750 a song?"
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.560]   The actual wholesale price of a download, $0.70.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.200]   Shouldn't it be $0.70?
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.360]   The judge said, "Oh, a good point.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.200]   Yeah, why is it?"
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.960]   Hey, RIAA, why is it $750?
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:54.640]   So now they're going to go back and have to explain why they want $750.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.640]   I think it's obvious why they want $750.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   Because it's a lot more money.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   I'm amazed.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.800]   And I'm going to ask, you know, it's interesting in all these RIAA cases, we're finding more
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.680]   and more that as soon as someone fights back and asks for, you know, proof, they say they
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.680]   are immediately backstabbed.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   Yeah, they collapse.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.400]   You know, it isn't the way it is always.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:21.960]   If you pay lawyers by the month, you use them and you hope that the other guy doesn't.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.320]   Well, and bullies can rarely back it up.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:31.160]   And I think what they're trying to do is to avoid ever having to lose a case because once
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:37.360]   they've lost one case, then the whole PR campaign of we're coming to get you falls
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.680]   apart because then, you know, it's proven that they can't get you.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.160]   You said, "Come and get me, sucker."
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.760]   The Mac guy, Justin Long, is gone.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.480]   I heard about this on, "Where was it?"
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.880]   "Oh, yeah, Buzz out loud."
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.920]   And the world cries.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.400]   And the world cries.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   This was so being used.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.400]   Your fault.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   I ended up on CNBC.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.840]   It's your fault.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.840]   That's why.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.840]   My fault?
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.920]   Yeah, you and Tom and Veronica mocked the Mac guy.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   You got it fired.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.360]   The Mac guys, we were not alone in mocking the Mac guys.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   He was on there.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   You said he was snarking.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   I don't know this story.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   Can you guys brief me?
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.360]   Have you seen the Apple ads?
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.440]   The new Apple ads have one of the great comics, John Hodgman, as a PC.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.920]   He's very likable, very cute.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:22.320]   He always loses because, you know, he's a PC and it's an Apple ad.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:30.480]   Justin Long, according to his agent, an actual movie star, with such great roles as dodgeball
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   and waiting.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.680]   Anyway, he plays the Mac and, of course, you know, they're funny.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.240]   You haven't seen these ads yet, John?
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.800]   No, I've seen these ads, but I'm not sure what's going on with the movie.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.080]   So what happened is they've done a whole campaign.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.800]   People like the PC guy.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   They feel sorry for him.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   He's funny.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   Yeah, he's great.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   Well, he's cute.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   He's seen him on the daily show.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   Yeah, he's very talented.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.080]   Like Justin, they say he's snarky.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.080]   He's annoyed.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.080]   He snarking.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.160]   He's like a mean Keanu Reeves.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160]   Exactly.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.360]   And he comes up as kind of smug and a little bit hateful and actually the opposite of what
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.960]   you would think you want your branded notification to be.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.120]   Yeah, but the fact is that's exactly the way Mac people are.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.360]   But usually you don't see Apple admitting it and building a brand campaign around it.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.760]   I don't think they notice.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.760]   You know what?
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.760]   I didn't notice and you're exactly right.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.400]   They think it's a good thing.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.080]   It's just one of us.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   Maybe that's it.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.480]   All the people that I see using PCs have suits and ties on too.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.480]   There's another one.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.480]   All the time.
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   I am.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   I'm a PC.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.720]   Well, I guess they've either fired or Justin's moving on.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.560]   He's, you know, he's in the new Bruce Willis Live Free or Die Hard movie.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.600]   So he doesn't really need the commercial work anymore.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.400]   I love the way that the Apple insider story has that the report points out most people
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.240]   who watch the get a Mac ads come away liking the PC go whilst quote,
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.120]   wanting to push the Mac guy under a bus.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   Successful campaign.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.120]   I think not.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.240]   I think that I read a profile of him in the Los Angeles Times actually of Justin Long.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.920]   And he said that people will come up to him on the street and be right him basically
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.880]   for being kind of such a turd.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   Wow.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.760]   In these, it's a big, you know, and Apple is, is nothing if not a brilliant branding company.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.280]   So I think this is a pretty surprising misstep that they really did not realize that people
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.720]   would, would look at Hodgman and go, I'm kind of more like that guy.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.720]   Or at least I would want to be.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.240]   I'm kind of embarrassed because I actually like these ads and identify with a Mac guy.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   But I guess I'm starting to know that.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   We already knew that.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   You're one of them.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   I'm one of them.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   Actually, I liked the ads.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   I thought they were, they could have been, if I don't know, you know, I didn't realize
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.240]   that that was going the wrong way from it.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.200]   I thought there were very creative ads.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.880]   I mean, Apple had always had excellent advertising concepts.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:45.280]   But now that you say it, I can see how people, you know, would identify with a PC guy more.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.280]   He's cute.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.280]   He's funny.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.720]   I say bring back that woman who threw the hammer into the television screen.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   That was amazing.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.840]   But you just want to see her again.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.120]   That was an ad.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   It's slow motion.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.240]   Apple had ran for one day and that was a great ad.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.840]   So one can do it again.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.960]   And it ran for one day and was shown 25 million times.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   After that.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.960]   For free.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.960]   I say bring back Ellen Fice and the hilarious.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.960]   Oh, they never aired that.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   No, they didn't.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.960]   The switch won.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   She was the stoner that looks stoned.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960]   The stoner.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   Oh, the stoner girl.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.320]   It's been all over the place.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   That's a great ad.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   I know.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.640]   I thought they did air at once.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   Maybe they did.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.080]   I used a Windows PC one time and it crashed.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   It was a bummer.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   That was a great.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.080]   It was a bummer.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   It was brilliant.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.880]   I don't know if they ever aired it or it was just online.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   It was funny.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   It's been on the website.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.760]   I think it's clever because maybe they did do that on purpose knowing that it would
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.760]   get picked up.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   No, I don't think so.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.760]   Free YouTube, free YouTube, but really kind of ahead of its time in that respect.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   Apple did.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   I'm going to reblog that ad.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   Not you mentioned that.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   It's very funny.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   That ad is brilliant.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.320]   It never fails to crash me.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.800]   The back story about that.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.360]   I mean, she was like, had nothing but grief after that for being, and in fact, for over
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:04.280]   a year or maybe two, if you looked up stoner girl on Google, you would, that she'd be right
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.120]   at the top of the, she'd pop right up.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.240]   What's interesting because I hear that she was on Benadryl.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.360]   I hear that she and Justin Long are actually getting married.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.360]   That would explain everything.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.680]   I'm a little actually angry with Apple because I bought a MacBook with day one.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.880]   And now here they upgraded to a core duo, a core two duo without telling me, how do you
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.680]   have a MacBook, don't you?
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:30.680]   Well, I literally, maybe a week ago just bought my second, I think about three days before
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.680]   the course you've heard this.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.040]   Oh, you must be even more angry because it's the same price, but you get a core two.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.040]   Hand a dual layer burner.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.600]   Leo, you've been complaining about this before you bought the machine.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.000]   I remember and the people out there can prove this by listening to some old Twitter broadcast.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.200]   Before you bought that machine, you began to complain about this.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.720]   Haven't I been humiliated enough?
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:56.440]   You know, John, on episode 74, we aired a best of and you'll, I don't know if you, you
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.200]   know, but you'll be very happy that one of the segments in the best of was me saying,
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:02.160]   oh, Apple's going down the tubes.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.600]   This Intel shift is the worst thing that's ever happened.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.680]   You're going, no, this is great for Apple.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.400]   You were absolutely right on and it's quite embarrassing to me now that the.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.880]   Hey, if you take enough swings at the ball, eventually it goes out of the park.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.240]   Oh, man.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.000]   Very embarrassing to hear that one, but then we have the I get no spam right after that.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.720]   So we're going to do, by the way, I don't know if you know this, John, but just in time
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.680]   for Christmas, we're getting, I get no spam bumper stickers.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.680]   We've got right.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.160]   Yeah, they'll be in the Twitch store.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.360]   I'm going to be glad to see that.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.240]   Well, yeah, we should give them a penny for everyone we sell.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   We're getting.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.840]   Twitch be giving us a penny.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.000]   I'll give you a penny.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   I will share.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.040]   I will share all revenue with you.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.040]   I promise.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.040]   It's not going to be a lot.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.040]   You know, these stores don't make a lot of money.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.800]   I thought they would.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   Nobody buy.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   We haven't had Twitter hoodies.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   We've sold like 12 of them.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.360]   You're not doing it right.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.480]   I must be doing something wrong.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.840]   We have, we have these new stainless steel mugs are great.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.040]   You know, the coffee mugs with a twit logo on.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.480]   So you're doing it right now by promoting a stainless steel coffee cup.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   It's the address of the store, yeah.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.120]   Well, just go to twit.tv.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   It's right there.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.880]   We also have static stickers you can put on your car and.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.720]   Is there something you can click on?
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.400]   Yeah, it's on the left there.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.560]   Just where it says twit bling.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.160]   Maybe that's the problem.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.000]   Maybe that's the twit.tv/store and it didn't work.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Okay, I'll fix that.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   That's where you've gone wrong.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.760]   Yeah, that should help.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.200]   People don't enter twit.tv/store, do they?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.800]   Why did you just did?
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.080]   Okay, I'll fix that.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.160]   That's easy to fix before this show.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   I can't find the mug.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.600]   You've only got the hoodie.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   There's no mug.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   This is why you're not selling anything.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.440]   Plus, I think you need to dump bling.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.440]   Bling is totally over.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.440]   Bling is too ghetto.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.280]   What should I call it?
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   What should I call it?
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.280]   But it's over.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   It's over.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   STORE.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.680]   You should call it like twizzles via hisel.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   Okay.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   Or that.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   All that.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   Twit.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.720]   It's either all the way there or not even, you know, not even close.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.720]   Twit word.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.640]   Yeah, it's hopeless.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   It's hopeless.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.960]   And do you sell stuff on Windows Secrets.com like MUGS T-Shirts that kind of thing?
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.000]   Well, we sell a paid version of our newsletter.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.360]   Which I subscribe to and paid for.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.600]   And we won an award this year because we don't charge people a fixed fee.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:24.520]   We let them pay any amount they think it's worth to them and fortunately I think it's
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.720]   worth quite a bit.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.560]   It's not as much as cable TV a month, but people do-
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.960]   Nothing is as much as cable TV.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:39.520]   We found that it wasn't really too successful linking to books@amazon.com.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.920]   And I think this is why a lot of blogs don't really make any money because they think,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.680]   oh, they'll have Google ads and they'll make millions of dollars.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.400]   But it's just a few dollars here and there.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:56.560]   Or they'll review books and they'll link to Amazon.com, but you only get 5% or 7.5%
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   from Amazon.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.760]   If somebody actually buys the book, Amazon is paying you nothing for all of these people
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.240]   you're sending to them.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:09.120]   So I think that more like listeners supported radio to discuss something that's close to
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.240]   your heart is really a better model for a lot of people to ask people to contribute
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   money.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   We do that.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.000]   We give them the chance to contribute as much or as little as they want.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.040]   And yeah, your one time donation buttons aren't working in Firefox, so I can't even see what
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   you're talking about.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.040]   Oh, great.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.080]   You're getting killed today, Leo.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.840]   You know, I think this switch to Intel is a bad idea.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.120]   I mean, I, but I think a stainless steel cup would be cool.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   That is cool.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   Yeah, it will be.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   I will.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.120]   It's the front.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   I will.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   As soon as we got them, as soon as we got them, we'll put them in there.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.120]   Oh, you got the vault.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.200]   You're having all the shirts and then and then hoodies that you were going to get.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.200]   We got hoodies.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   We're going to get some more shirts.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   Oh, you want one?
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   I'll get you one.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.360]   You say that every time.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.720]   Well, we only sold 25.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.280]   So that's because you're not pumping it.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   I know.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.280]   I could learn something.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.800]   I need to give them away.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   That's what we do.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   Do you give them away?
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.200]   Yeah, we give them away every Friday.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.400]   Oh, give me one.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   All right.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   One more.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.720]   I think you're going to look good and it is Kelly Green in a big, big way.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.600]   Oh, that's it is.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.600]   What is it?
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   It's Kelly Green.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.600]   What is it?
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.600]   Kelly Green.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   It's just a buzz out loud.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.840]   T-shirt has a bright, crazy, scenic green with a sort of yellow logo.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.040]   Oh, it's a scenic color.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   You definitely need that.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.680]   Sometimes, you know, the bummer part about working in a big company is you have a design
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.920]   department and they think that Kelly Green is like a brand statement instead of a terrible
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.720]   fashion mistake.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.920]   But people still seem to want them.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   We need a design department.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.400]   Forest Green would be OK.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   How about you?
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   He's seen it.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   Talking about design.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.400]   It hasn't seen it.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.960]   News had a little bit of a refresh.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.480]   All over the web, too.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.000]   All of the red ball property is so CNET.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.040]   CNET.com, news.com, and download.com.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   I'll got a redesign.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.600]   It is very web, too.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.720]   It's all pastel and actually I'm happy to say it is a little tidier than past iterations
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   of CNET.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.720]   A lot tidier.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.200]   Is it because Shelby left that everything came in?
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   No.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.200]   We ever talked about that.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.720]   They lost their art director some years ago and they've been floating all over the place
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.080]   with this design over there.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.640]   I like the red ball design.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.120]   I think the original stuff that they were, the original direction they were headed in
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   the early days in '95 or so I think was superior to what they're doing now personally.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120]   I think we're coming back to that.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:25.920]   I like, I like, you are actually, with CNET TV is very much like the early days of CNET.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.960]   CNET TV is an all different sort of look for sure.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.800]   I like the CNET TV look.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:38.960]   I sort of like the new CNET, although I'm not a big fan of the web to turquoise text.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   That's a big one.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.720]   Yeah, I just don't really dig it.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   That'll be dropped on your idea.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.640]   I like contrast myself.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   I like the Navy.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.640]   I'm a big fan of Navy.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   Well, you're in the Navy.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.360]   But our side is looking a lot better.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.640]   How about black on white for a text cone so far?
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.640]   What?
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.840]   That's so 80s.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.880]   How would you know what to click?
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.000]   On T.P.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.440]   The folks who sold, I'm sorry, sued RIM for $612 million.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:08.240]   They're now getting sued by a 43-year-old software developer who says he did much of
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.560]   the work that created those patents and now he wants his cut.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.600]   You were an NTP fan, John C. Devorak.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.240]   You thought that that was- Well, I read a lot about the whole story.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.400]   And it wasn't a fan by any means, but I didn't think they were bad guys for doing what they
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   did.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.840]   They weren't just a, you know- Yeah, they weren't just a company.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:31.000]   But they seem to have evolved into what everybody complains about, which is a company that's
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.160]   just out to sue people.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.040]   Now, I don't know that for a fact and I have to get back into the story, but I haven't
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.200]   really followed it for the last six months, so I'm not sure.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.640]   But this is kind of an interesting irony if true.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.160]   The sewers get sued.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:48.000]   He wants- Well, it seems to have happened partly because they attracted so much attention
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.400]   by filing so many lawsuits and getting so much money out of RIM.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   Right.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.200]   But then this guy said, "All right, then I'm cashing in too."
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.080]   At the time, John said that the NTP patent was good.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.880]   In fact, they deserved to get some money out of RIM.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   I don't know, though, because now a lot of those patents are under review.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:04.880]   Right.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.880]   And at least two of them, I think, were-
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   Over turned.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.880]   Were found to be not valid.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   Right.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   About at the time of the settlement, as a matter of fact.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.040]   And seven of them are being re-examined.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.600]   Some have been rejected as invalid.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:20.200]   So I find their current- At least I find the fact that they're suing Palm to be a little
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.200]   sketchy.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   I agree with that.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.640]   It seems odd, especially since it just seems odd.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.520]   Again, I'm not- I haven't kept up with the story.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   I guess I should.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.640]   And I can maybe say something smart.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.320]   Nah, why start now?
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.320]   Yeah, why bother?
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:39.760]   Google sends out- Speaking of smart, Google sends out the Commissure to RIM and emailed
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   to 50,000 members of its Google Video Blog Discussion List.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.320]   Boy, that's dumb.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.320]   That's not good.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.320]   I had to hurt.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.360]   I can't understand why they did it.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.960]   I don't understand how it happens.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   Why'd you do it, Google?
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.320]   I understand why there were 50,000 people subscribed to blog about Google Video.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.880]   That's surely the point of the story.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.600]   You deserve a virus.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.440]   What are you subscribing to that for?
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.440]   All right.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.480]   I guess we pretty much wrapped this thing up.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.080]   But one thing I haven't done more than a few times is mentioned Dell.
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:18.440]   And I do want to thank them for supporting the podcast financially.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:25.480]   I encourage you to visit the Leo's Picks page, which is logically enough at twit.tv/del.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:29.000]   And anything you buy there, of course, helps us.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.080]   And I'll make sure just for you, Will Harris, twit.tv/store actually goes somewhere.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:40.280]   And just for you, Brian, I've fixed the Donate Any Amount button.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.200]   So please, feel free.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.200]   Figure it out.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.800]   It doesn't open in a new tab in Firefox.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   No.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.200]   Try to open it in a new tab.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.960]   It doesn't do anything or it just opens the same page that you were already on.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.360]   That's a bug.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.720]   So you were doing the control click thing.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.520]   Well, in Firefox, if you click the middle button and now in IE7, if you click the middle
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.040]   mouse button, it opens a new tab, which I give all the time.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.680]   What kind of old mouse are you using?
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.160]   You know the scroll wheel he's talking about.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160]   Oh, the scroll reel.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.160]   Who's back?
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.160]   Ah!
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.160]   Ah!
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   Scroll wheel.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.160]   Dell, that's...
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:20.160]   John's still using one of those balls that you rub with the bottom of your palm to remove
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.120]   this cursor around the screen, I'm sure.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   So never go anywhere.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.040]   Well, I'm using one of those, but not for the cursor.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.120]   And he's using IE4.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.120]   We...
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.120]   Hey.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:30.120]   Yes.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.120]   Hey.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.120]   Nothing.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.120]   Okay.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.120]   We didn't get a chance.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.120]   We didn't do...
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   We didn't do multi-cool.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   I was just about to say that.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:41.800]   So let's wrap up with a quick look at bit-tech.net.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.360]   Will Harris, who is saying, "You do need multi-core.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:51.920]   You know, I got in this debate way back when with Intel, saying, "Who needs a 2 gigahertz
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:54.720]   process, a single core 2 gigahertz processor?"
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.280]   And I guess I was wrong there too.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.800]   So this is the day for me to say I was wrong.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:00.800]   I don't...
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   I like multi-core.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.640]   In fact, I'm running a quad-core Kenfield Mac Pro, and I love it.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.240]   I love all that power, but I don't use...
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.920]   I never see it go above, say, 50%.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   Well, that's...
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.440]   I mean, what we're saying is that we...
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.040]   Intel just released its new sort of Nate's...
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.840]   It's quad-core process against Phil.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   It's Phil, yeah.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.160]   There were loads of people saying, "Oh, why would you bother?
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.880]   And it's so expensive, and do we really need this much power?"
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.840]   In fact, Ellen asked an eight-way workstation, didn't they?
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.760]   You know, they said the same thing about the 486 when it came out.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   It's unbelievable, hardly.
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   Exercible, hardly.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   The same thing happens every time a new chip's released.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.760]   Anyway, go ahead.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   It is a lot, though.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.880]   Actually, I'll tell you the problem, and maybe you have a defense for this.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.560]   Well, the problem is, yeah, it's great.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.760]   Eight cores, very fast.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.920]   Your I/O bound.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.880]   You're so fast that the hard drive, the RAM, the bus, all of that's keeping you from doing
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   anything useful.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.680]   Well, I mean, the desktop version, Kens Phillips, is four cores.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:01.120]   That isn't so I/O bound.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.600]   It's not so stressful that it's a problem.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.840]   But certainly in the workstation, especially if you're using all those cores for virtual
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.600]   visualization and things, the NIO really does start to become a bit of a problem, which
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.320]   is why I think the rev that we'll see in the new year will address that.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:22.080]   Leo, it depends on what you're doing, because something like Microsoft Office is single-threaded.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.080]   Yeah, it's not benefiting at all.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:26.480]   It's not going to take advantage of two or more processors.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:31.840]   My server at WindowsSecrets.com, however, we found a major improvement when we switched
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:38.560]   from an older PC that we were using as a server to a dual socket, dual core, optoron, and
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.720]   that means you have two CPU sets, each of which has two cores.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.560]   And when you're doing something like an internet server feeding pages out and the pages are
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:55.080]   usually the same or you're hitting a database, which is the same, you can be serving four
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.360]   times more people with a dual socket, dual core.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.720]   That's not the kind of work that most people are doing on their desktop.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   Right.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:02.720]   But even there you'll get I/O bound.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.920]   I mean, if the hard drives can't keep up with you, it doesn't avail you of anything to
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.920]   have a faster process.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:13.160]   Most of our pages are 30 to 50K, so the I/O is not really a bottleneck for us.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.440]   I think the new hybrid hard disk will make a huge difference.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.440]   You've said this.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.440]   Now, what is this hybrid hard disk?
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.680]   This is the part of the VIST-thing, huh?
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.200]   Everybody's going to be using these things.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:25.920]   It's a disk that has a, essentially, it's just similar to the old caching controller
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.840]   disk where you have a lot of memory, but these are all flash-based.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   How much memory?
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.840]   Two gigs?
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   Wow.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   Typically.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:35.440]   That probably will make a difference.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.720]   Because you do tend to load the same data over and over again.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.680]   Have you tried any of these, Will, at all?
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.680]   Have you benched my days?
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   Well, we haven't benched my days.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.000]   Well, I had a bit of a fiddle with one.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.160]   And we found that there were some ways Intel's got some good sort of optimizations and things
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.160]   in beta.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.720]   For example, we found that you could run Battlefield 2.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.760]   That would like, it is notorious for being a very slow loading thing.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.240]   And that would load a lot quicker.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.400]   But the question is, were you fiddling while the ROM was burning?
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.360]   I'm sorry to throw that in.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:10.480]   And apparently, went right over everybody's head.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:13.080]   I was going to laugh, but I was on mute and then I didn't hear anyone.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.080]   You don't have to laugh.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   It's all right.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.720]   It was just a little silly.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:21.760]   I did want to say to Will, though, before we signed off that I am totally lame and late
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.280]   to the party and have only recently discovered BitTech.net, but I am hooked.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   Isn't it great?
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   Excellent.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.280]   Well, I'm very glad.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   Thank you.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.760]   And if you're not yet hooked on Buzz Out Lab, just listen to one episode and you will be
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.360]   Tom Merritt, Veronica Cartwright.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   No, what?
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.360]   Belmont.
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.640]   It's Veronica Cartwright because, well, when I was 12, I was in love with Veronica Cartwright
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   on Lost in Space.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.160]   Oh, many people are in love with Veronica Belmont, though.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.160]   She's very adorable.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.200]   And of course, the wonderful Molly Wood.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.360]   And that is at buzz.cnet.com.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.360]   Highly recommended.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.520]   And you're on all of her CNET TV too now, which is great.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   Yes.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:00.920]   And one last minute note, join me and the Pick Spot team plus Chris Perilon, Don Tapscott
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:07.200]   via conference for our undo.tv preview party.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   Yep.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.080]   We're almost there.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.480]   It's this Tuesday, November 14th, November 14th, 7 p.m. in Toronto at the No Regrets restaurant
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.480]   in lounge.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.960]   We've done many events there and it's a wonderful place.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.320]   We're going to preview the new undo TV site.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.680]   We're going to demonstrate the technology.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:30.880]   We'll have invitations there for those who want to participate, complimentary hors d'oeuvres.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.640]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:42.880]   6 p.m. on No Regrets to RSVP or get directions, visit pikspot.com/preview.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.320]   Undo TV is the future of tech TV.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.800]   And we're very excited about it.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.960]   And we hope you will come visit us if you're in the Toronto area this Tuesday at No Regrets.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.080]   Windows Secrets is at windowssecrets.com.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:01.120]   I am a paid subscriber now that Fred Langa is long a list, which I was also a paid subscriber
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   to has merged.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   I'm very excited.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.480]   This is going to be kind of the ultimate Windows newsletter.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.120]   How do you get it through the spam filters?
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.680]   Well, we ask people to whitelist our email address.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:16.080]   And you don't have a problem because you're sending out a quarter of a million newsletters
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.080]   every week.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.080]   Well, we will be on November 16th.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.080]   I haven't done it yet.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:26.000]   We calculated that it's going to take us more than nine hours to send it to all the subscribers
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.760]   because our email service provider, which is a broadcast email company, can guarantee
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.960]   us about 30,000 messages an hour to go out.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.320]   And you don't have to worry about getting blacklisted or listed.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.880]   Well, we do all the time.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.800]   You know, AOL has a problem.
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.840]   Sometimes if you see a link in there for something that a lot of spammers have also written
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:51.760]   about, they say any email that has a link to this site must be spam, even though we're
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.880]   supposedly on the whitelist at AOL as being very good guys.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:02.080]   But the only thing that we found that works is to have people put editor@windowssecrets.com
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.680]   into their whitelist.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.080]   And any email that is from that address, that's okay.
[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.920]   Don't put it in the junk folder.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:14.000]   That seems to work with most of the email clients that you have out there, Outlook, Outlook
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.920]   Express, Eudora, things like that.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:24.040]   I just wonder, if newsletters are ultimately doomed by spam, and if maybe RSS or some other
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.240]   form of push?
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:32.200]   Yes, all email newsletters are doomed and every other publisher should quit publishing.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.560]   WindowsSecrets.com, pay what you think it's worth.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.240]   And I think it's worth an awful lot.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.280]   Devorak.org/botblog is absolutely free because Jon makes so much money on Google Ads and
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.880]   Amazon affiliate fees.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:45.880]   I don't make, yeah, right.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.880]   I make like nothing.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:55.640]   I'm losing my butt on this thing, but I feel it's an important public service at devorak.org/bot.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.680]   As is Twitch, and I'm very glad to continue this public service.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.400]   For as long as you will listen, we do thank you for being here.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.640]   We thank you all for joining us and we'll see you next week.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.800]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:14.760]   Let's go round.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.240]   Alright.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:22.640]   PS3 and Helterbise.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.840]   I'm Rasted.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.840]   Linux.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.840]   Napster.
