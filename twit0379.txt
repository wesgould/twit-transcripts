[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.700]   I'm joined by Martin Sargent and David Prager,
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.100]   two of the best tech minds of our generation, if not,
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.700]   two best tech minds of our generation.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.400]   We're going to talk about all sorts of stuff.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.800]   The election was this last week.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.900]   Twitter stayed up.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.000]   There are some record-breaking milestones for the service.

[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.500]   Maybe.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.100]   Hey, Apple and HTC got into a patent settlement.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.200]   Can you believe it?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.200]   Lots of other stuff, too.

[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.500]   This is this week in tech.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.900]   It is Sunday, November 11, 2012.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.500]   Do not adjust your monitors.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.300]   Leo did not become young and gorgeous.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.600]   I am merely filling in for him while he is cruising around
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.300]   Australia for the next couple of weeks.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   And somehow Chad Johnson said, Sarah,
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   do you want to host TWIT on one of the Sundays?
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.300]   And I went, I have nothing else to do.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   So I thought, all right, well, if I'm going to host TWIT,
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.100]   I really need to have a cool crew with me.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.600]   It can't just be me and some Yahoo's
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.200]   I find off the street that know a thing or two
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.900]   about technology.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.600]   So I thought, who are my best buds in the business?
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   And I thought, immediately, of Martin Sargentz and David
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.100]   Prager.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.500]   Two other people also have nothing else to do on Sunday.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.500]   In other words, you failed at your mission.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   And they said yes.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.600]   No, first of all, so I thought, you know,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.700]   we get a lot of people who-- well,
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.300]   there are a lot of people who have no idea who any of us are.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.600]   But we have a lot of people who remember us all
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.900]   from the screensaver's days.
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.300]   A lot of the TWIT audience is the OG Tech TV, ZDTV audience.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.200]   And they want to see more of all of us.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.600]   And they like the idea of our unions.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.500]   I thought, let's try to do that.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   We actually were going to have Kevin Rose on the show with us
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.100]   today.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.000]   And unfortunately, he had to bow out.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.700]   He had some other commitments at the last minute.
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.900]   So we miss him.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.000]   It would have been fun.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.100]   But we'll do that another time.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.800]   I think that three of us can hold down the fort.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.900]   I think that we're the better for it.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.500]   Well, probably.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.300]   A triangle is stronger than a square.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.800]   Oh, hey, there.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.300]   There is a very good point.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.900]   So I think we should get-- before we get into some of the news,
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.380]   get folks a little bit up to speed on what both of you guys are
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.700]   even doing these days-- Prager, you were on the show back in July
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.600]   or something like that.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.200]   So I mean, coming up on like six months ago.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.400]   Gosh, is it that long ago?
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.700]   Well, getting there.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.140]   Since then, I've been stated on board with revision three
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.900]   only as an advisor.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.980]   So I'm working on a show with Glenn.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.500]   It's kind of a spinoff of "Dignation" called "Toasted Donut."
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.300]   And that's kind of just for fun.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.600]   What's it about?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.700]   It's basically-- it's about-- that's the thing.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.180]   Is the show is pretty much anything
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.300]   that we feel like talking about.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.100]   So it's kind of like a discussion about that.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.500]   I show about nothing.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.600]   It's kind of like a Seinfeld-ish thing,
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.700]   except more based on reality.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.100]   I love it.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.700]   That's right.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.900]   I'm about to launch another show that's called Distort,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.700]   which I don't think we've said the name of,
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.500]   which is kind of a high-speed camera, super slow motion
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.400]   based thing that I'm going to put out on revision three.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.100]   Now, is there the Scorpion thing?
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   Is that-- OK.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.100]   That's in there.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.600]   That's in there too.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.700]   Is that actually happened?
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.300]   It happened.
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.500]   I have a scar.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.000]   I can't believe-- is this secret?
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.900]   What we're talking about?
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.900]   OK.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.300]   So I won't say anything else.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.300]   All right.
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.100]   So we'll-- so it's just-- I mean, if that's on a tease,
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.100]   I don't know what it is.
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.700]   Barry's got a new show.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.500]   There's Scorpion and Bald.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.100]   He's got a scar.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.300]   And it's called Distort.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.100]   And what else do you--
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.100]   but you've got your hands in some startups too.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.900]   So like, I've got-- you know, over the course of the past,
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.700]   you know, seven years working at revision three
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.600]   and covering not only technology, but startups.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.000]   I kind of fell in love with entrepreneurship
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.100]   and startups and got to learn a few things about it.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.300]   So I've had fun getting to know more and more people
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.300]   that are also in that community.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.200]   And so kind of helping people where I can
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.300]   and the things that I'm interested in.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.100]   And feeling very privileged that some people
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.700]   are interested in my help and advice.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.300]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.700]   And then probably dabbling in a little bit more video
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.800]   as I try to work with some of the startups
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.300]   and getting some of their--
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.500]   I guess some of the marketing in a way.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.100]   I started for certain startups to be able to communicate
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.200]   to their potential users, consumers, customers, users,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.700]   about what it is that they do.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.700]   So I'm working on building some relationships--
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.700]   It's very jacked-dorsing of the users.
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.020]   --and not just some relationships with some startup
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.100]   companies in that way.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.000]   That's great.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.400]   Martin, Sergeant.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.300]   Now.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.300]   Well done.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.800]   Now.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800]   And now, exactly.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   Congratulations.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.040]   Now, Martin, Sergeant, and I, you may remember a little show
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.760]   award-winning, actually, show that we used to do here
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.000]   on the Twit Network.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.860]   Was it on Fridays?
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.700]   I think it was on Fridays.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.900]   It was on Friday afternoons.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.500]   And it was.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.300]   This week in fun.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.100]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.000]   It was also known as Twit.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.300]   We had our own theme song.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.300]   We had 49 because Leo told us not to come back to America 50.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.300]   That's sort of a theme in my life.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.700]   49.
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.100]   Well, it's a nice number to end on.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.100]   It's an interesting episode.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.800]   We used to-- really?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.600]   No.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.800]   Actually, I think 50 was the last one.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.400]   OK.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.000]   Anyway.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.400]   Anyway, it's been a while since the two of us
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.100]   were actually representing together at Twit.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.800]   And your career has changed somewhat.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.700]   People say, why hasn't Martin do a lot of video stuff anymore?
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.300]   What's the deal?
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.900]   What are you doing?
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.300]   So what are you doing?
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.740]   I actually have five television projects in the works,
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.100]   one on each of the major networks.
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.900]   They involve pythons, not scorpions.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.400]   OK.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.700]   No, I'm not doing any of those things.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.600]   I'm actually trying to make a little bit of money.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.500]   I've been working in advertising.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.700]   I'm doing a lot of writings.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.800]   Basically, I do art in the service of capitalism.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.600]   That's how I like to--
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.300]   You're an ad man.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.500]   I'm an idiot.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.100]   Yeah, I'm an ad man for--
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.500]   I write stuff for major corporations that can make it up.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.800]   But you're such a snappy writer.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.100]   So I would think that that's actually a pretty good fit.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.500]   It seems to be working out.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.100]   I still get fired a lot in this field, just like I did in TV.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.100]   But everybody gets fired in advertising, right?
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.200]   There's a lot of turnover in advertising.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.800]   There's a lot.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.500]   Most of that is my own fault.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.300]   But--
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.600]   Well, at least you're taking responsibility.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.900]   I'm taking all the responsibility.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.300]   I was just involved with a startup.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.200]   I was the only writer.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.700]   Startup doesn't exist anymore.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.200]   Really?
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.500]   As your example.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.300]   There you go.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.200]   Inferno is called self-immolated.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.300]   Is advertising really like mad men portrays it to be?
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.100]   It's a lot like--
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.100]   The world wonders.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.300]   I'm having an affair with several women right now.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.300]   I'm drunk all day.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.700]   Basically, it's a lot like television.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.300]   So--
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.500]   Kind of getting to advertising.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.900]   Yeah, it's basically--
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.700]   it's a lot of slinging of nonsense trying to sell stuff.
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.600]   It's a lot of fun, too.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.300]   It's a lot of work.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.100]   I've never worked so hard as an advertising.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   You were giving me weekends.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.100]   And I want to get back in the week
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.100]   because I'm supposed to be working right now.
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.300]   I don't usually do that.
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.300]   But I appreciate you taking time.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.300]   So for all these reasons, I want to get out of advertising.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.500]   And I do intend to get right back here on internet television.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.900]   And I have some stuff in the works.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.100]   Well, you know, the two of us sometimes
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.500]   say, why don't we do a Twiff anymore?
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.900]   We could just do it on our own.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.100]   And we don't have a very good reason.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.700]   So, you know, I don't know if we want to commit it.
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.700]   I know we should start doing a lot of that.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.500]   And we should start doing a lot of that.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   And we should start doing a lot of that.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   And now, but I don't see why it would be anything less than fun.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.500]   I have time for that.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.100]   To get together and shoot the breeze for an hour.
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:49.900]   Can we try to do that?
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.500]   Let's do that.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.900]   All right, now we've made a commitment.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.500]   All right, everybody heard it here.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   OK, so this show, of course, is about the week in tech
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   and what happened.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.700]   So last night, I was sitting at dinner.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.900]   It was before dinner.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.500]   I was having a drink.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.100]   And my date said, well, did you hear the news?
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.900]   HTC and Apple have settled.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.500]   And I was like, all right, let's figure it out.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.620]   You know, so here we are on our phones reading about this stuff
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.500]   because that's sort of thing that we do on a Saturday night.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.100]   This is actually really, it's kind of a big deal.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.900]   They have settled a patent dispute that began back in 2010.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.900]   HTC's One X, Eva 4G LTE devices had been delayed
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.300]   and definitely at US Customs.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.900]   As a result of an ITC ban, HTC created a workaround
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.100]   on the infringing patents.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.500]   Then the customs ban was lifted, but it was sort of a weird work
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.900]   around and it looked like the ITC might get involved again.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.100]   And as recently as August, HTC chairwoman, Share Wang,
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.300]   said the company had no plans to settle its ongoing litigation
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.700]   with Apple.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.100]   And that was in the wake of Apple's victory against Samsung,
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.300]   at least in the US.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.900]   HTC said, no, no, we're not backing down.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.900]   We're going to fight this to the end.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.700]   Well, they're calling it at least in some places.
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.100]   They're calling it a license agreement.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.100]   And so I think obviously in software patents,
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.700]   there's kind of like building a war chest.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.500]   And I think a lot of people even like in it to nuclear warfare
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.300]   in terms of like, I've got this many bombs.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.500]   I've got this many bombs.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.700]   And it's Apple saying, we have this many patents and HTC
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.300]   saying we have this many patents, except I believe,
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.500]   I think, that Apple has a few more.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   And they were able to come at them with an agreement saying,
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.900]   look, we will follow some of these patents,
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.100]   move against some of these other patents,
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.500]   but you still owe us some money for the licensing
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.300]   so that you can go ahead and use some of the features that say
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.500]   Samsung is still not allowed to use at least as far as certain
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.300]   courts in certain countries have levied against Samsung
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.100]   in favor of Apple.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:52.300]   Yeah, HTC statement, both companies released sort of concise
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.900]   terse almost a statement saying, yeah, it's cross-licensing
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.300]   agreement.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.700]   And we're not going to talk about the details.
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.700]   That's all confidential.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.100]   But HTC said the company will not have a material adverse impact.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.500]   The decision anyway won't have a material adverse impact on its
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.300]   financials.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.300]   Well, that means it's paying some money, maybe not a ton,
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.900]   but at least enough for the company to say, you know, we have
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.500]   to pay lawyers to drag this out.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.100]   However, many more years, Apple has more money than God or at least
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.700]   a lot more money than HTC.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.500]   Well, regardless of their stock price, they have a hundred and
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.700]   thirty one billion in cash.
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.300]   Right.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:23.700]   Exactly.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.100]   So Apple can do this forever.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.500]   And it doesn't really behoove either company to keep this going.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.700]   I mean, nobody's enjoying this, except of course, lawyers
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.700]   racking up fees.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:39.100]   But it seems to me that HTC, it just makes so much more sense
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.900]   for the company.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.500]   It keeps them on track.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.900]   I mean, they're trying to get some market share back from
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.100]   Samsung and having a hard time at it.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.500]   The more these feels to me like Apple is just trying to be a
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.900]   bully.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.300]   Did you guys agree with me?
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.700]   Who do you think came out on top of this?
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.300]   Do you think that do you think that they have the right to go
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:56.500]   after it?
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   I absolutely think that Apple is a bully company.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.900]   Do you think that they have the right to go after this?
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.500]   Or is it like, you know, trying to sue Carl Benz because he
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.300]   invented the automobile and the Henry Ford started to do his,
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.500]   you know, it's just like this is technology evolving.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   I mean, you start suing people like this.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.100]   I still think it boils down to the fundamental problem of
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.900]   software patents.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.900]   People spend companies will spend money in not only securing
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.900]   them, but purchasing them.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.100]   So once you spend money buying someone else's patents, then
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.900]   you almost put more value.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.380]   Like, one is I'm going to protect this idea so that I can
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.100]   chase after someone that's bullying someone and it happens
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.700]   from, you know, Apple to Microsoft to Google.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.900]   But then when you're when you invest money, like say Google
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.100]   purchased all of these, was it Motorola?
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.300]   No, the purchase of Motorola mobility and they purchased
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.900]   over a billion dollars with the patents.
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.900]   And so then that money has to have some value.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.100]   So they're going to use that not only to build up their
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.900]   defenses against someone else's patents, but also, you know,
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.700]   try to use the laws that are in place to maybe execute some
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.900]   sort of theoretical unfair advantage.
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.900]   I only say unfair meeting like it's stifling other companies
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.000]   from coming up with what I think are a lot of software
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.400]   patents are obvious ideas like, you know, the whole, you know,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.900]   one click purchase was the first one when I was, you know,
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.200]   pretty young was like, how do you patent one click purchase,
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.100]   which Amazon did, I think 15 years ago or something like
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.400]   that.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.500]   So I mean, well, there's also exactly what Apple was going
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.300]   after HCC for is the same kind of stuff that Apple's going
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.600]   after Samsung for.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   But one would argue that some Samsung products really do
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   look exactly like iPads.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   And HCC not so much.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.000]   Apple may have not been as victorious had had the patent
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.100]   lawsuits carried out much longer.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   Don't you don't you get kind of excited though?
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.900]   Aren't you kind of happy when like what just happened
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.800]   over in the UK?
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.400]   What just happened in the UK when the when the court said
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.200]   that sorry, Apple got to pay Samsung's legal bills.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   This is nonsense.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.500]   This is false and misleading.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.100]   We're not going to let this stand.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.500]   You got to stop doing this.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.000]   You're going to have to pay for all that because that's what
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.800]   you have to do in Britain.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.900]   If you see somebody and it doesn't work out, you got to pay
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.900]   their legal bills.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.600]   And that makes and that makes you feel happy.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.200]   I don't know.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.100]   I'm tired of Apple just trying to throw their way around
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.600]   like this.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.000]   I just feel like this is technology trying.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.200]   This is the way that things evolve.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.700]   All right.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.100]   You build on things before.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.800]   I don't think it's patent infringement.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.000]   Well, it's yeah.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.300]   Well, that's why a lot of people say that we need patent
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.700]   reform because because you say this that makes sense.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.300]   But that's just not the law works right now.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.900]   Well, I mean, I think I might sound like a broken record
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.000]   because I think last time I was on to it, we talked about
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.200]   patents, but I mean, I think the quickest way to start
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.700]   reforming the whole process is to not award stupid software
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.200]   patents.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.800]   So you can meet like you have to maybe you need to honor
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.600]   patents that have been awarded because of the efforts
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.500]   that went forth into it.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.400]   And maybe it's unfair to other companies that didn't
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.200]   spend that.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.800]   But like going forward from tomorrow forward,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   you can stop awarding pointless stupid software patents
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.600]   because they're still being applied for and still being
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.500]   awarded as far as I know.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.800]   I know that there's some changes going on in the US patent
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.800]   office to maybe fix that a little bit.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.000]   But it hasn't been thoroughly fixed.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.400]   And obviously, if you stop awarding stupid software patents,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.100]   then by the time the old ones run out or they become
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.600]   yesterday's technology, then you won't have quite the same
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   amount of problem and people can hopefully focus on
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.100]   innovating.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.700]   Just a company out there that just patents things.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.800]   That's all I do is patent things.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800]   And then then they sue people.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   Yeah, called patent trolls.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.600]   Is that this is a whole thing?
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   This is a business.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.800]   I mean, that just shows you.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.800]   But it's legal.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   That's a thing.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.300]   You know, that's why patent reform needs to happen.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:28.800]   All right.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.200]   I think we're all in quorum that.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   But I want to give a plug to the show this American Life.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.900]   It's a radio show episode 441.
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.800]   It's all about software patents.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.600]   I half of everything that I rant on about is because I
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.800]   listened to this episode and learned about the problem with
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.600]   software patents.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.600]   It's an amazing, it's an amazing listen.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.400]   It's like an hour just about software patents, patent trolls
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.600]   and the problem with it.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.400]   Yeah, this American Life 441.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.200]   It's just a great show.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.800]   Yeah, I mean, they educated me about that the same way as
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.700]   people learned about mortgage default swaps and the whole
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.300]   problem with the mortgage problem two or three years ago,
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.300]   which is barely getting ourselves out of that.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.000]   I find Ira Glass a bit annoying, but I like the show a lot.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.200]   What if it's wrong with Ira?
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.400]   I don't like the cadence of his voice.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.500]   Oh, well, that's, you know, you're picking at him.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.000]   That one is, mm.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.600]   It's, it's, if it's a radio show, I can see our first story.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.200]   People tell me, like, we can't.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   We can't.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   So my voice either.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.300]   Hey, you mentioned Martin, this, this thing that happened in
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.400]   the UK, we should probably explain to anybody who's like,
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.900]   I don't really know what they're talking about.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.400]   No, it's okay.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.800]   No, it leads us right into this.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.200]   A Court of Appeal of England and Wales has ordered Apple to
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   pay the legal fees of Samsung on an indemnity basis after
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.400]   Apple published a false and misleading notice after a patent
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.800]   lawsuit over the iPad.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.700]   You might recall that Apple was was was given a judgment to
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.200]   post in a newspaper and on on their website.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.700]   Basically, okay, Samsung didn't infringe on on these patents
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.200]   of ours and Apple did do that.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.400]   They were ordered to publish a notice on the front page of the
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.700]   apple.co.uk website after they lost an appeal back in October.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.700]   But this so they did, but they added some statements that
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.100]   according to the court, confused people.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.700]   So even though Apple said, yes, these products by Samsung did
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.800]   not infringe on Apple products, but we want a case like this
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.300]   back in the US and paraphrasing of course, but it was
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.500]   basically Apple making it seem like they were in the least
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.600]   amount of wrong possible.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.500]   The court said it was calculated to produce huge confusion
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.700]   for users and under pressure, Apple has now posted a second
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:50.000]   statement on its website that says on 25th of October, 2012,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Apple incorporated published a statement on its UK website
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.500]   in relation to Samsung's Galaxy tablet computers.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.100]   That statement was inaccurate and did not comply with the order
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.300]   of the court of appeal of England and Wales.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.700]   The correct statement is out of this whole this this website.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.400]   I didn't know that you could tell someone that they have to
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.000]   put that's like saying you have to apologize.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Go tell that person.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.800]   Not only did they have to apologize, but they had to
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.900]   apologize at a certain font point.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.500]   It was 14 point if I'm not mistaken.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.900]   I like saying it has to be above the fold.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.100]   Yeah, we were we were joking on TNT earlier this week.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.800]   It's like, but they didn't say what color the font had to be.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.600]   They could have just written it in white font and then you
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.500]   wouldn't see it.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.100]   Did they say?
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.200]   I mean, what kind of font was it?
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:33.500]   Did it?
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.100]   Was it like, you know, Helvetica?
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.500]   Well, no, they have done it in Wingman.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.300]   They said that it had to be aerial.
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.000]   Yeah, it had to be aerial.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.700]   Yeah, it had to look a certain way and it had to be yay big.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.800]   If they'd known they would have written it in comic sands.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.100]   I mean, the first time comic sands is on the Apple website.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:49.900]   Got it.
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.200]   We're talking about Samsung.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.600]   We're going to make it more of a topic.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.800]   Make it look like gangsta.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   But this is so this is a this is something that you feel a
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.000]   little you feel kind of good that Apple is forced to.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.800]   I like this.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   I like hearing about this kind of thing.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.400]   This doesn't all sound very childish to you.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.100]   No, speaking of I think because what happens to them, it's fine.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.000]   Well, speaking of design though, and Apple having to pay stuff.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.900]   Another one of the stories that you had in the queue is Apple
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.400]   basically taking the Swiss rails watch logo or watch the way
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   the watch looks and incorporating into iOS six and not
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.100]   asking or saying anything about it.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.600]   And then they finally it looks like they agreed to to continue
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.600]   to use it and to pay.
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.200]   I don't know.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.400]   They paid them 21.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.800]   21 million.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.600]   So here's the story for anybody who hasn't been following this.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.100]   When I was six was unveiled, we got a nice little clock app.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.200]   It's not anything that we had before.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.300]   In fact, let's see if I can just pull it up on my phone.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.700]   I think Chad pulled it up.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.600]   Yeah, Chad had it up there.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.400]   Well, I guess it's on the iPad though, isn't it?
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.200]   Yeah, it's on the iPad rather than the iPhone because the phone
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.000]   already had the clock app.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.600]   This was something that you never had in the long run.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.400]   I think it's a little bit of a problem.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.100]   The phone already had the clock app. This was something that you
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.700]   never had an alarm or anything on your iPad before.
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.200]   You've got this really nice, beautiful Swiss looking
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.700]   simple icon, efficient,
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.800]   simple, elegant,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.900]   just like Apple,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:15.700]   but it turns out,
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.800]   yeah, it was something that Apple basically lifted from the
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.700]   the Swiss national rail operator SBB.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.300]   Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's basically the same thing.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.300]   I mean, you can't design.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.900]   You can't.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.000]   It was done by Hans Hilficke.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.600]   Yes, he was he designed it in 1944.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.000]   He was a Swiss engineer and it's been used in SBB stations ever
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.500]   since the way that the story kind of came about it sort of like
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.100]   Switzerland's like, wait, what are you doing?
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.700]   Did we miss a phone call?
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.300]   They're all polite about it too.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:55.700]   They're very very proud to have, you know, our clocks from our
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.800]   rail stations in your very, very popular devices.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.900]   Apple, you're such a fine company, but you know,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.000]   you got to give us a little bit of money for this guys.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.800]   Yeah, before this agreement came into place, the rail operator
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   had said publicly, we're going to have to talk to Apple about
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   what happened here and why they think there's got to be.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.900]   There's got to be there's got to be probably one or two employees
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.500]   at Apple or might have been fired for like saying, Hey, this is
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:23.800]   cool.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.400]   It's put that.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.500]   Oh, it looks great.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.100]   And then like, oh, why are the Swiss colonists?
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.300]   They have no idea.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.100]   Most of the exact.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:30.400]   Seriously.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:30.800]   No idea.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.500]   Why is it the guy they're supposed to be neutral
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.200]   and they're coming at us.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   Twenty one million.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:36.700]   Swiss.
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.800]   No, I am not Swiss.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.300]   I have family that lives there though.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.600]   So I see where you got that impression.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   I might be.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.000]   I don't know.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.400]   I'm probably a lot of things, but no, it's a lovely place and
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   they have wonderful trains.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.200]   They run on time.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   Exactly.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.500]   I've never seen anything like it.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:52.900]   Amazing cheeses.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.600]   That too.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.500]   Fondue watches, cheeses, get some chocolate in there.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   It's Switzerland.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.200]   That's Switzerland and nutshell, and it's very clean.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.100]   Big horns.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.700]   You know, the hells are alive.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.300]   Right.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.100]   Um, okay.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.700]   So that's.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   We talk about one more Apple story.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.400]   Of course.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.600]   I was just on the list of Apple.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.000]   I thought it was interesting thinking about it.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.100]   So and especially with regard to how much money they have.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.500]   The stories about the rumors of Apple slowly moving away
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.600]   from Intel processors.
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.800]   Turn to use our processors and Max.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   Obviously we're we're already using that.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.600]   So they have their own most part.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.900]   They're on with through some also some some partnerships,
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.900]   but basically they put their own processors into the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:43.100]   And they're thinking about possibly, you know, as the iOS and the Mac OS start to merge a little bit more in the functionality.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.300]   That wouldn't make a lot of sense to have the back end process.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:52.200]   The process that's going on be seamless so that you can port those capabilities and functionality across more and more devices.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.100]   Make it save more power and make it more portable and still able to, you know,
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:19.100]   process the more intense things, which I think Apple's engineering team and especially with the R&D the money they have can kind of go at the capabilities that Intel's processors provide and try to slowly make it so that they can put their own processors into the next several generations of Mac book, which obviously is what Apple would want to do.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.400]   The question is can they?
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.900]   I mean the an arm processor in a new Mac book is going to be more power efficient, but less powerful as at least.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.100]   At least it's the technology stands today.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.400]   But I think I think it may.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:38.300]   I think it's kind of obvious though, like if I was at Apple and I knew that if I can control every element of my environment, I'd want to do that one too.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:48.700]   Intel is as far as I can tell and I'm, you know, they're they're huge, but they've demonstrated that they're not able to innovate as fast as everyone else is in the mobile environment.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   So I'm sure that they're reporting billions in R&D on it and Apple can port billions into R&D on mobile processing power consumption and the next generation of, you know, higher speed processor at lower energy consumption.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.100]   So what you're saying is this is a good time to buy Intel stock.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.700]   Well, okay.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.200]   So what does this mean for a company like Intel?
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.600]   Let's say you say it's a few years off and that might be true.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:21.400]   So, but this is a very key time for Intel to figure out how to get into the mobile space in a way.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.000]   You know, the company is clearly working on it, but they're they're late to the game.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.200]   Yeah, you don't want to they don't want to be Kodak here.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:33.800]   But also, you know, Intel's the as far as I know, again, you know, they're the number one processing processor manufacturer in the world.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.600]   They make the fastest processor arguably.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.900]   There's, you know, AMD's out there.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.200]   They're the only rival in terms of the absolute fastest, most badass aside from the few super computers processor you can get.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:53.000]   And so, you know, in order to stay at and top of their game, you know, they need to continue to refine the process of how they, you know, how they make these semiconductors function at the top.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.600]   And so I think for a company like Apple, they they want one to control their environment, but two, they want to make sure that they can provide the best possible experience for everyone.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.400]   And that's the reason they moved away from Motorola.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.600]   They said the processors we can get from Intel are faster and they're better.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.000]   We want to provide the best and the fastest for our consumers.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And I think as long as Apple maintains that we would they provide only the best, then I think they'll continue to provide.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.400]   And if they can make something that's better than what Intel does, that's when they'll switch.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.200]   And the other reason for them to switch, of course, is from the business reasons, they're just controlling it all.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:26.800]   Well, and I know there are folks out there who say, yeah, but Apple is not the majority of Intel's market.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.600]   It's just a tiny little sliver, but it is a tide turning, right?
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:36.200]   If Apple can figure it out, how to produce something that's better for the consumer internally, they don't need Intel.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.000]   Well, it's going to make a lot less sense.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.600]   And Apple is, you know, can be thought of as a trailblazer in this market in many ways.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:48.200]   That if Intel isn't needed from Apple, well, there's going to be other companies who are going to figure out,
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   well, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.200]   And let's figure out our own solutions as well.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.600]   I like the I like to fantasize about what an actual OS 10 or Mac OS and iOS hybrid would actually be.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   Well, I mean, there's so much engineering that I do, Martin, you laugh, but these are the sorts of things that get me up at 530 AM.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:10.000]   I like the fantasizing about a hybrid OS.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   In a digital world.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Well, imagine, you know, imagine, you know, there's going to be a MacBook Air at some point where you'll be able to take this lid,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   flip it around, put it back down.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   It's a touchscreen that does, and that functions and interacts with you the same way.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Oh, that's very Lenovo, though, isn't it?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   I mean, the thing is like you want to be able to do everything in your iOS environment the same way as you do in your Mac OS environment,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   because, you know, if I need to be able to do something and I have a device, I want to be able to do it the way I want.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And I think they want to be able to provide it for you to be able to do that way.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Sure.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   But then there's like, there's so many things that, you know, about engineering and semiconductors I don't know about,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   but there's so many little nuances like on Mac OS, I can't use Siri, because it's the way Siri's been designed,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   doesn't function with the processor the right way.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Right.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I don't understand why.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   I mean, I have a processor that can do so many calculations per second.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   That's as far as in depth as I know, but obviously there's a lot more about the underlying process and how it happens,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   and that's why it's important to be able to get a processor that knows how to interpolate the data of all the programs
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   you're doing, whether it's made for mobile device or not.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Well, you've got folks with second gen iPads who can't use Siri and Apple will never give you a good reason about that.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I have no idea.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   I mean, it could be the processing power as well as the underlying architecture.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I'm sure it's probably that knowledge is out there.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   I just, I don't know what it is.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Right.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Oh, Siri.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Speaking of Siri and voice recognition, did you guys see what's going on with Microsoft in China?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Holy crap.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I know.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Isn't that neat?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Okay.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   So, well, you know what?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   You know what we should do.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   We don't hold on to that.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Before we do that, let's go ahead and take the first of what will be really fun breaks during the show.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And then we're going to come back and we're going to talk about Microsoft in China because it's going to blow your lid.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   But first, let's kick it over to Leo who just happens to be sitting in the living room patiently waiting for me to toss it.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   We interrupt this Twitch for a message from Citrix and go to my PC.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Leo Laportier.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   They asked me to come back for my trip to Australia just to tell you about my favorite remote access solution.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Go to my PC.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I actually started using Go to my PC way back when during the screen savers.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   We were using it.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   We used it from time to time.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   If somebody called with a problem, we couldn't fix, you know, by talking them through it.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   We'd actually fire up.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   It was called Expert City back in those days.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   We fired up and we'd fix it.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   It was so cool.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And that's when I got to know the Citrix folks.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And ever since I've been big fans of their stuff, go to my PC.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   It gets better and better, faster and faster.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   It's now Mac or PC.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   You can access a Mac.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Well, so the idea is you put it.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Most people would put it on their office computer.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So they can go home from work early.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   They could take a day off.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   They could travel.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   They could take vacation.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   You better believe before I left for Australia, I had to go to my...
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Actually, I already had it, but I had it on my Mac.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   That means I can easily get to my Mac.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Now, it's not to fix stuff.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   It's because there's stuff on my computer I need.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Well, I can use my work email and it looks like it came right from work.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   I can access any network resource.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   I could send and receive email.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I can run any program.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   It's just like I'm there.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And I got to tell you, it's wild to run a computer Mac or PC.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   So I can use a computer Mac or PC from your iPhone.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Brian Brushwood showed me that's how he does Flash and it's iPhone.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   He'll use Go to my Firearm Go to my PC.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Go to his computer in Austin and go to the website there.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Actually, that's kind of a trivial use, but there is a serious purpose for that.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   It gives you completely secure access.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   So if I'm in Brisbane at a kind of some sort of shonky kind of coffee house,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   I don't know, shady characters everywhere,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   I could fire up my iPad or my iPhone or my Android tablet and bring the Nexus 7
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   or my laptop and I can log into my office computer.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   That's SSL all the way to here, completely secure and then surf out of here.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And I know it's safe here.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   So that's a great way to do basically a VPN.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   There's lots of ways to use Go to my PC.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   I'm sure you'll think of more if you try it for free for the next month.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Visit GoToMyPC.com.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Click the Try It Free button.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   See that big orange button right here?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And they're going to ask you for a promo code and all I ask is the type in the word "twit"
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   "t-w-i-t."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   That's not too much to ask.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   They say it's optional, it's not for me.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   "t-w-i-t."
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   That way we get credit for it.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   I think you're going to like GoToMyPC.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Really a great product.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   We've used it for years and man, I don't know how I'd have lived without it to be honest with you.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Go to myPC.com, offer code "twit."
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Speaking of which, let's get back to the Twits.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   God, it's so funny.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   He's right over there.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It just seems so far away.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I just like how the hologram technology is going.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Isn't that great?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Yeah, he's our Tupac.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   That's Leo.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Except that he's still with us, Livian.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Leo, give me a sandwich.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.680]   So you mentioned before we went to the break this crazy technology and you said something
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.000]   about Microsoft and China.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And the idea is that we've got technology now that was demonstrated actually.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And we even have a video that we can show you in a sec.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   But I'll try to set it up.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   This is a video of a speaker explaining how machines now can not only interpret English.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   So if I am speaking into a phone, you can have the phone.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Translate.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Type in exactly what I'm saying.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Thank you.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Dictation.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   That's the word I was looking for.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Dictating.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   So that's actually a technology.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.520]   But then, okay, well, once that information is in there, then that English that has been
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:58.000]   dictated can be translated into, let's say, any of the language.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   But in this case, Mandarin Chinese, which is of course extremely different language.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Doesn't always translate specifically that too.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Right.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And characters rather than, you know, there's all sorts of differences between two.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.600]   At that point, that now can be converted into a voice because the information is there in
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:26.080]   Chinese and wouldn't it be nice if you were maybe speaking to a group of business people
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   in another country.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.880]   You don't speak their language and they don't speak yours.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:35.840]   You talk freely and they're hearing without an actual human interpreter what you're saying
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.720]   in the correct language and the technology is actually there.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.960]   Chad, can we play a little bit of this video to give people an idea?
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   What's happening?
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   There are in fact quite a few areas.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.960]   There's much work to be done in this area.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.960]   That's pretty cool.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   With this technology is very promising.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   It's like diplomacy.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   It's actually great.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   One step closer, like the Star Trek Universal Transit.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   I assume some of the people who are clapping are like, yeah, that's actually correct.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.960]   No, you got it.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   Not just that it looked like it was working.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   Yeah, because that's the thing.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   They're surprised because this is amazing.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   I mean, please trigger ignition plods along.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:57.640]   You know, it's been improving at a very slow pace and this is a big step forward.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.360]   Not only, and this is something that I actually had to read a little bit about this research
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:10.760]   before I understood that the voice that's getting sent back out is supposed to mimic
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.600]   the original voice as well.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   How?
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   Do you know?
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:22.640]   Because it is pulling in the tones from the original voice and able to create a voice
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.800]   that is similar.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.960]   So if you were talking, for example, it's not going to translate into a voice that sounds
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.960]   like mine.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   It sounds like yours.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   That's pretty cool.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.840]   Well, Ira Glass could be just as annoying sounding and mandarin.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840]   Correct.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.960]   Well, you have problems with the -- it's the katos.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.960]   It's the cadence.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   It's the cadence.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:47.200]   This is a technique called deep neural networks.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:53.400]   Two years ago, researchers at Microsoft Research and the University of Toronto had been working
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.000]   on this, made a breakthrough.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.320]   It's pattern after human brain behavior and researchers are able to train better speech
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:07.640]   recognizer than anything that's come beforehand, which is obviously of the utmost importance.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.640]   It's like, you can't use a translation tool that works most of the time.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.280]   And if you watch this, this is a 10-minute video, although it's very interesting and
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.720]   you should definitely go and watch it.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:26.120]   And they say, "Where, you know, get an error rate maybe one in eight."
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.720]   So that's still pretty high.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:34.720]   Yeah, I mean, that one out of eight words could radically change the sentence to make it
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.040]   turn it from a compliment into something very, very offensive.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.600]   So if you are trying to use diplomacy, that's not acceptable.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600]   Absolutely.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.440]   You can't just say that you're a jelly donut.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.640]   Isn't that what Jeff K said?
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   Ichby 9 Bernina.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   You haven't heard this?
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   Yeah, I know.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   I was just wondering if that's where bankrupt.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.640]   Maybe.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   That's the jelly D thing from.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.760]   Oh, now we're getting off on very weird tangents.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.440]   I think this is cool because I remember when, like, Siri came out, but Android had already
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.600]   had their own Google for identifying just the questions of people like and interpolating
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.560]   that into valid search results.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.600]   And then obviously, Google's got theirs.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.560]   Microsoft clearly has their own.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:20.120]   And do you guys know much about Windows 8 and like speech to text?
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.800]   Not speech to text technology, but just like asking questions, their Siri version?
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   No.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.240]   I know that they are working on it.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.400]   I haven't had a whole lot of experience.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:37.120]   I haven't used Windows mobile at all other than like CES and demos.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.720]   You know, we got a surface this weekend.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.040]   I was telling you guys on our way up.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:51.040]   And it's like we have a few service tablets around the office because some I as and Alex
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.920]   are putting together a Windows show and everybody's interested.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   And there's that.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.760]   But I didn't actually have the opportunity to have a service, you know, relax on my couch
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.320]   and just see how the whole thing felt.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   And boy, that software is laggy.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.280]   I mean, it is just unacceptably laggy.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.000]   I mean, even to the point of like you're looking at something in landscape, you go to portrait
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.040]   and it's like, you know, you can't, that's not, that just doesn't work for me.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.040]   I don't know.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.760]   I mean, I know I'm not the first one to say something's up with that software.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.880]   It just doesn't seem, it seems half baked.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.800]   But there's something with the storage on the surface also.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.920]   Well, yeah, they say 32 gigs, but it ends up being more like 16 because the OS itself
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   and a variety of pre installed items end up taking up so much of it.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.000]   Oh, you have a surface, don't you, Chad?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.640]   Yeah, give this a.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.560]   Oh, that's not a.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.440]   It's a Asus tablet.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.240]   I'm trying to sign in so you can actually touch it.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.240]   Oh, I see.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.080]   Would you like to play with Windows Mobile?
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.080]   Here you go.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.840]   I don't know if I should like play for play with it for the first time.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.840]   In the middle of a show.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.160]   And it's got a lock password.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.400]   So yeah, so there you go.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.320]   But how's it feel?
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.720]   Does it seem like an iPad?
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.880]   Well, maybe soon.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   You know what?
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.480]   I'm interested in like, I've never owned a tablet before ever.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.320]   And I was thinking about, no, no iPad.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.280]   I've never had an Android tablet.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.400]   And I'm thinking that I might get a Nexus 7.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   Okay.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   Two reasons.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.440]   One, I don't know enough about Android and I want to know more about Android because
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.840]   I think, you know, Android is definitely a big force and I don't know a lot about it.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.640]   Two, I would have gotten the iPad mini because I really do, from what I've seen, I kind
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.680]   of believe that the 7-inch tablet seems to be the way to go.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.200]   But I don't want the non-retina display iPad mini.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.880]   If it was an iPad mini with a retina display, I would have gotten it.
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.440]   So I think I'm going to jump into Android with a Nexus 7.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.440]   And then--
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.440]   People love their Nexus 7.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.760]   And then, you know, between that and the time that the iPad mini retina comes out will
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.720]   be my deciding factor on how much I want to stick with Android, aside from educating
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   myself more about it.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.000]   I know this has been talked to dust, but do you think we're going to see an iPad mini
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.080]   retina in March when we would normally see a new iPad?
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.120]   I mean, we just got a new iPad 4th gen.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.480]   What are they going to do in March?
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.320]   Are we even going to have a March event?
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.200]   I would venture to think-- and obviously, this is coming from someone who doesn't know
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:10.560]   a tablet, but I would venture to think that the iPad mini might just kind of take over
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.560]   and be the iPad and maybe the iPad 4 is the last of the full-size iPad.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:23.240]   Well, if I-- yeah, it seems like I hear more and more from folks who have gotten minis
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.600]   that once they have that, they say, I want to pick up their full-size iPad.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.920]   It's huge and clunky and the bezels too big.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.400]   And I love the mini.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.280]   I am with you about the retina.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.240]   You also have a retina MacBook Pro.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:41.520]   So you know it is sucky to go from that beautiful display and then look at anything.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.600]   It's a MacBook Pro.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   It's a MacBook Pro, yeah.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.520]   Is that an error?
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.040]   No.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.920]   It's just a beautiful thin MacBook Pro.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.160]   I would rather have the 13-inch MacBook Pro, but they didn't have it.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.160]   Right.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.160]   I mean, that's what always happens.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.200]   With Apple and anyone else, is you buy something and they think that or--
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   Sure.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:03.920]   I'm holding out for-- and I'm hoping this is coming out in March-- the iPad cinema display
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   with the retina.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.920]   It's like huge.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   So OLED, right?
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.240]   Well, maybe they could just give us a 16 by 9 aspect ratio and there's your little cinema.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.640]   I want to be able to--
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.680]   This is like how I like to do things.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:21.160]   Well, so that is-- yeah, that's the cinema display, but you just want touchscreen capability.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:27.000]   So then we get back into our Mac OS versus iOS and how they confuse together.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.600]   See, you're starting to fantasize about it too.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   Wow.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.960]   See what happened there?
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:39.640]   Speaking of iOS and Microsoft, actually, Microsoft Office for iPhone and the iPad and Android
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.120]   also has been revealed by the Verge.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.520]   This is really technically still just a rumor.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.760]   But the Verge says, hey, we've got sources.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:58.320]   Our sources say from within Microsoft that an iOS version of Office mobile is coming to
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.200]   fruition as early as next February, 2013.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.760]   Android I think is expected a little bit later in May.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.200]   And we've talked about this a little bit on other shows this week, or I have anyway.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.200]   You guys have been here.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   I'm excited about it.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.200]   Are you excited?
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Are you excited?
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.840]   Okay, so let's talk about who is the target market for this because you're interested.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.280]   So I'm not very good at-- I'm not Excel Jedi at all.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.920]   But I will say that using numbers, which is the numbers for the iPhone, which is their
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.040]   version of a spreadsheet-- Apple's version of a spreadsheet for mobile has made me a
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.720]   stronger spreadsheet user than any desktop app I've ever used, me being a dunce at spreadsheets.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   And using numbers on the iPhone, I think it costs $6, which is a lot for an app.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:50.040]   But just the user interface, the way it allows you to just do everything with the touch of
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.000]   a finger versus thinking about keyboards and keyboard shortcuts and all that, the functionality
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.560]   that taught me how to create spreadsheets better on mobile than on Excel itself or then
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.600]   on the desktop version.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.280]   Of course, this coming from someone who's not good at it.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.080]   If I was doing spreadsheets all day long and working and accounting firm, I would want
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.840]   to use the desktop version.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:15.720]   But it went to show me the power of how intuitive it can be using the inputs of the way a handheld
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:21.520]   device works to teach someone how to create formulas or just throw in graphs and charts.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.040]   And the fact that you could do all this on a mobile device that easily is pretty cool.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.360]   And so knowing that Microsoft, who is the one that pioneered office suites and office
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.520]   products, is getting in and creating the own version to help push everyone else to compete
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.960]   more, I think is exciting.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.240]   Because if they can make a better Excel than Apple can make numbers, then that makes it
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.240]   better for everyone.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.200]   What are you doing with the spreadsheet on the phone?
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.200]   Creating charts.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.880]   When you start, charts and graphs.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:54.040]   And I also feel like I go to the gym and I like, I keep, I input what I'm doing on the
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.040]   spreadsheet on my handheld device.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   Spreadsheets are great.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.240]   You've got to get into the spreadsheets.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.760]   Your people are crazy.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   Now I'm with you.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.320]   Why can't you just go to the gym?
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.320]   Well, because you have to multitask.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.240]   You can't, you can't, you can't, because you can't put your phone down for long enough.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.240]   That's the problem.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   That's true.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   You got to be playing with these phones.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   I've sort of made a career out of it though.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.280]   You should go out to dinner with these people.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   It's so annoying.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.240]   Well, you don't go to dinner with me anymore for this reason.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   No, you don't invite me.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.640]   That's because I'm not playing with the phone.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.320]   It's because last night, if you would have been at the dinner table when I said, "Holy
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.120]   crap, Apple and HCC, how about this?"
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   You would have been all on the art.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.680]   Who's been at the dinner table if you said, "Hey Martin, do you want to go to dinner?"
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.240]   I didn't know you wanted to go on my date with me last night.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.920]   It was a date night.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.160]   Yes, I'm sorry.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.880]   I'm very sorry that you weren't invited.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880]   Well, hold on a second.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.200]   Now, let's get back to the idea that this is a great idea.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:52.160]   This is a great thing for Microsoft to get into the mobile market on obviously OS's
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.920]   aside its own.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:58.680]   Android, iOS, but what do you want to pay for this access?
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   What do you think is fair?
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:06.160]   Well, I think there's a combination of you're paying for cloud storage because most of the
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.280]   files that you're opening in any office suite now are going to be stored on the cloud.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.520]   Whether it's SkyDrive or whoever's a cloud.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.240]   I think you'd be paying for a little bit of storage, but to have a really rich capability,
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:28.600]   I think it's going to cost more than, gosh, I think if you're really wanting to use productivity
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.520]   and not productivity, but just like office suite products, I mean, I think you'd hang
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.080]   on what your competition is doing and how it's supported.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.120]   I mean, it's something that you have to pay for.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.480]   It has to be paid for and there's no other way around it.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.480]   Well, okay.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.520]   It just depends on what's, you know, Google's offering it for free, but there's certain things
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.360]   that you're going to need to have capabilities of.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.240]   And then you're going to have your competition from, you know, Apple and numbers and pages.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.680]   Well, here's what we know.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:02.880]   And this is again, rumors, but what we know is that Microsoft has made it pretty clear
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:10.080]   that if you are accessing anything from the Microsoft office suite on, let's say your
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.720]   iPhone, for example, by the way, I have a lot of stickers on my iPhone.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.680]   I got a little crazy on the weekend.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.680]   Hello Kitty stuff.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   They're coffee.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:19.680]   She just came back from Japan.
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.680]   Well, it was Japan town, actually.
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   It wasn't actually Japan.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   It was Japan town.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.680]   I know it's store.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   We did that one night.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   It was really funny.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.760]   And, you know, these stickers don't want to come off.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.320]   So I think they're here to stay very nice, huh?
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.080]   Just a little, just a little mistake I made a couple of days ago.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.280]   See, you couldn't even leave your phone down in the store.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.480]   You had to put stickers on it.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.680]   Well, I bought the stickers first.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.160]   I didn't steal them.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:46.480]   So the deal is you'd need a Microsoft account, obviously, to access any documents that you
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.400]   would be accessing on your phone.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   Okay.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   So that's fine.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   But then it would only be read privileges.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   Okay.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   Well, that's not helpful.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   Okay.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   So I'm going to go to a point where you can edit the documents.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.480]   Well, you need an Office 365 account.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.840]   Well, that's not free.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.840]   Okay.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.800]   Well, what are the different packages that I can get the lowest, I think, is $4 a month
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   right now.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.000]   And they might change the pricing for Android and iOS folks.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.840]   But even if they do, it's not going to be free.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.200]   It's going to be a subscription model.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.400]   And do you really want a subscription model for something that's not going to be as good
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.240]   as the native version?
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.840]   I mean, as we get more and more devices, you want to be able to access whatever it is
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   that you're working on.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:31.560]   And half of what you're working on for most people with normal jobs is using Office Suite
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.560]   products.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:36.280]   And so you want to be able to access it on your tablet, on your desktop, and on your
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.400]   very small handheld device.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.720]   And I think being able to provide the best possible experience for each of those form
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.920]   factors is going to be really important.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:51.280]   And so beyond that, I think that Microsoft Office for the iPad better be able to open
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.160]   everyone else's competing Word documents, spreadsheet documents.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.720]   Because you ought to be able to open all of it.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:06.800]   And each to compete in a Fortune 500 world, you need to be able to offer their own experience
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.160]   through and through and support everyone else's.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:14.320]   This seems like something that's great for a small business or a group of people who
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:19.840]   are already using Microsoft Office in the cloud using Office 365.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.160]   And this is just one other way to be able to access files.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:30.080]   Well, I won't be happy until I can ride my bicycle to work and build a PowerPort presentation
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.720]   at the same time.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.680]   I thought you didn't want a multitask too much.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.120]   I'm being very sarcastic.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.200]   I'm trying to point out how ridiculous it is.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   Well, okay.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:46.480]   Now, when you went on your little Dvorak-like rant a few minutes ago, you had some people
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.760]   in chat saying, "Yeah, go Martin.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   That's right.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.360]   I mean, you love your phone.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:52.760]   I know you love that song."
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   I like my phone.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   You do.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.160]   I call my friends and family on it.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.160]   Well, that's a little antiquated.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.720]   I call names every once in a while.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.440]   I check the weather so I know what to wear.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.760]   I use it very...
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   It's wonderful device.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.840]   You don't seem to want to add me as a friend on path.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.360]   I just haven't gotten around to it.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   Right.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.360]   I know.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   It's a full-time job.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.440]   Maybe when I'm working out later, I'll make sure to do that.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.600]   Hey, you know what happened this week?
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.000]   It was a big week, at least in the U.S.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.080]   We had a presidential election.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   We did.
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   We had a presidential election, folks.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   Hey, do we want to...
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:29.440]   Maybe we'll take a quick break and then we're going to talk election stuff.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.280]   And it's going to be non-partist and a force.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.280]   It's going to be political.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.520]   Yeah, we're going to get political because nobody...
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.720]   We haven't had enough of that yet.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.480]   No, but we're going to talk about the fun stuff, the tech part of the election.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.880]   But first, let's kick it over to Leo.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.600]   Leo, who are we thinking?
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.840]   Excuse me one moment.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   May I interrupt?
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.400]   We'll get back to your tech news in just a moment before we do that, though.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.120]   I've got some news for anybody who mails a lot of stuff.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.200]   And I know that's a lot of you, whether you've got a business that sends out mailings or
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.160]   maybe you send packages, maybe you sell stuff on Amazon or eBay or PayPal or Etsy.
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.160]   And you're not.
[00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.640]   I hope.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.760]   I hope you're not going to post office and waiting in line and buying stamps.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.760]   Worse.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:17.040]   Worse, I hope you're not leasing a postage meter and paying for fancy ink that you don't really
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.040]   need.
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:24.680]   I could save you up to 80% off the cost of a postage meter with stamps.com.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.000]   Stamps.com, you already have what you need.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.880]   Stamps.com lets you print legal US postage from your printer and your computer.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.880]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.120]   You don't need a fancy ink.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.600]   You don't need to wait in line at the post office.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:37.040]   You just need stamps.com.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.480]   You sign up and, but I'll boom, now I'm sorry if you're outside the US.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:43.120]   This is only for the United States.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.160]   It is good, though, if you mail internationally from the US, you know, I don't know if you
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.360]   know this, but if you ever mail internationally, you've got to go to the post office, get these
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.640]   forms, fill them all out, get international money or it's very complicated.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.160]   Stamps.com, they fill out the forms.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.160]   The whole thing is easy.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.800]   And then it all prints out.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:03.080]   They can print sticky stamps, you actually can buy like Avery label stamps, but that's
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   not the best way to use stamps.com.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.840]   You should do what we do.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.520]   Print it right onto the envelope with your logo.
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.880]   We got a little Twit logo.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.880]   Return address.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.800]   Stamps.com will pull from your address book or Amazon, eBay, Etsy, PayPal, all the sites.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:18.760]   Put the senders, the receivers, the recipients address in there.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.240]   Print it all out for you, the print great mailing labels.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.000]   They even do the kind of that thing where you're sending express mail and it clicks
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.320]   and you send an email to the recipient letting them know it's on its way, giving the tracking
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.000]   number and all that stuff.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.920]   And by the way, the post office loves stamps.com.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.560]   They give them discounts you can't get at the post office.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:40.400]   Up to 21% on an express mail up to 15% on a priority mail.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.680]   I'm just a big fan and I think that I've been using it for almost 10 years and I think
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.960]   that you ought to try it if you aren't already doing it.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.560]   I know you will find it much easier than what you're doing now.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.560]   So here's the deal.
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:57.600]   Stamps.com, you'll see there's an $80 trial offer but don't do that please because I
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.920]   can get you better.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.800]   Click the CC heard about us on a podcast.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.120]   Click that up in the right hand corner.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:10.880]   Enter the word "twit" T-W-I-T and that $80 offer is now $110 offer.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.880]   It's magic.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.320]   It's a little magic act there.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:20.960]   $55 in free postage of free digital scale, $5 supply kit, four-week trial, canceled at
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.680]   any time the scale's yours to keep but I don't think you're going to cancel because I think
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.240]   you're going to realize what a great deal Stamps.com is.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.240]   Try it today.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:33.840]   Stamps.com, make sure you use the offer code "twit" and now back to those "twits".
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.840]   Yeah, that's us.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.480]   While we were on our break, Martin, discovered a button.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.320]   It's on the microphone.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.320]   It's on the little foot.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.200]   All of our likes has a little button.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   I don't know what it is.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.200]   It might be a mute.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   They don't know what it does.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   Can I get a shot of this button?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.480]   Yeah, let me get to this camera.
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.960]   It actually doesn't do anything.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.720]   Those stands are made for ham.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.760]   This is the button, though.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.080]   What happened?
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.800]   It's a push to talk button for ham operators.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.600]   It's the cough button, right?
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.680]   So wait, it doesn't do anything.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.680]   Is this thing on?
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   It doesn't do anything.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   I was excited.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.680]   I thought I could mute Sarah in the trigger.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.920]   Well, that would be fun.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.040]   That would be fun, wouldn't it?
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.960]   We don't need to mute anyone.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   We don't need that.
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   That button actually does do.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.960]   We don't actually.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   I couldn't do this at all.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.400]   I want to pull a doctor lower on you guys.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.160]   Like, no, this is how it goes.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.400]   You're going to listen to me and you're going to stop using your phone while you're on your
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.400]   bicycle.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.880]   I'm going to yell at you for a few minutes.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.040]   So we're going to have a nonpartisan discussion?
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.120]   Or we could make it really one-sided.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.200]   I am not interested in getting into a medical debate at all.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.480]   It was the most tweeted election, which is kind of surprising because obviously there's
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.720]   just more people using Twitter.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.160]   So of course, it's the most tweeted election.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.360]   Not only was it the most tweeted election, but we have our most retweeted tweet in the
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:55.800]   history of Twitter that happened just moments after Fox.
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.400]   And I think CNN had called the election in favor of Barack Obama in a way.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.360]   Tom Merritt and me and Justin Robert Young were here.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.640]   We were actually sitting over on the TNT news said we were trying to have kind of a election
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.160]   night hangout that was a little bit more about just making sense of all of it.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.320]   And it was really, really fun.
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:20.560]   But at that time, Justin says, you know, people in chatroom are saying that Fox called the
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.160]   election in Ohio or called Ohio for Obama.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.080]   And we're like, no, no, no, that's it's way too early.
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.080]   And then all of a sudden we saw the tweet.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:31.040]   The tweet from Barack Obama's account.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.120]   The first tweet said something like, thank you.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.800]   You know, I was able to do this because of you.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.960]   And it's like, oh, okay.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.400]   This is everything's happening now.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.160]   The second tweet said four more years and it was the picture of the two of them.
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:49.120]   Of course, the president Obama and Michelle Obama, his wife and Ray 12,000 retweets,
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:55.600]   812,860 retweets and almost 300,000 favorites.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.840]   Now that's that's and that that beats the previous record, which was held by Justin
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.760]   Bieber, the little trivia for you.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.880]   Well, I'm really glad that what Justin Bieber said, you know, I don't remember something
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.680]   that I love you.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.600]   Something baby, baby.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.120]   Oh, hey girl.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.840]   Thanks for buying my stuff.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:16.400]   I really love you.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.640]   Something like that.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.760]   That's probably exactly pervade and what with the tweet was.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:29.200]   So the, I mean, this is, this is, it's, it just shows how much activity was happening
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.360]   on Twitter at the time.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.440]   By the way, that same picture was posted to Facebook, Barack Obama's Facebook account.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.440]   It also broke records.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.280]   It's the most liked photo ever posted to Facebook.
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:46.560]   And how many people liked it?
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.360]   I wish they had a dislike button.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.000]   Well, but then you get a lot of negativity on Facebook.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.440]   People have talked about that before.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.800]   You know, I, I'm just wondering how partisan Twitter is.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:58.000]   Well, I, I think you're general though.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.320]   I mean, it's just that more people are doing things online.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:06.280]   So when there's a global event or a national event, more people instead of just watching
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.960]   it on TV are now online in different ways.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.520]   So whatever the biggest social network is, they're going to be participating on that
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.360]   with, whether it's all whether Obama wins or whether Romney wins.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:20.480]   If Romney had won and posted a picture, probably would have been the most retweeted picture.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.480]   Sure.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.480]   Exactly.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   It's not so much.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:24.720]   It's not a support thing so much as well.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:28.520]   This, this just happened and we're all here and we're talking about it and spreading the
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.520]   word.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.520]   You know, it's, it's interesting.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:36.560]   Like when, when these big seminal events in history, bad, awful things, tragedies, wonderful
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.240]   things, whatever it is, big news events used to say like, I can remember distinctly where
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.240]   I was when whatever happened.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.560]   Now people are going to be saying, well, I can remember distinctly where I was when I was
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.560]   tweeting, you know, and everyone's going to have the same answer.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.560]   You mean, but no, but they were participating.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.080]   But you're not all going to be in the.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.960]   So not only can you remember where you were, but you can go back and remember what you
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.120]   said and to who?
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.120]   That's a good point.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.120]   That's pretty cool.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.160]   And I mean, you have like, yeah, it's like a timeline.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.520]   It's kind of fun to at least, you know, I was in a room with a bunch of friends watching
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.840]   everything go down and I was having a in person experience with them.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.680]   But then at the same time, anyone who, you know, I'm following or is following me that
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:19.680]   there's other places, you know, they're, I'm able to share and what they were doing and
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.960]   they're able to share what I'm doing a little bit.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:26.000]   So I mean, I, I kind of like being able to have a discourse with more people.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:33.800]   You know, Instagram had had also had some insane number of pictures that were being posted.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:40.680]   They actually had, I think it was record numbers during the superstorm Sandy that just a few
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.320]   days before.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:49.160]   So again, you know, a lot of people taking a lot of a lot of visual moments in time.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.560]   But where you were and everything.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.560]   I did.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.560]   I took video.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.120]   I shot pictures of I was at a bar.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.120]   Right.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.120]   As you do.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.120]   As you do.
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.400]   I happened to be at a bar that night.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.160]   Well, Kevin's system, the CEO of Instagram, he was speaking at the Gig Aum Conference
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.160]   structure.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.160]   Road map.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.040]   Road map, which was this past Monday in San Francisco.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.680]   And he was asked about the idea of, you know, what kind of what's next for Instagram?
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:17.600]   Are you guys going to get into video or what's, what's the deal now that now that you've
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.280]   got Facebook as, as your big umbrella company.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.600]   And he said, yeah, video is that a whole different beast.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   Not sure about that.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.120]   But what Instagram is really interested in doing is figuring out, okay, we've got all
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.720]   the crazy amounts of data coming in.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:33.120]   Let's say the election, you know, the, the election goes.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.280]   Uh, to the incumbent president, it's a big deal and people are just pouring in.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.000]   You can hashtag photos.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.440]   So you can, you can give it a, a category that it will, it'll be tagged in with other
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:44.440]   photos.
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   But that's about it.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.240]   Well, no, I mean, there's, there's geolocation.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   There is.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.400]   If you mean, you can turn it on or off.
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:50.400]   It's a privacy thing.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.160]   But the default, I believe is, you know, I, it's kind of neat.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:57.160]   I can see a map of where all the photos that I've posted on Instagram were taken.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.560]   Well, and San Francisco or Southern California or even Hawaii.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.640]   And Instagram wants to make that even more accessible.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:09.160]   So if you know where, yeah, the, the map view of where you were, then, you know, you could
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:15.320]   say something like, okay, well, how many Instagram photos that are about this particular subject
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.360]   sent between nine and 10 PM within a city.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.360]   That's really cool.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.000]   We're taken and I want to see them all.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Exactly.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.600]   And I'm sure, you know, Facebook can probably collect that data as well.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.240]   If there's the excess data in the photos that people upload to, to Facebook, they could
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.600]   aggregate, well, Facebook is Instagram.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.840]   We keep forgetting that.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:38.760]   So you can, you can actually see a map of all the Instagram photos you like laid out.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.400]   As long as you're allowing Instagram to get that information.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.280]   So that's like, say that's like, that's the x axis of your data.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.720]   Is there like a time of function in that too?
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.400]   Like I don't think they let you like layer information.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.200]   Information's there, isn't it?
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.520]   That's, yeah, that's their, that's the challenge, right?
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.440]   Is they're getting this information.
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   The information is coming in.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:06.440]   This is sort of the big data question that a lot of companies have, right?
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.440]   Right.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:07.440]   It's, it's, we, we, we have all this data and how do we make it useful to the company and
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.440]   to the users?
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.280]   I don't know where the camera is, but that's a map of like how many photos I took in each
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.280]   of these geographic locations.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.240]   Oh, we're, we're, you wrap in night, like Nova Scotia.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.360]   So you can zoom in on those and tell me how many photos, when they were taken what time,
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.000]   you know, and that's just all from my Instagram.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   That's just for you.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   So that's good.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   That's good.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.960]   So all the information's there for pretty much everyone.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.760]   I can turn off the geolocation if I want.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.000]   So if I, you know, if I take, I don't know, photos somewhere, I don't know, there's all
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.960]   kinds of reasons not to share info, but so you know, you can be as private as you want.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:43.560]   It's very, it's, it's interesting what a company like Instagram, you know, tie a little company,
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:48.240]   sold for a billion dollars, still a very small team, works at Facebook and they got to figure
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:54.560]   out, okay, well, how can we continue to iterate on this, on this really, really seemingly
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.560]   simple idea?
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.640]   Because we just, we have too many photos coming in.
[00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:03.600]   Getting the big data, getting the data right, you know, with, with Romney's team.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.240]   Oh, and Orca.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.200]   Oh, speaking of, speaking of Obama's and then our wall.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.320]   This is, um, and then you go, of course Nate Silver, you know, right.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.920]   And everyone said, ah, he didn't know what he's doing.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   That's not how it works.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.720]   I mean, that, that's crazy and predicting that so perfectly.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:26.560]   Well, okay, so we talked about, we're talking about big data here and it turns out, and
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:34.000]   this is, this was sort of new to me actually, that campaigns, they all have their own strategies
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   for being able to make sense of who's voting and who still needs to vote in a, in a, in
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.880]   a, and, and making sense of exit polls and that they now have their own apps.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:56.320]   So for example, the Romney team, the campaign had an app called Orca that everyone sort of
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.360]   was like, oh, yeah, it's a big killer whale.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   Got it.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360]   Got it.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:06.720]   Um, it was a, a web app that was supposed to search for and mark off voters as they left
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.680]   polling locations, then taking that data to use in projections, or then check when supporters
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.360]   of Governor Romney might need a phone call.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.760]   Hey, are you still coming?
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:24.320]   So this is obviously just a, a design to, to be as accurate as possible.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:31.760]   So communications director, Gail Go, get show had told PBS, for example, when exit polls
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.320]   come out, we don't even need to pay attention to that because we have scientific information
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.960]   based on the political operation we have set up.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.480]   So this was Project Orca.
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.920]   It was designed to replace kind of pen and paper, get out the vote efforts, right?
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.880]   The problem is is that by all accounts, it was a colossal failure.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.920]   There were login information, a variety of logins.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.080]   People just said they want to work.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.720]   All the campaign people to be able to share information on who, what the information they're
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.800]   collecting from, particularly battleground states of where they can try to continue campaigning
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.960]   to get more influence.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   Right.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   Exactly.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.280]   Running up to the end of the day on election day.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.920]   And it failed on almost every level.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   It failed.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.600]   There were so many harpoons.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.520]   But I think the headline is a little much though.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.480]   I mean, Killer Fail.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.320]   And like, were they, they were playing that thing.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.320]   They were playing that thing.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.720]   Influence that many more people in those decision states.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.440]   And even the headline in a way, it says Killer Fail.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.520]   And it says, it cost Romney thousands of votes.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:34.720]   Well, quite frankly, thousands of votes ain't nothing.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   Right.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.760]   So how big the Killer Fail was it?
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.880]   It's not an, it's not an election tied Turner.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.320]   I mean, it's amazing that, you know, there's more data out there's more ability to be able
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.880]   to share data to be more effective with your campaigning.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.160]   Did this change the course of the elections of this app?
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.160]   No.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.160]   No.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.160]   I mean, it's an interesting story.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.680]   And if you're a journalist, you could see why you would want to jump on this and talk
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   about it.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.800]   But they did make a little bit bigger deal out of it.
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.400]   I mean, but it's interesting though.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.600]   Renegade Mike makes a good point, says Orca was never beta tested in the field.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   That's right.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:08.920]   And that's, yeah, that's what folks at the Romney campaign said, is that it was just,
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.640]   this is more just a story of it's not so much about politics.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.400]   It's just you have organizations who say we got this tool.
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400]   We're going to build it.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.160]   It's going to help everybody.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.240]   And it's just a mess.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.160]   And it turns out the people are like, give me the pen and paper and a phone.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160]   I can't do this.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.160]   You couldn't log into it.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.480]   It was like it was like, if you had to type it in perfectly, like HTTP or it was HTTP
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.520]   PAS or something like that, you couldn't log in.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.760]   No one could even ask.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:40.800]   This is a Romney volunteer and someone who wrote it sort of a what went wrong on Orca
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.440]   had said, I mean, training materials were vague and inaccurate.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.480]   Nightly information sessions weren't helpful.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.680]   Volunteers were told to look for a native mobile app, but it was web app.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.640]   The URL was for an HTTPS site, but the HTTP address didn't forward.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.240]   And if you started with a WWW, you just wouldn't find anything.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:07.360]   I mean, this is we know enough about computers to know that if any of those things are wrong,
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.840]   you're going to have a lot of people who are like, I don't know.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.840]   It's just broken.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   I don't know.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.920]   It's just it's just I it just doesn't work.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.920]   So Yikes.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.240]   This is not by the way Obama had his own campaign tool, narwhal.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.240]   I don't know.
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.440]   We haven't heard as much about that.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.560]   I guess it was effective enough.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.920]   And I believe that they use that in the last election.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.200]   It sort of had a tusk sticking out of his.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.200]   His narwhal.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   Might have held it.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.000]   Maybe that's the way that's what you needed.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   I don't know.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.640]   So and then in New Jersey, they were allowed to vote through Friday, even though the election
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.680]   was called Tuesday night, not even that late either.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.040]   They have some email voting.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.640]   Yeah, it was it's very interesting.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.800]   The way that that researchers and security experts say, you know what?
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.320]   This is a terrible idea.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:02.440]   All voting is basically the most potentially inaccurate and hackable method to vote.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.680]   However, in the wake of a natural disaster, sometimes you have to give a pass, right?
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.120]   I mean, hopefully the hackers are going to be like, all right.
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.720]   These people have had it rough enough.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.120]   We're not going to go after it.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.520]   Yeah, we're talking about politics though, right?
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:22.400]   When it comes to politics, I don't think anybody's giving anybody a pass.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400]   But go forward.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   Sure.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.400]   I don't think that this is going to be widespread.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.800]   I mean, this is a but it wouldn't work.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   It's never going to work.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.000]   Email is not built for that.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   My favorite.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.920]   We have to come up with some other system to vote online.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:41.800]   It does seem it will it does seem like, okay, yeah, email, maybe a bad idea, logging into
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.240]   some secure site, secure information.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.680]   I mean, can't that be done?
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   Wouldn't it be nice not to have to go down to your nurse pooling location?
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.600]   You know, I first thing in the morning, went in line.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.760]   But you can use the absentee ballot thing, but you can go half.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.560]   I did half and half, which is, yeah, I got the absentee ballot or the vote by mail.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.720]   They sent me the ballot, which is the exact same ballot they stuffed in in the sheet that
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.760]   I was at, at least for my polling location in San Francisco.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.240]   I hung out at home, filled out the whole thing, looked up research online while I was doing
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.280]   it for some of the issues I wanted to know more about.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.720]   And then on election day, I didn't mail.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.120]   I just walked over and I'm like, hey, can I start this in here and I want to stick her?
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.120]   That's what I did.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.120]   I got my sticker right here.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.280]   But I think they should encourage more people than not even necessarily even have to mail
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.760]   it in, but get the ballot in the mail and then hand the ballot in because the lines are
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:27.480]   going to go down if it means you hand it over with your ID to a poll worker and you're done.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.480]   So I mean, I don't know.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.960]   I didn't even go ahead and did it.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.440]   I signed it.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.240]   Giving Molly permission to hand it in for me.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.400]   Oh, yeah, I saw that too.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.680]   There's an extra feel to have like, you know, another person.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.960]   Well, you know, I had read about that.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960]   Okay.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.040]   So we're, you know, we won't talk too much about voting day, but just before we move
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.600]   on, I had read the same thing.
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:52.280]   It's like, you can't just have somebody bring in your ballot because I did the same thing.
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:57.480]   I, I, um, I filled out my, my mail in ballot and then I walked it down to the precinct
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:01.560]   and I, you know, I had my ID with me and, you know, you can't just be anybody and I
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.680]   walked up and she was like, Oh, yeah, just put in there.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:07.000]   And kind of, you know, I said, do you need to know my name?
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.400]   And she goes, no, no, it's fine.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.600]   And then I sort of was like, well, where is my sticker?
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600]   And Oh, oh, yeah.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   Okay.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.600]   You have to go talk to that lady.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   And then she gave me one.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.360]   You know, she didn't really want to either.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.360]   I'm like, I just voted.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.360]   I get a sticker, but.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.360]   Although there was a lot of security.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.160]   Isn't it crazy how loose the security is?
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.760]   And I don't know if that's just here.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:26.160]   Well, actually, I've gone into last time.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.360]   I actually went and voted and I had my idea that we don't even know.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.040]   Well, no, because there's voter ID laws.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:37.600]   They find it unlawful to be to, I mean, to have the between the step of an American citizen
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.000]   and getting their vote out, having a ID is a contentious issue.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   That's right.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.560]   But what, you know, if I, if I had a beef with you, Prager, which I do, I could have
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.200]   gone into your precinct and said, I'm David Prager.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.560]   And I'm going to vote for someone I knew that you disliked.
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.480]   Oh, I mean, you can do all kinds of things.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.480]   It would have stopped me.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.560]   And then you would have gone in there to vote later and it would have been a mess.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.560]   It's probably happens.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.560]   I'm doing it in four years.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.560]   Okay.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.000]   So who are you voting for in four years?
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   Who you want to run in four years?
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.920]   I know exactly who's going to run and who's going to win.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920]   But I'm not going to talk.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.840]   That's, that's very innate silver of you.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.840]   You know how it's all well.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.640]   I mean, apparently he's got it all figured out.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.440]   I'm pretty sure too, at least he was going to run.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.240]   I don't know anything about who's going to win.
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240]   Oh, who knows with this country?
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.920]   It's a bunch of, it's just crazy.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   I can't wait.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   Hey, yeah.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   Okay.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:39.640]   Should we talk about AT&T making it easier now for, for anybody who's, who's an AT&T user
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:45.120]   who isn't on an unlimited plan to now use FaceTime over cellular.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.720]   So I am on an unlimited plan.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.200]   So this actually doesn't apply to me.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.920]   So I, I, yeah, I'm on an unlimited plan.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:51.920]   So I can't use FaceTime.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.520]   No, no, no, because you're already getting too much.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.520]   I hate it.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.920]   So when I'm at home now, I have my router, Wi-Fi and I have LTE.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.480]   And when I do a speed test, it runs faster on LTE.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:06.120]   So I'm kind of like, I got to turn the Wi-Fi off on my phone when I'm at home.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   No way.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120]   Because it's faster.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   What?
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.120]   That's crazy.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   I'll get like 40 megabits down on my phone.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.600]   Do you live like under a tower?
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   I don't know.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.120]   I won't complain, but it's amazing.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.800]   Well, that's, yeah, that's great.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.360]   But it doesn't, if you want to use FaceTime, then you're at the wall.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.360]   I can't use FaceTime.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.360]   I have to turn on Wi-Fi.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.720]   Is your like skeletal structure made of aluminum?
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.080]   So here's, here's a little bit of the backstory on this for anybody who's like, what, what's
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.080]   going on here?
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:36.440]   So initially AT&T said, no, no, you can't get FaceTime over cellular unless you're part
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.840]   of a mobile share plan, which happens to be a new exciting plan that is probably pricier
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.760]   than the plan you already have.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.080]   People went, well, you suck.
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.080]   Okay.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.840]   Thanks for nothing AT&T.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:55.200]   And meanwhile, there were a lot of organizations, public knowledge is one of them free presses
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.200]   and other said, hold on a second.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.200]   Hold on a second.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200]   There is no reason the AT&T should be limiting this.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.600]   AT&T has spectrum that it licenses as part of an agreement of licensing spectrum.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.320]   You might pretty much agree to use the spectrum to its full capability for the benefit of
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.280]   the users, the community.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:20.200]   And AT&T just isn't giving us one of the options that we should have on our phone, right?
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.760]   So AT&T said, no, no, this is not because we're trying to screw anybody over.
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.160]   It's because our engineers have no way to test our network beforehand.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.720]   So we just needed to make sure that the infrastructure was in place and we weren't going to affect
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.000]   everyone's, all of the users by bogging down the network, you know, with all the FaceTime
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.320]   that everybody's doing.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.440]   So we just had to make sure that everything was okay.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.360]   Now we've deemed it pretty much okay.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:54.840]   So anybody who's not on a limited plan gets to now use FaceTime over cellular, which just,
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:00.720]   it's almost more insulting because AT&T is saying, well, okay, we do have the capacity.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.480]   We always did have the capacity.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:07.320]   And now we're finally admitting it because we're under pressure from companies, you know,
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.960]   and possibly under FCC pressure, right, if we don't do something about this.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.680]   But it just, it's spectrum that they have plenty of and they still won't let Prager
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.560]   or me use FaceTime over cellular.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.480]   Why no reason?
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.240]   How often, how often I've probably made all of five FaceTime guys.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   Well, that's really good.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   And you hold on to me.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.480]   You guys talk four of those five or just like, wow, this is kind of cool.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   Okay.
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.960]   Yeah, I think honestly, the only people are using Facebook are FaceTime.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   I'm sorry, FaceTime.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.320]   You know what I meant?
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.000]   I like, you know, it's just for kind of dirty purposes.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.320]   But that's not really the point.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.760]   It's not all about somebody in chat said, oh, only girls use FaceTime.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.280]   I never use FaceTime actually.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:56.000]   It doesn't really, none of this really matters to me on an actual day-to-day level.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.240]   It just bothers me that AT&T is saying, oh, unlimited user that got in before we stopped
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:07.680]   letting people get unlimited accounts, you can't have this feature because if you for
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.640]   some reason are a big FaceTimeer, then maybe you'll sign up for a different account and
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.600]   we can get you off of that unlimited plan that we really don't want you to have.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.800]   And the same thing goes for trying to make a mobile hotspot.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.320]   I can't do that unless I go to a limited plan.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.320]   Exactly.
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   Right.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.320]   Which they want you off of the unlimited plans.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.320]   I totally understand it though.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320]   I do.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320]   Well, the business of making money, right?
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:30.920]   Well, I mean, they got in trouble.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.000]   There's another story we had here.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.720]   They have to pay overcharging dispute because they're people that were grandfathered in.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.960]   And then if they went and got a new phone through some warranty, they got automatically switched
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.600]   over to the non-grad grandfather in one.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.160]   So they're getting overcharging users without telling them.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:53.160]   Violating whatever contract that they had with the subscriber.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.880]   That's probably what's happened to me.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880]   And I haven't even noticed.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.680]   When I don't understand about the stories, it says that AT&T is to pay the feds $700,000
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.440]   to settle overcharging dispute.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.920]   It seems like they don't owe the feds.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:03.920]   They owe the customer.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920]   Maybe that's in the fine print.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:05.920]   Maybe that's in the fine print.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.920]   I don't know.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920]   Well, I don't know.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.920]   The feds can't pay all that money.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   Well, you know.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.920]   Everyone's got a damn handout.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.920]   My dad always says.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:23.680]   FCC started investigating AT&T last year over these claims because consumers were complaining.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.320]   Then the agency reached an agreement with AT&T.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.400]   They announced it Tuesday.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.160]   Julius Janikowski, FCC Chairman, says today's action sends a clear signal that the wire
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.080]   list carriers can't wrongfully charge consumers.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.240]   These strong FCC accountability measures will ensure consumers are not overcharged.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.000]   I am pleased that AT&T is taking the appropriate steps to resolve this issue.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.520]   Well, they did it under duress.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.760]   I don't think they did it just to be cool.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.320]   I mean, they're collecting.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.000]   I mean, I think most of us, I mean, maybe there's a subset of the population, but most
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.920]   of us with smartphones that use them a lot are paying on average probably about $100
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.920]   a month.
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:00.920]   I think.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   And so if you think about, you know, the number of lots.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.960]   I mean, that's a lot of money.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.840]   And there's a reason why you can buy your smartphone for a subset.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.840]   Well, yeah.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.400]   AT&T will make a voluntary payment in the amount of 700,000 to the US Department of
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.840]   Treasury, which will then refund individual consumers affected by the changes.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.040]   You better get your money.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.200]   You've probably been wrong.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.160]   I've probably been wrong because I didn't pay any attention when I was moving over to
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160]   this iPhone 5.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:34.480]   I didn't even realize, you know, they always looked so long and thin.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.440]   And now everybody has them and they just look normal.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.440]   Yeah, it's kind of fun.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.440]   I'm very, very happy with it.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.800]   I know that the Apple haters don't want us to talk about.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.800]   Yes.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   That was a huge upgrade.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.080]   You're actually the perfect.
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.120]   I mean, that must be an extremely exciting for to me.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.440]   I'm like, it's a little bit bigger.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.720]   But for my 3GS to a 5, it's a huge job.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.840]   I mean, I don't get very excited about phones and this kind of thing.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.640]   This means a quantum leap though.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   Really great device.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.640]   It's pretty fun.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.400]   Hey, we should take another break.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.480]   Let's figure out what we're going to talk about next while we do that.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.800]   Let's kick it over to Leo because he's got some thinking to do.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   Ah, yes.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   Excuse me for just a moment.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.800]   A brief plug for one of our favorite sponsors.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:20.320]   In a way, I almost feel like this is a public service announcement when I talk about Gazelle.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.120]   I know, look, we all have a drawer or a closet or a Dvorak's case.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.600]   An entire rented office full of used old gadgets.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.240]   Wouldn't you like to get a little money for them?
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.760]   Maybe pay for something new?
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:36.560]   This is the way to do it.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.280]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle dot com.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.720]   Sell your iPhone, your iPad, your Mac.
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   Even if you got a blackberry or an old Samsung phone, this is the place to go.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:53.080]   Say you just heard that Apple was replacing the third generation iPad with the fourth.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.880]   Now you haven't seen the fourth yet.
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.920]   You don't know if you want it, but what I would do is go right now to Gazelle dot com
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:03.160]   and get an offer because I'll tell you what, that offer is good for 30 days.
[01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:06.840]   Whoa, four to 95 bucks for that iPad 3.
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.880]   Throw that in the box.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.000]   Now you don't have to do that right away.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   You could just say add it to the box and then keep doing it.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.160]   Find other gadgets, add them to the box.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.320]   Gazelle will pay shipping.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.200]   They actually send you a box with a shipping label and everything on it and they will pay
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.400]   the shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:32.000]   And then they give you cash, PayPal or better yet an Amazon gift certificate.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.760]   Four and twenty one bucks for my iPhone 5.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.760]   I'll take that.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.440]   Wow, this is good.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.960]   I ought to do this more often.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.960]   Gazelle dot com.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:46.920]   Now you can do it now and get 30 days guaranteed that way.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:53.480]   You can wait till your device comes and move the data over then send it to Gazelle.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.920]   But do the quote now because I'll be honest with you.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.640]   These things aren't getting any more valuable.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.800]   I don't care what you think.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.600]   Here's a blackberry torch.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.960]   You think that's worth more?
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.760]   That's scary.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.760]   Free of water damage, yes.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.840]   By the way, they're data experts will wipe your data.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.200]   Wow, that's worth a hundred bucks.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.760]   That's worth a lot more to them than it is to me.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.840]   I'm going to Gazelle.
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.840]   You should too.
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.160]   Gazelle dot com.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.160]   Get paid fast.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.840]   Get almost $50 million to over 400,000 customers.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.560]   It's a great way to recycle.
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.480]   Gazelle dot com.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.720]   All right, Prager, you said to me--
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.400]   Oh, back to you guys.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.120]   Oh, thank you, Leo.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.320]   You said to me, hey, are we going to talk about smart glass?
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.480]   And I went, I guess.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.480]   Are you excited?
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.480]   Xbox, my glass.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.480]   Come on to iOS.
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.720]   Well, I'll start by saying I'm not a huge gamer.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720]   It's actually out already.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:50.160]   I think it's kind of cool because it just allows a new dimension to a lot of what we
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.320]   do in our living rooms.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.920]   So smart glass.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.400]   It's basically an app for iOS.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.320]   And you can also do--
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.680]   I think I'm positive it's on Android as well.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:02.080]   And what it allows you to do is basically interface and input what you're doing through
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.320]   your Xbox, but with--
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.320]   To Android app launch.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:04.320]   Your--
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.320]   --comparing how.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:09.600]   So instead of having to use a joystick and toggle through what your name is or just
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.720]   change all your settings, it's a lot faster to change settings using the inputs of a
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.240]   touchscreen display than it is to use a joystick.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.120]   But beyond that, and even though it's not in the story, I kind of find it.
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.760]   Interesting to be able to have an additional display for something like an Xbox 360 because
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:30.680]   the new Nintendo, the Nintendo Wii U has a joystick that's also a display.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.560]   So say if you're playing a game like Madden and you want to scroll through all the plays,
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.280]   I don't want you to be able to see the plays I'm looking at.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.160]   I can do that on the Wii U or when it comes out.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:44.240]   And I think theoretically on the Xbox, because they have smart glass, you'll be able to add
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.640]   additional ways of input for your game in addition to just going through your settings
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.560]   and changing your user names.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.160]   Yeah, it's a remote, real.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.200]   I mean, in many ways, plus the ability to input.
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.200]   Exactly.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.200]   So it's like a keyboard.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.360]   Sure, a glorified keyboard.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.360]   Well, and more.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.600]   I mean, basically, it's like you already have your phone, right?
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.040]   Your phone is sitting on the couch next to you.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:11.000]   Why not actually have it be able to integrate with the gaming console that you're using
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   that you love?
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.760]   Because I can't put my phone down long enough.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.240]   Even while I'm playing video games, I have to be on my phone.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.880]   Well, it can-- yes.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:21.880]   Once again.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   If you want it to-- if you want your phone to be fun--
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.720]   I need the joystick over here and a phone over here.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:29.720]   Well, that's the thing, though.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.720]   And the snacks over here--
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.720]   Is that you-- my soda over here.
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.760]   The idea is to be able to combine so you don't end up having a living in full of these
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.600]   devices that all do one or two things.
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.600]   And it's a video game.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.600]   You have fewer devices that do more.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:45.440]   It's an extra level of dimension that a video game author can choose whether or not
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.920]   they think it enhances the quality of the game.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.920]   And then they also have to consider going back to the Wii U. If you have a Wii U, it's given
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.440]   that 100% of the users will have the device.
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.600]   And so it's easy for a video game maker to say, well, I'm going to make this added method
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.280]   of using the joystick and build that into my game.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.240]   And they'll know everyone can use it for the Xbox 360.
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:10.560]   You can't necessarily think for a given that everyone has an Android phone or an iOS phone.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.800]   That said, they can decide whether or not enough people have it that they can add an
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:18.480]   element of diversity into the input control of the game that therefore allows that many
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.600]   more users to be interested in getting the game.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.600]   How much does this cost?
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:22.600]   I have no idea.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.600]   It's an app.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:24.600]   I bet you it would be free.
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   I bet you it's free.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.600]   Well, let's look.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.160]   Let's look because I haven't downloaded it.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.440]   I don't have an Xbox.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.200]   So there's not much I can do with the I always want to call it Gorilla Glass.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.200]   It's not.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.200]   It's not what it's called.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.080]   The app is free according to the chat room.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.280]   Yeah, free app Xbox smart glass.
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:41.280]   There we are.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.760]   You have a computer sitting in front of you.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.160]   Why are you looking this up on your phone?
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.080]   Because I'm looking in the app store dummy.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.080]   That's where you go when you want to know if an app is free or.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.080]   Yeah, this.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.280]   They haven't gotten rid of those processors yet.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.720]   So you got to use iOS.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.720]   Okay.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.800]   Looking on your computer for an app that's going to be on it.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:58.800]   Come on now.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.800]   You blow my mind.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.640]   Let's go the short route here.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:06.700]   Hey, so what do you guys think about Kim dot com and mega upload because this story gets
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.800]   weirder and weirder.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800]   Oh, so.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.720]   Now, first of all, I don't have a huge issue with Kim.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:13.720]   Dot com.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.720]   Sure.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:21.120]   Even though I know that he's well, I guess as far as his his persona goes, he really
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.440]   rubs people the wrong way.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.960]   Well, I mean, I'm sure everyone pretty much knows, but I mean, for the most part, he had
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.040]   mega upload a place where you can pirate movies.
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040]   That's why I got shut down.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:35.840]   They said it's used for pirating movies, not for sharing massive amounts of legitimate
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:36.840]   data.
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.480]   But there was legitimate data that was shared a ton of legitimate data, which pissed off
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   a lot of people using it.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   Sure.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.600]   And the federal government among other people, but for the most part, the federal government
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.600]   says, guess what?
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:51.000]   You ain't doing this because you're violating federal law on sharing video material that's
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.360]   copy written.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:58.080]   So they shut it down, try to issue an arrest warrant to have him extradited from New Zealand
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.080]   to the United States.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.280]   So that goes down.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:05.480]   There's a huge, I don't know, rig them a role for like of a better word.
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.480]   And it's a rig them.
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.320]   So now, so now, so now, Kim dot gom says, well, I'm going to create a new service now that
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.560]   mega upload comms down.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.880]   I'm going to go create it under what was the new name mega mega.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   Yeah, yeah, like Gambier, Gabon.
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.640]   So then the government over there is like, well, hold on.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.520]   We don't want to be a tool for you to create a new site.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.360]   So then he's like, yeah, it's going to be somewhere else.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   Really?
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.080]   Well, what else is Gabon got going on?
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:40.400]   But Belazé Luembe, which is Gabon's communications minister, pretty much said, no, we're not going
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:45.560]   to serve as a platform or screen for committing acts aimed at violating copyrights nor to
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.440]   be used by unscrupulous people.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:54.320]   That was according to a New Zealand publication stuff dot co dot NC, which is, which is funny
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:01.560]   because the lawyer for kind of like mega uploads worldwide defense who is very busy these
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.560]   days.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.560]   His name is Ira Rothkin.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.760]   He's based in Silicon Valley actually said in an interview with CNET.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:12.360]   Yeah, okay, we're not going to actually go ahead and use the Gabon domain.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:19.200]   It's mega as an ME dot GA because that's the domain of the country said, well, okay, we'll
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.480]   just call it something else.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:26.200]   But it's funny because Kim dot com recently, I mean, it was in the last couple of weeks,
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.000]   had made a big deal about how something is going to come back.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   We're going to launch it in January.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.720]   We don't even have anything to show you, but it's going to be at the domain mega.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:40.320]   And it's going to be a big deal.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.240]   So everybody started talking about it.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:46.800]   Gabon says, we want a part of this and they go, okay, well, our idea that's really just
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.440]   an idea that no one's even seen yet will just be called something else entirely.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.600]   The thing is stupid.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:56.680]   I mean, it's, it's this guy, Kim dot com saying I'm going to be the champion of the ability
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.600]   to share information and media across as many people as possible.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.600]   Period.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.680]   And I'm the champion of this and this is the right thing to do because we don't freedom
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:04.680]   for everyone.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.680]   And he knows.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.680]   Of course.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.800]   And, and yes, there has to be a solution for some people to do stuff, but that I don't
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.880]   think this is the way to do it.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:20.040]   And I'm all, you know, for, you know, circumventing, you know, means to get what you want legally.
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:24.520]   But if you're using someone's service, clearly, I mean, it's pretty freaking obvious.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.880]   I hate to say it that, you know, the service was used in large part for piracy.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.320]   So what, what, what can mega upload do going forward?
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:37.440]   They're going to, they're going to figure out how to relaunch some sort of a service
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440]   like this again.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:43.080]   You know, it's, it's some, in some form, we're going to see mega upload come back from the
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080]   ashes.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.080]   What do they do?
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.720]   How do they make sure that I don't share infringing content, you know, rather than
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.000]   perfectly safe Linux distros the next time I use it?
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   What do they do?
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.800]   What I know that there is a whole, you know, there's the whole like winky wink thing like,
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.720]   yeah, sometimes there's legitimate stuff shared on mega upload, but most of it isn't.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:09.160]   And I think that if you build infrastructure for people to share and you back away from
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.200]   it and say, well, it's not, you know, it's not my job to make sure that I'm policing what
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.200]   you're sharing.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.360]   And some people are asking, like, how's it, how's it different from the drop boxes and
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.880]   the, and the G drives, except for those are tied to specific user accounts.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:26.320]   And I also think at the end of the day, it's, it's kind of like, you know, as, as it becomes
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:32.160]   more easy to traffic and high bandwidth and easier to have more storage on your devices.
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:39.200]   I mean, the sharing of movies is not hard and it's not going to, the problem is for stopping
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.200]   piracy.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:41.960]   I don't think that's the root necessarily to take.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.720]   You can't open it up.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:48.880]   So I'm kind of being a devil's advocate to myself, but like, it's absolutely easy to
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.840]   share any data that you want.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:57.320]   And you know, the, the encryption of, you know, copyright protection schemes using technology
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:58.320]   to do that.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.080]   All those are going to be cracked nonstop all the time.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080]   Certainly.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:03.840]   Um, you know, I think, I think the movie industry hasn't happened yet.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:07.080]   It's going to, it's going to come up against the same thing that's happened to the music
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.560]   industry and it's already happening.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.560]   And it's going to start happening more.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.640]   Have you seen this guy?
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.200]   This Kim.com, what he looks like?
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.200]   I've seen him.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.280]   Have you seen, but well, that's why I talked about his whole persona thing.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.960]   He's, he's done many photo shoots with boats and guys.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   He's trying to be gangster.
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.960]   Well, I mean, I don't, I'm not going to say a lot of money.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   Come at me.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   Who's that?
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.440]   Don't come at me, Kim.
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.920]   Well, I may be a marked man.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.920]   Be careful.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:32.920]   I'm kind of scared now.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:33.920]   Right.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:34.920]   Hey, so, uh, what do you think?
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.800]   What do you think about the, uh, 15 year old hacker calling himself Cosmo the God?
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.960]   Sentence to juvenile court on Wednesday.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.800]   Uh, he pleaded guilty to multiple felonies in exchange for a probation.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.240]   Um, all the charges brought against him, which included charges based on credit card
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:59.720]   fraud, identity theft, bomb threats, online impersonation, just, you know, bad stuff over
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:08.120]   the course of this last year, 2012 Cosmo, um, belonging to a group called UG Nazi, um,
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:12.080]   took part in some pretty high profile hacking events.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:17.240]   Um, they started as a group that was opposing SOPA, uh, as, as many folks were took down
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:25.120]   websites, took down NASDAQ CIA dot gov, USC UFC dot com, redirected for chance DNS to
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.560]   point to, uh, its own Twitter feed.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.560]   What's going on?
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.040]   Social engineering techniques gained access to Amazon PayPal, other companies.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.040]   Holy crap.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.960]   He's not going to feel like a God very much longer.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.080]   Well, what's in the who's gal?
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.200]   I mean, cause both of his and part.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:49.040]   And so he's not getting sent to prison probably because he's 15, but what they're doing is
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:55.880]   they, they want to, uh, prohibit his use of the internet until he's 21 without express,
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.880]   uh, permission.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.880]   Right.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:02.360]   And, and so he can't, he can't be unsupervised.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.600]   He can't do, he can't be on the internet for anything that's not education related.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.800]   But it seems interesting because like, this is a tough one because he did some really
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.360]   bad things and he deserves to be punished for it.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:17.440]   That said, from some, some kid like him who is livelihood and part of his, in a way, his
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.240]   genius is being able to use the internet.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.880]   Is it robbing him of his entire future by turning that off for that long?
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.640]   Nick, it's not his entire future.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.640]   Six years.
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:28.640]   Six years.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:29.640]   But here's the thing.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:30.640]   Okay.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.280]   So he basically just, he has to be supervised because he can't be trusted to, to be responsible,
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.280]   right?
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.880]   He has to hand over all of his account logins and passwords.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:43.040]   He has to disclose in writing any devices that he has access to, um, that have the capability
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.800]   to connect to any network.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.240]   He can't have any contact with the members or associates of a UG Nazi or anonymous.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.360]   I mean, I mean, that's, that's, that's tough one.
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.800]   So just anybody who might be associated with anonymous, we don't know how those people
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.520]   are, along with a list of other individuals, he had to forfeit all the computers and other
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.040]   items seized in the raid on his home.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:07.000]   Um, and violating these terms will, will result in a three year prison term.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.600]   So I don't know.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.880]   What would you, what would you do if you got sentenced and you, you, they said you can't
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.480]   touch your computer, your phone, your anything for six years.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.040]   Would you, I mean, well, you would go nuts.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.520]   Well, I would go nuts, but I'm not.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.640]   I've got your phone and we're going to put it over here for the rest of the show.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640]   That's fine.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.800]   See if you can get it.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   You can't get in.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.800]   You can get it.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:32.800]   Itchy.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.800]   I have it.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800]   It's tough.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:35.800]   I think, I mean, I think, you know, he deserves to be punished.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.400]   I can't think of an alternative, but at the same time, it's kind of interesting, you
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.000]   know, being a heavy computer user, being someone who's got this in my pocket all the
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   time.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   That's just.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   But you're not taking down CIA.gov.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000]   I'm not saying, I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000]   I'm not saying it's true.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   He might actually be taking down CIA.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.160]   Listening the cell phone tower where he lives.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:56.160]   You're sitting right next to us.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:00.080]   I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's, I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it again, but
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.560]   it's a, it's a harsh punishment.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.560]   I don't really.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560]   It's a pretty good.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.480]   Jay later, man, a LA attorney who represented alleged members of anonymous and lulsec told
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.680]   Wired, keeping somebody off the internet for six years.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:14.360]   That one term seems unduly harsh.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:18.800]   You're talking about a really bright gifted kid in terms of all things internet at some
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:22.280]   point after getting on the right path, he could do some really good things.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.640]   I feel that monitored internet access for six years is a bit on the hefty side.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:30.280]   It could sideline his whole life, his career path, his art, his skills.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:33.320]   At some level, it's like taking away moats, arts, piano.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   I just don't.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   I just don't.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320]   Whoa.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.320]   You told you.
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:39.320]   I don't.
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.560]   You do bad stuff.
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.360]   You know you're doing it.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:46.160]   That's why a lot of people in the chat room are saying that the CIA should hire them.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.440]   Well, I'll be that.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.400]   Well, you know they did lose a little leader.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.400]   So I'm kidding.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:52.600]   Well, that's a common practice, right?
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:53.600]   Companies as well.
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:54.600]   No, they do.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.200]   But you can't you can't reward all these hackers like that.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:58.200]   Sure.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:03.080]   At a certain point, it may be Cosmo the God is where it ends like, all right, dude, you
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.640]   guys, because you know, these guys are like, well, you know, I'll just get a great job
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.760]   in the government for your caught doing this.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.680]   Well, the thing is that if you are a best and brightest, then it's a very weird way to
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.960]   get your name out there as well as resumes go.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.760]   But it's a good way to prove that you know what you're doing.
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:23.400]   However, if you're doing it for chaos and.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.600]   Well, what would he was punishment have been if he he were 18 or 19?
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.720]   What have you been in prison for six years?
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.600]   Because I think you would have gone to prison.
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.520]   Yeah, so he did a lot of stuff.
[01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:35.920]   This is all just because he's 15, right?
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.240]   Yeah, no one even knows his name because of that.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.760]   And credit card fraud alone.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.680]   I mean, you're getting in a lot of trouble.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.680]   Bomb threats.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.680]   Never funny.
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.680]   It's a good stuff.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   Yeah, it is.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:51.840]   Well, Cosmo, we don't actually know his name.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.600]   That's all being withheld again, because he's a minor.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.120]   I'm wearing like these.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.640]   He was arrested back in June, by the way.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.360]   It was a multi state FBI sting.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.080]   This is finally his sentencing.
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.520]   So yeah, there are there are folks out there who think it's a little a little a little steep,
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.680]   a little stiff.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.680]   I don't know if I agree.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.840]   I can't you can't just run rampant out there.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.360]   Take down government websites.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.640]   You can, but they'll find you.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.320]   There you have it, folks.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.240]   You like that?
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.960]   Mind your peasy cues.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   Be careful.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.960]   I'm internet.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:31.560]   Hey, you know, we mentioned Instagram a little bit earlier, but we hadn't talked about the
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:35.000]   coolest part of Instagram's news this week.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.720]   Instagram now has web profiles, full web profiles.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:42.160]   If I go to Instagram.com/DavidPrager, you're David Prager on Instagram, aren't you?
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.160]   D L Prager.
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.160]   D L Prager.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:48.600]   Of course, that's amazing photos of my most recent one is of a of a of a of a little
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.600]   bird in Hawaii.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.880]   I always wondered why did you you've always gone with D L Prager, not David Prager.
[01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:56.040]   Is there actually is like a radio host?
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:01.840]   No, it's I mean, you know, Prager's you a unique, but if I type in the word Prager,
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   there's a lot of that.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:06.960]   There's a lot of people that if I type in D L Prager, it's a 100% only me.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:12.120]   I think you're just SEO or not SEO, but just for isolating my online person.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.120]   This is great though.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.120]   This is like deal.
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.120]   Hugely.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.120]   Deal, Hughly.
[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.800]   I was sort of one of that too.
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.800]   I'm glad you got it.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.280]   I still don't have a good I still don't have a good fees.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:26.160]   I can go to Instagram online, but I can't see a nice stream of all the people I follow.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.160]   What was that picture?
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.420]   Was that your picture?
[01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:29.420]   Which one?
[01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:31.760]   Somebody running over a zebra.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:32.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.480]   That's not real zebra.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.480]   There's a Z.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   No, it's a giraffe.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.560]   Oh, that yeah, I took that one too.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.560]   That's a zebra.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.560]   What are you doing?
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.560]   It's a party zebra.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.960]   It belongs to a bear lion.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.200]   It belongs to a bear lion.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.200]   And I was walking over this.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.800]   Is a bear lion also have that vehicle?
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:48.800]   Yeah, he does.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:51.680]   I was walking to his house after they had a party the night before and I thought it was
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:55.560]   very ironic that there was a party zebra passed out in front of a Ferrari.
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.000]   What party was this?
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.360]   Well, Prager has some pretty she-shey friends.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.560]   I've watched a bear.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.560]   It's just a donut.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:05.000]   A bear had started a few companies and he's done okay.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.800]   And now he has this zebra.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:08.800]   He's like one of those kids.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.800]   He could have been.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.520]   But except he's a rich kid of Instagram.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.840]   But he did and we talked about it in an episode of Does Donut.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:17.160]   He deleted AOL from existence for three days.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.880]   Back in 1996, I believe.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:19.880]   Wait, what?
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:20.880]   Tell me more.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   What?
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   He's a zebra.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   And he got rewarded.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:28.520]   But no, I think he quickly realized that there's people behind what you do on computers.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.400]   And I think there was a hint of morality there.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.840]   And so he realized that maybe I shouldn't hurt other people through my knowledge of computer
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.840]   networking.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.360]   And he happens to be one of the smartest people I know in terms of understanding how
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.960]   data transfer works.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.040]   He's a pretty smart guy.
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.040]   Yep.
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:44.040]   And so now he has a Ferrari.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:49.640]   And you took a picture of it on Instagram with a drunk passed out zebra made of air,
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:50.640]   I guess.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.640]   Well, okay.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.440]   So web profiles.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:54.600]   Okay.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:58.480]   I like the fact that Instagram has rolled out web profiles.
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.400]   Martin, you don't, not a huge Instagram.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:02.400]   Not huge.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.320]   But you do have a picture on there.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.320]   I agree with that.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:06.320]   You should what?
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.880]   Someone in the chat room said bearish had mentor Cosmo about using your knowledge.
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:13.840]   He just needs, he needs a good mentor to get him on the right path, the path to.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.160]   He needs a big brother.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.440]   Well, he's I'm sure in juvenile court and you in here somewhere.
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:22.760]   So there's a mentor.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.240]   Yeah, he's probably got a big brother.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.240]   And you'll be right now.
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.240]   Okay.
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.240]   All right.
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.240]   So you think Instagram news is a little bit too hyped.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:34.120]   I mean, it's just a way to look at someone's photos from their social, from their.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.640]   Yeah, I kind of do.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.320]   I kind of do.
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:41.920]   You know how anytime anybody has a reason to, you know, pimp their profile, you start getting
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.360]   all of these people on Twitter saying, Oh, cool.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.240]   I love the Instagram new web profiles.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.680]   Here's mine.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.760]   And yeah, so I saw a lot of that over a few days.
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:52.560]   But I can't look at my feed.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.240]   Well, yeah, it's not your feed.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:58.080]   I use an app called Carousel and it allows me to use my desktop computer to look at.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.080]   Yeah, I have that too.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.840]   I just, you know, the updates that someone's having on Instagram.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:04.640]   So the idea, it's almost like going to a Twitter profile, right?
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.640]   If I'm like, David Prager, I don't know.
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.640]   He seems like a cool guy.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.040]   What kind of stuff does he tweet about?
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.960]   I go to Twitter.com/dealpregger.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:16.640]   If I want to go to see what you're taking pictures of, I go to Instagram.com/dealpregger.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.640]   Makes perfect sense.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:25.600]   I guess I'm just so used to accessing Instagram from a mobile device that I don't see much
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.600]   of a point of the of the web profiles.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.960]   Prager's over there clicking on stupid pictures that I've taken myself.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.960]   That's Instagram.com/Cerellene.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:35.960]   Right, right.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:36.960]   Oh, okay.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:37.960]   That makes a lot more sense.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:38.960]   I thought that was Prager's Instagram.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:42.440]   Like, wow, you got a lot of pictures of Sarah and MG.
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.440]   Yeah, that's really creepy.
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.720]   This seems like a it seems like it makes sense now that Instagram is owned by Facebook.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.360]   Of course, Facebook trying to get heavily into mobile, but very much web presence.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:59.800]   Most people are accessing the only integration I've seen is that if I put an Instagram photo
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:04.920]   or if I put a if I post a picture on Instagram, Instagram will tell me when certain people
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.760]   have liked it on Facebook.
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:09.760]   If I tell it to go on Facebook, Instagram, Apple, tell me.
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.960]   Or was that always available through the API?
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960]   Posh, I don't.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.960]   Wait a second.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.560]   If you post a photo to Facebook.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:23.280]   If I use Instagram, take a photo and put it online and say also publish to Facebook,
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.840]   yes, Instagram, Apple, tell me when Facebook people are liking it.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.160]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.800]   I don't have that turned on, I guess.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:32.800]   So what do you get?
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.320]   You just get a little pop up?
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.880]   Oh, no, it'll just tell me, I don't have push turned on for that.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.960]   But it'll just tell me this many people liked it.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:43.040]   Like say I'm logged into the app without having the push turned on.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.560]   It'll tell me like this many people liked it and some of them are on Facebook and some
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560]   of them are on Instagram.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.960]   Where does the app tell you that?
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:50.960]   In your what?
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.960]   Oh my goodness.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:55.800]   I haven't been to my Instagram settings recently enough.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:56.800]   That's pretty cool.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.640]   Hey, you know, we've got, so yeah, Instagram on the web.
[01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:00.800]   Martin has nothing to say about it.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.000]   I don't know.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.280]   They got too much attention already.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.760]   Instagram, we're sick of you.
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.760]   We're going to move on.
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.960]   Hey, before we move on, we have one more, one more sponsor that we want to thank.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:14.320]   I'll go ahead and kick it over to Leo to do the dirty work.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.200]   Hey kids, how are you?
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.320]   Everything going good in Twitland?
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.360]   You miss me?
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.520]   You wish I were what?
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:23.560]   You wish I were still there?
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.200]   No, I'm right now.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:31.000]   I'm in, I think I'm in, I'm in New Caledonia, New Meia, I think.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.800]   Anyway, I'm far, far away from here.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.200]   Thinking of you though, oh yeah.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.920]   And thinking about your data, because I do think about that.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.240]   The one thing I do not miss is the calls to the radio show.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:52.240]   It's actually sad from people who say, my hard drive crashed and I have pictures of
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.240]   my wedding on there.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:54.240]   Is there any way I can get it back?
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.640]   I got one guy, call me up.
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:57.800]   It actually was a happy ending.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:58.800]   He called me up.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.720]   I was sailing from Los Angeles to Catalina Island on my boat and the lap, it got a little
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.440]   rough, the laptop went overboard.
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.040]   And he said, but there's a happy ending.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.880]   I was using carbon, it was fine.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.840]   I mean, you know, he had to buy a new laptop, but his data is safe.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.160]   And you know what, really the data is the stuff that's irreplaceable.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:20.280]   You can always get a new laptop, but can you get, you know, new wedding pictures, baby
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.080]   pictures, financial records.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.360]   Just think what's on your hard drive right now.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.920]   You can't afford to lose that.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:30.240]   You need a backup solution that's automatic, that's continuous, that will be up in the
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:31.240]   cloud.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:37.000]   So, you know, it's not going to be lost whenever there's a really big disaster, a fire or a
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.720]   hurricane or something like that.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.720]   I love carbonite.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:42.040]   It's a really good backup plan.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.960]   Very affordable, by the way, $59 a year for everything on your computer.
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:51.360]   It's cloud access too, because all those files are, you know, once they're on the
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.960]   carbonite servers, you can log in to your carbonite account on any device, any laptop,
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:00.600]   any desktop, even a smartphone or tablet, and there's your stuff.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.080]   It's a great way to get to your files as well.
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:09.520]   Best price, best part of all is the price, $59 a year, less of $5 a month.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:12.400]   I want you to try it free for the first two weeks.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:15.800]   That'll be enough probably to get your first backup done, depending on your upstream bandwidth.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:19.320]   And I do like you to try it, because it uses your internet connection.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.840]   It does not slow you down, it does not slow your computer down.
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.040]   But if you don't have enough bandwidth, you know, don't use it on a dialup.
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:27.120]   So that's why I want you to try it free.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.600]   Carbonite.com, click the try home free and use our offer code TWIT.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.960]   You can try it free for 14 days.
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:38.080]   And if you do that and you decide to buy, you get two months free with purchase, notice
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.600]   there are small business, home office and other plans as well.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.440]   Flat rate plans that are very affordable, just compare it to anything else out there
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.120]   and you'll see what I mean.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:53.040]   It's Flat rate plans.com, please do us a favor, use the offer code TWIT.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:55.520]   Now it's back to you guys.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.460]   Thanks Leo.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:02.240]   So we're kind of in the home stretch here of the show, but I just want to end it without
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.260]   talking about Yahoo just a little bit.
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.640]   Yahoo has a new homepage redesign.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:10.560]   Have you been using Yahoo all these years Martin?
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.560]   I know you still, it's still one of your primary email addresses.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.080]   Yeah, I have others.
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.080]   Yeah, I know.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.240]   You're a friend to Yahoo, right?
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.280]   Yeah, I look at Yahoo, okay?
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.680]   I don't feel like you need to apologize for that.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.160]   Sometimes you throw someone a Yahoo email address.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.160]   It's true.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.160]   It's true.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.160]   There's a stigma, isn't it?
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.160]   There is a stigma.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160]   Obviously, I'm riskin' my end team.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.920]   I used to think that about people with AOL addresses.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:40.920]   Is it that bad?
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:42.920]   Not that bad.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:43.920]   No, you're not.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.600]   It's a decent portal.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.600]   Right.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.640]   So I get my news.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:55.040]   Do you feel like what is the problem that people have with Yahoo?
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.600]   What needs to change?
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:58.640]   You still use it as a service?
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.280]   I'm fine with it.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.720]   I don't think it's that horrible.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:08.560]   Obviously, they're making some radical changes.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:12.000]   What they're trying to come out with now, and they're testing it with some people.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.400]   I have not seen it.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.240]   They have not foisted it upon me.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:17.280]   Looks more like sort of a Windows 8.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:19.480]   Yeah, it does.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.480]   Or some might say a Pinterest type of a thing.
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.480]   There's all about tiles and visuals.
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:28.560]   Well, that is interesting that Pinterest, they started and then you've even have, I'm
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.520]   sure Windows 8, they've worked on it for a long time.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:33.640]   But then you've even got eBay's homepage redesign.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:38.840]   And so all the way, it's like a new design movement in terms of how people are displaying
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:44.120]   information that you can click on and you can kind of peg to things.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:48.560]   So Chad, if you pull up this All Things D article and you scroll down a little bit, we can
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:55.280]   see a couple examples of what the new Yahoo homepage will look like.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.000]   Just go down there a little bit.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.200]   So we're looking at something that looks like that.
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:03.320]   You kind of go, okay, well, you've still got that familiar Yahoo logo.
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:05.240]   It's a lot smaller.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:11.240]   Up in the upper left, you've got your categories, you've got your big tiles.
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:13.240]   I assume they'd be dynamic.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.960]   I don't know, maybe not.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:18.040]   They possibly changing possibly not.
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.720]   Of course, we're just looking at screenshots.
[01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.120]   I think it looks great.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120]   You like that?
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:25.600]   Yahoo is, you know, Martin, you say, I don't know, I don't really have a problem with Yahoo.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.600]   I don't have a problem with Yahoo either.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:32.160]   It's familiar, but it's also, it's, you know, it's, it has that age look.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.160]   It all really does.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.160]   It's not much.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:36.160]   It's just functional.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.160]   Sure.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.160]   It is now.
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.160]   I know where everything is.
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.200]   Well, it's not to say what you're doing now.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:42.200]   It's bad.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.160]   That's still why they have pretty good page views, you know?
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.160]   They still cut it off.
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.800]   I mean, it has crazy good page views.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.320]   Yeah, but they, but, but it doesn't really have the respect of, I don't know, a forward
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.240]   leaning community.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:44:01.080]   So design changes, obviously that's just one piece of, of, of all of the stuff that
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.080]   Yahoo has to work on.
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.080]   But I like it.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   I think it looks nice.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.080]   It looks fine.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.080]   Do you know what?
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:08.960]   Yeah, I would get used to it.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:12.080]   If they did this, it would take half a day.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:14.840]   You're like, oh, yeah, this is fine.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.920]   The only thing about this is that, and no, I don't, I don't know when they're rolling
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920]   it out.
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:25.520]   It looks like it's, it's being tested in a limited group of users.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:30.120]   They've got, like I said, a simplified logo, still that crappy logo, but it's simplified
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.880]   smaller.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.680]   More prominence for search, infinite scrolling, things that people like.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:42.760]   And it looks like they're testing redesigns and figuring out what sticks with folks before
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.480]   they flip it on for everybody else.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.880]   Speaking of flipping, I mean, it looks like flipboard.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.760]   It looks like Pinterest.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.840]   It looks like Windows 8.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.640]   As you mentioned, Martin, I just, we're kind of getting to that point where everything
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.040]   looks the same because it's a, it's a nice design.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.040]   It's pleasing to the eye.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.560]   It works really well right now.
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:03.840]   But I'm pretty sure in five years, we're all going to go, gosh, remember, we all did the
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.840]   tiles.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:05.840]   Everything was a square.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.640]   Do we really need tiles?
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.480]   Does everything have to be that easy?
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.800]   Well, I mean, that's my question.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:13.800]   Isn't this a fad?
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:14.960]   Is, is, is Yahoo as it is?
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:17.720]   Is it really, is it too complex for you?
[01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:18.800]   Is it giving you a headache?
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:20.520]   Are you having trouble figuring it out?
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:22.000]   No, it's, it's simple.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.120]   It works tiles.
[01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:26.480]   It's like, this is like what a baby could use.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:30.400]   Well, I'm sure Yahoo was fine with that.
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.000]   More page views, right?
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.920]   The baby's on the mobile.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.920]   No?
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:35.920]   No.
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.920]   Okay.
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:37.920]   You're, I don't know.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.760]   I, I think I get more excited about design changes than everybody else.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.160]   You're, you're at Yahoo right now.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:47.360]   I, I, I go to Yahoo specifically to do, I go to like news.yahoo.com.
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.360]   Sure.
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:53.360]   I find it actually more fulfilling than news.google.com unless I'm searching for news.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.360]   Right.
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.360]   Exactly.
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:57.480]   I like, they, they, they have editors and they have a lot of categories and they sort
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:58.480]   it fairly well.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:45:59.480]   Fairly well.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:01.960]   I think they're, they're not going to change the news site.
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.320]   If they did, then it basically would be a bunch of massive photos with captions that
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.320]   if you hover over it, it'll tell you the caption.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.440]   I don't know if that's the way I want.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.720]   Yeah, I doubt that they're going to change it here.
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.480]   I think that that's working just fine for them in terms of page views and everything.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:18.040]   I'm, yeah.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.120]   I'm all for new design ideas.
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:27.120]   Hey, do you either view use the app Waze sort of a crowd sourced traffic turn by turn
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:28.120]   solution?
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.720]   It's a very good one actually.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:34.640]   Why do you use that over Google Maps or, I mean, not to talk about Apple Maps, but why
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:38.360]   would you use it over the native apps in the smart, in the phone devices?
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:43.680]   I think a lot of people prefer Waze because they feel it has a more updated information
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.840]   on like accidents that are coming up because folks have contributed to that data.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:55.360]   So it has a lot more of a real time indication of, of how point, a point B is when to go.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.720]   I always thought that way seemed like a cool idea.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:01.360]   And for some reason, I also always thought that that wouldn't succeed because there's
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:03.880]   too much competition from the likes of a Google.
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:04.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:09.480]   And clearly, like they've been able to hold their own, a master own data and be able to
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:14.000]   provide an experience that these big wigs like Google can't match.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.000]   Right?
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.080]   I mean, do you use it over Google because it's better?
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:20.160]   Well, then I don't for explain.
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.560]   I don't know the ways of this ways of which you see.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.320]   Yeah, it's D-A-C-E, by the way.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:27.200]   Well, it's exactly that.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:28.760]   It is an alternative.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:31.640]   If you want to take a road trip, you're going to go down south.
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:32.880]   You're going to go down a Monterey.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.880]   You're going to go on Street.
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.240]   Yeah, super fun.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.240]   You've never been there before.
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.240]   Cannery Row.
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.240]   Let's go on the trip.
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:39.240]   Let's go.
[01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.240]   Yeah, you know, you don't have to get there.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:41.240]   How do I do it on Waze?
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:43.880]   Well, you would type in the directions and would tell you how to go.
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:44.880]   Okay.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:46.240]   And you have a turn-by-turn type thing.
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:47.920]   The reason that I'm talking about Waze.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:48.920]   Like Google Maps.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:55.360]   Waze has also experienced an influx of new users because of the Apple Maps fiasco.
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:00.040]   It's not the only company to enjoy a lot of users saying, "Yeah, I don't like Apple
[01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040]   Maps.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.040]   What are my other alternatives?"
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:07.880]   Apple, Tim Cook himself had suggested some other map alternatives if you're not actually
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:08.880]   happy with Apple Maps.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:14.320]   So you got a lot of Waze users in the company, has gone ahead and said, "Listen, it's time
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:15.320]   to monetize.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:21.000]   We got users and we are ready to figure out how to push ads towards those."
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.800]   They wanted to when you're driving by somewhere and they're going to say, "Hey, why don't you
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:24.800]   stop by and get a sandwich?"
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.800]   That's right.
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.120]   This place, the sandwich shop here, they're often a twofer.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:29.120]   Exactly.
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:31.120]   Or location.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:33.800]   We got a pop-up going on right here at the bait shop.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.600]   When I first heard about that, I was like, "Ah, first of all, that'd be the most annoying
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.600]   thing in the world.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.640]   If, for example, you're listening to turn-by-turn and it's an audio ad."
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:47.440]   I mean, that's extremely distracting and just invasive and blah, blah, blah.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.280]   But I don't actually think that that's really the point of it.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:58.400]   It's more of a, "If you had liked Whole Foods on Facebook, say, so weird and you know that
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:02.240]   you're like, 'That's a great brand,' then we'll be able to say, 'You're about to go
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:03.240]   buy Whole Foods.'
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.960]   And I'd be like, 'Cool, because they have this kind of juice.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:08.240]   I can't get anywhere else and we'll just get right off the road and here we are.'
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:12.400]   The only thing is that you have to be looking at the map as you go along, right?
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:15.920]   So that gets a little complicated.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:19.840]   So if I'm in the middle of my journey, maybe I've already pulled over, I look and I see
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.120]   my ways ad and I say, "Oh, okay, cool.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.000]   Whole Foods is pretty close."
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.920]   But if I am not and I'm continuing to drive, then that would be extremely dangerous for
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:33.200]   me to be looking at an ad when I'm trying to look at a map or driving.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:38.080]   But it'd probably make comfort you to touch your phone for the first time in a while
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:39.080]   you were driving.
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:41.520]   Yes, it would bring me great comfort.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:42.520]   Wait, wait.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:43.520]   Oh my God.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:44.520]   I got to pull over.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:45.760]   Why do you have to hold my phone when you do this?
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:47.600]   And you're holding upside down, by the way.
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:48.600]   You look like stupid.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:49.760]   I know it makes you nervous.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:50.760]   It does a little bit.
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:52.240]   You need your phone back.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.840]   Good thing I have all those pillowy stickers on the back case.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:55.840]   You drop it or something.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.840]   You want that?
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:57.840]   I don't.
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:00.960]   But I'd like you to stop putting your fingerprints all over it.
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:01.960]   That would be nice.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:02.960]   Oh my God.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:03.960]   Gosh, you're terrible.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:04.960]   You know what?
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:05.960]   Fine.
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:06.960]   Ways is monetizing.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.960]   They're not going to be able to get a new product.
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:10.960]   I don't know.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:16.040]   I still think they're going to five years from now an automobile manufacturer is going
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.920]   to license Google's self-driving car technology.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.360]   You're going to have that as an added feature in addition to the GPS was a little while
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.600]   back.
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.640]   And a company like Waze won't be able to put that.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:32.640]   Or they'll have enough information to supplement an existing map company's technology that
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.840]   they will get purchased by that.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.040]   I think it could be cool.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:41.240]   I would like it if I'm driving around or walking around or something like this.
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:46.400]   And it tells me that there's something of historical significance happen here.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:52.400]   Or this restaurant over here is offering a deal right now because between the hours
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:55.400]   of four and six it's happy hour or something like that.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:56.400]   I think that's fine.
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:58.880]   You get some of those types of because you love coupons.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:50:59.880]   I love coupons.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:00.880]   It's like your favorite thing.
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:05.840]   And you know, four square is already offering that type of those sorts of deals.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:06.840]   Depending on my location.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:08.320]   I could get value.
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.320]   Yes.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:10.320]   Absolutely.
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.320]   I'll be all over that.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.320]   Well, I know.
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:13.760]   Why don't tell you some of the stuff?
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:16.320]   Because I'm like, oh, he's going to go to a coupon binge.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.680]   He's going to be exploring on four squares.
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:22.320]   Do you have any idea how many unused groupons and bloom spots I have?
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.720]   I'll never be able to use them all.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.960]   I'll never be able to use them all before they explain.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:27.960]   Oh boy.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:33.440]   Yeah, before we wrap up this show, we do have one story that we have to talk about before
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.720]   we say goodbye.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:39.880]   We want to kick it over to Tom to find out what's going to come up on this week ahead,
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:40.880]   Tom.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:41.880]   Hey, thanks, Sarah.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:45.960]   Here's some of the things you'll be talking about on the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:50.120]   Sunday, November 11th, Techonomy kicks off in Tucson, Arizona.
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:54.280]   Looking ahead to Tuesday, November 13th, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 arrives.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:52:01.480]   The LG Nexus 4 hits 02 in the UK and the Nexus 10 will be available starting at $399.
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:06.040]   Wednesday, November 14th, Defrag happening for two days in Broomfield, Colorado.
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:12.000]   Thursday, November 15th, the rescheduled Facebook gift event in New York City and Friday, November
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.360]   16th, Desert Bus for Hope 6 kicks off.
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.560]   Let's look at some of the things we'll be talking about on Tech News today.
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:19.560]   Back to you.
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:20.560]   Tom, great.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:21.560]   Thanks, Tom.
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:23.120]   Tom was like, "Thanks, Sarah.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:27.680]   You're going to talk about this on Tech News today because Tom and I and I as in Jason host
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:28.680]   Tech News today.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:31.680]   I'm going to do Friday, 10 AM Pacific, such a good show."
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.680]   It is a good show.
[01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:33.680]   It's a really good show.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.680]   Tom, you're fantastic.
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:35.680]   You don't watch.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:36.680]   I know that.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:37.680]   Yes, I watch.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:38.680]   I don't think that's true.
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.400]   You know that I do because you see that I'm logging in from various advertising agencies.
[01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:43.400]   You've seen it.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:44.400]   I don't.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:45.400]   Yes, you have.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.400]   You've called me on it before.
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.400]   Well, that's true.
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:50.160]   You're not a very good hacker.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:52.840]   I'm not trying to pull an over idea.
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:56.200]   I can go to watch the show sometimes.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:57.200]   It's a good show.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.200]   You ask myself.
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:52:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:00.200]   Hey, we put together Monday through Friday's show.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.840]   I'm never watching it again.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.400]   Oh, well, maybe we don't need you.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:06.400]   Clearly.
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.400]   So a little over your head.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:11.640]   I think that this episode of Twit has proved that, didn't it?
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.120]   I don't need to be.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:18.200]   In fact, one of these last stories here might as well be our last story, really.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:19.200]   It's a good one.
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:22.880]   This is something that this is a Martin Sergeant.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.080]   It's truly a Martin Sergeant type of a story.
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:28.880]   Well, it's a public service as the holidays approach.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.080]   People you have to be careful when you're getting gas or you're in some dark parking
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:34.160]   lot somewhere.
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:39.840]   If somebody rolls up to you in a car and offers to sell you an expensive gadget for like a
[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:42.600]   quarter of the price, don't buy it.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:44.360]   Well, like this woman.
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.360]   Gelonta Freeman.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.360]   Gelonta Freeman.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.080]   She lives in Arlington, Texas.
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:49.560]   This is precisely what happened to her.
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:53.880]   She was getting gas with her mother and her sister.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:57.520]   And this guy rolls up and says, hey, I've got iPads here.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.720]   They're $800 machines.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.960]   I got to unload them for $200.
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.800]   Gelonta, would you buy it for me?
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:07.160]   And she said, that's a fantastic value.
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:08.160]   And she bought it.
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.840]   And it turned out she opened it up after the guy drove away because he had to get out
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.840]   of there really quick.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:13.840]   It was a mirror.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:17.720]   It was like one of those mirrors that you put in your locker and he put a sticker over
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.120]   it.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:21.400]   And this woman bought it.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.960]   I mean, I don't even wear these.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:24.960]   She does.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.800]   Gelonta, you deserve it.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:27.800]   Gelonta.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:29.800]   Gelonta.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.360]   You deserve that in shame on your mother and sister too.
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:33.800]   Well, geez.
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.560]   I mean, think of how bad she feels.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.720]   She must go look at, okay, look, so hold it right there.
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.280]   If you look at the video, the woman doesn't even have lenses in her glasses.
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:42.280]   How do you know that?
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:44.240]   Maybe she put some lenses in her glasses.
[01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:46.360]   She would have been able to tell that that was a fake iPad.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:49.080]   I don't think you can tell if there are lenses.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.320]   Maybe they're just very clean.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.320]   She's trying to look bookish.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320]   Oh, well.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:55.680]   I think you prove that you're not gelonta.
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:57.480]   Well, my goodness.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.240]   I didn't realize the story was going to take this type of a turn.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:04.880]   I didn't either.
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:05.880]   This is so sad.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:11.080]   I mean, the worst part about is like, is that it was a $200 mirror.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:15.040]   I want to start like a kickstarter to get her a real.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.520]   Now I feel terrible.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:22.080]   You probably could raise the money.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:27.600]   We start just like a kickstarter campaign.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.600]   Like what are the what are the creators yet?
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.600]   I don't know.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:31.760]   They all get iPads.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:35.400]   Well, gelonta is not the first women.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.760]   I don't get to mirror with an iPad.
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:40.160]   Maybe they really aren't lenses in her glasses.
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.400]   There aren't any lenses.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.640]   You probably brought those in a guest.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:46.120]   Now, hold on.
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:48.560]   Now people wear glasses because it's a cut.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.640]   They think it looks cool.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.840]   Sometimes glasses can be very face flattering.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:55.320]   Oh, it's poor woman.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:58.160]   She says, I bought a mirror.
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.160]   Gosh.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:04.200]   You know, South Carolina woman last year paid $180 for a wooden iPad.
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.800]   It was just made of wood.
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:06.800]   It wasn't an iPad.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.200]   Look at that diamond she's wearing.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.200]   That's right.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.440]   It's a mirror about the size of an iPad.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.680]   It's just reeks of local news too.
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:16.560]   Isn't this this is a local news story?
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:17.560]   I would never do it.
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:18.840]   I'd be like, they get a job.
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.040]   I just started casting.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.600]   I was I was like, say, like anybody will be.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.000]   She paid $200.
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.000]   That's good value.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.920]   I mean, $10 maybe.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:27.520]   I know she keeps the mirror.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.760]   Puts it up on the wall or something.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:29.880]   I think I hope she does too.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.720]   And I hope she looks in it every morning and says gelonta.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:35.280]   Don't be stupid no more.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:42.160]   Mirror, mirror on the wall.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.360]   Man, I'm not even going to say it.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.480]   All right.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.040]   All right.
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:54.280]   You know, this is this we have to stop the show before before it goes any farther into
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.080]   this weekend fun territory.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:59.040]   Well, all of a sudden the show got fun.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:00.840]   Nothing wrong with that.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:02.880]   Chad saying I have another promo.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:03.520]   We do.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.320]   We have what happened on the--
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.200]   I have no idea what you mean.
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:07.280]   Sorry.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.040]   At the top of the doc, but we have a we'd like to show what happened on Twitter.
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:13.040]   That last week.
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:14.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:15.040]   Oh.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.040]   Do you want to check that out?
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:17.040]   Yes, I do.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.160]   Let's see what happened on Twitter over the last week.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.160]   I bet it was good.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:22.160]   This is Twitter.
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.160]   So sorry.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.160]   And it's not W.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.160]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.160]   For what?
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:27.160]   Yes.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:28.160]   All right.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.600]   Comcast just ripped all the clothes off me and left me with nothing.
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.600]   Ha ha ha.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.680]   Tech TV has been absolutely ripped off.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:41.360]   There is no stench of clothing on what used to be Tech TV.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.400]   Now since Shane didn't make it.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:44.400]   All about Android.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:50.440]   If you had come to the studio today, you would have seen that we were ready to do.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:52.680]   In fact, let's just go ahead.
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:53.680]   Yes.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:54.680]   There we go.
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:55.680]   I think--
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.480]   I think this works.
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:57:59.480]   Windows Weekly.
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:01.960]   Does your mother call you a sexy beast?
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:02.960]   Yes.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   If she's trolling.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:06.960]   You think I'm a jerk?
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.360]   I'm the first generation jerk.
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:11.360]   No.
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:12.360]   Frame rate.
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:17.400]   Well, if it's a jerk move to reveal a twist ending, it's a jerk move to reveal any ending.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:20.760]   If it's a jerk move to reveal any ending, it's a jerk move to reveal the middle plot.
[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:24.200]   If it's jerk move to reveal the middle plot, it's a jerk move to reveal like any other
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:25.200]   plot.
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.400]   If it's a jerk move to reveal any implied, it's a jerk move to say anything about the
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:29.600]   movie at which point we can't talk.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:32.120]   So there's got to be a lot.
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:33.120]   Twit.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.280]   Broadcasting from the capital of the free world.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.280]   Petaluma, California.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:37.280]   Ha ha.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:38.280]   Wow.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.280]   That's it.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:40.280]   Awesome network.
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:43.280]   See what happens when Leo goes away?
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:45.280]   Yeah, we have a great week.
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.520]   That's our wonderful time.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:48.920]   No, that's the show that we saw you on.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:51.360]   But that wasn't this week.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.120]   That was like on Halloween.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.120]   It was on Halloween.
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:55.120]   Okay.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:56.120]   Well, okay.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:57.120]   And SFW.
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:58.120]   Last week-ish.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:58:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.120]   So recently recently.
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:01.120]   Recently.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.120]   Recently on Twit.
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:03.120]   Well, it was fun, Chad.
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.120]   Thank you for reminding me that we have this fun promo.
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:06.120]   It was fun.
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.120]   Thanks.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.120]   That we make.
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.800]   It works really hard on that too.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:11.680]   I think he's the one who's still doing it.
[01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:13.680]   I love hearing Jim Cutler too.
[01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:14.680]   You know that?
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.680]   Yeah, that's the voice.
[01:59:15.680 --> 01:59:16.680]   Sure.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:17.680]   Jim's great.
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:18.680]   I've used Jim in some of my ads.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:20.480]   Yes, he's an old tech TV voice.
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:22.520]   He's best in the business.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:25.520]   He also, he voiced an internet superstar.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:26.520]   He did.
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:27.520]   The opening.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:29.080]   And he did web drift or stuff.
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:30.320]   He's a great guy.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:37.960]   Well, so David Prager, before we wrap up, this episode of Twit, episode 379.
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:38.960]   Wow.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:40.480]   What's coming up in your world?
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:43.840]   You obviously talked at the end of the show that you've got your hands on quite a few
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:44.840]   projects.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:45.840]   You sound really busy.
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:50.000]   I'm hoping to launch Distort on Revision 3, new show.
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:55.080]   And then I'm hoping to build the audience of Toasted Donut, which is Revision3.com/ToastedDonut.
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.080]   It's a good show.
[01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:59.000]   Hoping to build the audience.
[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.400]   Just getting the word out, making good stuff.
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:05.320]   Well, we just signed a contract with Revision 3 since I'm not full-time there.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.320]   Oh, yes.
[02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.320]   Okay.
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.320]   So we're going to analyze Monday, Friday releases.
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.880]   We're going to change the show description because I didn't have a description.
[02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:14.680]   I said it was a show about nothing or whatever we want to talk about.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:18.680]   So we're going to try and set a few standards in there and by having predictable standards,
[02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:21.840]   hopefully have some consistency that drives the audience.
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:22.840]   It's great.
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:26.720]   Now that you don't work at Revision 3 full-time, does it feel weird to be entering into contracts
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.720]   with the full-time people who are still there?
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:30.880]   Is everybody still really good friends and nothing is too different?
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:31.880]   That was great.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.200]   I mean, obviously I'd done a bunch of the contracts that we had had with other content creators.
[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:36.720]   So I mean, it's the same contract.
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:38.320]   So it just sent me the same contract.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:41.600]   The contract that I drew up originally four years ago.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.600]   You're like, this contract is terrible.
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:44.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:45.600]   I remember this.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:46.600]   I just know.
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:47.600]   I just know.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.560]   Well, thanks so much for coming up and being part of the show.
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:51.560]   Thank you.
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:57.200]   Prager and Martin and I have all been buddies from 2001.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:01.920]   That's when I met you guys because that's when, yeah, that's when I got hired at Tech2B
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:05.240]   and it's fun that we're all still close.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:06.240]   Send me a tweet.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.480]   Send me a tweet at Martin Sargent.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.480]   Tell me, I want to do a show again.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.480]   Oh, no.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.480]   Okay.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.480]   We're going to do this week of fun.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:14.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.480]   Tell me what kind of show you'd like me to do.
[02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:16.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.040]   I mean, what else is, we said, hey, we've got time for this.
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.800]   We could do this.
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:23.920]   What else is new in your world when you got coming up?
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:25.920]   Well, I'm going to be starting a fun for Gelanta.
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:26.920]   Besides.
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:27.920]   You can hear an iPad.
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:30.680]   You're such a nice Samaritan.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:31.680]   And I don't know.
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:34.080]   I'm actually working on some cool stuff that I can't talk about.
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:35.080]   Honestly.
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:36.080]   I honestly can't talk about it.
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:37.080]   So why even say that?
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:38.080]   I know.
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.080]   You just want to leave us hanging.
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:40.080]   I want to make it intriguing.
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:41.080]   Well, it is.
[02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:42.080]   I'm intrigued.
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.840]   And by the way, Will Stuttler, I'm going to get you your shirt or something.
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:45.840]   I promise, man.
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:46.840]   I promise.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.400]   So that's all I want to say.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:49.400]   You heard it here, Will.
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:51.520]   Well, thank you to both of you for coming up.
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:52.520]   Thank you.
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:53.520]   Thank you.
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:54.520]   This was great.
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:55.520]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:56.520]   I had a really good time and thanks to Chad.
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:57.520]   You're such a good technical director.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:58.520]   Thank you.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.520]   You're the best in the biz.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.240]   There's no time for a shot of him that you can take or not.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:04.160]   I think they're probably just right.
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.560]   It's kind of far away, but here it is.
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.560]   There it is.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:08.560]   Yeah.
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.560]   How is he doing?
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:12.000]   We had a really nice live audience.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.560]   Yeah, we had a very attentive, wonderful audience.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:15.560]   Thank you.
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:20.600]   So if you were so polite, you made us feel right at home.
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.160]   But yeah, that's it for me.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:27.440]   Thanks to everybody who watched and listened live or otherwise.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.280]   And it was really fun to take over for Leo.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:35.680]   Father Robert Baliser is going to be our guest host next Sunday for the next episode
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:36.680]   of Twit.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:37.680]   That'll be great.
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:41.960]   He's the host of our newest show, one of our new shows this week in Enterprise Tech,
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:44.120]   also known as Twiit.
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:45.120]   Is he a priest?
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:46.560]   Yes, Jesuit priest.
[02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:47.560]   Wow.
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.560]   Yeah.
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.560]   Twiit.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:50.560]   Yeah.
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:51.560]   It's a really good show.
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:52.560]   It's doing well.
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:53.560]   People love it and he really knows what he's doing.
[02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.960]   So I know that he'll be a great host for this show as well.
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:56.960]   I know.
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:57.960]   Someone said thanks Dennis.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.000]   And there's a radio dude named Dennis Prager.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000]   There is.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.800]   Someone said thanks Dennis.
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.280]   Thanks Sarah, Marty Dennis.
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.040]   Do you think it was a slip or is he?
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.040]   No idea.
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:09.040]   Probably.
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.040]   He's probably like, yeah, Dennis Prager.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:11.040]   I love that guy.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:12.040]   All right, everybody.
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:18.960]   Thanks for watching and we'll see you next week on This Week in Tech.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:20.800]   I think you're supposed to see another Twiit is in the can.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.800]   Another Twiit is in the can.
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:22.800]   I never get there.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:23.800]   You're so right.
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:30.800]   I want a Twiit.
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:32.300]   - See you in the Twitter. - Alright.
