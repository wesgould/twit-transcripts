[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.680]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.680]   The show that covers the week's Tech News.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   This is the analysis show.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   You may want the daily news, the day-to-day news information.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.680]   Of course we've got Tech News today with Tom Merritt.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   But every week, every Sunday we get down, we sit down, we talk.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680]   We just thought of as kind of a hot stove kind of a conversation where you kind of say,
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   "Well what about and how about them?" and that kind of thing.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   And of course that's why we bring in this guy, John C. Devore, Act of War Act Auto Exhaust Blog.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   He is the king of the hot stove tech commentary.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   Yeah, I got nothing else to do.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   No, but it's good.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   It's fun.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680]   And flannel suits you.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.680]   Flannel is my new, is the new silk.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   Well, I think in the summer you should wear those beach boys shirts you were wearing.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.680]   And in the winter you could wear a plaid flannel.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   It's cold out.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   It is cold.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   And it's raining.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.680]   And it's very rainy.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   And that's what made me think of the hot stove thing.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   Just the cracker barrel.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   Crackle barrel.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680]   The pickles.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   Yeah, the play a little check.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.680]   Eating pickles.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.680]   Eating pickles.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680]   That kind of thing.
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.680]   Tim Stevens is here.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.680]   He's the urban, urbane urbainite here from Engadget.com, Editor-in-Chief there.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   Do you live in New York City, Tim?
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.680]   Actually I don't.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   I'm way up in the country out around Albany, New York.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   So I'm actually out in the middle of nowhere myself.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   Oh, well never mind.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   You understand cracker barrel better than anybody.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   I do.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   There are many cracker barrels around here.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.680]   There are many, many different restaurants.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   There's an actual restaurant.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680]   Called the cracker barrel.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   And they have all sorts of memorabilia on the walls.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.680]   Where does all of those restaurants that do that?
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   TGI Fridays and all the ones with the flair.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680]   Flair.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.680]   Is there a company that churns duck decoys and old advertising signs out for these?
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   They can't possibly be.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   eBay.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680]   That much stuff that they could--
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   There are three factory for cracker barrel to make that stuff.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   And you can buy anything up the wall.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   If you see something that you like, you can just point at it and the waitress will pull
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   it off for you.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   And so too if you want to--
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   And then they have more in the back room.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   Absolutely.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   Okay.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   See, I thought these can't be real antiques because there can't be that much.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   Now I understand.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   It's cracker barrel slash pick and pay.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.680]   Now we're appealing to the rural folks.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   And now believe it or not, Mike Elgin is back with us.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.680]   The last time we spoke to Mike Elgin, he was in the Peloponnese in Greece studying up the
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680]   Spartan diet.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.680]   And he's moved on to Nairobi, Kenya.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.680]   Hello, Mike Elgin.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.680]   Hello.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.680]   Thank you for having me on.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680]   What a great connection.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.680]   So you've got good internet up there.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.680]   And I have-- I'm staying with my cousin here.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   It's a beautiful house in a lovely area.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   And it's fantastic.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   We've been here two weeks.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   Are you going to stay there for a while?
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.680]   Because we should explain that for those who don't know, Mike has kind of done this court
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.680]   cutting thing.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   But instead of cutting off the cable companies, cutting off the entire United States of America.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.680]   Yeah, no offense.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.680]   Fellow Yankees.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.680]   Nothing wrong.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.680]   America.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   It's-- no, I'm a digital nomad or a better win or whatever you call it.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.680]   But basically, because I write for living and my work is literally location independent,
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   it doesn't matter where I am, I live in different countries for a few months and then move to
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   another country just for the hell of it.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.680]   As John was saying before, we started rolling the show just to prove a point and also to
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.680]   have a lot of fun.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   So yeah, I'm in Kenya now for probably another couple, three months and maybe more.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.680]   It's actually really awesome here.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680]   I really like Kenya.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.680]   You don't need-- you don't have an itinerary then.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.680]   You don't say like, oh, well, by January, we've got to be somewhere.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.680]   You can be anywhere you want any time you want.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   It's pretty vague.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.680]   I hope to go to Mobile and Wireless in Barcelona early next year.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.680]   That's a great event.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   So probably go to Spain next just to do that.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.680]   And I may try to hit certain shows if it kind of works out.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   But no, we don't have an agenda at all other than the fact that we want to live in France,
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   we want to live in Spain, we want to live in India.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.680]   There's a bunch of places where we really like to live and we intend to do that.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.680]   So it's really working out great.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.680]   And it's funny because I kind of did this for about four months back in 2008.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.680]   And now it's a whole new world with Skype working as well as it does with Google+ Hangouts,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680]   with social media.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   There's just no reason to be stuck in a house if you don't have to be.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   I've noticed that travel has really changed.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   Well, first time I went to Europe as a kid in 1967, you couldn't get baseball scores.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.680]   You had to wait till the Herald Tribune came out the next day and you'd get the baseball score.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   And even the beverages were a little weird.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.680]   They didn't have Coke.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.680]   And they had this funny-sized cans.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.680]   Yeah, they had Africola.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.680]   It was foreign.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680]   Now they got Coke.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.680]   Now it just really feels like it's all the same.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   We've a little bit homogenized now.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   You'd see a lot of people with cell phones.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   And this is a country where you have the whole range of people from destitute poverty all the way up to pretty
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   wealthy.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.680]   And the first, if they get anything before they get a computer, before they get a calculator,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.680]   before they get a digital watch, they'll get a cell phone.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.680]   And Kenya is actually pretty advanced.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   They have mobile payments.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.680]   Almost everybody pays for stuff with cell phones around here.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   That's actually an interesting story because there is a company that people don't, in the
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.680]   U.S., have never heard of that is huge in this space, much bigger than PayPal.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.680]   What is the name of it?
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   They do global payments.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.680]   I'm sure they're big in Kenya.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   Yeah, I don't know the name.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   I haven't gotten a local phone yet, but it's, I've just been observing that everybody is using this thing
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.680]   to pay.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   And it's, as far as I can tell, in most reasonable stores, I mean, not talking about the roadside
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.680]   stands and stuff like that, but the stores all, you know, it's more common than cash.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.680]   And in fact, so much so that there are even people who have, I know this is the case in Africa
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.680]   and some other areas in India, probably too, who have cell phones who don't have regular
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   power.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   So they will go to a vendor to plug in their phone, street vendor, plug in their phone to
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.680]   power it up.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680]   Is it M-Pesa?
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   Is that the one?
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.680]   I think that's it.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680]   M-P-E-S-A.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   Somebody said.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.680]   Thank you in the chat room.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   This company is massive.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   I think this thing's dead in the water, Mike, machine.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.680]   And we'll get your machine online.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.680]   Sorry about that, John.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.680]   Tim, are you, do you go to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona every year?
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   I bet you do.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.280]   I don't personally, but we do send a big team there for sure.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.680]   It's getting bigger every year, and this year should be really big.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   They're moving to a new venue, and it sounds like it's going to be a major, major event,
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   so we'll be covering it, but I don't think I'll personally be getting it.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.680]   Yeah, it struck me last year that we should have been there.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.680]   That's where Windows Phone 8 was announced.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.680]   With great fanfare, a bunch of new Android phones.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.680]   It seems to be that is the most right now vital conference, even maybe more so than CES.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680]   You should cover it.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.680]   I think we should.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   You've done it so much.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.680]   You've done it so much for sure.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.680]   Yeah, and Barcelona is great.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.680]   That's why you want to go there, because you want to go there.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.680]   I didn't say I wanted to go, but I would.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.680]   You're inviting me?
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.680]   Is that what the deal is?
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   Sure.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   You could be our Barcelona.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.680]   We sent you to Spain last year, didn't we?
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.680]   That's for Madrid.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   Madrid.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680]   Yeah, wasn't that fun?
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   Barcelona.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   Now, isn't Barcelona...
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   We have Ford, Lorna's one of those little cars.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.680]   We could do it.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.680]   M-Pesa comes from M for mobile Pesa, Swahili for money.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   It's a micro-financeing service for Vodacom and SafariCom, the largest mobile network operator
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   in Kenya and Tanzania.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   It is the most developed mobile payment system in the developing world.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   It's huge.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   It's actually taken over banking for lots of the undeveloped world.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   M-P-E-S-A.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   So, 9 million customers as of late 2009, 40% of Kenya's adult population.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   That must be the one you're seeing.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   Mike.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.680]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   And I'm almost sure certain that it is.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   Somebody in the chat room asked what the OS is that people are using on their phones.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.680]   And that's the interesting thing about it.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.680]   It's almost all feature phones here.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.680]   Right.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.680]   And also Turkey and also Greece.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   I've been kind of shocked in this whole thing to see the number of people who have feature
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   phones that don't have smartphones yet.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   Yeah, but their days are numbered.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.680]   Well, and exactly why companies like Google and Apple are looking with great interest to
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   the rest of the world is huge opportunity for them.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.680]   And I think actually Android probably has an advantage.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   They're what is it?
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.680]   Maybe Tim, you understand this.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.680]   Why did RIM just gain a huge amount in the stock market?
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   Is there suddenly a bullishness over Blackberry 10?
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.680]   I haven't heard anything particularly recent.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.960]   I know that they are definitely talking to a lot of international carriers to do a big
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   role by launch.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.840]   And I know that in developing nations like Kenya, this big part of where they want to
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.480]   be a player over the next year.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.680]   But no, there hasn't really been any recent revelations.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.080]   And I don't think we're going to be hearing much of anything until their big January 30th
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.600]   announcement when we finally see the full retail hardware devices and get the full details
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   on when they're going to ship the things.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.400]   I think an analyst boosted his recommendation, the stock market listens to these guys.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:32.320]   And apparently there is a contrarian theory that if RIM can just convince its existing
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.160]   customers to stick around for a little while, that when Blackberry 10 comes out, they might
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.560]   actually not only keep their existing customer base, which is still pretty decent, but also
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.200]   start to win over iPhone and Android users.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.400]   Yeah, they're crazy.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.200]   Have you seen Blackberry 10?
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   It does sound nuts.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   No, it does not.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   Have you seen Blackberry 10?
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   I spent quite a bit of time with it.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   It's a great operating system.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   It looks really nice.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.800]   I'd say it's right up there with the best of them as far as usability goes.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.360]   And the intuitiveness has got amazing gesture control.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.640]   You can really quickly jump from a meeting appointment to a conference bridge to directions
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   to your next meeting.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.040]   It's all really intuitive and nice, but I don't know that it's quite enough to pull
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   people in.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.720]   But like you said, RIM still got a very strong base.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.560]   And interestingly, that base isn't really shrunken.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.880]   It's just that the market has grown so much.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.000]   RIM hasn't been growing or RIM's user base hasn't been growing enough to keep up with
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So it looks like they're shrinking.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.520]   They're more or less flat for them.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.320]   So next year is going to be very interesting for them for sure.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.160]   It looks fantastic, though, for sure.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.640]   I just don't know that it's enough to topple iOS and Android.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   Right.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:40.280]   On Thursday, they jumped to over 12 bucks from 11 bucks, a huge increase.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.800]   One of those things.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.480]   You see the stock price, boom, like that.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   But and all because of this analyst, they were as low as $6.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.080]   Which analyst was it?
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.080]   It's a quick doubleer.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   Get out, sell now.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.080]   Double the money.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.600]   And you mentioned anything to PR Web this week per chance.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   That's quite a story, too.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.320]   We're going to get to that in a little bit.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.840]   Boy, I'm not using I'm not following PR Web anymore.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.680]   I didn't know this story.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.000]   Oh, you haven't seen this one?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   No.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Maybe we should.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I'll tell you what, let's take a break and we'll get to it.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.680]   It was a rumor that Google was buying a company called Icoa for $400 million.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.880]   Well, I did hear this.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880]   You heard that rumor.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:30.680]   I doubt that that came from a PR Web press release that was purchased by speculators in
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.960]   this Icoa stock.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.240]   And the whole point was to run up the stock price.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.240]   Oh, pump and dump.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.240]   Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   I love it.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.800]   The problem is the problem is caused by a PR Web.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.960]   Do you want some jewelry?
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.960]   What do you got there, Leo?
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   I got some jewelry.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.520]   So for the new advertiser?
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   It's not new.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.280]   We do this every holiday season because we know that our geeks do not know what to do
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.440]   for their ladies in their lives.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.120]   I know exactly what I did.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.160]   I got you a surge suppressor.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   I hope you like it.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   Exactly.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   What's wrong with that?
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   You know, you really ought to have a surge suppressor.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   You should.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   Your home theater.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.320]   And I got you one.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.600]   So I'm going to tell you something.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.560]   Ladies don't want surge suppressors.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.440]   Is that right?
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   They want.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.240]   They want to be dripping in jewels.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.640]   How would you like that?
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.160]   And I'll tell you where we said, oh, this is a nice piece.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   Look at that.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.920]   Those are real products, by the way.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.920]   You put a few ports in it?
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.920]   No.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.360]   That's what it's for.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.880]   So ice, I want to send you to ice.com/twit.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.760]   Ice is a great place to buy jewelry.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.880]   And I can vouch for that.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.680]   Really gorgeous stuff at a very affordable price.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.840]   And we have a special 25% offer.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.080]   Actually, why don't you show the video?
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.280]   Because we shot some nice video of this jewelry.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.760]   I just wanted to show John.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.760]   These are beautiful rings.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.560]   I'll give you some examples.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.480]   25% off.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.840]   It is a black diamond rose gold over sterling silver.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   Actually, that one.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.840]   It's a little black diamond there.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840]   No, what is that?
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.760]   I don't know what the earrings--
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.000]   and this is none of the stuff I know anything about.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.480]   It's horrible.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.760]   We just have pictures of earrings.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.080]   Watch out QVC.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.160]   Guaranteed delivery by Christmas for any order
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.520]   placed by December 19.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.240]   25% off most items.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.760]   Some restrictions do apply.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.880]   If you go to ice-- there it is.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.160]   That's the one I was talking about.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   Get it in focus, Tony.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.240]   Are you going to start taking calls from customers?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:20.760]   No.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.280]   That is a black diamond rose gold over sterling silver
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.320]   heart pendant with chain.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   How much would you pay for that?
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.000]   It's $95, normally $71 with a twit discount.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.480]   How about that?
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.120]   How about-- look at those.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.800]   The hoop earrings, quarter carrot, diamond, $14k pink gold.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.840]   I love that.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.320]   Normally, $475 are twit holiday price, $356.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.800]   This is all at ice.com.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.720]   We also have pearls.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.960]   These are cultured freshwater, pearl, and diamond.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.160]   So this is not junk jewelry.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.000]   White gold ring.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.040]   No, no, it's nice.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.800]   But it's very affordable.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.600]   $195, normally $146 for our twit audience.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.080]   Again, free--
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.840]   Knock on my finger.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.160]   Yeah, I have to take it home.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.720]   Go ahead.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.240]   You can.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.880]   No, no, actually, I think we have to send this back.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.680]   Yeah, never mind.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.160]   There's a lot of jewelry in here, though.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   Look at these hoops.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.640]   I think my wife would go for this as her color.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.240]   No, this is--
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.280]   This is saving me a--
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.400]   So here's the point.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.880]   There's a big range of prices on here.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.600]   So you can get something you can afford.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   What?
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.120]   My wife's color.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.760]   That's big.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.440]   Is that her color?
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.080]   It's amethyst, right?
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.560]   Oh.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.800]   Beautiful.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.320]   Look at this.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.640]   Should Mike and I just pick our favorite
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.440]   and you'll ship it to us?
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.040]   I'll ship it all.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.840]   I'll ship it all right out to you.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.320]   That'd be great.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.280]   I'm still Christmas shopping.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.720]   So any help you can provide would be very appreciated.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.560]   We do this every year.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.680]   And I think we're going to do next year
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:38.400]   is like a whole little shopping segment.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.640]   We're not going to sell anything.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.920]   We're not going to sell anything on here.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.040]   Actually, we are going to sell something.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.320]   I'm going to show you something else we're selling.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.000]   Anyway, that's ice.com/twit.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.880]   Free guaranteed delivery in time for Christmas.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.160]   If you ordered for now through December 19th
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.680]   and 25% off most items, it's very easy.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.120]   If she doesn't like it, it's very easy to return it.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.000]   She can pick something else.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.280]   Very simple to do.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.400]   I am a big fan.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.160]   Ice.com/twit.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.600]   Let me show you what we are selling though in our store.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.240]   I haven't showed you this yet.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.200]   How do you like these, John?
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.080]   Twit mugs.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:10.720]   This is--
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.040]   You've always had twit mugs.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.440]   We've always had them, but this is the first time
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.240]   we've had these with the colored gear logo.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.160]   No, these are nice, yeah.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.920]   They're pretty, and the insides match the orange.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920]   And now there's two for that.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.440]   We don't see any on the set.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.640]   We don't have any.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.960]   They haven't made any.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.920]   You're doing this on spec.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.760]   Well, it did--
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.520]   Believe it or not, we've already sold 173,
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.560]   and all we had to do is sell 100.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.120]   But they're printing them now.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.160]   Every batch of 100 and other set will go out.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.120]   So if you order now, you'll get it into the second set.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.400]   $20 for two mugs.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.760]   You have the 16 ounce or the 9 ounce.
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.760]   But now that--
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.160]   Do you see the spoon mug?
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.880]   What do you-- is that a good idea?
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.480]   The spoon mug.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.760]   The spoon goes in the handle.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.920]   That's lame.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.080]   That's what I thought.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.880]   The girls love it.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.920]   Everybody here--
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.720]   Why?
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.760]   I don't know why.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.280]   All the guys said no.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.880]   Maybe it's a sexual innuendo.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.000]   No, it's not that.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.880]   It's the cup is a perfect spoon holder.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.120]   It's already built in it.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.880]   It's called a cup.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.480]   And then that gets in the handle.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.520]   But apparently--
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.760]   Don't you poke yourself in the eye when you drink from it?
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.800]   Yeah, I was going to say, I think
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.800]   that's what they were talking about.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.120]   And they say, gag your eye out with a spoon.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.520]   I think that's what the parents say to this.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.800]   It looks very practical other than that.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.120]   If you drink very carefully, you can wear eye protection.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.280]   Anyway, two mugs for $20, very affordable.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.040]   I don't know what this is.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.240]   We're trying to raise money for something.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.360]   But at least it hasn't told me what yet.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.200]   Another trip to Australia is my guess.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.360]   It could be payroll.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.920]   I don't know.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.400]   Payroll.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.000]   Go to the address for this is T-W-E-Spring.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.800]   tespring.com/twitmugs.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.840]   And this is a seven day offer.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.240]   So that's why I'm mentioning it now.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.040]   It runs out in one week.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.360]   So do not waste any time ordering.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.280]   These are John Closure Ears.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.560]   These are the gifts we're going to give the Twit hosts.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.200]   And so we thought, oh, we should offer--
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.960]   we were getting these made for the Twit hosts.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.920]   And we thought, oh, we should offer these for sale as well
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.000]   on the T-Spring site.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.400]   So these are the Twit gift hosts Christmas presents.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.080]   Sit.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.720]   Now you can listen.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.720]   Is the apple-- is it working?
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.520]   The mac?
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.760]   Yes.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.200]   Yes, he's working now.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.440]   That looks good on you.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.560]   He's got two rings in the pink gold.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.320]   You look like Jack Benny when you do that.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.160]   Oh, man.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.920]   Yep.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.040]   I've come to save the show.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.400]   All right.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.640]   So PRWeb, which is--
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.640]   everybody knows PRWeb and PRNewswire, right?
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.320]   These are two different companies
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.680]   that you can take--
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.200]   if you have a press release--
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.520]   There's Business Wire.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.840]   Business Wire is another one.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.400]   If you have a press release, you give them the press release
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.440]   and you pay them, right?
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.320]   Let me describe it a little more accurately.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.600]   If you can't get any-- you could write a press release.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.560]   You can't get anybody in the world to pick it up
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.160]   because you've got no mailing list
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.120]   and you're an incompetent bonehead.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.680]   You give it to these people and give them money
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.240]   and then they put it on their wire service
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.080]   and then nobody picks it up anyway.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.000]   Well, that was what I thought.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.920]   But it turns out that many news outlets
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.240]   use press releases from PRWeb, including Google News.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.800]   And so, in fact, that's what's happening,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.640]   is that these are getting picked up
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.520]   and you could put, it turns out, a spurious news release
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.600]   on PRWeb.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.320]   Tim, is that what happened with Icoa?
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.960]   I love it.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.400]   Press release went on PRWeb and we saw it
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.360]   and we were looking into it and then we saw it
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.480]   at the next web, threw it up.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.280]   So we went ahead and did the same.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.840]   You put it on that gadget?
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.240]   We did.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:33.720]   We did so.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.560]   Oh!
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.060]   Oh!
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.000]   No, they're not alone.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.600]   They're not alone.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.520]   Everybody did.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.000]   I didn't.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.080]   Lots of people did as well.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.680]   You're not a news outlet.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.040]   I am too.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   Very shame to myself.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.120]   The funny thing is that if you have the bottom of the barrel
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.360]   package with PRWeb, it doesn't go on Google News
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.920]   unless you upgrade to the $199, $199 package.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.840]   And then it just automatically goes on Google News.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.440]   But the thing is, PRWeb is one of them,
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.080]   the other one you mentioned.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.000]   There's like half a dozen of these things.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.960]   And if you just scan through their daily press releases,
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.920]   each of these companies sends out somewhere between 10
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.280]   and 150 press releases a day.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.160]   And half of them are just garbage.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.680]   Like somebody will do a vanity book or something like that
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.800]   and just write their own press release,
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.160]   put it on there, pay $149 and out it goes.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.400]   And it's just the fact that it's showing up anywhere
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.320]   other than on these sites is just an example
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.000]   of the shoddiness of journalism and the sort
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.320]   of abandonment of any sort of editorial filter on anything.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.600]   Well, but it's a problem because I get a lot of email
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.400]   from publicists.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.480]   I don't know if I get anything from these guys,
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.040]   but I get a lot of email from publicists.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.080]   Because mostly because of the radio show,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.320]   so we're on every list in the world.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.880]   It's so funny because they often offer me tech experts.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   It's always hilarious.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.600]   Would you like somebody to come on your show and comment
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.480]   about how viruses are ruining everything?
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   And they obviously are paying no attention
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.680]   to who they're sending it out to.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.200]   Right.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.040]   What's the point?
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.680]   But I get them all.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.440]   And obviously, Tim and Gajid--
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.360]   no, is Engajid subscribed to PR Web?
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.360]   Or is it just show up in the inbox?
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.120]   We have a variety of tools for tracking different outlets.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.680]   And PR Web, we follow, I believe, is through RSS, actually.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   So we were seeing the PR through that.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.800]   We were doing the investigation.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.480]   We saw a pop up on a few other sites.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.720]   And we made the erroneous assumption
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.880]   that those other sites had done the verification.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.200]   And we all know what happens when
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.240]   it one makes an assumption.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.920]   And of course, we will never make such an assumption again.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.880]   In fact, there was another acquisition that came out
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.400]   on PR Web later that week that we, of course,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.360]   ignored until we were able to verify it ourselves this time.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.120]   But yeah, that's exactly what happened when on PR Web,
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.840]   a few people went ahead and pulled the trigger
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.400]   without making the right phone calls.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.840]   And then that ultimately led to the steam roll of everybody
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.080]   else doing the same thing.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.280]   Sadly, ourselves included.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.240]   And a lot.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   So did you change your policy on that?
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.880]   As a result?
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.480]   We should actually press release and announce that.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.880]   Yes, if only I knew where to go ahead and push that.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.360]   Yeah, $199.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.560]   That's all.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:05.080]   OK.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   $499.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.840]   But that's cheap.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.240]   If you hired a publicist--
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:08.800]   Oh, yeah, no.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.520]   How much is a publicist a month?
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.880]   You must have had that publicist from time to time.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.480]   I've never had a publicist.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.440]   You don't need a publicist.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.160]   You're a self-promoting maniac.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.760]   A lot of companies will pay between--
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.640]   I think that's $1,500 a month, something like that.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.880]   No, it's a lot more than that.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.560]   More than that.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.960]   You're generally about $5,000 a month for starters.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.040]   And do they make any guarantees?
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.360]   They say, we're going to get you on Regis.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.640]   They start doing that, and you've got a phony, usually.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.600]   They can't promise anything.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.320]   No.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.640]   There are actually-- actually, there's one guy in Marin County.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.080]   I still think he's up there who used to do it on a fee base.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.120]   So you'd hire him, and then he had his little fee list.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.600]   So if he got you in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.720]   then you owed him $10,000.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.600]   That's worth it.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.080]   If he got you into--
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.000]   That's worth it.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:50.920]   Sometimes.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.320]   If you get in live with Kelly, that's 4 million people.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.080]   We'll see your product.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.520]   That's huge.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.020]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.600]   And what product were you selling there?
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.600]   I never sell products.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.800]   It is a mistake.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.880]   You should have the mugs for sale.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.400]   You know, they told me--
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.880]   I started doing that in 2001.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.400]   Tech TV set that up, right?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.800]   And I've been doing it since then.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.840]   So I would go on and show gadgets.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.800]   And I was going to wear--
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.360]   Tech TV actually had made for me a bunch of sleeveless sweater
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.040]   vests with the Tech TV logo on it.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.680]   Like, I would wear that crap.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.080]   But I did.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.080]   I brought it out there, and I asked--
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.360]   Gellman said, you can't wear that.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.320]   What do you mean I can't?
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.600]   I'm the Tech TV--
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.560]   he's-- no, no, sorry.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.920]   No, they're really freaky about it.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.480]   They won't let you do that.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.040]   I went on-- I was almost on one of the Bravo shows.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.400]   I was just-- I wasn't on it.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.360]   But I was one of the guys on the set doing stuff
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.080]   that they were filming.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.840]   And I knew they were going to do this.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.600]   So I wore a no agenda t-shirt.
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.800]   And they just were not putting up with that.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.080]   Yeah, they don't want you to do that.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.120]   No.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.640]   Anyway, so this PR web thing-- now PR web, in theory,
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.760]   vets these, right?
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.560]   I mean, because otherwise this really would be--
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.080]   No.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   What were they--
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.920]   A cesspool because anybody who wants to pump and dump
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   a sock--
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   Yeah, well--
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   Who just put out a press for this cheese--
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.840]   I think this is a new idea for pumping dump.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.160]   It is a cesspool.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.600]   And it is already-- he's right.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.200]   It's already a cesspool.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.640]   And this was some clever guy, new idea for pumping dump,
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.480]   and it was genius.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.000]   It worked.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.440]   Won't work again, probably, but it worked once.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.160]   No, it won't work again.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.680]   PR web issued a press release.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.040]   In which they said, we have since
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.560]   learned that that was a fraudulent press release from ICO.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.480]   The release was not issued or authorized by ICO.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.360]   Vocus, which is the parent company, PR web,
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.160]   reviews all press releases and follows an internal process
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.440]   designed to maintain the integrity of the releases
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.560]   we send out each day.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.320]   Apparently, an internal process that doesn't, in fact,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.960]   involve calling the company issuing the press release.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.200]   Even with reasonable safeguards, identity theft occurs.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.960]   Oh, maybe-- OK, so maybe it came from an address at ICO.com
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.600]   or something like that.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.400]   Maybe that was what they--
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.600]   Probably some phishing--
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.320]   That's easy to do.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:57.960]   You can do that.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:58.480]   I can do that.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.280]   I can send out an address from any email from any address I want.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.760]   We have removed the fraudulent release,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.160]   turned the matter over to the proper authorities.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.360]   The police for further investigation.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.240]   Danny Sullivan has a great analysis on search engine land,
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:19.640]   and in which he effectively implies that PR web not only
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.560]   doesn't have a check, but in fact does this all the time.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.880]   For instance, he points out a press release that comes out
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.200]   monthly from your best pills online.com.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.600]   It's a press release titled, How to Buy Drugs,
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.360]   Lowest Price Viagra, Vi Levitra Viagra, Online Pills
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.040]   Store.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.600]   And it has a completely bogus text.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.440]   And the reason they do this is because--
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.440]   this is the PR web-- all the places you'll go
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.680]   want to see where your news is going.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.800]   Look no further, major search engines associated press.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.440]   And what happens is if you now do a Google search
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.440]   on this particular press release, you'll
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.960]   see, for instance, the Houston Chronicle
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.240]   is republishing press release.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.960]   Isn't that they have a special page?
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.400]   It's the Houston Chronicle PR web page.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.160]   But this now gets published.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.440]   Yeah, this is ridiculous.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:08.960]   This is going on to--
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.800]   On a newspaper website, it also shows up--
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.400]   This is the clean advertising inventory.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.400]   And of course--
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.880]   And of course, quite a few legitimate companies use PR web
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.440]   as well.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.520]   And BD, for example, sends out their releases through PR web.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.640]   And of course, that's a well-known company.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.600]   Those are legitimate.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.360]   So that just means the owner says, of course, on us now,
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.480]   as it should be, to be verifying these things,
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   to make sure that they're correct.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.160]   But hopefully, we'll be seeing some companies maybe
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.440]   shifting away from PR web.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.040]   And maybe we'll see the other options,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.160]   or you mentioned before, being a little bit more strange
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.880]   in NPR web as well.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.360]   And it also led me to do a little digging.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.080]   And in fact, you can turn off press releases in Google News,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   which you might want to do.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.600]   Nice.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.880]   If you're in news.google.com, which I use,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.960]   I like Google News.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.400]   There's a Settings button by the sources.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.240]   And look at this.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.320]   There's apparently a setting.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.760]   Personalized Google News, reflect your taste and publishers.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.240]   Do you want press releases?
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.680]   It's normally normal.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.120]   You could turn that off.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   You can also--
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.040]   You could put more.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.560]   You could put more.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.240]   Can I get only press releases?
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:11.600]   Yes.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.160]   Yeah, you could.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.440]   You could turn off--
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.680]   Turn off blogs and turn on press releases.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.360]   And that's going to be a great feed for you.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.160]   You're going to find lots of stocks you might want to invest in.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.920]   What's sad is that they include blogs, as well as press
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.240]   releases in that setting.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.760]   You can add sources, but you cannot--
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.080]   I don't think you can remove sources.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.280]   So you couldn't manually say no more PR web.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   But at least you could say no more press releases.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.200]   And I immediately did that to Michael Will News feed.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.480]   I didn't want to get any more of those.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.040]   There's a virtue in there somewhere with Google.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.760]   They're trying not to exert editorial control over what's
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.280]   legitimate and what isn't.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.240]   And they're giving you the tools, if you're savvy enough,
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.480]   to go in there and make that decision.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.000]   But really, there's no good answer to this kind of thing.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.840]   When you talk about blogs, I actually
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.920]   wanted to get my blog to post on Google News years ago.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.960]   And their criteria for what's news and what's not a news
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.240]   worthy blog is how many people are involved.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.240]   So apparently, if you have one person doing the book--
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.040]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.040]   That's not legit.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.760]   If you have two, then they'll post it on Google News.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.160]   At least that was the case a few years ago.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.000]   I don't know what it is now.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.280]   And I thought that's kind of a weird criteria.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.040]   But what else are you going to use if you're Google and you
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.280]   want to sort of have a hands-off approach on what's news
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.000]   and what isn't?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.520]   Well, while we're on the topic, I usually
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.240]   don't talk about no agenda stuff on this show.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.000]   But I did discuss this because it was a news item
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.200]   that I thought was interesting.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.920]   If you go to Google and type in, give frozen P's, P-E-A-S,
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.120]   a chance, you get two articles.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.760]   Because my wife called me and she's moaning about this.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.520]   Dr. Oz wrote an opedfortime.com.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:00.000]   And the oped is word for word the same as the top hit,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.240]   which is this give frozen piece of chance and cares to
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.200]   with the same art from this Dr. Nick Guel.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.360]   You can see who's stealing from whom.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.360]   I don't think there was stealing.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.920]   I think these were both planted articles from some PR
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.760]   company that were given exclusives.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.560]   And one guy said-- I thought I had the exclusive.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:15.920]   Right.
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.640]   You know about this, Mike, whereas these companies will say,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.160]   yeah, we wrote a piece for you.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.240]   You can run it.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.800]   You can use your own buy line if you want to.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.600]   And they don't even change a word of it.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.320]   And you just run it under your own buy line.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.080]   And it goes out there.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.760]   And everybody thinks that you wrote this thing.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.440]   But in this case, two guys did it the same time.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.160]   That's bizarre.
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.680]   And you have to--
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.920]   I think it's the frozen P council of America.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   I think it's frozen foods.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.600]   Frozen-- because this is about frozen foods.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.760]   I think it's about frozen food.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.480]   And they make it sound like some article that sounds like
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.840]   somebody did write it.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.440]   But both of these doctors live in a vegetarian household.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.400]   I mean, it's unbelievable that Time Magazine--
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.440]   Talking about these--
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.900]   You guys possible that the other articles stole Dr. Oz's
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.400]   book.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.280]   They both came on simultaneously.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.280]   And I don't think so.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.080]   That's interesting.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.600]   Because I've seen this sort of thing happen.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.800]   It's always by accident.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.120]   But it's because of the exclusive thing.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.560]   I got this-- when I was editor in "Fo World,"
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.720]   we always solicit stuff.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.400]   I used to have a bunch of PR people
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.640]   who said, what can we do?
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.080]   I said, well, you can write an article.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.480]   I never put any of else's name on it.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.960]   You know what's changed everything is demand media.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.680]   Demand media is the big ones.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.600]   In fact, yeah.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.400]   That's fascinating.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.840]   Because basically, somebody said, hey, you know,
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.840]   instead of us writing--
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.360]   as we do on Twitch, we say, editorially--
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.120]   oh, these are the stories.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.120]   Let's talk about them.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.720]   What if we just looked at what the search terms were
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.320]   and wrote stories that matched the most popular search terms?
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.320]   Right.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.120]   And then we'll get high search rankings.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.520]   And we can put an ad on there.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.920]   And it's going to be a valuable product.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.320]   So if it turns out, people are searching for Harley-Davidson
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.440]   belt buckles, which apparently they are,
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.480]   they're going to find a demand media article about Harley-Davidson
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.000]   belt buckles.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.040]   It'll have some nice ads on them.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.680]   They pay writers next to nothing.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.840]   And they pay the writer $5 because the writer didn't
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.080]   have to put much work into it.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.560]   I think that's changed this a lot.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.000]   The entire media is just rank with corruption.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.080]   It's terrible.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.880]   But Tim, I know-- I mean, look, and a gadget
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.960]   is a serious journalist to get a prize.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.840]   I like a gadget.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.440]   I love a gadget.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.760]   And there's no question about that.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.560]   That's got to be a constant challenge.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.160]   Yeah, it absolutely is, especially with properties.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.200]   Like, everybody's basically trying to be first.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.960]   If you're trying to basically get the recognition,
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   you get to have that wave on Twitter.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.680]   And there's such a huge amount of traffic to be gained
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.800]   by being first.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.200]   So, you know, especially when these stories break early,
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.360]   this one broke, I think, before 8 AM.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.000]   And of course, Google PR wasn't even awake at that time.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.400]   So you don't have time.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.760]   You cannot wait and say, let's sit on this.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.040]   Let's call Icoa.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   Let's call Google.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.280]   There's a real urgency to getting this out.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.320]   But there's the--
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.440]   A lot of it's automated nowadays.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.280]   There's the risk.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:54.920]   Yeah, that's tough.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.280]   I think, especially in your field, in the gadget field,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.720]   it really is cutthroat.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.960]   It is definitely a very cutthroat.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.040]   And these things happen very quickly.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.800]   But ultimately, there were a few warning signs,
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.160]   which all things digital did a very good job of pointing out.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.800]   Within this press release, there were no quotes from Google,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.320]   for example, talking about the acquisition.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.160]   There was, I think, a spelling mistake in there as well.
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.480]   So there were a few little things that--
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.920]   That's a bad sign.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.280]   --were red flags.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.560]   So ultimately, even without the confirmation,
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.400]   there were a few things that might have jumped out
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.560]   at to us if we hadn't been in such a rush show.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.480]   But again, there were a few other instances later
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.280]   that week, if other press releases from Pierre Webb,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.920]   then we made sure to verify those.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.880]   And we will continue to do so good.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.280]   Well, I think this is--
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.440]   As with all pump and dump scams, it only works really
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.480]   the first time.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.320]   It works well.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.720]   Yeah, well, there's-- you know, they still
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.120]   do a lot of email pumping dumps and those--
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.720]   The forum works.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.280]   The forums used to be a good source.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.800]   Pump and dump is what?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.320]   Pump and dump is where you take a position
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.880]   in some worthless stock, and then you dream up
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.680]   a bunch of bull crap, and you pump it into the market
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.120]   to get the stock pumped up.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.920]   So you drop all this phony information
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.760]   in as fast as you can on blogs and all these things.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.080]   Oh, it's a rumor that they're going to do this,
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:02.920]   and they're going to do that.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.080]   And to get-- usually it's a penny stock.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.920]   That way, you get the thing, the skyrocket,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.680]   to go through a few bucks, and you slowly unload it in the--
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.640]   you can't unload it all.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.560]   Once you're slowly unload as it goes up,
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.160]   and then you-- so you dump, you pump, and then you dump,
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.600]   and then you're out, and then everybody else finds out
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.720]   that the stock goes back down to one penny.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.280]   And you made a bunch of money.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.800]   You can make 10x in one of these schemes.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.160]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.400]   And it still happens all the time.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.680]   Much of it is done by the mob.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.200]   What?
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:30.920]   Well, you know, actually--
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.720]   they do it with phone solicitations.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.920]   They dump, and dump on that with a call.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.720]   This whole PR web thing is the latest in a series of ways
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.480]   by which kind of the media and the blogosphere has been
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.480]   duped by one group or another.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.320]   This just-- this one happens to be with a press release.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.440]   But remember that-- I think it's a day four blog.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.720]   They came out with a hoax about Apple invented a proprietary
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.520]   screw.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.920]   And everybody fell for it.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.120]   Because that's the kind of thing you want to happen.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.080]   You expect to happen.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.360]   And so you believe it when it happens.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.440]   The India's $35 tablet.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.360]   Remember that?
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.680]   Everybody was talking about-- OK, it never happened.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.960]   And everybody believes it happened.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.680]   Because in this case, it was actually
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.440]   the government minister in India who
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.960]   is propagating this hoax.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.360]   Because he's trying to-- it's all politics.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.560]   He's trying to get everybody to think
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.120]   that India's on the forefront.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.880]   Turns out they ended up coming out with a device
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.160]   that wasn't made in India.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.560]   It didn't cost $35.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.240]   It was a piece of junk.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.040]   Nobody could use it.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.600]   They didn't distribute to millions of students.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.360]   Like they said, they were going to-- but there's still--
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.760]   even today, there's been going on for a year and a half.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.400]   They're still trying to get credit for it.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.360]   And the media is still lapping it up.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.640]   You can still find all these $35 tablet stories
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.640]   and pretty legit things.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.600]   And so this is-- there's just one organization
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.520]   and one individual after another,
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.640]   duping the media and the blogosphere.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.440]   Everybody is too busy to really track things down.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.080]   And by the time somebody does track it down, it's out there.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.120]   Unless you think this is just blogs, it's just new media.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.320]   Conan O'Brien had a little something
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.080]   that he did a few months ago.
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:15.720]   And I think this is a good example of lazy journalism.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.840]   Now, a lot of people-- they look at the news these days.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.040]   And they think the big news stories today
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.840]   are, well, the new al-Qaeda, underwear bomb threat,
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.200]   or where President Obama stands on gay marriage.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.000]   People think those are the big stories.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.200]   Well, judging by local news, there's an even bigger story
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.720]   that is sweeping the nation right now.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.600]   Here's a look at today's real top story.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.120]   Thank you, Don.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.760]   Well, we watched them on YouTube
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.640]   and post their pictures on Facebook.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.880]   What is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.800]   Who is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.520]   Is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.960]   Is it time for dogs to have their own social network of their own?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.560]   Is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.960]   Is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.960]   Wow.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.480]   Is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.280]   Is there all local news anchors?
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.280]   And it's OK, national news anchors.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.640]   Is there a social network inside of their own?
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.840]   Reading a press release.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   Very common.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.120]   Is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.040]   Is it time for dogs to have a social network?
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.920]   Apparently, it's time for dogs to have a social network of their own.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.080]   I'm not convinced yet, Leo.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.080]   Is it time for dogs to have a social network of their own?
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   My dogs are not very social, actually.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.080]   So I don't think--
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.800]   Just keep watching, because your local anchor will appear in this supercut at some point.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   It's hard to believe.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.520]   Yeah, they did this couple.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.520]   They do this a lot.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.520]   I love the supercuts.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.720]   I don't know how they do it.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.760]   They must have-- and same thing with the Daily Show.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.920]   John Stewart does this a lot.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.680]   There's some research that there's some databases now where you can--
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.840]   They must have text transcriptions.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.000]   Yeah, you find one example of something.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.680]   It's like I found the P's thing, because I wanted to read the article.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.200]   There must be a way to do that.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   You can do it.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   Yeah, and you can--
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.960]   To the close captioning systems, they can basically do a search based on that and get
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.640]   a time index in any news program to find out who you're going to do this.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.720]   Well, first, you've got to come up with the mean time.
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:18.440]   By the way, we still don't know if it's time for dogs to have a social network of their own.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:27.480]   I just do that to point out that no matter how many ways you complain about blogs and
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.040]   all this, it's always been far worse than local news.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.160]   It has always been far worse.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   They don't care.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.560]   It's not even they don't have time.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.560]   They don't.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.560]   They have time.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.440]   They only do two shows at 5.30 and 11.
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.440]   That's it.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.960]   They have plenty of time, and they still don't bother.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.440]   They say, "You got to press release I can read?"
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.440]   Thank you.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   We come back.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.200]   I want to talk a little more about Google.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:57.520]   The Chrome OS notebook, maybe Tim has an inside knowledge of this.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.920]   Google is reportedly going to do its own Chrome OS notebook.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:04.560]   They've sold out of the one that Samsung made.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.040]   I was just going to mention, people want to look into this.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:11.960]   They can look at snapstream.com, which is a clipping service.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   They do it.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:14.960]   Snapstream.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   That sounds familiar.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.600]   I think for a while we were using them for transcriptions on the podcasts.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.400]   DVR and search engine technology.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.400]   Wow.
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.080]   Monitor everything set on TV and then just search for it.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   That's incredible.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   It's only $1,000 a month, $15,000 a year.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   For you?
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   For me, nothing.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   We could do super cuts too.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   You get a key.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   If you get in a key, yeah.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.920]   I mean, these memes, there's probably tons of them.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.280]   We only see a few of them on Conan and John Stewart.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:48.360]   Just make a note of that, Chad.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   And Chad, get me an account.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.320]   Maybe we could spend the mug money on a snapstream account.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.000]   There you go.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.160]   That's a good idea.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:02.520]   Meanwhile, I know one thing we're not going to spend it on, trips to the post office.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   Time to talk about stamps.com.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.520]   Go ahead, everybody.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.160]   If you want to take a break, smoke them if you got them.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.720]   The smoking lamp is lit, John.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.240]   John likes to go out and have a stogium during these commercials.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:22.600]   Stamps.com is a way to turn yourself into a mailing pro.
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.840]   This is not, I have to say, this is not for somebody who's doing your Christmas card
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   list.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.000]   This is for somebody who does a lot of mailing.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.800]   It's part of your business, whether you're sending out invoices and you use QuickBooks.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.160]   If you're an eBay seller, an Amazon seller, a PayPal seller, you don't want to have to
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.480]   go to the post office, buy stamps and put them on an AMOLOM.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.320]   No, that's for the amateurs.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.720]   Especially this time of year.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.480]   You don't want to go in line there.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.080]   Crazy at the post office.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.280]   Stamps.com is a solution that should print your own US postage.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.080]   Legally, from your own computer, your own printer, you don't need a postage.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.280]   Look at that new scale, Chad.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   We got to get the new scale.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.280]   I know.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.640]   We have to get another account so we can get that new scale.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   I already got two scales.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   I want a third.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.280]   I want the brushed aluminum scale that matches my iPad.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.280]   That is pretty.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.280]   It looks thin.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.280]   That is amazing.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.280]   It is.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.080]   It's kind of the scale air.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.200]   And you just get that stamps free.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   Oh my gosh.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   Free.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   So here's the deal.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   Go to stamps.com.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.800]   If you do a mailing, this does all the things you want.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.200]   You know, you send an email to the recipient saying we just shipped the mail care.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   It comes and gets.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.800]   You can schedule free pickups so you don't have to worry about even mailing this stuff.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.960]   They come and get it.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.720]   It'll print postage on an envelope.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.240]   It'll print packages.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.120]   If you're doing international mailing, it fills out all the forms automatically.
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.880]   It takes the data from the Amazon or eBay or PayPal or Etsy site or whatever or from your
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   QuickBooks.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.920]   I mean, this really streamlines your mailing.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.200]   It is the way to get more done faster, more affordable because there's discounts you can't
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   get at the post office.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.960]   Now, if you go to stamps.com, you'll see that $80 offer.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.920]   But I don't want you to do that because if you click the upper right hand corner, you'll
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   find out why.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.360]   Two billion letters and packages have been sent with stamps.com.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.240]   Put Twitch in the offer code.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.760]   And now that $80 value.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.040]   Now, by the way, I think you get the new scale.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.240]   I don't think you get the old scale.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.480]   We just have to update that picture.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.480]   I would hope so.
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.480]   I think so.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.800]   I think you get the new scale.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.280]   The same old host, but you get the new scale.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   This hasn't changed.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.240]   The host is still going to look old.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.960]   $55 in postage coupons.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.120]   You get the digital scale.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   That's a $50 value.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.960]   By the way, yours to keep.
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.240]   If you cancel at any time, you get to keep the scale.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.440]   $5 supply kit and four week trial of stamps.com.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.480]   All you have to do is click the radio microphone and enter in our offer code.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.800]   If you ever go to the post office again, this is what the pros do.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   Stamps.com.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:47.040]   Thank them for their support.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.640]   Do you have a Newport?
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   Salem?
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.640]   Salem?
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   Salem.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.440]   Don't inhale them.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   John C. Devorak.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.440]   OMG.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.240]   That's from Throwboy.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.800]   It matches the shirt.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   Throwboy.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   Yeah, you can have that.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.200]   You want that?
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.280]   Every time John comes here, you can't have the jewelry.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.480]   By the way, the jeweler is over here.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.880]   OK, because I have to return that.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.320]   My wife's color.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   Really?
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.320]   Let me ask Lisa.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   I had this nice.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.320]   You know what?
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.160]   I think Mimi would like that.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   I think so.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.080]   But instead, she's getting the OMG pillow.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   You keep this here.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   It's a good prop.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.680]   I like to use it.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.840]   Moving right along.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.720]   I don't take anything home in this trip because there's nothing here.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.720]   There's nothing.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.200]   There's some bacon flavored vodka in the back.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.400]   When it comes to alcoholic beverages, you are in the-- go in my cupboard there in the
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.280]   back of my office.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.120]   Anything you want, anything you like.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.720]   You can even take the Dan Aykroyd autographed skull-shaped vodka bottle.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.640]   I'm not going to take anything like that.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.640]   You could.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.800]   This is how much I love you, Johnson & Worek.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:57.040]   Google Chromebook selling like hotcakes.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   Why?
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   Why?
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.960]   Are you stunned, Tim?
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.560]   I'm surprised for sure.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.720]   They certainly had a new low price point.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.000]   We've got one in $200 and $250 for the Samsung one.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.320]   But isn't it just like the netbook?
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.000]   I mean, didn't we learn cheap computers or crappy computers?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.120]   Well, these are very high quality netbooks.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.560]   Yeah, they definitely do look and feel like netbooks for sure.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.200]   But the thinner the battery life is quite good on that Samsung, at least.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.560]   And Google's making a new push right now.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.920]   We were a little bit curious on what exactly Google was going to do with Chrome OS because
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.720]   for a while there, they were quite quiet on that front.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.920]   But then we get the new Samsung unit a few months ago.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.760]   And then the new unit just drops from Acer.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.600]   The Acer is kind of cheesy.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.560]   According to your review, the Acer is kind of cheesy.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.720]   But this Samsung's pretty nice.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   The Samsung is absolutely very nice.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.480]   It's on the very high end of the old or the netbook specs for sure.
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.720]   Almost crossing into the regular laptop territory.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:55.080]   But there's also rumors of a touchscreen Chrome OS laptop coming sometime in the new year,
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:00.520]   perhaps directly made by Google itself with no partner at all, which would be very interesting.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.080]   So see what exactly Google is up to.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:08.280]   It's a little bit confusing still with Android and Google TV and Chrome OS as well.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.000]   We're trying to figure out exactly where Google is going with all these things.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.920]   But Google did make a big push into small businesses and to the education market as well
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.680]   with leasing programs for these, which we thought was a great idea.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.720]   And so I'm hoping that Google finds some success on that front because I think that
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.280]   could be a really big win for them.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.320]   I think in these into schools, low cost laptops that are very effortlessly connected to the
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.560]   Internet, that could be a great thing.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.440]   You know, somebody asked me about this.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.600]   You know, this Google Chromebook is really cheap.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.600]   Should I get one?
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.680]   And I said, well, you know, it's not really doesn't do anything.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   It's a net book.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   It's a browser.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   It's a browser.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   And you have to be on the Internet.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.000]   So you have to be on the Internet all the time to use it.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I mean, you're useless.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   I said, yes, you totally.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.560]   He says, well, what would anybody buy one?
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.800]   That's totally useless anymore.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   I can answer.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.760]   Yeah, I can answer that question.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.320]   The Chromebook is the computer for the rest of them.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.000]   It's the computer you get you give to somebody else.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.560]   And to the ad, it's for dogs and babies.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:10.920]   Dogs, babies, grandma, students, employees, anybody you want to lock into a cage.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.240]   You know, you don't want to do tech support.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   You don't want to worry about anything.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.760]   You don't want to let them install anything.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.760]   Nothing.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.960]   You give them a Chromebook and everybody's happy because they surf the web and do email
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.680]   and do all that kind of stuff.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.040]   And you don't have to worry about anything like, you know, they advertise it by showing
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.800]   that you can destroy it.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.680]   And if you destroy it, you just get another one, right, and up, log in and all your stuff
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.680]   is still there.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.040]   So that's really the benefit.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:42.000]   But nobody besides Jeff Jarvis, I don't know of anybody who's actually chosen one for himself.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.280]   Jeff, who is our host on this week at Google has decided at, but in his role as a journalist
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.280]   more than anything.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.360]   Yes, he's limited himself to a Chromebooks.
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   And Google stuff.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.360]   And he's very important.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.720]   Go ahead to Tim.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.840]   We use Google Docs or Google Drive now, excuse me, for quite a few tools internally.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:07.000]   And you know, our CMS is of course all online and we use an online wiki for sharing information.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.400]   And of course, almost all of us at an Engage.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.800]   We use Gmail for our email tools.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.400]   So because of that, I think it's very possible to actually do, you know, and be very productive
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.560]   with these machines and you can work with them offline.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.400]   You can edit docs offline and do some things offline with them, which does make them usable
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.200]   for long flights that don't have a Google internet, for example.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.040]   But ultimately they are very restrictive.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:30.680]   But really you can do so much online these days that it'd be very good machine for somebody
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:34.320]   who's like Mike was just saying, somebody who, you know, you don't want to worry about
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.640]   them getting a virus or downloading some toolbar for Firefox or something like that.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.200]   That's going to screw up their entire machine.
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.640]   It's a very easy machine to use and very hard to destroy.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:53.160]   It's $49.11.6 inch display.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.920]   Your review says six and a half hour battery life.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.720]   But it's running on, it's running on arm.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   Right.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.320]   And that's a big difference between the two that just came out.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.240]   The Samsung one is running on arm, which is the first actually.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   And so it's got pretty good battery life.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.240]   It's very thin, very efficient.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:13.240]   The other one, the $200 one from Acer is actually running on a, I believe, a solar on processor.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.000]   Which is very, very disappointing.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.080]   And also it doesn't have the 3G wireless connection built in that most of the Chromebooks do,
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.600]   which is a big advantage.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.280]   You can get usually it's 100 megs of data per month with those devices or some small
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   amount of data anyway.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.640]   Just enough to check your email and to download some docs and to do some simple web surfing.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.880]   But you can do it from anywhere, which is a great advantage from these machines.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.880]   They sort of doesn't have that.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.960]   So that really is just a net book that happens to be running Chrome OS, whereas the Samsung
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:43.080]   feels like a nice Chrome OS Chromebook laptop.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.720]   And even in the in gadget review, Miriam, is it Jwarr?
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.200]   How do you pronounce Miriam's last name?
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   Miriam Jwarr, yes.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:54.480]   Jwarr says this will always be a polarizing class of product.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   And I think that's accurate.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.840]   The geeks like us are going, "What?"
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.280]   But I think maybe some people, that's all they need.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.920]   It's always backed up because you're always in the cloud.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:13.040]   Do you, you have prisoners, slaves, employees.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.960]   What's interesting is, so you use Google Docs, we use Google Docs here.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:21.520]   The one thing that concerns me a little bit about all of this is I've just recently
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:28.080]   learned about the Electronic Communications Protection Act, which Senator Laye's trying
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.120]   to amend to be a little bit more up to date.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.800]   But this thing was written in the '80s, 1986.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:41.000]   And one of the things it says is it assumes that anything that's, anything that's stored
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.080]   in the cloud that hasn't been accessed in six months.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.280]   Did you talk about this before?
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.280]   It's public.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.040]   Yeah, no, it's abandoned.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.920]   It's abandoned, which means you don't need a search warrant to get it.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.080]   All the government or an law enforcement has to do is get an administrative subpoena.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.760]   They don't even have to prove illegality.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.160]   They just have to say, "Yeah, this would be useful in an investigation."
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.960]   Yeah, they need to be a little bit more.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.040]   And so, everything- Six months, which is a crack up because that's not nothing.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:12.200]   I mean, if you look at your own email six months ago, I mean, there's still email I
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   haven't answered.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   It is still active.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   Right.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   Then mostly email I haven't answered.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Well, in your case.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.040]   Now, Laye is trying to amend this and we'll see what happens.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.360]   They just came out with an amendment that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.360]   And we did.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.240]   We did talk about this last week, but we got it reversed because some of the amendments
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:36.680]   were worse, but apparently what Laye's amendments are going to do is to amend that $180 rule
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.960]   to say, "Yes, you still need a warrant."
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.280]   However, law enforcement, and we have talked about this before, I just think it's worth
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.920]   saying again, can still get things like your name, address, credit card, bank information,
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.640]   the date and times of email, the recipients of the email, the devices you used when conducting
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:58.440]   electronic communications, all of that without any warrant.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:03.120]   I'll be done just with a pen register.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:08.480]   So do you worry, Tim, is there, corporately, do they worry at all about the idea that everything
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:14.640]   that's in those Google Docs is basically available to the feds any time after six months?
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.240]   You cannot actually get internet provided instances of Google Docs, basically, hosted
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:20.600]   instances of Google Docs.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.920]   Not actually hosted, but kind of walled off from the internet as a whole, which actually
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.120]   AOL has done.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.400]   Interestingly, we don't actually use those.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.440]   We're using the public Google Docs internally adding gadgets so that we don't have to worry
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:35.560]   about the internet and VPN and all that fun stuff.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.760]   So there are ways for corporations to protect themselves from that sort of thing.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.800]   And I presume that content that was protected like that would not be included in that, but
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.480]   perhaps not.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:48.360]   But I personally don't tend to worry about that sort of thing, but then again, I try to
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.880]   do good on the internet, so maybe that means I shouldn't have to worry.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.600]   I think that that's risky.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.880]   That was always for, if you're not doing anything illegal, what are you doing?
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.920]   That's a species argument because that's not really what it's all about.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   Sure.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.680]   It's about fishing expeditions.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:10.160]   It's about fishing expeditions, entrapment, finding something you could blackmail somebody
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.920]   else with that may have an interest, may have an effect on you.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.800]   Let's say you don't like the director of the CIA, for instance.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.880]   Maybe you'd like to get him out of office.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:23.000]   If you could only go through his personal Gmail account, maybe you could find something
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.760]   really salacious in there.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.480]   It worked out fine.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:31.400]   But I don't think that we should let fears like this keep us from using what is ultimately
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   a very good service.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.560]   It sounds like the government is aware that this is a curious exception to the rule or
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.240]   what's intended use of the rule and is trying to fix it.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.160]   What about encryption?
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.600]   You could use, well, I guess encryption works.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.320]   You could encrypt the doc and then save it.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.960]   Are you doing that?
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.120]   The mega uploads case.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   That's the example.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.400]   That's a perfect example.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   Exactly.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:03.440]   There were thousands, millions of innocent people, just users.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:08.640]   They decided that the physical servers were evidence.
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.600]   They took them and, gosh, there's data on the servers.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.120]   We get to do anything we want with that data.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:20.000]   You could even imagine a case in which you're using a legitimate service.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.920]   Hackers steal all of the personal data.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.640]   The feds go in and grab the servers from the hackers.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:30.720]   Now the stuff that has been stolen by the hackers is now in the hands of who knows who
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.760]   in the government doing who knows what.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:39.040]   It's really the larger, the biggest picture about this whole thing is something I've talked
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.280]   about on this show before, which is every time there's an advancement in technology,
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:50.040]   if you assume that the cloud is an advancement, there's this balance between the public's
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.760]   rights and the government's desire.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.840]   They take advantage of it.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:01.480]   We take advantage of all new technologies to seize more power as it relates to the public.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:06.200]   Every cell phone thing, every now the cloud, they're trying to get around the constitution.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:13.080]   They're trying to say, "Hey, here's an opportunity for us to just have no rules about searches,
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.080]   basically.
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.240]   This is a constitutional issue."
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.600]   It's like, you know, it's yet another case and people are not sufficiently up in arms about
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.600]   it.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   It's the principle of the thing.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:27.640]   You can't let governments seize additional power over the population every time there's
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.600]   an advancement in technology because there's going to be a million more.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.600]   Here here.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   Here here.
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:34.600]   Bravo.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   I absolutely agree, by the way.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.840]   But do you propose that we not use these services until the laws are up to speed with
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.920]   the technology?
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:46.480]   I propose that we talk about this and get people riled up so that they understand that
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:52.920]   their rights are being trampled and exactly what's happening.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:59.120]   We still have a democracy and if people make enough noise about it, then we will have laws
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:04.200]   that protect us from invasive crap like this.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.120]   It's something people should be concerned about.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.000]   They should be, but unfortunately they're more concerned about dogs having their own
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   social network.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   But John, shouldn't you?
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Well, shouldn't they?
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   Isn't it time?
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   Dogs have the act I think it is.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.160]   Actually, dogster was like three weeks after Friendster.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.160]   There was dogster.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.160]   Right?
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   You remember that?
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:25.560]   Yeah, they can't remember dogs.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.040]   Dogs have had their own social network as long as we have.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.040]   Do they use it?
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   Aussie?
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.040]   No.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.040]   No.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.040]   Type.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   They can't type their little dog.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.040]   A dog's social network is they sniff the behind of the other dogs.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.040]   That's a social network.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   That's a social network.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.040]   It's not that different, actually.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.040]   No.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.560]   It goes on to San Francisco a lot.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.960]   I'm just going to stop talking right now.
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:46.960]   Okay.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.400]   So what's the next topic on the agenda?
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:54.800]   I want to talk about Windows 8, but first, is 40 million really good, but first?
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.800]   40 million, what?
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:59.880]   Say, they say Microsoft says the fastest selling version of Windows ever.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   Nobody else says this?
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   I know.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.560]   Where do they get that number from?
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.200]   We'll talk about it in a second.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   I know.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   It's different.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.240]   It's maybe the PR web.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.240]   They're going to be the butt of a ship.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   Bomber web.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.240]   Bomber web.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.240]   Hey, that's a good idea.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.840]   A Twitter web.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.120]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.120]   If you're an IT, this is a tool.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:31.080]   Everybody in IT has their tools that they use, everything from a utility tool, your own
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.520]   little, what do they call those?
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.680]   A Gerber tool?
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.440]   Every IT guy I know has a Gerber tool.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:39.480]   A Leatherman on their belt or Gerber.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.480]   That's another kind.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.200]   The golf is confiscated by the TSA years ago.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.800]   Of course, you can't bring that through.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:46.800]   What are you, crazy?
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.800]   This was at the beginning.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   Who knew?
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   Who knew?
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.720]   Every, but there's also software tools.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.280]   That's just hardware tools.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.680]   And I got this is the multi tool for the IT Pro online.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.080]   It's called GoToAssist.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.200]   If you use this, number one in remote support, but let me tell you, Citrix is making this
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.440]   better and better all the time.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:08.840]   It is the number one remote support tool for IT.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.880]   10 years in business, but they've added new features.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.800]   Two new features that I think are fantastic.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.760]   So there's GoToAssist remote access.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:24.840]   They've just added GoToAssist service desk, which is a tracking system.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:25.840]   You need this, right?
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.960]   To track and resolve issues.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.560]   So it's cloud based service management tools, easy to deploy, easy to use, ticket and incident
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:40.200]   management, problem management, changes, releases, all of that stuff available.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.520]   And now they also have remote monitoring.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.240]   They've really beefed this up.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.760]   If you haven't looked at GoToAssist lately, you've got to give it a try.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.840]   The monitoring is awesome.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.560]   You put the crawler on your client's network.
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:54.720]   This is great if you want to be a managed service provider.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.480]   You want to grow as an IT professional.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.800]   Or if you get the boss to pay for this, it's going to save your life if you're in a company
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.520]   doing hardware or software support.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:03.760]   You run the crawler on the network.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:08.280]   It finds every bit of hardware, all the computers, but also the network attached devices.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.680]   And I really like this, all the software.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.800]   You get an assay of everything on your network.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.640]   You'll have this whole database of this stuff.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:22.720]   And then they've got a dashboard and you could set up trackers.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:27.800]   They have some standardized dashboards, but you can also custom trackers, all kinds of
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:35.240]   stats, everything from how is the Wi-Fi performance to what is the average, discudalization?
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.240]   What is the toner cartridge doing?
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.520]   And the reason you do this is because you can have proactive alerts, text messages, email
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:46.000]   messages, instant messages that let you know if there's a problem.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.520]   As you set up the alert yourself, if you want, using customized thresholds or you can have
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:57.200]   the preset thresholds, and if disk space falls below 5% on a computer, you will get an alert.
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.200]   And you can be proactive.
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.840]   You can fix that problem before it becomes a big problem.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.720]   This really is the way to do support.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.800]   So they've got the ticket management, they've got the remote support, and they've got the
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.200]   monitoring now.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:16.600]   And you could try all of it free for 30 days if you visit gotoassist.com.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.880]   We actually use it here.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   I have it on all the servers, so I don't have to come in if I want to fix something.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:25.920]   I use the remote support a lot, but I know that Russell Tammany are IT guys very interested
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.880]   in the monitoring module.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.160]   Go to visit gotoassist.com, click the try at free button, and the promo code for this
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   is TWIT.

[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:39.280]   And you can try this for 30 days.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:44.240]   You get to try all three, the remote support, the service desk, and the monitoring module
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:46.320]   free for 30 days.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.320]   Please give it a try.

[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.560]   Oh, look, here's all the jewelry.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:56.360]   I just found the inventory.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.760]   See what you do something you like.
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.760]   Well, there's the window.
[00:59:58.760 --> 00:59:59.760]   Yeah, I like this.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   This is like a wedding ring that's actually a belt.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.760]   I know I like that.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   It's kind of cute.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.040]   It's got a little belt buckle on it.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.040]   It's cute.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.040]   Anyway.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.040]   I think you should get one.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.040]   First, I have to get it.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.040]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.040]   This is the thing we just...
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   Yeah, how much?
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   Nothing.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.800]   It's $200 normally.
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.960]   TWIT price, $146.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   Huh?
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   You know what?
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:26.040]   I'll buy it for you and you can give it to Mimi.
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.040]   I think that's a cheat.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   She'd appreciate that.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   We could pinky ring.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.280]   We got to get her size though because you got to make sure it fits.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   Although, I don't mind it.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280]   So it shouldn't be very...
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280]   It's 14 carat.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.280]   You can pound it.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.280]   You can make it fit.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.000]   You can make it fit.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   No, wait a minute.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.200]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.880]   This is 5 1/3 carat amethyst.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.880]   That's how big that is.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.480]   Look at that.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.160]   Diamonds and it's sterling silver with yellow rhodium plating.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.440]   That's why it looks like gold.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.440]   It's sterling.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   Okay.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   Yeah, it's fascinating.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   [laughter]
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]   Windows.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:05.200]   Oh, first of all, let's talk about Scruggles because you talked...
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.680]   I think was it you that wrote about the...
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   Oh, no.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Harry McCracken wrote about this.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.320]   I thought maybe Mike Elegant wrote about it.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.520]   Harry McCracken said, "Come on."
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.040]   But I just like the name Scruggled.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   Have you got...
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.520]   Go to Scruggled.com, John.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520]   Have you seen this?
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.400]   Well, there used to be a different Scruggled.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   So here's the deal on Scruggled.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.960]   There used to be a search engine called Scruggled.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.960]   It really...
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   Yeah, it was a Google...
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.240]   It was a shell on the Google search engine.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.840]   It would eliminate all advertising.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   Ooh.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.480]   And then Google got on their case and pulled it.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.200]   And then Microsoft came along and said, "We'll take that domain.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.040]   Thank you very much."
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:43.800]   So this poor woman, she's clearly worried about what Google might be doing with their
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.280]   Google shopping.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.440]   Microsoft says Google Shopping, which used to be just a search engine.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.960]   I like to look on her face.
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.240]   Wait a minute, there's another guy.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   He's even more worried.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   Let's scroll down.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.240]   She looks constipated.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.040]   He just looks mad.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.040]   He just...
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.040]   And I don't know what the four fingers are, but I think an Italian that means...
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040]   It means something.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   ...to the devil with you.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.040]   He's been Scruggled four times.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.880]   Yeah, but it's kind of all they're upset about is the fact that Google Shopping, which
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:14.880]   used to be unpaid search results, are now all paid search results.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.120]   Here's the thing, they're actually better search results in my experience than the one
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.120]   that they've been on.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.120]   So I want to just...
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.120]   So I got this and the unpaid ones.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.600]   Yeah, I think I'm back to back in Paris and it's after this.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   It's supposed not to long.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.600]   I just had a point.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.120]   And so I searched for things on Bing Shopping and on Google Shopping as well.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:36.520]   And by and large, the results were far better on Google than on...
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.520]   Ironic.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.000]   I searched for a 64 gig micro SD card, for example.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.520]   The top result on Google was a Kensington option, which was reasonably priced, I think
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.000]   it was from Amazon.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.480]   The one at Bing was...
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.040]   The price was low and so I clicked through and it was a $50 shipping charge from this one
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.600]   vendor I'd never heard of that was selling it through Bing for a $40 micro SD card with
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.480]   a $50 shipping charge and they were out of stock.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.960]   So it really shouldn't have even shown up anyway.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.160]   But ultimately my experiences have been that Google Shopping, even if they are a little
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.240]   bit skewed, are still better results than Bing's unfortunately.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.520]   The point funny things about Microsoft is that the different divisions never talk to
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.520]   each other.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.600]   They're all at war with each other all the time.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:24.680]   And so Microsoft's Bing actually has exactly this sort of thing, paid placements for the
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.040]   holidays.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.720]   And so that was a project that no doubt was happening over here and then this Google
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.680]   project was happening over there and they didn't talk to each other.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.800]   So now Microsoft is slamming Google for something that Microsoft is doing.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   It's hilarious.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   It's hilarious.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.720]   Never a dull moment.
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.800]   Microsoft just can't stop shooting themselves in the foot.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:53.320]   Now they said 40 million Windows 8 licenses in the first month, which is comparable to
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.200]   the Windows 7.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.320]   Now these upgrade licenses are the just sales.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.680]   Because if they have this as a licensed thing automatic when you buy a new machine, that's
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.920]   about what the monthly sales could be.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.560]   It's a very good question.
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.320]   Yeah, it could be all kinds of things.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.520]   It could be all kinds of things.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   It could be stores.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520]   It could be OEMs.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.720]   It could be, you know, filling the channel.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.280]   Yes, it could be both licensed purchases as well.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.280]   Unfortunately, they haven't actually clarified what exactly this 40 million number means.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.240]   But it is significantly higher than they said is comparable to Windows 7, which was 60 million
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.960]   over two months versus 40 million in one month.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.920]   But I was trying to remember, do you guys remember what the upgrade prices were for
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.920]   Windows 7 at launch?
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:34.920]   Well, that's the difference.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.920]   Yeah, it was like $130.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.520]   It was a 40 buckers.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.520]   And it's cheap.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.680]   Windows 8 is the cheapest version of Windows ever.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680]   Right.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.280]   40 dollars than one, I might add.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.960]   There's another piece of data from NPD group, which points out that since the Windows 8
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.400]   launch, about 40% of the PCs being sold are not running Windows 8.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.840]   They're running an older version.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:04.040]   And they can actually compare that to Windows 7, which was 83%.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:09.280]   So by that measure, the percentage of PCs that have the newest operating system is significantly
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.000]   stuck in badly compared to the last version.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.720]   If I'm going to buy a new PC, I'm going to request Windows 7 on it.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.120]   I'm talking about a desktop.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.480]   Yeah, if I have a touchscreen laptop, I'll get Windows 8.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.360]   But if I'm going to buy a desktop app from scratch, like today, they make touchscreen
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.280]   Dell's XPS1 with Windows 8 is touchscreen.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.120]   I don't like to be that close to the screen.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.120]   You don't have to.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   You just reach out and swipe it.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.000]   I got a new shot and it's like you hangs your arm.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   You're going to end up with...
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   But you don't spend it.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.840]   So here, I'm playing devil's advocate because I'm not sure I'm convinced of this.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.200]   But I do think touch is nice if you...
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.400]   It's a hybrid environment.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.120]   So most of the time you're typing along, but haven't you ever done that?
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.120]   Well, you've been using your iPad for a while and so you reach out and you try to swipe
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.120]   a screen.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.440]   There's just times when you want to do that.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:00.680]   I was watching somebody with one of these touch screen desktops and a fly landed on
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.680]   the screen.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.680]   Started setting off all kinds of things.
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.680]   No!
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:05.680]   The next thing you know the guy was...
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.680]   The fly was typing.
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.920]   The flies can do that?
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920]   They can, absolutely.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:12.000]   I thought it happened as well.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   It said help me.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Help me, help me.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.960]   It seems you've worked so on keyboard to talk to you.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.480]   So flies work with capacitive screens.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.960]   They are fully conducted.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.680]   But you software.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.520]   Both of you say you've seen this.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   I absolutely don't know.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.840]   I can't just lie, I was typing in URL.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   Help me.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.840]   Help me.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.880]   There's a video on YouTube of it actually if you want to see it happening.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   It's at docs.com.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.380]   Wow.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.720]   Is it time for flies to have their own social network?
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720]   I think so, yes.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.440]   Flies should have their own social network.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:48.040]   So I have the Windows RT and I think it's kind of interesting.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.280]   It's not perfect but it's an interesting.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.280]   So the surface...
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.280]   I play with yours.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:54.280]   I like it.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.520]   I was at the airport and they're...
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.120]   Microsoft's doing a good thing here.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:03.080]   They're putting these pop-up, not a store but a pop-up events at the airport.
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.000]   That's what Google did for its Chromebooks.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   So they're doing it too.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.800]   Yeah, and then you go in there and you can play around.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:13.880]   They give you a free $25 coupon just to play with the thing and you get a $25 off your next
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.880]   Southwest flight.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880]   Wow.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   It seemed like a deal to me.
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.560]   Google was doing that in Terminal 2.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   If you got on a Virgin America flight they'd say, "Well take a Chromebook with you."
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.200]   Oh, they didn't do that.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.840]   And you can watch a movie and then they had it at the other end, you drop it off.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.240]   Well, that's cool.
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.920]   Some about airports I guess.
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.080]   It's a captive audience.
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.240]   Microsoft did announce that they're going to sell their Surface Pro.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.240]   So this is...
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.400]   The one we were talking about was the RT.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   It's the ARM-based.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   It's a tablet.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.280]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.680]   The Pro is Windows 8 Professional.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.440]   It's full Windows 8.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:55.560]   That's going to be $8.99 for the 64 gigabyte model, $9.99 for the 120 gigabyte model.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.880]   That's without keyboard.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.280]   I wrote a column about this saying this is way overpriced.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.560]   I think a lot of people would agree with that.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560]   But you get a pen.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.560]   So you don't.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.560]   I don't think you do.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.360]   I don't think you do.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.760]   I think both the pens and keyboards are sold separately.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.760]   I think.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.840]   Yeah, I know you don't get the keyboard, but I thought you got a pen.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   It all cares.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.280]   Who uses a pen anyway?
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.560]   It's an i5.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:27.200]   It's a 1920x1080, so it's a good resolution for a 10.6 inch screen.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.520]   It's got a full size USB 3 port and mini display port on it.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.560]   The pen, I guess, I don't know if it's what kind of digitizer.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.640]   Do you know Tim if it's like a pressure sensitive or if it's a stylus?
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.640]   No, I don't.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.080]   We haven't had a chance to actually see this in the wild yet, so I don't know exactly
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:45.080]   what it's using.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:48.760]   I presume it's similar to what the Galaxy Note is using, which is kind of a lack of
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.320]   basic quality, which does have pressure sensitivity.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.840]   So it's definitely a capacitive pen.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.360]   And I'm pretty sure that it is actually included, but the keyboard or the touch cover, those
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.360]   are not included.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.840]   So pen input and pen included with purchase.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:01.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.440]   And it is a capacitive pen.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.360]   Well, it has to be because it's a capacitive screen.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.000]   But battery life will be one half the RT.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   So we're talking what, four hours?
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.400]   Four to four and a half, yeah.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.840]   Is that enough to make that a compelling product?
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.320]   What's interesting is I would have said no right now, initially because I thought, well,
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.840]   all of these other companies are going to be putting out their Windows 8 Pro computers.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:30.840]   There's some beautiful ones.
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.600]   I just saw one from Acer.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.480]   But boy, if you go to Best Buyer, even a Microsoft store, there's a dearth of Windows
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.120]   8 Pro computers.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.840]   They just came out.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.920]   Well, but, well, okay, remember Windows 7?
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.680]   There were lots of them.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.560]   There's lots of announcements, but there are not a lot of them in the store.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:55.560]   Well, if I had a store, I wouldn't be inventorying them until I saw what was going to happen.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.760]   And you know that Microsoft's going to have this surface and then maybe that would slow
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.840]   the OAMs down a little bit, waiting to see how that goes.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.080]   So somebody said they were watching one of these surface machines on an airport on the
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   tray.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.600]   And apparently that little kickstand thing is positioned poorly and it keeps falling
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.160]   off the edge of the tray.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.760]   Oh, you know what?
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.960]   That makes sense because if you've got the touch cover or the type cover, I should have
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   tried this.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.280]   I didn't take it out during the flight.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.800]   But I bet you an economy that it's just a little too long to fit on the tray.
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.960]   The weight is all in the very back.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.600]   And if that slips off the edge down it goes.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:44.040]   The bigger story here, I think, is that, I mean, let's just call a spade spade here.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.320]   Windows 8, the Surface Pro and Windows RT are flops.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.480]   They're just a pointing fail.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   Yeah, they are.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:56.920]   I've heard that RT, they cut in half the number they expected to sell.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.960]   It's a flop, but it's actually not a terrible thing.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.480]   Microsoft's trying to do something very tricky and difficult here.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.720]   They know we're heading for a post-PC world.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.720]   They know we're heading for a world where everything is touch.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.280]   And they're the legacy company.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.560]   They can't be like Apple and just cut everybody off with the knees and just go on to the next
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.560]   thing.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.560]   And sorry if you've invested a lot of money in this other stuff, we're going to the new
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.560]   thing.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.240]   Microsoft is the company that tries not to do that.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.280]   So they're trying to backward compatible support everything, all that kind of stuff.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.560]   So how do they get all these reluctant global people to move into the post-PC world or more
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.560]   to the point?
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:35.160]   How do they avoid getting left behind and represent the past, the GUI interface, while
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.520]   Microsoft owns the future, which is the touch interface.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:40.280]   So they're playing a funky game.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.200]   And in hindsight, it appears that the better strategy would have been to have a Windows
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.000]   8 that doesn't have the Metro UI and then have devices that do have the Metro UI and
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.600]   let consumers pick and just not force it down people's throats.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.680]   I think the biggest problem is this touch interface when people use it on a device that
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.200]   is not being used for touch.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.680]   If you're using a mouse and a keyboard with something with an interface designed for touch,
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.200]   you're going to be disappointed, confused, annoyed, et cetera.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.080]   And that's exactly what I think is happening with a lot of people.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.600]   So I think the longer game, I think three, four years from now, five years from now, this
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.280]   is all going to be cool stuff.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.440]   Microsoft, which I think is actually really good at making hardware.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.320]   I think they're better at making hardware than they are at making software, ironically.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.280]   That's ironic because this is the first PC they've ever made.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   Exactly.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.800]   And if you think about everything, prototype, right?
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.800]   Well, right.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.960]   But they've been making Xbox, which is a PC, really.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:40.120]   I mean, they've been making peripheral device for a long time.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:47.480]   If you look at the surface, the windows RT, this device was not perfect at all.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:53.440]   But wow, for a 1.0 release, a hardware product by a software company was pretty darn good.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:58.120]   So I think by the time they get to version three or something like that, it's probably
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.800]   going to be pretty good.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.880]   So Windows Blue is the next, the upgrade.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.880]   Windows Blue.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:11.080]   My argument is always that we have to understand Microsoft by understanding the retail strategy,
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.640]   which is where they're headed.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:17.080]   They're following Apple's strategy because of the great margins or the great per square
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:22.800]   foot sales that Apple has at their stores, the highest that any retail outlets ever achieved,
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.440]   much higher than Tiffany.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.080]   And Microsoft saw this and even they get half the sales of an Apple store, they're still
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:31.040]   going to make more money than a Tiffany store.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.200]   And they are going to push this as far as they can, but they have to have hardware in the
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.200]   stores.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.080]   That's where they're going to bring out hardware, whether people like it or not.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.280]   We've been on this show years ago and said, "Oh, Microsoft will never do hardware."
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.040]   And I've always said they will do hardware because they've always been toying with it
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.800]   and the Xbox is a good example of hardware.
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.800]   You're the one though, and I quote you all the time who said, "Well, look at Apple's strategy
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.520]   and Microsoft's strategy.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.720]   Apple sells hardware, Microsoft sells software."
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.720]   And you always said, "Well, whose wallet would you rather have?
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720]   Steve Jobs or Bill Gates?"
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.200]   And for a long time it was Bill Gates' wallet.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.000]   They were making the money, but that has flipped.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.680]   You must have known.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   I saw them now.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   I didn't know when Dave's online.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   That was a good idea.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.720]   I knew it was when they started doing the retail stores you had to say, "Why are they
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:11.720]   doing this?
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.080]   And what's the structure of the future based on these stores?"
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:19.640]   And then once you get the numbers from Apple, you go, "Oh my God, would they Microsoft?"
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.840]   Be crazy not to do these stores, but you can't do the stores the way they did with their experimental
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.240]   store in San Francisco, which is just sell software.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   You have to have stuff in there for people to play with.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.480]   They would take the store, the one at the Metra, and you'd go in there and it was just
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.480]   box.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.480]   It was just software.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480]   It was terrible.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480]   But these new stores are...
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.560]   Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you, John, but I just want to agree with you.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560]   That's exactly right.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.000]   Everybody's going into these Microsoft stores today.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.320]   It's almost all Xbox people, or at least the people who are buying stuff.
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.560]   They're buying Xbox stuff exactly right now.
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.520]   And this is Apple's magic strategy with retail.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:53.520]   The thing that's great about it is that it's a gateway drug.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.080]   Originally you had an iPod, and you'd go in there to see if there was a case for your
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080]   iPod and you'd see the other stuff.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.320]   Now you have an iPhone, all these Windows users have an iPhone, they go in there and
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.480]   they see the iMac and they're like, "Wow."
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.600]   They go in there 20 times, and at the 21st time they're like, "You know what?
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.600]   Screw it.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.560]   I'm going to get an iMac."
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.960]   That's the real power of the Apple store, and that's what Microsoft needs to do.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:20.040]   They need to convert all these Xbox freaks and all the whatever fans they have and convert
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.160]   them over to their other stuff.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.800]   Is there an Xbox Halo effect?
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.160]   Ha, get it?
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.680]   Very funny.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.360]   No, I think they're going to bring out things.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360]   They're going to bring...
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.360]   They're going to bring...
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.520]   Get there with the smart class technology that's built into Surface into Windows 8 as well.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.360]   They're trying to kind of ooze that Xbox experience over to their other devices.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.840]   And I think that could be successful for them, but to kind of take the coolness of the brand
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.720]   Xbox and to displace the rather uncoolness of Windows, is a big ask.
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.280]   Well, but they will have...
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:55.040]   And the Surface is one of these things that I've seen people do.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:57.600]   They played with it at the airport and they talked about it on the airplane.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.800]   They really liked it.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.320]   And I think once Microsoft...
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.880]   They're spending the extra money to make these things cooler than a normal Microsoft
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.920]   product.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.680]   And I think once they get a couple more machines and a phone, they have to have a phone company
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.920]   that they're going to either buy Nokia or somebody else so they can have a phone you
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920]   can buy there.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.960]   And all the rest of it, people can walk into Microsoft's story and have almost an Apple
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:20.960]   experience.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.960]   Super nuts.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960]   Super.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.280]   It's going to be cheaper than the Apple stuff and it's going to...
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.000]   But it's going to be the stores or clones.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.760]   They're a little bigger.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.520]   I think it's going to be fun to watch.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.000]   My experience with Windows RT was exactly that, which is when you first start playing
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.440]   with it, it's like, "Oh, this is cool.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   This is nice.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   This is great."
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.400]   But it's when you live with it for a while, as I did.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.400]   You tried.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.400]   It doesn't...
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.400]   It doesn't satisfy.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.400]   There's...
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.400]   What's wrong with it?
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.400]   It's rough-edged.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:55.200]   It's hard to discover some of the ways to get to control panels and stuff.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.920]   When you're using a real application like Office, you end up going to desktop and then
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.280]   touch doesn't work quite as well.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.280]   For instance, you can...
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.040]   Let's say you're using Excel on a Surface RT.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.840]   Yeah, you can open up the cells to make them bigger.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.360]   But the menus and all the touch targets on the menus in the ribbon are all still dinky,
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.800]   dinky, and you can't hit them.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.960]   It's just little things like that where you go, "This on the surface," so to speak, "This
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:18.960]   looks great.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:19.960]   You go, "This is innovative.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   This is exciting."
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.760]   It's when you live with it for a little bit.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:28.040]   Now maybe that's not a bad thing because maybe people will buy it.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.400]   Paul Therat, who is certainly an expert on Windows, the host of our Windows Weekly, wrote
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:37.120]   the article on his win supersight.com that uncertainty could turn Windows 8 into the
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.120]   next Vista.
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:43.200]   Well, there is the theory that every other operating system Microsoft has done and I
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:48.000]   think you can trace this back, has been a dog and then they rush out a new one.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.640]   He says, "Sales of Windows 8 are well below Microsoft's internal projections and have
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.040]   been described according to his sources inside the company as disappointing.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:03.920]   They're blaming though lackluster PC maker designs and lack of availability," which is
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.520]   what I was talking about, which may be one reason why Surface is more important even
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:12.160]   than we realized.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:17.160]   He says, "One of my trusted sources at Microsoft confirmed Windows 8 week start and with all
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.920]   the drama surrounding Windows 8 and the recent unexpected departure of Stephen Sonofsky, the
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.800]   Windows chief, rumors are sure to swirl.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.560]   One Microsoft is blaming the PC makers.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:38.080]   People are worried about Sonofsky and the handoff to Julie Larson Green, the ribbon girl.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:44.800]   Also, it's a bad economic times and that could hurt sales for anything.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:50.600]   If you're a business, I don't feel any urge or pressure at all to upgrade my PC.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.440]   I still have one machine running XP.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.400]   A lot of people do.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.840]   And the confusion over whether Windows 8 is a tablet, is it a desktop?
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.840]   What is it?
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.240]   Well, I think it was ill-conceived.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:11.080]   I mean, Microsoft has this history of having various devices trying to all look and feel
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:18.840]   the same and they began by taking the Windows desktop as a complete system and trying to
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.240]   take it down a few notches.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.920]   So the early smart phones, the original smartphone as a matter of fact, and some of these other
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:31.880]   pocket computers, you had Windows shrunk onto that platform with a pen and you had the same
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:37.200]   icons you had on your Windows OS and it ran Word and things.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.760]   Sorry, but.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.880]   It was a down scale and so somewhere, but it never worked out.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.000]   So somewhere along the line, someone said, "Why don't we do the opposite and go upscale?"
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   We start with a phone OS and then move it upscale.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   So they did?
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.960]   Which they believed Apple was going to do because they had suggested they might, but they never
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   did.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:55.960]   Move iOS to the desktop.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.400]   Or back to the Mac as they called it.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.400]   Right.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.080]   But they never did yet and I don't know if they will.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:08.960]   So Microsoft jumped the gun on this and they upscaled from a phone OS to a PCOS is ridiculous.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.520]   It was idiotic and it's not what anybody wants.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.680]   I don't want a phone OS on a 27 inch monitor.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:18.760]   So when I click on something, I get full screen that's on a 27 inch monitor.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.880]   One app is kind of moving that way though.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.680]   Yeah, well you haven't seen it yet though.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:28.720]   Well, the irony is that Microsoft owns the large touchscreen market.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.720]   They have the original one.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.720]   They have the big giant one.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.720]   Right.
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:37.200]   And they also purchased Perceptive Pixel which was the other company.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:42.160]   Between the two of them, that's a lot of intellectual property, a lot of brilliant research that's
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.400]   been done and they're kind of doing nothing with it.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.960]   I mean, you know what, Ballmer three years ago promised that there would be a consumer
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.120]   version of Surface.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.240]   Again, the big retail touchscreen thing that they have.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.200]   I didn't know it was going to be what they now call Surface.
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.240]   I thought we were going to have the big consumer touchscreen.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.880]   And that would be absolutely awesome.
[01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:06.560]   But you know, the other point I want to make about the stores and Windows 8 and about the
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:10.440]   thing you talked about, Leo, where it doesn't really feel right, things are hidden, it's
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.400]   nonintuitive and so on.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.480]   All completely true.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:17.520]   They're so busy copying Apple that I need to, I think they need to get their act together
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.720]   and start copying Google.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:23.200]   So what would Google do to paraphrase Jeff Jarvis?
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:29.580]   Google would use the stores as a laboratory to, as an ongoing focus group to see what
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.960]   people are confused about when they're poking around on these machines.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.720]   They would have a camera above every single device and they would see, look, everybody's
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.320]   always confused about this, that and the other thing.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:44.340]   And have that be like, you know, you literally have millions of users telling you exactly
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:47.500]   what's wrong with your user interface.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:48.960]   And they really should use stores like that.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:53.860]   They should use them as data gathering engines for--
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:54.860]   I'll probably know they are.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:59.100]   I mean, they may be asking their associates, hey, what are people confused about?
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:00.600]   So I don't think that's Microsoft's way.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:05.040]   I think Microsoft's much more about chest beating and saying, no, it's selling great,
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.040]   it's selling great.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.840]   Paul wraps up his article saying, the net effect of all of these concerns is it contributes
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.840]   to a wait and see approach with Windows 8.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.640]   And I think that's definitely what people are saying.
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.480]   He says this is exactly the opposite of what Microsoft should want at this time.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:24.960]   In this way, Windows 8 is much like that, the launch is much like that, a Vista, where
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:29.920]   a nagging, and in that case, tech blogger led Cabal of disappointed voices.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920]   I love this.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920]   He's a good writer.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.920]   Yeah, it's funny.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:38.280]   A nagging Cabal of disappointed voices dominated the discussion at launch in torpedoed the
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.440]   product before it had a chance, you agree?
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.440]   It's kind of what's happening.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:48.000]   I'm reminded of the-- I don't know why Microsoft-- this whole thing is somewhat baffling to
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   me.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.840]   Well, that's what Paul's always said.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.520]   It's a bubble on Microsoft's part.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.040]   They just don't seem to handle this stuff well.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.200]   They're not a social company.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.000]   They don't listen to the users.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   They don't listen to the critics.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   They don't listen to anybody pretty much.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   They do the problem.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.240]   The problem is that they need to fire Steve Ballmer.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.640]   Steve Ballmer is not-- he's out of his depth, and they need a visionary guy.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.280]   I need to say it, but I think you're right.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:19.600]   I mean, Ballmer is going to quit one of these days, and it's probably going to be within
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.720]   the next few years, I'm guessing.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:23.920]   But who could run that company?
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:24.920]   It's a monster company.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.240]   I think what they should do-- I don't think they should fire Steve Ballmer.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:31.200]   I think they should divide the company into four separate operations, spin it off the
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.200]   stock.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:33.200]   I say it all the time.
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.200]   It used to be three companies.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.960]   Now, I think they can do four.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   What?
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960]   Consumer?
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   Consumer-- yeah.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:45.440]   Consumer, Xbox, gaming, enterprise with the mail and all the rest of it.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:51.680]   People love that exchange server, and I think the fourth one was maybe-- oh, now--
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.400]   The retail would be wonderful.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.400]   Retail.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.800]   I mean, there's different ways to divide it up.
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   But the company's too big, and as you said earlier in the show, when we went on the
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:04.120]   screw-go-d thing, it's like they're complaining about what Google's doing, and they're doing
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.200]   it at the same time, because they can't communicate.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:11.320]   The company is too unwieldy.
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.840]   And Ballmer can take the one company--
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.120]   Of course, all the techs.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.720]   You know, we'll find out December 6th, Tim Cook.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.440]   Maybe Brian Williams will ask Tim Cook this question.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.400]   Who should take over Microsoft?
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.720]   Tim Cook will be-- this would never have happened in the Steve Jobs era.
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:32.880]   Tim Cook has given a full interview to Brian Williams on his-- what is it called?
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.640]   The Rock Show.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.080]   Rock is called Rock Center or something.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.080]   Rock Center, yeah.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:46.320]   He apparently was-- they did a little tour of the Grand Central Store, the Apple Store
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   and Grand Central.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   Another new one.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:54.440]   And Brian Williams said that, unlike Steve Jobs, Tim Cook was able to walk across Grand
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:56.440]   Central Station completely unrecognized.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.640]   Of course he was.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.040]   Who knows who Tim Cook is?
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.200]   Once we got to the Apple Store, he said that all changed as devoted fans approached him
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:08.000]   and treated him like a rock star.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   There he is.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.160]   If you look at the video, walking across completely unrecognized, no flash mobs to greet him,
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:16.720]   no happy fans.
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.720]   And nobody throwing a pie at him.
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.960]   Nobody hit him with a pie either.
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.960]   So there's--
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.440]   Nobody caring about Brian Williams either.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.440]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.800]   They didn't even notice Brian Williams.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.960]   Well, without the cameras.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:34.080]   Anyway, this was taped, I guess, a few days ago and we'll air next week, December 6th.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.080]   What is that?
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   That's soon.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.560]   It looks like they should take out an ad.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.840]   I mean, this to me is just a publicity stunt for Apple.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:42.960]   Congratulations on getting a job well done.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.160]   But that's one of the things that is different.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:49.040]   Steve Ballber interview is not going to be something that normal people are interested
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.040]   in.
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.360]   But Tim Cook, people are very interested in Apple.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.640]   He's a boring guy.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.280]   Tim Cook, yeah.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.760]   So he's a piece of wood.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:03.960]   He's an operations guy.
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.840]   The guy who invented-- he lasted in first out kind of-- or whatever, the inventory program
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.000]   that he saves a lot of money.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.960]   Yeah, he talks like a politician.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.680]   He doesn't really ever go on any sort of--
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.200]   That's a good CEO does that.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.760]   It's the Eric Schmitz and the Steve Jobs of the world that are good for us.
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.680]   But I think bad for their companies, don't you think?
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.840]   I don't think Schmitz's bad.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   Schwell.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.840]   Schmit would say stuff.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.840]   Well, he does.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:29.840]   He's got a-- he's a--
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.320]   He would say stuff that really increased the creepy factor.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.000]   He still says weird stuff.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   He still says weird stuff.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.400]   Now, that makes good copy for all of us.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   I like him.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.400]   I like him.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.400]   I like him.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.400]   I've always liked the guy.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   But I don't think it's good for the company.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.160]   He interviews Larry Page doing this.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.160]   Zero.
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160]   Zero.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.160]   Smart.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.160]   A good CEO.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.160]   No, he's just used to-- he couldn't talk at all.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.160]   Remember that?
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.160]   What, months and months?
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.160]   But he can now.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.160]   His voice is bad.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.160]   Perfect CEO.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   Perfect CEO has no voice.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:58.880]   Although Jobs was-- see, Jobs was the exception that proves the rule because Jobs was very
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.680]   good marketer.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.680]   He was brilliant.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:02.680]   He was manipulating the media.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.200]   And he totally manipulated the media.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.320]   He played Walt Mossberg like a royal flush.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:13.600]   Well, Mossberg wasn't the only one that was on his speed dialer.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.000]   We're going to take a break.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.680]   Come back with more Amazon looking for $3 billion in loans.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.400]   Would you lend money to Amazon?
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.400]   All right.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.320]   Apparently you're not alone.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.520]   And why you might not want to leave your laptop in the hotel room anymore.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.400]   But first, let's see what we missed this week.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.120]   If you missed Twitch, be asleep.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.560]   On Twitch, I5 for the iPhone.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:42.560]   You have to--
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.560]   Christmas music radio is $199.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.120]   And you really need to want to listen to Christmas music for it to be worth it at all
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.120]   to you.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.320]   There are free alternatives in the app store, but honestly, they all seem pretty terrible.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.160]   And if you hate Christmas and want me to stop talking about it, your wish is granted.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.160]   Ebenezer.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.160]   Windows Weekly.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.560]   Are you using your Surface not on power?
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.560]   Right now, no.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.720]   In other words, see, that's what you're probleming about.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:08.720]   It keeps you asleep.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.560]   The Surface that's not plugged in is like an iPad.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.040]   It turns off like every 10 seconds.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.040]   Constantly.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.520]   So you notice that I'm constantly tapping.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.520]   That's why I asked.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.960]   So if you plug that thing in, you can change the power setting so it stays online.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:20.960]   That's what I do with mine.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.120]   Because it drives me crazy how often it turns off.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.120]   GizWage.
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.120]   Look at that.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   Completely depilated.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   Wow.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]   Wow.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   Boy.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.120]   But there is--
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120]   Smell that.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.120]   That is right.
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.440]   The burning means it's working.
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.440]   NSFW.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   I want a big star, Brian.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:46.560]   That's why we got our old pal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:51.800]   You know him from such shows as Heroes and Felicity, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.800]   Greg Gratberg.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:54.800]   Put that music back on.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.280]   Put that music back on.
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.280]   Sure.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.080]   Here, I'll play the curse belt music for you again.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:00.080]   There you go.
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.080]   There he is.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.080]   Done.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.320]   Just add water.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.760]   Holy crap.
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.960]   Pre-house ads.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:11.960]   House ads.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.320]   Hey, is Tom Merritt back there?
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.960]   Let's do something that's realistic and get a-- Tom Merritt.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:20.000]   Tom, you got some sort of news coming up for this week, Tom?
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   Hey, Leo.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   Thanks.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.600]   Here's a look at some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:24.600]   Tech News today.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:30.180]   Monday, December 3rd, the International Telecommunications Union starts their 12-day conference in
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.180]   Dubai.
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.200]   They're just going to do something like determine the fate of the internet at that.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.640]   But Tuesday, December 4th, Dark Knight Rises is out on Blu-ray.
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.160]   Thursday, December 6th, Applin, Samsung, discos their post-trial motions and injunction
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.160]   requests in court.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.400]   That's from the patent trial from last summer.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:52.240]   Also Gadget Live happens in San Francisco, and the Neo-GEO console is reborn.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:55.000]   The cartridge console has its worldwide release date.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.840]   Friday, December 7th, the Nintendo Wii Mini exclusive to Canada comes out for $100 and
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:04.980]   Saturday, December 8th, the Nintendo Wii U launches in Japan along with the TV service
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.980]   in Japan only.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:07.260]   Let's look at the week ahead.
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:08.260]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:09.580]   Thank you, Tom Merritt.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.620]   I got some booze for you, John.
[01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:16.820]   You could have the Crystal Head vodka signed by Dan Akrit actually accidentally smudged
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:18.900]   the signature at one point.
[01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.860]   So it just says, "Ankroid."
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:33.720]   Remember, the king cake lucky player imported king cake flavor vodka from New Orleans in
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.520]   the honor of all's coming up.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.600]   So make sure you tune in TNT with Tom McChon's way over there.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.800]   I was going to do a gag with him about liquor, but I guess it's not going to work.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.960]   TNT every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:53.780]   One, sorry, 1 p.m. Eastern time, 2,100 UTC for your daily dose of tech news.
[01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:54.780]   Which do you want?
[01:30:54.780 --> 01:31:01.420]   Do you want the king cake flavored vodka or what's in this bottle?
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:02.420]   It's careful.
[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.820]   The Dan Akrit signatures on the back.
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:05.220]   It's getting all smudged out.
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.220]   I know.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:07.220]   I had it giving it away.
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:12.220]   I didn't know it was signed when I took the bottle out of the box and I realized that
[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:13.220]   I feel bad.
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.060]   I actually have slighted Dan Akrit twice.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.660]   We were going to have him on Twitch.
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:21.880]   This is back in the old studio and he called in, but I didn't have the volume turned up
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:22.880]   on the phone.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:23.880]   Oh no.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.040]   And he was sitting there for like 10 minutes going, "Hello?
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.040]   Hello?
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.040]   I felt terrible.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.960]   Dan Akrit, I felt terrible.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   Ghostbusters."
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   Hmm.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.000]   Should we have him on another episode?
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.080]   We could try again.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:40.240]   What do you got the bangry birds for?
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.240]   All right.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:49.240]   So Amazon kind of went out to the markets and raised $3 billion selling bonds for the
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:55.460]   first time in 15 years, according to the SEC filing Amazon will use the proceeds for
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.400]   general corporate purposes.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.160]   That means we can spend it on anything we want.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:00.800]   Yeah, jet.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.300]   Could be but may not include repayment of debt, repurchase of outstanding shares of stock
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:11.100]   acquisitions, jet investments, working capital, investments in our subsidiaries and capital
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.780]   expenditures.
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:20.220]   One possible use is the purchase of the company's headquarters for more than $1.1 billion.
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:23.300]   You know who owns that campus in the Seattle area?
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:24.300]   Microsoft.
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:25.300]   Paul Allen.
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:26.300]   Oh.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.620]   He needs a billion dollars like he needs a hole in the head.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.740]   Well, that's how he makes his money.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:38.380]   Would you loan, Amazon currently has more than $5 billion in cash and very little debt.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:40.420]   Would you lend Amazon money?
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.420]   Yeah, who wouldn't?
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.620]   I think Jeff Bezos is a genius.
[01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:45.540]   I do think he's a genius.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:49.820]   But I think also tough times might be ahead.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.300]   Well, there's going to be tough times for everybody else then.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.060]   And I think Amazon will have the edge because there's every, you know, if you talk about
[01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:59.620]   low price and convenience.
[01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:04.940]   You know, I just read an article that talking about prime loses them a ton of money.
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:05.940]   You know that.
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:06.940]   Good.
[01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:11.940]   I'm a prime member.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:12.940]   I was fine with me.
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:13.940]   So many things that Amazon does lose money.
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:14.940]   Their tablets lose money.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:15.940]   Prime loses money.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:21.260]   They really keep close to the, they invest everything into future business.
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:23.940]   It's really amazing that they have any cash at all actually.
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:24.940]   Okay.
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:30.380]   Now that works for a while.
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:31.900]   Doesn't after a while.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.100]   So here's the deal with prime.
[01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:39.900]   They took a write down of I think $400 million on shipping last year.
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:41.780]   And it's presumed that much of that was prime.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:46.380]   I just read an article on, let me see if I can find this.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:47.380]   This is from NPR.
[01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:50.300]   So actually I guess it was audio.
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:55.700]   But people, by the way, somebody in the chat was going to short with a short Amazon.
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.940]   This is like been tried and well, they failed.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.940]   They failed.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:00.940]   They short them for a long time.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:01.940]   You don't know when it's going to turn.
[01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:02.940]   It's going to fall out.
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:06.340]   I mean, eventually squeezed out in a short, you're getting no money.
[01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:10.660]   So prime for 79 bucks a year and I'm a member, you're a member, you're a member.
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:11.660]   Everybody's a member.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:13.580]   Tim is, are you a prime?
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:16.340]   Of course you're a boss of Amazon boxes surrounding my feet right now.
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:19.380]   So it's a brilliant strategy because it means you go to Amazon first because you're going
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:21.500]   to get free tonight, two day shipping.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:22.660]   Yeah, which is great.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.660]   Not everything on many things.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:29.180]   So NPR did a little survey trying to figure out, well, actually this is according to Wall Street
[01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:34.500]   Journal, what the most expensive shipping could be that you're saving money on.
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:43.260]   And it's a 1500 pound gun safe that you could buy on Amazon.com.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.460]   And the shipping would be free on this.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.420]   Costs Amazon, I think several hundred dollars.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:55.580]   But we don't know because Amazon may have a special deal.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.580]   But they have a special deal.
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:58.580]   There's no doubt about that.
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:08.980]   So the Canon safe, the C O 54 commander series premium 90 minute fire safe and gloss champagne.
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:09.980]   It's a beauty.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.660]   Three quarters of a ton.
[01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:13.660]   Wow, nice.
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:20.060]   Shipping is free because it's Amazon Prime.
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:22.700]   Can you imagine the, do you get it in two days?
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:23.700]   Yes.
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:26.460]   Imagine somebody driving up with that thing.
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:32.420]   It costs three thousand six hundred ninety nine dollars for the safe on the porch.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:33.940]   Who even on the porch?
[01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:34.940]   Good luck.
[01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:35.940]   Get moving it.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:39.220]   Now, if you buy it from optics, planet, you don't buy it.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:43.780]   If you don't buy a prime, it costs eleven hundred bucks to ship it.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:49.820]   But if you get from Amazon Prime, eleven hundred bucks, see eleven hundred bucks on shipping.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:55.180]   So the point is that Amazon is losing almost half a billion dollars a year on shipping costs
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:56.420]   according to their own.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.380]   So, I mean, where do you make that up?
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:00.380]   How do you make that up?
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:01.380]   It's not.
[01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:06.860]   Do you think that they're making so much money from the people who are shipping toilet paper?
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:08.220]   I have no idea how they're making it.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:12.940]   The worst case scenario is that they, and this is, this is kind of mirrored in the book
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.020]   publishing industry.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:18.660]   The worst case scenario, the darkest or most negative spin on this is that they're trying
[01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:21.300]   to run everybody else out of business.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:22.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:23.300]   And that's where you make it up.
[01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:25.540]   If you're the last guy standing, then you make it up.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:31.180]   When you're the last source of books and the last source of stuff that can be shipped,
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:33.020]   then you can charge anything you want.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.580]   That's probably unfair.
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.580]   But it's a little difficult.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.580]   It's a little difficult.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.580]   I like it.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.580]   It's a little difficult.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.580]   In some cases, it's dumping in some cases, right?
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.580]   Yes.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:44.260]   I mean, it feels that way in a lot of cases.
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:46.740]   Publishing certainly does.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:53.260]   When, didn't Netscape accuse Microsoft of, because it was giving away in an explorer,
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:57.300]   of doing the very same thing, didn't Intel get in trouble for that?
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.900]   I mean, this is in the European Union.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:00.980]   They paid a huge fine.
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:03.180]   This is, you sell below cost.
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.820]   They're not selling below cost though.
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:09.180]   They're selling cheap, but they're not selling below cost.
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:10.660]   Well, the shipping is below cost.
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.660]   It's true they are.
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:17.340]   They're selling books below cost in many cases, and they're selling tablets below cost.
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:22.460]   And who knows if they're losing money, you know, if you sell, if you take a bath on shipping,
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:25.580]   it feels like they're selling that safe below cost.
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:30.460]   By the way, if you're willing for fashion stuff, it doesn't account domestically.
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:32.300]   It's not just for prime members, by the way.
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:33.300]   You can get that.
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.420]   If you don't want it in two days, even if you're not a prime member, you get the free super
[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.500]   saver shipping.
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.820]   It's free shipping on that thing, no matter what.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.580]   And there's a sort of the company.
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:45.580]   I, I, I,
[01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:50.020]   Read Hastings recently said that Amazon is losing up to a billion dollars a year from this
[01:37:50.020 --> 01:37:55.020]   streaming video.
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:38:01.020]   And so that's basically them trying to go after Netflix and in the same way that Mike was saying,
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:05.020]   trying to run them out of business by being cheaper than them and offering the same service.
[01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:08.020]   But ultimately they're losing a lot of money on that too, I think.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:11.020]   So here's the, here's the, I, I misstated the loss.
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:16.020]   Amazon reported $636 million in shipping losses in the quarter ending September 30th, 2.8 billion
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:19.020]   dollars in shipping losses in the past year.
[01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:25.500]   So 2.8 billion dollars in shipping losses, that's 4.6% of its sales.
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:31.860]   They reported a net of 200, a net loss in that quarter of $274 million had they not had
[01:38:31.860 --> 01:38:36.980]   the shipping cost, they would have had a profit of a half a billion on shipping.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.980]   They're in higher notes.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:41.300]   There's total years to be to take all the money they make from selling all this stuff
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:46.540]   and books and everything and to take that money and squeeze the hell out of all their
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:53.260]   competitors by having impossible, impossibly low prices on everything and free shipping.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.740]   That seems to be their whole business model.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.740]   Okay.
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:56.740]   Here we are.
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:57.740]   What is the business model?
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:58.740]   Okay.
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.340]   Revenue 57 billion grows profit 10 billion.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:02.980]   So how they losing money?
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:04.940]   I'm looking at the, at the income statement here.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:05.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:06.940]   They're not losing money.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:09.420]   I thought they were losing money on shipping that quarter.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.980]   That was the September 30th quarter.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.860]   So maybe they made money another time.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:13.860]   They make money.
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:18.300]   They're profit they make and then they use that cash instead of doing what Apple does,
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.460]   which has what a hundred must be $150 billion in cash by now.
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.300]   Instead of not quite, but almost anything.
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:28.900]   Cash and being massively profitable like Apple, they take that money and they have free shipping
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:30.380]   and take a bath on shipping.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:34.340]   They subsidize their tablets with their losing money on their subsidized books, which they're
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.340]   losing money on.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:38.260]   They subsidize all these other things that lose money on because nobody else can compete
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.940]   with that.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:43.700]   But this only turns for them if they put everybody out of business.
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:44.700]   It's turning out, it's fine.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:47.500]   They're making 10 billion in profit.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:49.940]   Gross profit 10 billion.
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.540]   What's the problem?
[01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:55.700]   But if you're a cat in a quarter, if you're a competitor, if you're a competitive catalog,
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:56.700]   it's a problem.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:58.900]   And if you're a book publisher, it's a problem.
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:01.740]   And you know, it's a problem for their competitors.
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:04.460]   I mean, like you said, Jeff Bezos is a genius.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.140]   This is a, this is a brilliant idea.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.060]   So we're going to loan him the three billion.
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:10.300]   We're going to give him the three billion bond.
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.620]   We're going to loan him the money.
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:13.620]   All right.
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:16.540]   We're going to get the checks in the mail.
[01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.540]   So good article.
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:21.300]   It's 252 bucks a share.
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:22.300]   Good luck shortening.
[01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:24.700]   What's the price to earnings on that?
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:25.700]   138.
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:28.060]   The highest, I think that may be the highest.
[01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:29.060]   The trailing is 3000.
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:32.300]   I think that may be the highest in the market.
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:33.300]   3000.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.740]   Go ahead and find somebody better than that.
[01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:36.740]   That's pretty good.
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:37.740]   Yeah.
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.740]   138 bucks.
[01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:40.260]   138 price earnings.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.860]   I mean, times, times, yeah, it's a little high.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:44.620]   It's a little, yeah.
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.260]   Well, what's Facebook?
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:49.900]   That's telling everybody that there's going to be growing and growing.
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.500]   I don't personally see it, but okay.
[01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.260]   The stock may be overpriced.
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:41:06.540]   So a while ago, a hack, we talked about it, was revealed of, you know, the card keys in
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.540]   the hotels.
[01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:12.540]   Cody Brocious, who's a software developer at Mozilla, demonstrated this at Black Hat.
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:14.540]   He reversed engineered.
[01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:17.020]   There's a company called Onity that makes most of these.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:20.460]   He reversed engineers these card key locks that hotels use.
[01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:21.940]   He brings along a little device.
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:27.300]   They could be as small as a pan or actually a dry erase marker that you plug into the
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:29.340]   programmer port of these.
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:31.540]   They all have a port in the bottom and he can unlock that.
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:32.540]   Yeah, you can unlock that.
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:33.540]   There's a program.
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:35.540]   There's a port in the bottom of a stupid dandel.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:36.540]   Yes.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:37.540]   Things really.
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:40.780]   And apparently less than 50 bucks in parts, he showed how to do it.
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:45.220]   It reads the digital key that provides access to the lock and opens it instantaneously.
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:50.020]   And apparently, according to Forbes, there have been a number of hotel break-ins lately.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.020]   There it is.
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:52.260]   There's the dry erase marker.
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:56.460]   You stick that in the bottom and boom, the door is open.
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:57.460]   There apparently have been.
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:59.300]   That's what I call a serious bug.
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:00.300]   Yes.
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:01.300]   So what's the fix?
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:05.500]   Well, Onity says we're not going to ship a fix, but we are going to give you some putty.
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.260]   You could stick in the epoxy putty.
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:08.260]   Putty.
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:12.700]   You can stick in the bottom of these locks that at least keep people from sticking anything.
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:15.700]   Look at that.
[01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:16.700]   There it is.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.100]   There's the hole we're showing video.
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.740]   This is from Forbes.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.980]   Excuse duct tape.
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:22.980]   Duct tape.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:25.900]   Just tape it up.
[01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:32.580]   Some people are kind of mad at Abrocious, actually, because he did not contact Onity before he
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.580]   revealed this.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:36.380]   Oh, nice.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:43.220]   And of course, there's many, many, many millions of these locks or hundreds of thousands of
[01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:44.980]   these locks in use.
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:47.860]   Seems unlikely that Onity's going to replace them all.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.860]   I wouldn't think.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:49.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:54.140]   So basically, you should probably put your laptop in the safe.
[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:55.940]   That could be packed.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:56.940]   Yet.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:03.500]   The other lesson for the hotel industry is if there's a Black Hat conference in town,
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:04.500]   don't.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:05.500]   Don't.
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:09.980]   You know, Brocious not only didn't alert Onity to its security flaw before his presentation,
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:15.180]   he licensed the technique for $20,000 to the locksmith training institute.
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.980]   Oh, that's actually a pretty good idea.
[01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:17.980]   Wow.
[01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:18.980]   Very strong.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:20.740]   More than a year before he made it public.
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:22.060]   They train law enforcement.
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:23.900]   So I mean, that's, you know, it's not giving it to the hackers.
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.860]   It's giving it to the good guys.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:26.860]   Brocious.
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:32.460]   Yeah, because we all know that police have never gone in and planted evidence.
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:33.460]   No agenda show.com.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.460]   No agenda show twice.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.460]   It's there.
[01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:42.780]   Anyway, I just, I guess a word of warning.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:45.020]   Apparently it's fairly easy.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:46.420]   You can hide it as you saw in that video.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.180]   You can hide it in a dry race marker.
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:50.060]   Fifty bucks worth of parts.
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:53.100]   His Brocious said, Hey, we don't know how long hackers, the bad guys have known about
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:54.380]   this probably for a long time.
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.380]   I just found it.
[01:43:55.380 --> 01:43:56.820]   It doesn't mean they haven't known about it.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:58.780]   What's the point of the dry race marker?
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:00.540]   Just somewhere to well, because you can carry that around.
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:01.540]   We carried around anyway.
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.540]   Last time you were frisked.
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:06.260]   You get caught.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:07.460]   The hotel detected.
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:09.060]   What is this dry race marker for?
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:13.860]   Yeah, well, I'm a whiteboard artist.
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:15.660]   I carry it around all the time.
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:16.660]   Enthusiast.
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:17.660]   Enthusiast.
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:21.860]   I was like to mark things now that they arrest you for being a tagger.
[01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:24.340]   Yeah, right.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:26.660]   Do I smell dry race?
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:29.100]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:34.100]   Coming back with more.
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.100]   Right.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:39.820]   And do you know you don't do the you don't do the market watch PC magazine?
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:45.540]   You do a lot of writing, but you do like that guy with a beard or anything like that.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:46.540]   Do you do that?
[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:47.540]   Well, the tech hippie.
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:48.540]   The tech hippie.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:49.540]   Or the tech the tech.
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:50.540]   The tech grouch.
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:51.540]   You don't do that.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.540]   You don't even know the name of the character.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:53.540]   There's two characters.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:54.540]   There's two.
[01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:56.540]   Yeah, the tech hippie and the tech grouch.
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.220]   You don't do that anymore.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:44:59.740]   I wish I did.
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:01.100]   It was nobody watched it.
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:02.100]   Was that rude?
[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:03.100]   Nobody watched it.
[01:45:03.100 --> 01:45:04.100]   Nobody cared.
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:06.380]   See, that's the problem with podcasting.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:07.380]   Nobody watches it.
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:09.540]   Well, this wasn't very well marketed.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.420]   I don't think it's marketing.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:12.780]   Everything's marketing.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:13.780]   I don't know.
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.420]   You see this nice earring?
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:17.180]   I mean, what does that call?
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:18.180]   A pinky ring.
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:19.180]   Pinky ring.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:22.180]   That's marketing.
[01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:24.180]   I think I should go to the track.
[01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:25.180]   The seven-curret amethyst.
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.180]   But that baby on there.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.180]   Yeah, baby.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.860]   You ever have any gadgets you want to get rid of?
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.380]   This is Tim Stevens needs to know about this.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:32.380]   He probably has.
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:34.380]   I'm betting you you have a drawer right in that room right there.
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:40.220]   A drawer full of old phones and iPods and all sorts of stuff.
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:41.220]   I might.
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:43.220]   I might have multiple drawers.
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.220]   I bet you do.
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:48.940]   I don't know if he still has this, but for years, rented a room above a gas station.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.300]   I always like to bring that.
[01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:51.300]   I love that.
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:53.300]   I'll never forget that.
[01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:57.140]   That's where we're operating a company called World Wear 3.
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:59.180]   You still have the room?
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.180]   No.
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:01.500]   I got rid of it years ago.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:02.500]   Like decades ago.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:07.460]   It wasn't decades, but it was in 1992 that you took me up there because I said, "John,
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:08.460]   I need a modem."
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:11.260]   And he said, "Come on out."
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:13.260]   John, we got modems.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:14.260]   You want modems?
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.260]   We got modems.
[01:46:15.260 --> 01:46:17.220]   We got shelves of modems.
[01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:22.620]   Anyway, this is not a sensible plan because I got to tell you, I bet you if you still
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.660]   had those gadgets, there'd be, "Who needs a modem now?"
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:26.660]   Somebody.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:31.820]   Strike while the iron's hot and sell those gadgets now so you can buy new gadgets.
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.220]   That's where gazelle.com is so great.
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:36.420]   I love gazelle.com.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.420]   Visit gazelle.com.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.180]   They simplified the interfaces very straightforward.
[01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:44.260]   You got an iPhone, a cell phone, an iPad, an iPod, a MacBook or a Mac that you, let's
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:46.460]   say, "Okay, you got in your drawer.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:49.100]   You got a BlackBerry rim.
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:51.740]   Maybe it's time to get rid of that.
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:54.540]   I actually have a torch in my drawer."
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.540]   Good.
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.820]   This is the edition I never used the damn thing.
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:46:58.820]   Pre-of-water damage.
[01:46:58.820 --> 01:47:00.820]   Let's see what that gazelle will give me now.
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.020]   I bet you have $80.
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:03.020]   $85.
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:05.420]   You've done this before?
[01:47:05.420 --> 01:47:06.660]   No, I just guessed.
[01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:07.900]   Well, then dump that thing.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:08.900]   It's $80.
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:09.900]   Just sitting there.
[01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:11.740]   I didn't think it was worth anything.
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:17.260]   Now, if you've got an old iPhone, let's say you have a few Nokia phones, don't you
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:18.500]   line around, John?
[01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.500]   Yeah.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.500]   Yeah, I bet you have.
[01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:24.220]   Because you were really into that E71, right?
[01:47:24.220 --> 01:47:25.220]   How about a Lumi?
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:26.220]   Oh, I know.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.220]   Let's say I did this.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:33.180]   I bought an N9 because I, and then now I want the Lumia because it's much nicer.
[01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:35.500]   Let's see if I could sell that N9 for anything.
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:37.420]   No, free of water damage, yeah?
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.420]   Look at that.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:40.580]   I wonder if that's worth more or less than BlackBerry.
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:41.580]   124 bucks.
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580]   I think that's a collector's item.
[01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:43.580]   You might want to hang on to VN9.
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:44.780]   You think?
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:48.780]   I think so because that in the long run is going to be kind of known as an oddity.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:49.780]   So I think you might want to hang on to that.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:52.420]   And this is why Tim has a drawer full of crap.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:54.420]   I got it too.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:55.420]   I used to have this attitude.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:57.020]   That's going to be a collector's item.
[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:58.220]   Really a bad idea.
[01:47:58.220 --> 01:47:59.220]   Yes.
[01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:00.780]   Hey, it's like me.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:01.780]   He comes up.
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:02.780]   Oh, I see.
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:04.660]   I've got another collector's item you're keeping.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.460]   I do say this crap out.
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:10.180]   I do save seminal phones like the first iPod, the first iPhone.
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:11.660]   I do save those in our collection.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:15.700]   We have a little museum here, but that's not, that's me and that's Tim because we're, but
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:20.380]   a normal person, you got an iPhone 4s and you're ready to get an iPhone 5.
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:24.260]   Let's go see what that AT&T iPhone 4s is worth.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:25.940]   215 bucks.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:27.620]   That's going to get you the iPhone 5 right there.
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:28.620]   Boom.
[01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:29.620]   Bada bing, bada boom.
[01:48:29.620 --> 01:48:30.620]   Now here's a beauty part.
[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:31.620]   You throw all this stuff in a box.
[01:48:31.620 --> 01:48:32.620]   They send you the box.
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:33.820]   They send you the shipping label.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:35.740]   These quotes are good for 30 days.
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:40.260]   So if you wanted to buy the new iPad and, but you don't want to get, you don't want
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.820]   to send your old iPad into the new one comes.
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:43.820]   Keep it.
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:49.020]   You got 30 days to get the data off of it to, you know, get the new iPad and then you send
[01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.020]   it to Gazelle.
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:51.380]   They're guaranteed for 30 days.
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:53.020]   By the way, they do wipe the data for you.
[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:54.020]   They check it.
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:55.180]   They take care of all of that stuff.
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:57.140]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:59.260]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:03.300]   They pay shipping on anything worth more than a buck and they'll pay you top dollar.
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:04.500]   They're really a good company.
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:09.900]   They have paid almost $50 million now to over a hundred thousand customers.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:10.900]   I know.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:11.900]   That's pretty good, huh?
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.340]   It's a business we should be.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:14.860]   They have a better model than Amazon.
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:19.660]   I got to tell you, for over 400,000 customers, Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.980]   Do it today because I don't care what Tim says.
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:24.180]   That N9 is not getting more valuable.
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:26.180]   I disagree.
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:27.180]   You think it's...
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:28.180]   Long tail.
[01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:29.180]   Real long tail.
[01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:32.900]   Like, close to apocalypse, you know, people are going to be needing...
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:37.100]   Well, after the zombie apocalypse, people are going to say, "Anybody got an N9?"
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:38.100]   "Kill."
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.100]   "Yay, N9."
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:40.100]   "Kill all humans."
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:41.100]   What do you think?
[01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.620]   Do you like the DNA?
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:43.780]   Should I be looking at that, Tim?
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:44.780]   Is that a hot?
[01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:47.020]   That's the new HTC fund to be Verizon only.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:49.420]   Yeah, the DNA is a fantastic phone.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.620]   I mean, it's really well made.
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:52.260]   The screen is amazing on it.
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:53.260]   Tim, A-Z.
[01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:56.700]   I just bought myself a new Verizon phone and I went with the Note 2 though because of the
[01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:57.700]   battery life.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:02.220]   The Droid DNA, unfortunately, the battery life is not exemplary on that and it's not
[01:50:02.220 --> 01:50:04.900]   replaceable battery so once it dies, you know.
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:05.900]   Why did I do that?
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.300]   The Note 2 is much better battery life.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:09.300]   It's not as nice looking.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:10.300]   It doesn't feel as nice as the hand.
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:12.140]   The display isn't as nice.
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:15.580]   But for me, that was the one that I went with because I was looking for, you know, a big,
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:17.380]   big phone with a stylish phone.
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:18.380]   Jason's got one.
[01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:19.380]   It's great.
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:20.380]   I bought the Note 2.
[01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.860]   No, Jason has the DNA.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:23.700]   I think to review.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700]   I want to-- Oh, good.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.700]   We'll review it on before you buy.
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.700]   I think so.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:27.700]   And all about Android.
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:28.700]   Yeah, so you can go over to Jason.
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:29.700]   Oh, bring it over here.
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:30.700]   It's a Verizon phone though.
[01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:31.700]   Well, it's a great phone.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:35.180]   I don't mind Verizon because LTE is so fast in Verizon but it's not good for travel.
[01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:37.740]   Oh, I didn't even know we had one.
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:38.740]   This is the Droid DNA.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:41.900]   You guys don't even know what you have in this place.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.740]   It's called Gazelle.
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:45.740]   Is it in that box?
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.820]   You can't even open it.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:48.820]   Everybody's doing this.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:52.820]   Apple influence the whole industry.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:54.660]   They all do these airtight boxes now.
[01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:55.660]   Yeah.
[01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:56.660]   It's like perfect.
[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:59.220]   I bet you Apple invented the machines and now licenses it.
[01:50:59.220 --> 01:51:01.820]   You can't get this thing open because it's airtight.
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:03.820]   What's the point?
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:04.820]   Wow.
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:07.900]   It's to increase your expectations so that that moment of unveiling is--
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:08.900]   Exactly.
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.380]   And everybody's doing the same thing.
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:11.380]   Motorola is doing this.
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:13.860]   We're the first thing you see in Apple invented this.
[01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:17.220]   The first thing you see is the device sitting there beautifully.
[01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:19.380]   Steve Jobs even talked about this in the Isaac's biography.
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:23.460]   Then they got the little tab and you pull it out and they hide all the wires and stuff
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.460]   underneath.
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.300]   This is an Apple packaging.
[01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.020]   They ought to sue them.
[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:29.740]   I don't think you can sue on packaging.
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:30.740]   Really?
[01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:31.740]   You could sue on any companies.
[01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:34.740]   Anyway, so I was interested.
[01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:35.740]   It could be enough.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:37.940]   This is heavy enough seriously as a package.
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.260]   There could be a phone in it.
[01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.700]   That you could sell it to somebody with no phone in it.
[01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.340]   Which happens all the time by the way.
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:44.340]   And then they get a thing.
[01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:45.940]   And it takes them so long to open it.
[01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.540]   You're long gone.
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:49.180]   Just make sure you got a bicycle nearby.
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:50.580]   There you go.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:51.580]   Wow.
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:53.500]   It definitely could be used as a scam.
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.500]   Okay.
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.340]   Just a little tip from John C. Devorak.
[01:51:56.340 --> 01:51:58.860]   Did you get Verizon, Tim?
[01:51:58.860 --> 01:51:59.860]   You did.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:00.860]   Yes, I did.
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:01.860]   I'm on Verizon.
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:03.340]   I'm actually grandfathered into their old unlimited data plans.
[01:52:03.340 --> 01:52:05.220]   So I'm pretty well stuck on Verizon at this point.
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:07.660]   But up here in Albany, we have really great LTE speeds.
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:09.780]   So I'm quite happy with Verizon.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.660]   And I'm pretty happy with the Note 2 so far.
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:13.140]   I used it all day yesterday.
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:18.300]   You started at 6 AM and finally plugged in the charger at like 11 PM and it still had
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:19.300]   20% charge.
[01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:20.300]   Can you do tethering?
[01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:21.300]   Yes, you can.
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.300]   You can do tethering.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:24.100]   You had to pay extra for it though.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:25.300]   Oh, you have to pay extra.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:26.300]   You have to do that with T-Mobile.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:27.300]   That's perfect of course.
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.780]   But then you have to use T-Mobile.
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:33.100]   If you could use T-Mobile with Verizon's network, now that would be a deal.
[01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:34.460]   That would be a deal.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:37.100]   Is LTE good up in the upper New York state too?
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:38.100]   It's fantastic.
[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.380]   There's very good coverage and not that many people with LTE devices yet.
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:43.580]   So I typically see a 15 to 20 megabytes.
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:45.300]   Actually, I'm over LTE right now.
[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:50.140]   I use LTE as my home internet access because I am indeed way out in the boonies.
[01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:51.900]   And so we use LTE to the home here too.
[01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.260]   Now here's the catch.
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:59.500]   If you get a subsidized Note 2 from Verizon or any new phone for Verizon, they will turn
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.300]   off your unlimited plan, won't they?
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.300]   Yep.
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:05.700]   That's why I had to pay full retail price, which was a little bit painful to do.
[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:09.740]   But at least I did get, you know, if I'm looking at cubic inches, I got a large phone
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:10.740]   for my money.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:11.740]   So I guess I can look at it that way.
[01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:13.340]   Well, and they charge 300 bucks for it anyway.
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:14.340]   So you're only paying what?
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:15.340]   What'd you pay for?
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:16.340]   600?
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:17.340]   699.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:18.340]   699.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.340]   Yeah.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:20.340]   That is weird.
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:26.020]   So they even admit this that we will turn off your unlimited plan unless you buy it unsubsidized.
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:30.460]   Yeah, you're forced to go into one of their new plans, which are all tiered.
[01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:35.060]   They also have their family sharing plans, which are, you know, for some people, they
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:36.060]   can work out pretty well.
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:39.700]   But ultimately, you know, all the offerings are tiered at this point, which to me, they
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:44.260]   doesn't work because I do a lot of streaming through Spotify or Netflix on the road.
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:48.220]   So I definitely am one of the few who actually would go over their data caps and would be
[01:53:48.220 --> 01:53:49.220]   paying quite a bit more.
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:54.140]   So for me, it makes sense to pay full retail price for the phone and then keep my own data
[01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:58.140]   plan, which is, you know, just the way it's going to be, at least until they've finally
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:01.660]   come with some way, I'm sure, to force all of us who are grandfathered in to get out.
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:02.660]   Oh, they'll get you.
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:03.660]   Oh, of course.
[01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:04.660]   You said something interesting.
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:05.820]   Are you on LTE right now?
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:08.900]   You use this is your home internet.
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:09.900]   Yes.
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:10.900]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:14.700]   Verizon launched very quietly launched LTE to the home, actually.
[01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:18.180]   And there are it's available nationwide, but they're not really making a big deal out
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:22.500]   of it simply because, you know, it's more expensive than your average cable or files
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:23.500]   connection.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:27.540]   If indeed you can get files, I am in a place where I can't get cable or files.
[01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:30.700]   So it was either that or get like a T3 run to my house.
[01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:32.900]   And this is quite a bit cheaper than that.
[01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:34.180]   And the speeds are quite good.
[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:35.180]   It's really good.
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:36.180]   Look at that.
[01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:37.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:38.180]   You get a great picture.
[01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:39.180]   And Africa.
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:40.180]   Thank you.
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:41.180]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:45.420]   We get better connections to people in Africa or on LTE than somebody using Comcast down
[01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:46.420]   the street.
[01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:47.420]   I don't understand.
[01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:48.420]   It's true.
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:49.420]   It's true.
[01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:50.420]   Tim Stevens, we're going to let you go to dinner.
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:51.420]   Thank you so much.
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:52.420]   I appreciate your sticking around.
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:53.420]   So late.
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:54.420]   Thank you.
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:55.420]   I'm happy to be here.
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:57.420]   It's so nice to have you, Tim Stevens, editor in chief of Engadget.
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:54:58.420]   I had Engadget.com.
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:00.620]   I don't need to say much more than that.
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:03.540]   That's one of the most prestigious jobs in tech journalism.
[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:04.540]   Thank you.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:06.500]   Can I say a quick congratulations before I go?
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:07.500]   Yes.
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:10.500]   I wonder Peter Rohan and his wife, Jill, had a baby boy Friday.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.820]   I wanted to say congratulations to those two.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:14.060]   I didn't know that.
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:15.060]   That's great.
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:16.060]   Yep.
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:17.060]   So congratulations.
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:18.940]   I didn't even know Peter was married.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.140]   So he keeps his a sly cove.
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:23.180]   They got us on a gift now.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.500]   That is really great.
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.020]   But Peter's a regular on the show.
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:30.940]   I think he's one of the smartest guys out there, founded both Gizmodo and Engadget.
[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:33.740]   And now he's at gdgtgadget.com.
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:34.740]   Wow.
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:35.740]   Wow.
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:36.740]   That's great.
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:38.620]   And what's his wife's name?
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.620]   Jill Fernbacher.
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:41.940]   She runs in habitat, actually.
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:42.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:45.300]   Well, I'm glad you mentioned that, Tim.
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:46.300]   And congratulations, Peter.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:49.020]   And Jill, that's fantastic.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:53.740]   From Nairobi, Kenya, Mr. Mike Elgin, you could find him on Google+, that's where he
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:58.420]   lives, google.me/plusMikeElgin.
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.940]   And thanks for having me on.
[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:00.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:01.940]   Amazing.
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:06.220]   Again, you said that the bandwidth was good, but occasionally it goes out for two hours.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:10.580]   Yeah, occasionally there's a power failure often associated with weather.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:12.860]   Right now it's pouring rain.
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:14.100]   So we've been pretty lucky.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:17.100]   But yeah, it's a great connection for the most part.
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:21.500]   Now, if you go to a coffee shop, there are no good connections in public coffee shops
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.460]   and stuff like that.
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.540]   The house I'm in here happens to have a really great connection.
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:30.420]   So it can be spotty, but for the most part, it's amazing.
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:33.140]   What's your host paying a month for this connection?
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:35.020]   I don't know.
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:36.020]   Probably a lot.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:37.380]   You don't know that it's a lot.
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:38.580]   Could be low.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:39.580]   We don't know.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:40.580]   We don't know.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.780]   And what time is it in Nairobi?
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:44.860]   It is now 4.10 AM.
[01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:45.860]   All right.
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:47.860]   Oh, I am so sorry.
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:48.860]   Good morning.
[01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:51.180]   Mike, you stayed up all night.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:54.180]   You just got up early.
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:55.180]   One or the other or both?
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:56.180]   I'm not sure.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:57.180]   I am not.
[01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.260]   But he's going back to bed as we speak.
[01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:02.740]   I'm actually falling asleep right now.
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:03.740]   Mike, I'm so grateful.
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:05.740]   I had no idea it was that late in Nairobi.
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:10.420]   Thank you so much for being here and a belated happy birthday to you.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:11.420]   Thank you very much.
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:12.420]   I appreciate it.
[01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:16.980]   I know that because I follow you on Google+, and every time I go to Google.com, I keep
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:20.900]   saying Mike, you want to send him a car.
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:23.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:26.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:29.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:30.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:31.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:32.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:33.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:34.900]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:35.700]   Mike, you want to send him a car?
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:36.700]   Mike, it's not Russian.
[01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:37.700]   It's kind of Cyrillic.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.180]   I don't know what the hell that is.
[01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:41.180]   Macedonia, maybe?
[01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:42.180]   Macedonia.
[01:57:42.180 --> 01:57:43.180]   It's matchedonian.
[01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.180]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:45.180]   That's what it is.
[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.180]   Wow.
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:47.180]   Look at that.
[01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:48.180]   You're their main.
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:51.340]   They're main or mechatonia.
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.340]   Google me.
[01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:53.340]   San Nudid de Jezuku.
[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:54.340]   Somebody says Montenegro.
[01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:55.340]   Montenegro.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:56.340]   I'm going to Montenegro.
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:57.340]   You are when?
[01:57:57.340 --> 01:57:58.340]   This fall.
[01:57:58.340 --> 01:57:59.340]   All right.
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:00.340]   It's on the way to the Bosphorus.
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:03.620]   Ah, you're going to the Bosphorus, I understand.
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:07.500]   I'd see the Worek.org/blog.
[01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:08.900]   Channeldivorek.com.
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:10.460]   Channeldivorek.com.
[01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:12.300]   The real divorek on Twitter.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:14.180]   The real divorek on Twitter.
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:15.980]   Was there a not like a fake divorek?
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:17.540]   Yeah, there's a bunch of them.
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:18.540]   You're kidding.
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.540]   No, I just said screw it, I just used the real divorek.
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:21.540]   I think that's an honor.
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:58:22.540 --> 01:58:23.540]   Maybe.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:24.540]   Everyone should have that honor.
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:25.540]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:26.540]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoon.
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:27.540]   It's 3 p.m.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:28.540]   Pacific, 6 p.m.
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:29.540]   Eastern time, 4 a.m.
[01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:30.540]   Nairobi time.
[01:58:30.540 --> 01:58:35.500]   Actually, it's 2400 UTC, so it's midnight UTC.
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:36.500]   That's why it's so late.
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.500]   And you're two hours after UTC.
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.020]   Who's in the Brits?
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:41.020]   Wow.
[01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.020]   Lame the Brits.
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.620]   It's all their fault.
