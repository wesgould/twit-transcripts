[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   I'm Jason Snell, great tweet for you this week.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.480]   We've got Ben Brock Johnson, Andy and Naco Briana Wu.

[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560]   We're talking about Apple.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.480]   We're talking about Google, new phones, new rumors.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.320]   And also, who will speak for the bezels?
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.000]   Bezels' displays are everywhere.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.040]   We are going to have a really surprising debate about that.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.200]   It's all next, right here on "Twit."

[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.640]   Welcome back one and all to Twit this weekend tech.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.520]   I am not Leo Laport.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.520]   I am Jason Snell.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.360]   It is Labor Day weekend.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.400]   There are things going on.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.200]   It's a little bit quiet.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   It's the end of summer.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920]   But there's stuff to talk about.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.320]   And I'm here live in California.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.720]   Unfortunately, no one else is.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.520]   Fortunately, I have a wonderful collection of people
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.320]   in New England who are here via computer screen.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.520]   Let me introduce our wonderful guests
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.840]   on today's episode of Twit.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.440]   Andy Inaco is here.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.840]   Beloved technology industry pundit, regular appearances
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.320]   on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.280]   And always when I think of Boston, I think.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.520]   Andy Inaco, hi, pal.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.720]   You caught me at a good time.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   We just got the lobster plots in.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.120]   Good, good, good two day soak.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   And we got some blows.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.920]   So we're real happy over here.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.520]   Didn't understand a word of that.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.400]   Ben Brock Johnson is also here.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.920]   He does a podcast with another--
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.680]   a different, I believe, Massachusetts PBS radio station
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.840]   from the one-- what is it?
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.440]   Public radio station, then the one that Andy does.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.560]   We got lots of public radio here too.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.480]   Ben Brock Johnson, welcome.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.720]   Andy, thank you very much.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.920]   Andy and I are mortal enemies.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   Mortal massive.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   Only use its public radio.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   The public radio saw--
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.840]   intersoft fall league.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   That's right.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.120]   That's right.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.720]   That's right.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.520]   I don't get any--
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.920]   I don't get any of those games.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.800]   There's a rule about how much Pintar you can have on the bat.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.120]   If you read the rules, you wouldn't have used that bat.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.040]   I'm very sorry, but that's--
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.720]   It's not actually the WBUR Pintar scandal of 2014.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.320]   We don't want to talk about that.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.600]   Also, I have to say, very excited.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.920]   This guest is running for Congress in, yes?
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   Massachusetts.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.800]   It's Brianna Wu.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.840]   Hello.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.280]   That's right.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.960]   You can vote for me on Tuesday.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.000]   I'm really excited.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.280]   I'm going to get to vote for myself for Congress.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.680]   Look at this.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.200]   Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.320]   But before the show starts today, Jason,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.040]   I do have a couple of requests.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.640]   Since we're all Bostonians here, I just--
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.000]   I have this written down.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.840]   I wanted to ask you to please not insult our patron,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.560]   Saint Mark Wahlberg, today on the show.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   I would appreciate that.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.680]   Or Tom Brady.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.720]   It would just make us feel more comfortable.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.680]   And we will try to rein in our Boston selves
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.080]   and not spit or kick or drink or do anything like that
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   on the show today.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.920]   We've got that unlocked.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.240]   How do you feel about Ben Affleck?
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.720]   Can I say things about Ben Affleck?
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.160]   Ooh.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.440]   I'm fine with you.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.000]   I'm fine with you.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I'm not sick.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   All right.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.840]   That's a good--
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.000]   I like the-- my politic answer.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.480]   There.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.840]   That's a good--
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.520]   My third favorite Batman.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.360]   Or the live action Batman, I should say.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.120]   Live action.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.160]   Thank you for the footnote in the middle of your week
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.000]   praise for Ben Affleck.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.960]   Hey, let's talk about some technology topics.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.400]   How about that?
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.360]   That is why the people tune in on Labor Day weekend,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   if they are out there, which I'm sure they are.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.640]   I want to start with Apple, because first off,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.040]   I have spent my career writing and talking about Apple,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.200]   but also because we're in the silly season
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.000]   that is right before the big Apple event, which was announced,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.240]   it's going to be on September 12, a Wednesday.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.720]   They sent out an invitation to members of the media,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.640]   showing a golden ring that is basically the Apple Loop logo,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.880]   although that didn't stop people from joking
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.800]   that they're going to release a circular laptop.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.560]   That's probably not going to happen.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.040]   They will almost certainly release new iPhones, maybe iPads,
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.120]   probably new Apple watches as well.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.480]   And one of the reasons we know about the phone in the watch
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.680]   is because 9 to 5 Mac discovered basically-- let's just
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.600]   say somebody put some graphics up on--
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.320]   I think an Apple server somewhere using a gasable file name
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.520]   structure.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   And guess what?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.960]   Somebody was guessing.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.280]   And so 9 to 5 Mac has images of a new Apple watch
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.600]   with edge to edge.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.760]   It looks like basically the same shape of the Apple watch,
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.080]   but the screen goes edge to edge.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.280]   No bezels.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.000]   If you are an investor in bezels, by the way, I'm sorry.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.560]   It's a bad time for you.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.480]   And new versions of the iPhone X,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.560]   including a much larger version as well as a large non-Ole
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.080]   headset, an LCD version.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.200]   But there's an image of the two small and large iPhone
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.480]   tens as well.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.960]   So if you're an Apple and your job
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.040]   is keeping product security for just two more weeks
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.160]   and we'll get across the finish line,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.600]   well, Sam, the sad charm bonus playing for you.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.840]   But we've got the information.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.520]   We're on the outside.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.360]   We don't care.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.680]   We're not working at Apple.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.480]   So what does everybody think?
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.360]   New Apple stuff is on the horizon.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.280]   Andy, why don't we start with you?
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.040]   What's your read on what we know so far
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.800]   about what Apple's doing in a couple weeks?
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.320]   I like the news about the new Apple line,
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.880]   excuse me, the new iPhone line, especially the idea
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.200]   of having a humongously crazy stupid big iPhone X
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.320]   because I really missed having the iPad Mini to play with.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.200]   And so now you can sort of-- if it really
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.160]   is as big as they're saying, 6.5 inches diagonal,
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.400]   that will maybe give me some of that iPad Mini love
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.480]   that I've been missing out on for the past couple years.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.760]   And I also like the idea of doing an iPhone XS,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.440]   if that's really the name of it,
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.400]   basically finding a way to make something that is nearly
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.320]   as good as an iPhone X.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.520]   But why don't we just take away the things that don't necessarily
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.440]   affect performance?
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.640]   Like, what if we switch to an aluminum frame instead
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.560]   of a steel one?
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.200]   What if we switch to LCD instead of OLED?
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.360]   And be able to get the price way, way, way, way down.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.680]   Let everybody have a face ID.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.600]   Even the people who normally would buy the iPhone--
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.920]   the people last year who would have bought the iPhone 7
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.160]   or the iPhone 8, isn't it great that they can have
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.880]   the really cool notched screen that is the other thing that--
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.840]   see, my great grandfather, his first job as an Italian immigrant
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.040]   was on the factory floor, creating--
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.560]   creating notches out of screens, like the classical hand
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.120]   tooled methods that he'd brought with him from Italy.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.480]   And he would be out of a job now, because if you don't have it
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.720]   not screen, you are nothing.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.560]   So those are my two favorite things from the--
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.600]   what we think we know right now.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.000]   I spent-- what do you think about this?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.280]   Man, I just-- Jason, I know you love Apple.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.200]   I support you.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   But I'm so bored.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   This is a safe space.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   It's a safe space.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.700]   Be bored.
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.200]   It's safe to be bored.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.400]   It's a safe space.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.900]   OK.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.440]   It's safe to be in love.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.720]   I'm so bored.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.640]   I'm glad this is a safe space to say this.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.160]   Admittedly, I'm also an Android.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.080]   So I have my Pixel first generation.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.240]   I'm just holding onto that, waiting for that October 9th.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.120]   The other event--
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.240]   We'll get there.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.740]   Yes.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.240]   Yes.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:27.720]   We'll get there.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.040]   But I think what is fascinating to watch as I guess kind
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.480]   of an Apple outsider is just how much--
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.720]   they just do one thing.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.040]   They send out an invite with a circle on it.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.120]   And that becomes a huge conversation on Twitter
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.440]   for five days straight, which I think is amazing.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.800]   You have to give them that.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.720]   You have to give them what they do still matter
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.800]   is even tiny little design choices, which, frankly,
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.680]   as near as we can tell, that's what
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.200]   we're going to see in this event.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.720]   We're not going to see any huge leaps forward
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.480]   in small device computing technology here.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.320]   We're talking, again, as per usual,
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   about changes in bezel, disappearing bezel,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.040]   using a different metal that supposedly maybe
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.800]   will make the phone function better.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.760]   I guess I've just become that old guy yelling in a room
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.720]   by himself saying, show me something amazing.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.400]   And this is all incremental stuff, and that's fine.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.720]   But I guess, yeah, I've become that guy who's like,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.680]   I don't know, make it and turn it into a convincing virtual
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.360]   reality, augmented reality device.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.520]   Show me something amazing, and I'll
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.880]   be excited about Apple again.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.920]   Until then, I'm going to yawn a little bit.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.880]   Must be nice to send out an invitation
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.240]   to an event that has nothing in it of interest at all.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.280]   It's literally the logo for their new campus
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.520]   where they're holding the event.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.640]   And have people spend several days talking
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.000]   about your invitation?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.920]   If only a wedding saved the date invitation got so much.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.160]   But no, it's just Apple.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.920]   Brie, what do you think?
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.960]   Are you more interested in this than Ben is?
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.280]   So as you may know, over on Rocket,
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.600]   we're big believers in the rose gold lifestyle.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.240]   We love rose gold.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.920]   So that's-- I'm sorry I'm that Apple fan.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.040]   They're releasing my favorite color iPhone.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.080]   I'm going to buy the phone.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.880]   It's safe for you too.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.600]   I'll just go for a few.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.400]   Yes.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.240]   I also want to say I love the saddest thing about the server
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.480]   leak is where I found out about it.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.680]   I'm imagining what goes on in Guangzhou with the people
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.760]   actually assembling Apple devices where they're
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.840]   padded down in X-ray as they're going into the factory
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.240]   to build these things.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.160]   And then back here in America, somebody just didn't think
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.040]   and crypt the server before everything is going live.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.320]   And it all gets out.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.520]   I find that deeply ironic.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.720]   As far as this generation of iPhone,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.560]   we've had some real turkey-esque years, in my opinion.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.360]   The 5S and moving to 32-bit.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.040]   And touch ID at first.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.680]   I don't think that was the best phone.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.000]   But for this year, with the different sizes of phone,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.640]   I'm actually-- I'm really excited about this.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.680]   I do think there's some room for a faster processor in the iPhone
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.200]   10.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.720]   I think it does stutter just a little bit.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.280]   And for me, even though I know the screen in it
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.840]   is bigger than the old 7 Plus, I just
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.040]   liked that bigger form factor.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.120]   For me, on my campaign, I use my phone so much more
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.600]   than I use the Mac we have dedicated to it.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.360]   So the idea of having more battery life and more screen,
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.560]   that's a product I'm very, very excited
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.360]   to buy, which is why I was sad that it looks like there's
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.360]   going to be no pencil support.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   Yeah, I'm sad about that, too.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.560]   That's our report.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.120]   Who knows?
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.040]   It seemed to me like if they're going
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.120]   to do a giant iPhone 10, which is what we've seen,
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.640]   it seems like that's going to happen,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.880]   that that would be a great time to do a revision of the Apple
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.040]   Pencil and bring that support.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.920]   They've got all the software there from the iPad
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.960]   and bring that in because you've literally
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.560]   got to phone the size of a notepad.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.280]   Why not let people write on it?
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.160]   They'd have to make a smaller pencil,
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.000]   which would also be great.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.920]   Definitely.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.680]   Like a golf pencil, the Apple Golf Pencil, I could do it.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.520]   I think in terms of the talkier versus--
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.900]   it's like a TikTok, it's the S-year, as you said,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.320]   Brie, the idea that at least doing this big phone
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.000]   is more interesting, a big iPhone 10,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.520]   than if it was literally the same phones we saw last year.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.800]   And then having this other large but cheaper phone
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.040]   is also something to give, even though Ben is bored.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.400]   It's a little bit more interesting
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.320]   than if it was literally the same phones you saw last year
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.480]   but slightly faster.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.760]   But I do want to ask about this because I know a lot of people
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.600]   who really don't like large phones.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.160]   And if you do like a large phone, bless you.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.280]   It's great.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.080]   But the rumors do not encompass an update
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.080]   to what we think of as the iPhone 8, which
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.960]   has been the shape and size of the iPhone
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   for the last five years.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.240]   And I wonder, is that a problem?
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.400]   I know there's a market for bigger phones.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.400]   But is Apple basically saying if you don't like a huge phone,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.280]   the iPhone 10 is your only option?
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:16.720]   Oof.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.200]   That's a good question.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.720]   I'm a huge fan of big phones as well.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.920]   Like all of my phones have been huge since I had that option.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.760]   And I really do think it has been interesting to see them
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.040]   sort of take the place of tablets,
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.160]   as Andy was talking about.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.560]   So I don't know.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.160]   Again, it's like the question of if Apple makes a move,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.040]   does everyone just say, OK, I guess we're all
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.760]   getting big phones now if we want the new version.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.440]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.200]   I think that's a--
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.800]   I don't know.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.480]   I think that's a good question, Jason.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.360]   My guess is that if Apple just makes a bigger version
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.200]   and is like you have to get a bigger phone now,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.120]   people will fall into line.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.440]   I feel like I have a really interesting perspective on this.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.400]   They actually came out with guidelines
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.320]   for people running for high level office,
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.720]   basically steering us away from certain brands of Android
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.440]   phones because of security leaks and hacking.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.440]   So my campaign has literally every single size of iPhone
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.120]   that they make.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.920]   I've bought that for somebody on our campaign.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.600]   For my call time phone, I don't use my personal phone.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.920]   I have a different iPhone that I use for that.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.720]   It's a little iPhone SE.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:36.200]   I would love to see them update this phone as part of their line
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   this year.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.360]   We've gotten so used to the bigger phones
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.920]   that when you hold the smaller one in your hand
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.880]   and you're just fitting in your purse,
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.800]   I think we've really forgotten just how awesome that is.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.040]   I mean, it's a little small emergency phone that
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.800]   weighs nothing that you can use like it's a backup phone.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.240]   I would love to see them just update that,
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.480]   make it a little thinner, and put it right back out.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.160]   So I also want to say, I agree with you, Jason,
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.040]   that there are people that don't like big phones.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.680]   There are people that don't want to spend $1,000 on a phone.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.200]   We do Simone de Rush for, a friend of mine.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.880]   She just absolutely thinks it's absurd to spend that much
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.520]   on the phone.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.040]   And she's the person that goes out and buys that,
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.840]   the model from last year at a lower price point.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   So I do worry that they're not going to--
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.520]   that they're going to be pushing us towards the higher end
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.680]   and are going to ignore other kinds of consumers.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.480]   That's what's intriguing about the combination
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.200]   of having a phone that is the rumored cheaper phone, which
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.800]   is this 6.1 inch phone.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.880]   It's like, well, wait a second.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.960]   So it's cheaper, but it's also larger.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.160]   And that's a little bit of a conundrum,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.880]   if you're somebody who doesn't want to spend a lot of money
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.640]   on a phone, but also doesn't want a large phone.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.480]   But I guess it's also a great value,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.720]   if you do want a large phone, that there will be one that's
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.240]   cheaper.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.840]   Also, there are some rumors I should just mention in passing.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.200]   Some rumors that maybe the iPhone 10 won't be $1,000
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.960]   this year, that it might actually go down 100, which
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.400]   is still not a cheap phone.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.040]   But it is cheaper than it was last year, and that might be good.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.240]   Yeah, that's one of my ongoing worries about Apple,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.960]   that because they have the horrible responsibility
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.280]   of making literally every single phone that runs iOS
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.640]   and runs iOS apps.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.360]   But they can't deliver the sort of broad accessibility
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.320]   that the Android platform can.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.960]   And we have to remember that as convenient as the larger
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.720]   screens are for reading and for media and stuff like that,
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.320]   large phones are unavoidably sexist, because I'm a dude.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.920]   I also am a dude with poor fashion sense.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.080]   So I've got lots of pockets, and they're all big.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.400]   But if I were a woman, I would not have as many pockets,
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.160]   and they would be not big enough for these kinds of phones.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.720]   And if you're on the Android platform,
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.160]   you can actually seek out phones that are pretty much--
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.120]   if you just come up with a list of everything
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.680]   that you would like to have on a phone,
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.040]   chances are excellent that you can find it somewhere in Android.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.520]   I've got in my library of phones.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.120]   I bought last year a Kickstarter phone
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.560]   that runs the second to latest version of Android.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.240]   But it is literally about the size of this battery charger
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.200]   pack.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.520]   And it's a full-touch screen phone.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.600]   It has dual SIMs.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.680]   It has SIM expansion.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.960]   It's unlocked.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.600]   And I actually use it.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.120]   I actually bought it because for $100,
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.880]   I wanted to have a music player that
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.440]   will work with Google Music and all the other services
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   and also be able to contain my entire music library.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.720]   But I'm also using it occasionally when I'm at the beach,
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.000]   and I'm probably not going to be using my phone much.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.960]   And it's OK for me to have lost or gotten wet $100 phone.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.200]   And I took it to a place where I needed to remind myself not
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.440]   to be on my phone because that would have been incredibly rude.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.600]   So I have this thing where I can just take place text messages.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.400]   So that's the problem, the lack of diversity,
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.040]   both economic diversity and size diversity.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.840]   So I think that Apple is missing a trick.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.680]   They don't figure out a way to preserve at least the classic
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.760]   iPhone size and scale and keep that in the product way.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.240]   It's funny.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.160]   I was actually just thinking that this is--
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.040]   I see the signs that Apple actually knows now
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.480]   that it has a problem with not--
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.040]   for the longest time, the iPhone was literally an iPhone.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.560]   We can only make one kind, guys.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.400]   So here it is.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.680]   You've got the entire Spectrum of Android phones and an iPhone.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.840]   And if you look where they're going,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.920]   if these rumors are true, we may see an Apple that
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.720]   is selling an iPhone SE, an iPhone, essentially eight,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.160]   this new, large, lower cost iPhone,
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.840]   plus the iPhone 10 size, plus this larger iPhone 10 size.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.600]   At that point, it's like, OK, and with presumably
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.360]   a spread of prices in there, it's not
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   going to ever match what Android can have.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.240]   But I do wonder if Apple realized that what's holding
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.480]   the iPhone back at this point is a lack of diversity
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.680]   in the product line.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.800]   Yeah, they're running out of people to sell iPhones, too,
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.520]   which means they're going to have to figure out
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.920]   why people aren't buying them.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.760]   And price and size are probably two big reasons.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.800]   I'm also waiting for-- this is the extreme trend, obviously.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.840]   But I am also waiting for-- I feel more and more,
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.200]   I run into people who are much younger than me, who are--
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.720]   who are basically want a flip phone.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.200]   Basically want this simplest--
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   right.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.920]   Do not make phone calls or pick up phone calls.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:29.960]   They are actually suspicious of being always on their phone
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.200]   and using the internet on their phone.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.320]   And I'm waiting for this.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.560]   I feel like I'm seeing the edges of it
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.040]   just anecdotally of people, younger people who are like,
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.760]   you know what?
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.520]   A flip phone would be fun.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.320]   If I can send text messages, which is basically all I do
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.720]   anyway on my phone and maybe take good pictures,
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.120]   that would be enough for me.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.720]   So I feel like-- I don't know.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720]   Maybe that's too crazy.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.880]   But I feel like there's a further extreme coming
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   in the phone market.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.440]   And obviously, Android has some crazy options like this
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.920]   or not crazy, but older options like this
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.000]   that run some of the more recent operating systems
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.520]   but are much simpler phones.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.440]   So I don't know.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.720]   I'm curious to see in the coming five years
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.520]   if we see more of that.
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.440]   One last Apple thing before we move on.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.720]   I use the Apple Watch.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.920]   I don't know if anybody else here.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.720]   I know many of you have used it.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.480]   Brie, do you use an Apple Watch?
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.000]   Right there?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.520]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.720]   OK, well, so the rumor about the Apple Watch, where they,
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.360]   again, hey, there was a file on an open web server
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.160]   about an event that's happening in two weeks.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.800]   What could go wrong?
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.560]   Show the Apple Watch with this edge-to-edge display.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.600]   The idea is it's not necessarily going to be bigger,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.120]   but there'll be more pixels on it,
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.800]   which I think is going to be a big win, especially
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.000]   for people who use the smaller of the models.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.880]   I talked to a couple of designer friends
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.200]   who I know who looked at this image that you're putting up
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.800]   on the video version of this show anyway.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.840]   That is this-- it's got like 10 different complications on it.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.280]   And basically, what they all said is, oh, the horrors.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.320]   It's so junkie.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   There's so much there.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.120]   And as an Apple Watch user, I looked at this
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.600]   and I was like, finally, a watch face
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.720]   that I can put stuff on.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.640]   Because for me, I was always frustrated
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.560]   that I couldn't get enough information on my watch face.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.000]   I don't know if you feel that way, Brie.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.920]   But that was definitely the first thing I thought of when
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.280]   I saw that image.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.640]   No, I couldn't agree more.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   I think it's worth saying, like, the Apple Watch has--
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.160]   it has gotten so much better since that series 0.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.480]   I mean, the first one I had it, and I remember getting it.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.400]   And I work out every single day.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.080]   I run, so I used it.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.040]   But when it finally died and the battery in it wasn't working
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.080]   or I didn't replace it, just like through a series of things,
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.000]   I ended up getting one with the cellular capabilities in it.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.720]   And I really, really liked the series 3.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.200]   So I almost feel like it's a shame that from the outside,
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.840]   it really looks like the same watch.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.560]   And I think that's kind of unfortunate,
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.120]   because I think a lot of people that were kind of underwhelmed
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.600]   by this along the way, I don't know
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   that they're going to be looking at a watch
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.080]   with a little bit of extra pixels around the edges
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.120]   and feeling like that's a product they
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.520]   should take a second look at.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.600]   As far as the UI, I'm right there with you.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.640]   I think it looks much better.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.560]   But what I can't tell from that picture
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.600]   is if they've made it any thinner, finally.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.800]   And that's really my main complaint with it.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.960]   The battery life in the series 3, it's OK.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.160]   It's better than it was, but it's nothing to write home about.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.720]   And it's a watch that when I go on TV,
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.080]   I'm embarrassed to wear it, generally.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.880]   So I really would have thought they'd
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   make more progress on it by now, if that makes sense.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.120]   No, it does make sense.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.480]   Keep in mind, it was literally four years ago
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.560]   that that product was announced.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.440]   It's only been out for three and a half years.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.200]   And this will be the latest iteration of it.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.200]   They've come a long way.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.160]   I think you're right, though, that you can see
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.880]   that they've kind of emphasized features.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.760]   And the software has really progressed in the last couple
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.600]   of years.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.240]   It's way more capable as a device than it was.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.080]   But it does feel like they've prioritized all of that
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.960]   over making a big hardware a look change to it.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.440]   And so it does look the same.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.640]   This one will no doubt be better,
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.680]   but it does look the same.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.080]   You've got to wonder when they're going to finally
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.000]   just break compatibility.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.200]   It feels like maybe next year is the time where they say,
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.920]   I'm glad you bought all those watch bands.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   We're Apple.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.040]   We're going to buy new watch bands now.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.360]   That's just how it's going to have to be.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.640]   Pay us money.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.480]   No, no, no, they got your back.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.200]   They'll give you like a watch band dongle.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.240]   So you could just plug it to the dongle.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:40.320]   I need the new watch band C format and the adapter for it.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.000]   OK, we are going to talk about things other than Apple.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.720]   There's a whole bunch on the agenda.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.280]   But first, we're going to take our first break.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.240]   Now Leo, he's sending postcards from his trip,
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.040]   his beautiful trip.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.640]   I only get to host the show when Leo was someplace beautiful.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.920]   Seems unfair to me, but that's how it works.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.200]   So we're going to go to Leo, who has a very special message
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:58.880]   for you.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.600]   Hi, Jason.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.240]   Hi, gang.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.800]   Let me interrupt just briefly, because I
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.840]   want to tell you about a better way to invest.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.960]   It's betterment.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.200]   And I just think this is awesome.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.240]   Betterment outsmartsaverage does better
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.640]   because it's the smart way to manage your money.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.160]   Designed to help customers build wealth, plan for retirement,
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.520]   and achieve their financial goals.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.000]   Whether it's a down payment for a house,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.280]   putting away money for the kids college,
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.680]   or just a little nest egg, Betterment's technology
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.440]   is designed to help you make more from your investments.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.480]   With tax efficient investing strategies,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.160]   it will give you an edge.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.560]   And Betterment provides unlimited expert advice
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.000]   designed to help you make smart financial decisions.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Now this is the key.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.240]   The financial advisors at Betterment are fiduciaries.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:56.080]   That means they recommend things in your interest, not theirs.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.320]   They're not incentivized to recommend certain funds.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.800]   They don't have their own investment products to sell.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.720]   They work for you.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.440]   Now, ask your current investment advisor if that's the case.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.680]   Often it's not.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.960]   It is at Betterment.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.680]   And the other thing I love about Betterment,
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.480]   because it's automated, it's doing things like tax loss
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.960]   harvesting, sometimes trading by the minute
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.880]   by the hour, by the day, it's not day trading,
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.640]   but they're constantly adjusting and rebalancing
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.240]   and making sure you're getting the most out of your investments.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.600]   And none of that costs you extra.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.800]   There are no hidden fees, no matter who you are,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.000]   no matter how much money you invest,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.480]   you get everything for one very low transparent management fee,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.000]   no transaction fees, nothing else, no hidden end of the year.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.440]   Oh, by the way, nope, you know ahead of time
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.880]   exactly what you're going to pay.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.520]   And it is very, very affordable.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.080]   Betterment gives you constant access to information and tools
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.800]   that allow you to track progress toward your goals.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.200]   So you can always feel like a smart savvy investor.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.560]   The kids today, they want everything
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.080]   they want to see it online on the app, and that's awesome.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.800]   You know, you complete control of it through the app.

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.280]   Now, of course, investing involves risk,
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.280]   but you can get up to one year managed free.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.400]   Right now, if you go to Betterment.com/twit,

[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.400]   betterment.com/twit.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.600]   Back to you, Jason.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.520]   Listen to the man floating in the Mediterranean
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.040]   when it comes to making investments
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.120]   and living a good lifestyle.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.880]   That's my rule.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.880]   That's my rule.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.200]   I'm going to live by that.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.920]   Okay, we're back here in the studio.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.040]   I mean, by we, I mean me,
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.480]   and then everybody else is in Massachusetts.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.000]   I want to talk about the Google Pixel 3.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.840]   It sounds like it's going to be announced
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.040]   October 9th in New York City,
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.280]   so about a month after Apple's event.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.080]   There are definitely things afoot.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.560]   They are being approved by the FCC.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.920]   A lot of stuff has leaked about them.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.280]   And today I read that somebody left one in the back of a car.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:10.240]   And the Uber driver was very nice enough to take pictures
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.160]   and post them on the internet
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.880]   before giving it back to the person.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.960]   Apple's been feeling a lot better
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.520]   about that server photo leak.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.360]   That was, and that and plus Pixel 3,
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.840]   Pixel 3 XLs boxed are being sold in the black market
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.600]   from someone in the Ukraine.
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.840]   So yeah, that's okay.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.080]   There's no patch for human stupidity.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.440]   As we like to say.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.760]   This is the world we live in.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.800]   Try to keep things secret in this day and age.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.080]   And it's not, okay, Ben, you talked about how you were doing
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.800]   some eye rolling out all the iPhone business.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.680]   Here we are, Pixel 3.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.840]   How do you feel? You excited?
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.760]   I'm interested.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.440]   I think the thing that annoyed me about the Pixel 2
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.760]   was that you basically, and Apple fans will, of course,
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.360]   relate to this, is that you couldn't actually,
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.160]   you know, they got rid of the headphone jack.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:03.160]   And the, you had to get these new wireless earbuds.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.040]   And I think--
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.840]   We're a dongle.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.680]   We're a dongle.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.000]   You could just attach a dongle.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.400]   If you could remember to bring it with you.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.440]   Yeah, sure.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.920]   I'm not a dongle guy.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.160]   I'm not interested in dongles.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.680]   But no, but I do think, you know, I'd
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.640]   like to see what they do with that because I am still
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.600]   an old fashioned, regular wired earbuds guy.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.280]   I think the thing that most intrigued me about the Pixel 2
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.120]   was the live Google Translate function.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   I just, as a huge fan of, you know, like all of the books
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.440]   that we think of when we think of live translation
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.400]   as a technology.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.080]   I think that was the thing that most interested me
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.120]   about the Pixel 2.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.040]   And I think, again, Google's software power.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.720]   I was driving in the car yesterday with my brother
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.120]   in kind of like showing off to him Google's assistant.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:57.240]   And he said to me, he was like, wow, Google's pretty good.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.840]   And I was like, yeah, obviously.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.360]   And he was like, Siri sucks.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.240]   And I'm not going to come out too hard against Siri
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:05.960]   and against Apple.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.240]   But I do think that at least with the Pixel 2, at least,
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.000]   this live translate function and basically Google being
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.600]   able to show off its software power in its device
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.200]   was the most interesting thing to me.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:22.160]   So I'm sort of intrigued to see what they release with the Pixel
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:22.680]   3.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.120]   And as long as it's got a headphone jack,
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.640]   maybe they'll go back to the headphone jack I'm hoping,
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.480]   then I will definitely buy into the Pixel 3.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.280]   If you can find somebody who thinks Siri is awesome,
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.680]   by the way, let me know who that person is.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.200]   Let's talk to them.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.600]   So many Android phones have picked up on the notch design
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.200]   language slash compromise from Apple.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.720]   And the pictures that I see of the Pixel 3,
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.280]   it's just got a little bezel at top and bottom.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.720]   And they're not going with the indentation.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   Is that right?
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.400]   Is that your understanding, Andy?
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.280]   Yeah, that's the-- well, that's not understanding.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.640]   That's the photo that we've been seeing.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.480]   That's literally it.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.840]   I checked the back of the cab.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.000]   It's old at all.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.920]   And I don't feel as though that marks this phone as unclean
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.720]   and uncomfortable.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.520]   I think it's kind of bold that they're like, yeah,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520]   we don't need to do a notch.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.000]   We're not going to do that.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.960]   Everybody else does it.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.280]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.920]   Yeah, I think that edge to edge is really a design thing.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.480]   It does let you put a larger display in the same size device.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.520]   But it's not as though I'm suddenly
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.680]   going to be able to read two page comic book spreads
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.920]   in comicsology because I've got a notched screen, is it?
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.840]   So it's fine.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.760]   I just think it's silly when people say, oh my god,
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.120]   look how big that notch is.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.360]   Oh, the notch.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.600]   That's like-- I need to hold a martini glass
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.120]   and put on a monocle so that monocle could fall theatrically
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.720]   into the martini glass.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.840]   Yeah, I think-- and for me, I am anticipating
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.720]   buying a Pixel 3 because I do like the size.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.120]   I love my Pixel 1, which I actually bought a year later
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.640]   as an overstop.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.120]   I just picked one up because I like
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.080]   to have a current Android version reference hardware.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.640]   And my old Nexus 5X doesn't run Pi.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.480]   And these are really-- it's really nice hardware.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:12.920]   Very nice.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   It's a nice phone.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.520]   It's a nice phone.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.040]   It also has a great camera, which again--
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.320]   Yeah, I was going to say.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.000]   If you take-- at least me, again,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.280]   that's 80% of what I do with my phone is take pictures.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.680]   And I think just having an amazing camera
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.320]   is huge in the Pixel 1.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.040]   And again, if they come out with hardware that is as good
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:41.120]   as the Pixel 1 and has a headphone jack, I'm in.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.440]   Brie, are you allowing any Android in your campaign at all
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.600]   or that is a no-go?
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.640]   Well, I mean, I have a pile of Android phones in--
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.640]   our game studio office.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   I mean, we worked on developing games for Android.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.240]   And obviously, running for Congress,
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.400]   there's not as much time to develop games as I would like.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.160]   But I don't have any philosophical objection to Android.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.800]   It's just-- it's literally--
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.040]   this is not a situation where you want to be hacked, right?
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.920]   You're talking about some really important stuff.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:17.680]   And I really have always been confused
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   that the Pixel is not the most popular Android phone.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.400]   I mean, I like the Samsung phones that they put out.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.920]   I think the Touch-- the Note 9 this year is particularly great.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.200]   But I think if you're comparing the flagship Samsung
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.160]   to the flagship Google, it's generally better.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.520]   That said, I'm looking at this phone this year.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.040]   And I don't think it's really progressing as much
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.200]   as I think the iPhone 10 has.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.280]   I'm a big believer in the fingerprint on the back
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.280]   of the phone.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.320]   I think it's more convenient if you get used to it.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.800]   Even though I love Face ID.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.000]   But I'd love to see--
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.120]   I just don't see Android--
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.720]   I don't see Google rather putting out Pixel that makes me go,
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.000]   oh, wow, I want to get that that really looks sexy.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   That really looks like a cool design that
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.120]   looks substantially thinner or different or better battery.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.320]   I just-- I don't see that this year.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.800]   And that's disappointing because I don't
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.960]   want it to be just a Samsung and Apple world where only two
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.280]   people are putting out good phones.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.240]   And I absolutely see that.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:29.040]   My excitement about the Pixel 3 is because I love what
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.880]   Android is doing-- excuse me, Google is doing with Android.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.560]   And I really want to have a phone that'll
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.000]   be able to-- that's designed with next year's Android
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.160]   and the Android after that in mind.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.360]   I think that Android P this year has got
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.120]   to be one of my favorite updates from last years
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.520]   to this year's OS on any platform whatsoever.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.880]   And that's this thing that gets me really excited about staying
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.800]   as an Android user.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.360]   But you're right.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:02.040]   I think that the current generation hardware
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.000]   and what we think is going to be next generation's hardware,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.400]   it's very, very nice.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.560]   And it's great for people like me who
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.800]   are only going to be looking at the phone
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.960]   until I get that shipping from spec.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.080]   And I put it in that grippy case that I like all the time.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:26.600]   Like, why does Google suck at selling hardware?
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.680]   It seems like-- or maybe they don't suck.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.280]   But it just seems like people--
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.880]   I also wonder why the Pixel is not way more popular than it is.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.720]   And I've always felt like the hardware
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.040]   that Google is putting out is basically
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.520]   like an experiment for them to learn new things
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.360]   to make their software better.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.280]   Or something like-- it just doesn't--
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.560]   I've never been convinced that Google is serious about hardware.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.720]   And maybe I'm completely wrong on that
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.960]   and happy to be told I'm wrong.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.560]   But it just seems like the stuff that they put out
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.080]   that I have bought is great.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.440]   But they don't--
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.560]   I don't know.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.360]   I do wonder because some of the hardware is amazing.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.080]   But it just doesn't seem to gain the same traction
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.440]   as Apple hardware.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.880]   And maybe it never will.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:19.160]   But even-- it seems even behind Samsung and these other companies
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.320]   that make great phones and great devices as well.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.640]   But I'm just sort of surprised, I guess,
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.840]   that Google's hardware is not more popular than it is.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.880]   I mean, I've heard people say--
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.400]   and the chat room is saying it now is that carriers
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.000]   is a big part of that, right?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.680]   It's like they're not-- they don't have the deals with the carriers.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.920]   I think that I think that is plus simple marketing.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.160]   When Samsung comes up to the new phone,
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.800]   my metric for marketing is when my commuter train pulls
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.560]   into South Station, because Samsung will buy out
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.360]   the entire-- every space on every platform
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.280]   and every advertising screen inside South Station.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.480]   And you see them everywhere.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.400]   And it's not the coincidence that's the reason why
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.680]   Samsung is kind of the default hardware platform for Android.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.200]   And because they are in every single carrier store.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.160]   Are there people who just--
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:08.640]   But that's what's weird.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.200]   Why don't they spend that money?
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.960]   Like they have the money.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.280]   So why don't they spend the money on it?
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.520]   The other question is, do they have the capability
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.880]   of manufacturing that many phones, which I don't know?
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.600]   No, I don't know.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.360]   I think it's like Apple.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.760]   I think they'd have to go get a foothold at the mall,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.600]   just like Microsoft did.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.440]   It's an analogy here.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:35.440]   But Microsoft has really started to excel at hardware.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.440]   I bought the Microsoft Surface Go, which I think
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.800]   is it's an exceptional product.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.440]   Like from a hardware perspective,
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.200]   I think the software itself has a lot of issues.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.440]   But the hardware itself is excellent.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.160]   Apple went to the mall for the first few years
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.640]   of the Microsoft store being there.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.720]   It was a ghost town.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.480]   And I don't know what yours are like.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.280]   But when I've been to the way in Burlington
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.320]   or the one in Nadek, it's a generally popular
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.640]   store these days.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.800]   I think Apple's really--
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.520]   I mean, Microsoft rather has put the time in.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.360]   And they've really built up a following.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.000]   I think if you look at the Google Pixelbook,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.520]   I've wanted to buy one of the first gen ones for years
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.720]   and just like hack it to run Linux, which
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.840]   is a completely awesome computer if you can do it.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.640]   But they sold so few of them.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.320]   It's still unbelievably expensive to find a really good one.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.760]   So I think they can clearly do it.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.400]   As far as the number of phones, I think
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.360]   they have the partners out there, which
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.000]   they've used to produce it.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.840]   I think it's just simply a matter of marketing
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:42.120]   and having the in front consumer facing places to go sell it.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.960]   The record, my Microsoft store, the last time I went in
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.080]   to buy an Xbox, which was about a month ago,
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.120]   had more people in it than I've ever seen in the Microsoft
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.400]   store, that said it was all kids playing Fortnite.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.960]   They're more than--
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.120]   Understandable.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.360]   That's a good game.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.320]   And they realized-- and I think smart on the Microsoft
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.840]   store's part-- they're like, yeah, sure kids.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.040]   Come on in, play Fortnite here.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:03.800]   It's fun.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.120]   That shows you how brilliant and profound
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.520]   the decisions the planning that went around the Apple stores
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.280]   are.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.480]   If they really are town squares, where people just
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.320]   go there to hang out or people go there to get a class
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.160]   and figure out what's going on, my Microsoft store
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.720]   is at the Prudential Center, actually
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.200]   kind of like one street away almost
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.920]   across the street from the Apple store.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.640]   And it's usually pretty busy, but there's really--
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.400]   it really doesn't invite you to sit down at a big, big, huge
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.120]   table and just plop your laptop down and work
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.840]   on the free Wi-Fi for as long as you want.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.760]   It really is a place to go buy something,
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.160]   have a nice conversation with somebody
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.600]   in a very clean polo shirt, and then conclude your business
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.880]   and leave.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.800]   Well, that store is particularly--
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.040]   that's a zoo.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.280]   Like, if you live in Boston, you know, to avoid that store.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.120]   Who among us does not know that?
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:51.640]   Oh, that's me.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.560]   I don't know that because I am not from Boston.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.960]   One other Google related thing that I
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.400]   wanted to talk about before the next break, which is YouTube--
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.040]   owned by Google, obviously--
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.320]   rolled out a-- the next step-- obviously at I/O,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.840]   they talked about digital well-being
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.120]   and the idea that you're trying to manage how you use technology.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.080]   They rolled out a new time-watched stat this week
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.560]   in their apps that will actually tell you whether--
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.760]   well, I mean, you have to look.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.680]   If you don't want to know, don't look.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.520]   How much time you spent today, yesterday,
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.720]   and in the last week, on average,
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.640]   watching YouTube-- now, I thought about this
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.720]   and thought, my son--
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.840]   I wonder if my son could break 24 hours.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.880]   Like, if you could literally have two screens up
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.800]   and on average, you watch YouTube for 27 hours a day.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.600]   He could do it.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.280]   He could do it.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.640]   But, you know, again, I think this
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.680]   is a really interesting trend where seeing how much time you
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.920]   spend on YouTube is probably not going to encourage you
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.440]   to watch more YouTube, right?
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.720]   It's probably going to encourage you to be like, oh, my God.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.680]   What am I doing here?
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.040]   And yet they are adding this feature,
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.200]   which I think they're to be applauded to do it.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.400]   Because I think a lot of us are going to look at that time
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.560]   number and be like, oh, my God, I had no idea.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.160]   I was watching.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:03.920]   I did.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.440]   I did.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:04.920]   Did you do it?
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.800]   I saw that.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.000]   So, OK.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.320]   I do want to say, though, my primary use of YouTube
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.400]   is I pay for YouTube premium.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:18.560]   And it's been my experience when you're out about streaming
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.440]   YouTube audio really doesn't hurt your data plan that much.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:26.400]   It doesn't seem to be any worse and like streaming music.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.360]   So when you're running for office,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.040]   you're in the car constantly driving from place to place.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.920]   And I love that I can go into the app
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.760]   and can see whatever horrible thing is going on in the news.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.160]   I need to be able to understand and can
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.960]   listen to it while I'm driving.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.360]   So my step was amazingly like four hours, like on average
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.240]   a day, which I was stunned by.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.600]   But it's like, I don't think I'm the only person
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.840]   that, quote unquote, watches YouTube by mostly being in the
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.800]   background when I'm doing something else.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.600]   I mean, that's not just me, right?
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.240]   No, that's--
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.880]   I mean, my son is literally playing a video game while
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.120]   listening to a YouTube video.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.440]   He occasionally looks at--
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.640]   I would wager that people who watch "Twit" probably aren't
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.400]   sitting there with us on their big screen TV.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.960]   Hi, if you are.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   And like, wrapped attention at the four talking heads for two
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.520]   hours.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.000]   My guess is they're doing other stuff.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.400]   And we're up in the corner of their screen.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.920]   And they glance over when they're like, who said that?
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   And then, oh, it's that guy.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.600]   How could you, Jason?
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.520]   How could you?
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.160]   How could you?
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.840]   I'm just-- that's my theory.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:29.320]   YouTube is not necessarily for super focused attention viewing
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:29.720]   necessarily.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.720]   Right.
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.280]   I didn't have to shave for this.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:33.680]   You did.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.480]   There's a dress code you can tell from my t-shirt.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.000]   That's right.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.040]   There is a dress code.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.960]   So it's like that stat in like my destiny stat that shows how
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.360]   many hours I've wasted playing destiny.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.840]   I'm ashamed of that stat.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.240]   I'm deeply ashamed of that.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.800]   And a steam game will tell you, like, oh, boy, that much,
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.240]   really?
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:49.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.960]   But this is one I don't know.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.400]   It's like, will we shame somebody for how many hours you
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.360]   spend listening to the radio?
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.960]   I just don't think it's the same thing.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.160]   Well, it's weird, too.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.720]   I wonder how many--
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.880]   I guess I'm curious about-- and I don't know, maybe people
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.800]   were writing about this.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:11.560]   But I'm curious about what science they base that on.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:15.480]   I do think it's admirable that they put out that information.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.280]   And there's sort of this tech wellness thing that's
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.680]   happening and people are talking about.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.040]   And I do think that that's good to be sort of conscious
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.480]   of the amount of time you are spending using these services.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.160]   But at the same time, like, where--
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.520]   point me to the science.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.000]   Like anecdotally, I totally can relate.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.360]   I mean, I was going to say shadows of Mordor for me.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.320]   Like, when I looked at the number of hours
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.800]   I was playing that game, I like almost through the controller
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.640]   at the television.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.280]   I was like, oh, my god.
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.360]   But I am curious, Jason, you talked
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.000]   about the possibility of that actually getting people
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.680]   to stop or to be more conscious of their viewing habits.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.960]   And I am curious as to where--
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:06.840]   is Google actually looking at science or studies and saying,
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.280]   oh, yeah, this will get people to be more healthy
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.280]   with their viewing habits?
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.520]   Or are they saying, hey, if we put this data,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.840]   people will think that we are encouraging people
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.680]   to be more healthy with their viewing habits.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.040]   When in reality, it makes no difference whatsoever.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.960]   Oh, I just think it's an easy enough thing for them to do.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.080]   I think that all these services are
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.160]   coming under a certain level of heat
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.160]   about having an impact on lives.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.120]   But no one knows exactly how good or bad that impact is.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.600]   I keep coming back to it's an easy enough thing for them
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   to do.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.120]   And I have that it's given that it's essentially
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:48.160]   an extension of the same sort of stat tracking
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.960]   that they've got going on Android phones now,
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.880]   with how much time are you spending in certain apps?
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.920]   I think that's a natural progression and a good thing.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.840]   What I would love to see is if they were to open up that API
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.280]   so that if someone who does have access to good science
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.240]   wants to build tools to be a more efficient meter on how
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.040]   you're using these devices and harness that data
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:15.480]   for your personal well-being as opposed to Google's advertising
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.320]   well-being, there are a lot of things
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.520]   that you could, I wouldn't say, diagnose,
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.920]   but it's interesting data.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.400]   There have been times where I've looked back on--
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.560]   it felt like I wasn't getting out enough.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.160]   It felt like-- and that might be because of my mood is bad
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.040]   or something like that.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.520]   And then I went into that tab in Google
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.320]   where we'll say, well, here's a calendar
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.840]   of where you went on certain places.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.040]   And I could see, oh, wow, that's right.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.280]   In December, I didn't really even leave the house for two days.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.440]   And then I went out once just around the block
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.400]   to do some shopping.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.480]   And then I didn't leave the house for another two days.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.560]   It would be great to have the ability
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.520]   to take a look at that status to not even do something as simple
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.320]   as, gosh, I seem to be spending too much time watching YouTube.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.400]   But when you're trying to figure out the status of your well-being,
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.600]   and that could be just as simple as, hey,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.640]   I want to live a happier, more productive life,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.680]   or it might be that I deal with major depression
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.880]   and I need to figure out when I seem to be cocooning as opposed
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.160]   to engaging with the world.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.400]   And did these periods of just spending--
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.080]   instead of two or three hours watching YouTube
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.280]   to now eight or nine hours in Netflix and eight or nine
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.640]   hours in this app, did that coincide with something else
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.080]   that I could look at and track?
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.080]   It's good to have that data available.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.480]   And I don't see any particular downside to it.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.360]   I know why you didn't go out in December, Andy.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.200]   New England weather, am I right?
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:36.800]   Yeah, you can.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.320]   I don't know what I'm talking about there.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.320]   But that's--
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:39.800]   That's good.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.440]   That's when they get out the toboggan.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.040]   The tobogganan.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.120]   I don't know.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.480]   See people liken it to calorie counts,
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.880]   whether you're counting calories yourself
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.320]   or it's being displayed in the restaurant.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.280]   Look, you can ignore it or you can pay attention to it.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:52.600]   It depends on what you want to do.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.680]   It gives people the option.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.480]   I like the idea that people can choose
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.360]   to be aware of what they're doing if they want
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.680]   to make a change in their life.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.240]   I also am dreading the fact that in maybe three weeks,
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.040]   iOS 12 is going to come out.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.360]   And at some point in the weeks following that,
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.240]   we will be barraged with thousands of think pieces
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.440]   by everybody who's using the new screen time feature, which
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.400]   will be able to say, yes, you are using social media 10 hours
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.760]   a day.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.680]   I think it will make people make changes in their life habits
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.760]   that will make their lives better.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.880]   I do believe that.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.040]   But boy, there are going to be so many people who
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.440]   are going to be writing that very serious.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.920]   I needed to regroup in my real life
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.480]   after discovering how much time I played X or was
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.280]   on this site using screen time.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.400]   It's going to happen.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.640]   I'm just getting ready for it.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.040]   It's happening.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.280]   I'm ready for it being gamified.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.720]   I want just on my Apple Watch.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.880]   I want to get this little like chrome badge.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.920]   You've just earned your eight hour arrested development
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.080]   badge from one day.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.680]   I'm challenging with you.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.960]   Which one of us can use social media the least
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.520]   in the next week?
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.760]   Oh my goodness.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.000]   Maybe don't get there.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.560]   I want to counter for the time I've
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.480]   spent reading think pieces.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.320]   I feel like I need you.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.600]   Oh my god.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.120]   That's not something the New York Times will never give you
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.840]   is the think piece counter.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.880]   Ladies and gentlemen, if it weren't for think pieces,
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.800]   I would not be paying my cable bill every month.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.640]   So I will not have you malign think pieces.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.160]   It's to arrest somebody who writes.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.240]   They don't require me to think or research.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:20.760]   That's right.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.080]   No thinking required for a think piece.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.440]   You do the thinking by reading it.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.680]   I don't do the thinking by writing it.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.880]   What are you talking about?
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.600]   All right.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.280]   I feel a strong sense that someone who's
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.120]   floating in the Mediterranean needs to tell us something
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.400]   about something.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.000]   And that person is probably a report.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.360]   Let's see.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.960]   Hi, Jason and gang.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.200]   Thank you for letting me interrupt.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.280]   I'm on vacation right now.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.920]   But I bet you.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.440]   I'm not sure.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:46.280]   But I bet you I'm missing my Casper.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.360]   Oh, it's such a good feeling, isn't it?
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.480]   When you go home after a hard day
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.640]   and you pull back the sheets, you get under the covers
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.880]   and you just go, ah.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.760]   And I get that every night.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.280]   It is a little hard to travel because I don't
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.400]   know what I'm going to get.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.240]   But I know when I get home, I'm going to say, oh,
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.720]   it's so good to be home with my Casper.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.400]   Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.640]   for a fraction of the cost.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.880]   They noticed there was this real discontinuity
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.920]   in the economics of the mattress business.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.160]   It seems that turns out that there's
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.360]   this horrendous markup at the mattress showrooms.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.880]   And by selling direct to you, by manufacturing and selling
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.520]   direct to you, Casper saves so much money.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.800]   And then they pass that on directly to you.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.120]   Brilliant.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.400]   And man, talk about brilliant Casper's mattress
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.960]   obsessively engineered at a fair price made in the USA.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.440]   Their expert team of engineers and designers
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.400]   researched, prototyped, tests.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.560]   They made hundreds of test models.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.480]   They wanted to meet the needs of all kinds of sleepers
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:02.520]   and give you just the perfect balance of both support and comfort.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.720]   So when you get in bed, you go, oh, I love my Casper.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.000]   I love my Casper.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.960]   And all Casper mattresses use premium phones
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.600]   that relieve pressure.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.760]   No more that hip-poken thing, you know.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.280]   Oh, ow.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.440]   It helps align your body.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.480]   So you fall asleep easily.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.880]   You wake up feeling refreshed.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.160]   And for me, really important, it breathes.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.320]   It is you sleep cool on a Casper.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.240]   Summer or winter, that's important.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.600]   Regulating your body temperature
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.160]   turns out to be one of the most important things
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:28.640]   during sleep.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.920]   Casper makes it easy.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:31.600]   Now, I know summer's coming to an end.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   So this is a limited time Labor Day offer.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.480]   Say goodbye to summer by taking advantage of Casper's
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.520]   limited time Labor Day offer.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.880]   Get 10% off any order with a mattress
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.520]   by visiting casper.com/savings.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.800]   That is really a good deal.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.040]   10% off any order as long as there's a mattress in it.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.080]   So you can order some other stuff too.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:58.000]   Casper.com/savings.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.640]   Free shipping and returns in the US and Canada,
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.520]   you actually have 100 days or 100 nights, I should say,
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.960]   to sleep on your Casper.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.080]   If at any time you say, no, it's not for me,
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.880]   you call them, they come and get it,
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.760]   refund every penny, cost you nothing.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.880]   But you won't.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.440]   In fact, probably like me, you're gonna say,
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.640]   I can't wait to get home from vacation
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.520]   so I can sleep on my Casper.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.280]   Free shipping and returns US and Canada
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.000]   for a limited time 10% off any order with a mattress
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.800]   by visiting casper.com/savings.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.560]   This offer expires September 3rd, 2018.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.560]   I hope you're here this in time.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.080]   Terms and conditions apply 10% off any order with a mattress,
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.400]   but you've gotta do it right now
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.480]   'cause you offer expires September 3rd,
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:47.480]   Casper.com/savings.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.920]   Now back to you, Jason.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.760]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.680]   One of the signs of a true media professional, by the way,
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.720]   is that when I'm on the show, I'm getting very excited
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.640]   and I'm gonna talk and I'm gonna say,
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.560]   we're gonna talk about this topic
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.760]   and we're gonna talk really fast.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.400]   And then we cut to Leo.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:06.360]   And he's just happy to be as slow as he needs to be
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.560]   talking about a mattress.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:12.440]   I aspire to that level of chill on podcasts.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.280]   I don't have it yet.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.120]   I aspire, I dream.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.040]   - It is kitty.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   - There is the cat.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:16.880]   It's the cat.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:17.760]   The cat helps.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.600]   - It's true.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.680]   It's true.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.360]   So definitely, Leo is an aspirational figure.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.480]   Okay, this is the topic that I don't really want to talk about
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.760]   because it pains me,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.840]   but I feel like we need to talk about it
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.160]   because this week, the president of the United States
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.640]   said that Google is out to get him.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.520]   It's rigging its search results against him.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.880]   The search results are very biased,
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.560]   that they didn't promote his state of the union address,
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.680]   which wasn't really true, that it was all unfair
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.320]   and Google is a meanie and it's out to get the president
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.480]   of the United States and we're taking a look.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:56.440]   Maybe something can be done about Google.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:01.680]   - Man, I wish Google did that.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.440]   - Google's falling down on the job.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:08.360]   You're saying, I feel like I want to ask Breonna Wu
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.440]   about this one.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.280]   - Yeah.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.760]   - Bre is Google and the internet out to get the president
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.600]   of the United States.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.880]   Is that what's happening now?
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.000]   - So I'm afraid I may have a different opinion
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.240]   than some of the people here today.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.880]   So with Trump, no, it's not.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.400]   It's clearly not.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.640]   I mean, if you Google Trump's name and I did before the show,
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.880]   it's linking to reputable search results.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   It is showing accurately what credible media sources
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.120]   seem to be thinking about him.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:42.000]   That said, I do think there is an adult discussion to be had
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.760]   about the way that Google ranks things.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.240]   One of the things I've really faced in my career
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.000]   is this week I did a piece with Kotaku.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.240]   I did Ball Street Journal.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   I did New York Times.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.240]   There's a lot of credible media sources about me
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.120]   that don't always say things that I like, but it's fair.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:02.960]   It's accurate.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.920]   It's well researched.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.760]   It's journalism.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.280]   Then at the same time, it feels like stuff
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.080]   from very wholly unreputable sites ends up in the search
[00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:16.000]   results of a lot of marginalized people's search results.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.360]   Like I dare you to Google any professional woman
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.320]   in the entire world and see what comes up in her search
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:22.800]   results.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.400]   It's going to be Reddit.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.600]   It's going to be 4chan.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.840]   It's going to be all these sites that don't really
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.160]   add anything to the conversation.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.560]   What I've been trying to talk to Google about for years now
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.200]   in back channel is talking to them about the way
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.280]   that they rank things.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:44.560]   Because people click on dirt and dirt
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.640]   does make things go higher and higher in the rankings.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.160]   And I don't have any issue with that being out there
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.640]   and being publicly searchable.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.520]   This is the magic of the internet.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.240]   But I do think there's a discussion to be had
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.560]   about how people like to click on dirt.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.200]   We like to click on click bait.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.280]   That's why that media model works.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.160]   And maybe when it comes to search results about topics,
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.680]   we should be thinking about ranking New York Times, Washington
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.880]   Post, these really excellent sources of journalism
[00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.120]   are higher than they are.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:19.160]   I totally-- for the record, I totally agree with you, Brianna.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.680]   I think that--
[00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.720]   I really--
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.520]   I think that this is a bigger conversation.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.960]   And as much as I will say, that I'm totally
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:37.040]   fine with not seeing any more news periods some days.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.640]   I do think that this is a bigger conversation.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.280]   Obviously, Facebook has struggled with this.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.600]   Twitter has struggled with this.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:49.080]   All of the major platforms that we use every day
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:54.000]   are trying to solve this curation question
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.440]   and mostly trying to solve it for their own profitability
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.160]   and for their users.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.480]   And I also think it's really tricky when you start
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.240]   to get into this conversation of, well, what
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.960]   news sources should we promote?
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.560]   And I think that's part of the reason
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.120]   that a lot of the executives at these companies
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.200]   resist this idea because I do think
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.320]   that that is a tricky conversation of saying, OK,
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:20.440]   well, let's make sure people get their vegetables.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.920]   And obviously it is.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.960]   They are designing their tools around how users act
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:26.920]   and user behavior.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:28.880]   And they're trying to serve the user the content
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.280]   that the user seems to want.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   And if the user clicks on trash, they get served more trash.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.880]   And I do think that that's a really complicated thing
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.960]   of figuring out how to give people their vegetables,
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.160]   for lack of a better term.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.480]   So I agree that I think it is a conversation worth having.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.240]   I also think-- and I think we've talked about this on this show
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:58.960]   before-- that you really need a human element in this curation
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.560]   process.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:05.560]   It's not going to work to just build some algorithmic solution
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:06.040]   to this.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.680]   You need a human element when you're talking about fake news.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.200]   Or you're talking about wrong news or bad news or whatever.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.400]   So I do think it's a bigger conversation.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.880]   I do think that the president is not wrong,
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:25.360]   that there may be issues with the larger question of curation
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.560]   on tech platforms.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:29.360]   And we need to know more about how they do it.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.360]   And they probably need to do more to make sure they don't do it
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.280]   in an irresponsible way, since they have now become
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:41.240]   the arbiters of how we take in information all the time.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:45.120]   But obviously, when it comes to his positive stories getting
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.640]   punished, I think it's complete BS.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.280]   Yep.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.280]   Yep.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.720]   I just want to say one more very quick thing here.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.000]   And let's be clear that there has been throughout my life
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.800]   a very concerted effort by one particular political party
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.120]   to work the refs.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.720]   We saw this with the coverage of Facebook
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:10.200]   and the stories that came out this week about people not feeling
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.200]   they could express conservative opinions at Facebook.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.520]   That's part of a whole tactic that has been very, very effective.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.680]   So I think there's a conversation that needs to happen here.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.920]   But let's be really clear.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.240]   Like a certain political party is trying to work the referees here
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.960]   and get an outcome in their favor.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.200]   Andy, what are you thinking?
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.120]   A couple of things here.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.200]   They're obviously--
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.680]   Google's not responsible when-- if people
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.520]   are writing about weird and contrary things
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:45.640]   that you're saying and Google search
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.920]   finds all those articles, yeah, that's not Google's problem.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.320]   And that's a secure problem.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.760]   It's the problem of the people who are paid very, very well,
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.320]   government salaries to make sure to try to get you not to say
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.200]   stupid and contrary and incorrect things.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.920]   But it's good to have that broader question.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.280]   You're right about prejudice and search.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.080]   I don't believe there's a liberal prejudice
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.560]   or conservative prejudice.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.800]   There is, as Bree mentioned, when you do these searches,
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:17.040]   you get-- it seems to be favoring major news outlets
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.920]   that have real journalism that's happening, as opposed
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:24.040]   to Kyle and Randy's political blog.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:27.920]   But that in itself does point out one prejudice that we're
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.480]   not aware of, that independent voices of journalism
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.000]   are not going to be favored.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.200]   It's always going to be large corporate-owned newspapers
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.520]   and media outlets that are going to get the most attention.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.360]   It's not wrong for the New York Times
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.440]   becomes a juggernaut in these search results.
[00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.520]   But not everybody is as well-funded as the New York Times,
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.720]   even though they're working just as hard
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.920]   and providing just as good journalism.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:55.560]   And the other thing is that Google is not necessarily
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.960]   in control of its own algorithm.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.800]   And they don't know how it works and what effects it has
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:05.400]   on the people who are doing the searches until somebody--
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.840]   there's a really great book that I got a hold of earlier
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.840]   this year, I had to go look at algorithms of oppression
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.040]   by Jackie Snow.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:20.120]   And it's basically about how Google Search can enforce
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:20.840]   racism.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.440]   She did the inciting idea from this book.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:29.200]   Well, she did a search for the term black girls wanting
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.960]   to find some pieces that her nieces would enjoy.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.680]   But that might find interesting.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:39.720]   And most of the first pages were links to model sites
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:41.160]   and porn sites.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.960]   And that was a prejudice that was built into the search engine
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:47.560]   because the people who are gaming this are trying to hardwire
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.880]   those pages for those two words.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:51.960]   But nonetheless, the majority of people
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:55.560]   who are just looking for I'm doing a history paper,
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.680]   or I want to find out what resources there are
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:59.640]   for black girls who want to code or black girls who
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.760]   want to get access to whatever.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.800]   And that's not something that you get when you do other similar
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.640]   search terms.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.480]   So I don't know that it's a problem
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.800]   that Google can very easily solve.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.720]   The Boston Globe had a very, very long piece earlier
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:18.280]   this year that they decided that they posited that it's time
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:21.880]   for Google to be broken up in that they made the case that
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.000]   for one thing Google should open up the search algorithm
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.200]   so everyone could see how that works, which is a natural solution
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.960]   to the problem of we have to find out what's inside this black box.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.400]   But the problem is once everyone knows how it works,
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.960]   everybody will figure out how to fool it.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.880]   And that can't be that can't happen.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.400]   What I really favor is it is a black box,
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:42.520]   but it's a black box we all have access to.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.960]   Researchers can send whatever signals that come into it,
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.920]   take a look at the signals that come out of it
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.360]   and point out where it's failing.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.360]   And so I don't know if this had any direct,
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.280]   if the book that I was mentioning had any direct impact like this,
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.360]   but now if you do search for black girls,
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.600]   there's almost nothing that isn't like a LinkedIn profile
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.120]   for black girls code coding programs and other positive
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.680]   and good things.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.600]   So long as we have the, if Google is not going to monitor this,
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.760]   we have the ability to monitor it and make sure that it's not
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.800]   having an effect on how in our perception of the world.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.280]   Yeah, can I say one more thing before we move on on this?
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.920]   So at the height of Game of Game back in 2014,
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:30.920]   I got a, I got a rather interesting email from a woman.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:35.280]   And she was describing to me a company that a man in tech
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.920]   had started to basically wage SEO warfare against women
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.080]   that he didn't like.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.800]   And the idea was if you broke up with a girl
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.600]   or had some problem with the woman at work,
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.120]   you could destroy her life and he had a set of bot farms
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.400]   that would essentially go and rank up anything
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.400]   that the person paying for it wanted in a person's search results
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.320]   to basically destroy this person's professional reputation.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.200]   It was shocking to me how little that cost.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.880]   Andy, one of the things in the example,
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.200]   you just mentioned they do open up that box.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.960]   That's going to be a roadmap for people to know exactly
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.680]   how to conduct SEO warfare.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.160]   So I'm not sure that I agree with that.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:24.160]   But I would say SEO warfare as a tactic.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.280]   This has implications for cybersecurity.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.640]   It has implications for national security.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.240]   This is information warfare.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.040]   And we do need to start to have a discussion about this.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.560]   Now, I'm not the kind of person
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.080]   where I believe every single problem needs to be solved
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.360]   by the government, but I do think that there needs
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.400]   to be a conversation between national security interests
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.320]   and Google to make sure that other people
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.520]   are gaming search results for nefarious purposes.
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.920]   And I do think that's a conversation we should start to have.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.760]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.160]   But despite I have a fear,
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.200]   but that fear shouldn't interfere with this conversation
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.400]   that we need to have.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.640]   My fear is that we've seen what happens
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.280]   when people who decide that it's wrong that science doesn't,
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.000]   our science textbooks and schools don't cover intelligent design.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.680]   We need a balanced discussion of it.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.240]   And if we're looking at the scientific portion of it
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.680]   and it's not balanced unless we look at the other one.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.000]   So my fear, and again, I don't think this fear
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.600]   should supersede the ongoing conversation
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.680]   into how best to integrate search
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:43.480]   into responsibility for positive search into society.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.400]   My fear is that someone will say, well, look,
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   if someone is saying did Andy Anatko,
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.480]   who's running for Congress actually steer all of his campaign
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.400]   money into cookies and beer.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.840]   If they're 41 articles to say, well,
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.280]   I don't know what that rumor is about.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.960]   I don't want to vote for him, by the way.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.800]   Exactly.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.080]   I don't know what that investing is.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   I don't know, I should stress that I'm on the record
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.200]   saying no, I'm not even running for office.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.200]   But it's not a balanced search unless there are also
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.120]   also pulls up 41 articles that says that he did do it.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.960]   It's like, well, no, because these are idiots
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.080]   who are saying that he did that thing.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.280]   He's not even running for office.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.320]   I think your statement cuts to the core
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   of a lot of the president's complaints too, which is,
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.440]   we live in an era where people talk about alternative facts
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.960]   and truth not being truth.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   And one of the challenges is if you're trying to create
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.120]   this concept of a neutral search engine,
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.960]   but nobody can agree what neutral is.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.760]   And you see the arguments around this story.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.880]   It's things like, how dare that you say that CNN is neutral
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.160]   and Breitbart isn't?
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.280]   And it's like, OK, well, that is a perspective.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.720]   And somebody else might say, how could you say that Fox News
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.200]   is neutral and CNN isn't?
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.400]   And when you can't agree on what reality is,
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.200]   it's a problem now not necessarily
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.760]   to people who know all the brand names
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.520]   and know that when they pull up a Google News search
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.640]   and they see a Breitbart article,
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.080]   they know what they're going to get versus a Cher Blue
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.320]   article, let's say.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:09.680]   But it does matter if it's a topic where somebody is
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.760]   innocently typing something into the internet,
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.600]   wanting to know what the truth is,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.640]   and what they get is not the truth,
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.880]   but they get this weird collection of potentially,
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.440]   like, is the earth flat, right?
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.280]   The answer is no, it's not.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.880]   And it's not fair and balanced and neutral.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.040]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.480]   Oh boy.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.200]   The answer is what?
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.280]   I got some news for you later about the ice wall
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:33.960]   in Antarctica.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.960]   Anyway, that's the danger there is when people are saying,
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.200]   well, yeah, but I just want to know the real truth
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.080]   on the internet and the internet is incapable
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.200]   of providing the truth because we're unwilling to say,
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.280]   this is true and this is not,
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.080]   but when we can't agree on the truth, that's a lot harder.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.360]   Just to one point of clarification
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.200]   that we shouldn't care whether our news source
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.840]   is biased or not, we can only hold them to the standard
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:08.120]   that they have to say things that are factually based.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.840]   That they can, if it's not labeled as a personal editorial,
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.280]   if they're saying, you're free to say that the world is flat,
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.080]   but you have to show your work.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.200]   If you've done an incredible amount of research
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.080]   and if you've done all the homework
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.760]   and shown all the math, that's okay.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.440]   If you're showing, if you're just saying, I guess,
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.320]   citing other BS blogs that don't have any firmament,
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.480]   that's why bias is such a bad word for journalism.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.480]   I don't know any journalist who isn't biased in some way,
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.680]   but if they are journalists, they know that they can't simply
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.320]   say that employee employment is way, way, way, way down
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.920]   under Trump, well, no, it isn't.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.640]   You would have to come up with numbers too.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.480]   If you don't start off with the idea,
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.360]   I'm gonna write about how the employment is down under Trump.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.320]   You write under, well, how is employment doing under Trump?
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.240]   And then when you find out that no, the numbers are actually
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.840]   very, very good, you bite your tongue, you swallow your bio
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.760]   and you say, well, employment is actually very, very good
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.760]   under Trump because that's what you can actually prove.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.560]   So bias is not as important as being an actual journalist.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.040]   - Yeah, that's hard stuff.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.200]   Complicated, turns out when we were all excited
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.840]   about inventing the internet, I don't know,
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.840]   I was on the internet in the late 80s
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.320]   and I feel like sometimes those of us who were there early,
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.440]   the computer nerds among us, we probably got a sense
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.280]   at that point like, oh wow, imagine if all the issues
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.200]   we have now on this small internet were taken
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.960]   where everybody in the entire world was on the internet.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.760]   Oh, that might be bad, that might be bad,
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   that might be bad for society, turns out, well,
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.120]   what you gonna do?
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.800]   Here we are, now everybody's on the internet
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.880]   and it's, we've come a long way in 30 years,
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.680]   that's what I'm saying.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.520]   - That's true.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.160]   - I do sense another disturbance in the force
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.720]   as if somebody concerned about our own personal security
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.640]   on the internet was floating in the Mediterranean
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.720]   and had sent us a message and a bottle
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.440]   that we need to know about, Leo?
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.160]   - Let me barge in one more time and talk a little bit
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.600]   about something we did at Twit that made a huge difference,
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.740]   certainly a piece of mind for me.
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.280]   It all started when we had an engineer
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.800]   who couldn't remember the passwords, right?
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.440]   Now most people, if they can't remember passwords,
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.880]   they'll put a post it under the screen,
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.520]   they'll write it down in a book, they'll do something.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.000]   He did, I think he thought he was clever,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.160]   he put it up on the internet on a public website,
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.240]   all the logs, it's all the passwords for our web servers.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   Our Amazon instance, everything on a public website.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.120]   That's when I said, no, there's gonna be a better way
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.520]   and we got LastPass Enterprise.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.320]   It turns out I'd been using LastPass for years.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.760]   LastPass celebrated its 10th anniversary last month.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.680]   Oh, actually in July, so that's almost two months.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.040]   And I started using them, I think,
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.920]   right about when they first started.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.600]   And then we got to know Joe Seagress,
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.800]   the creator of LastPass, Steve Gibson interviewed him,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.440]   we looked at the source code, he gave it thumbs up,
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.160]   he started using it.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.800]   So I know LastPass is great, it's a password vault,
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.960]   keeps track of your passwords,
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.560]   it's the last password you have to remember,
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.520]   the LastPass vault password.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.280]   But it has so many features for enterprise
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.520]   that are so important.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.840]   Remember, when you have employees
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.360]   and you're giving them the keys to the kingdom,
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.880]   you know, they're gonna leave,
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.360]   they can share those passwords.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.480]   I just saw a study that said 32% of employees
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:22.760]   share their passwords with other employees, or people,
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.720]   maybe not even employees.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.840]   Now, oh, ow.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.760]   And then there's always the guy's gonna put it
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.080]   on the public website.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.720]   LastPass Enterprise makes password sharing convenient
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.640]   for employees, but keeps access to corporate data secure.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.520]   You can completely customize the access,
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.040]   I can share a password with an employee
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.120]   and they don't even get the password, they can't share it,
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.720]   they don't have it.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.600]   They can use it, but they don't have it.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.360]   I said it whether they can modify it,
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.920]   we can do there are a hundred different policies,
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.320]   things like, well, we have master password requirements,
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.320]   so they can't use monkey123 to open their vault,
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.600]   they have to use a good password.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.040]   We do have password resets, so if they forget
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.560]   an administrator, I or Russell or somebody can reset it,
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.680]   we do require, and I would recommend this two factor.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.440]   In fact, LastPass's Authenticator app,
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.080]   it makes it really easy, it's not a number,
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.800]   a button pops up on your employee's phone
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.240]   and said, did you just try to log in
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.360]   and they say, yes, that guarantees,
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.840]   they're the only ones who can access their account,
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.240]   that I think is really good.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.640]   You can organize more than just passwords
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.120]   to database logins, SSH keys, software licenses,
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.080]   as I travel, I'm in Europe right now,
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.080]   I always have in my LastPass, an image of my passport,
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.480]   so I always have it with me,
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.480]   you don't wanna put that in a public website,
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.800]   but I always have it with me secure,
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:47.160]   plus credit cards, drivers,
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.440]   everything, social security numbers, I stored it all in LastPass.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:54.720]   And LastPass makes it easy if an employee leaves
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.280]   to restrict access, or maybe they just no longer need access
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.160]   to the quick books or whatever, you can easily change that.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:06.360]   LastPass now supports Active Directory too, by the way,
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.040]   so you can use your Active Directory credentials to log in,
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.400]   so if you're an Active Directory house,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.840]   that's a great feature, you don't have to even have
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.960]   a LastPass password, just use your AD credentials.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.920]   And of course, and this is important,
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.280]   this is one of the things that Steve Gibson wanted to see,
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.000]   data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level,
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.280]   data stored in the vault is secret even from LastPass,
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.440]   no one has access to it but you.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.440]   LastPass's password generator is great,
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.760]   I use it all the time, and you know what I do,
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.760]   I do all the little tip, I make passwords of varying lengths.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.480]   So sometimes, I was just gonna say this,
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.480]   you can't make it more than 12, I was like, come on, come on,
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:49.280]   but if I can use long passwords and I use the longest ones I can,
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.440]   but I don't, but let's say it's, oh, we allow 48,
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.000]   I'll use 47 or 42, so it's not easily guessed
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.800]   how even how long my password is.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.400]   Makes it really easy to do that,
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.720]   you can of course have letters, numbers, special characters,
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.760]   whatever you need.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.040]   So there's LastPass for business, that's the LastPass enterprise,
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.520]   if you have a small business, LastPass teams 50 or fewer,
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.760]   that's good, there's LastPass premium for your own personal use,
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.640]   if you're not already using it, why not?
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.920]   LastPass families is great too, that's what I use at home,
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.760]   that way I can share passwords with Lisa,
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.720]   like things like, you know, she wants to know,
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.600]   and you know what the login for Comcast is,
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.640]   I could send that to her.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.480]   - Securely.
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:32.720]   - LastPass, more than 13 million people trust LastPass
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.040]   is the number one most preferred password manager.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.000]   So what I've been using for almost a decade,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.760]   Steve Gibson uses and we use here @twit.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.920]   Enough said, right, LastPass,
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.960]   learn more at lastpass.com/twit,
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.240]   lastpass.com/twit.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.400]   - Snow?
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.480]   - Yes sir, oh yes sir, I'm coming sir, I'm here, what is it?
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.600]   Oh, he's not gonna answer, is he?
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.480]   He's probably not gonna answer.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.720]   By the way, great news from our chat room
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.320]   and our live video stream, they all assure us
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.280]   that they watch it all in full screen
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.480]   and they're always paying attention to everything we do.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.000]   We're not minimized, we're not,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.680]   they are very special people,
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.400]   they are wrapped with attention for this, everything we do.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.560]   - Really?
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.400]   - Yeah.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.640]   - I'm surprised at that time,
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.240]   and during the last ad break, before,
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.400]   when I was holding up that sign,
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.480]   this is everybody in the chat room can suck eggs
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.720]   that nobody mentioned that well.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.040]   - Nobody said a single thing,
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.280]   they didn't mention anything when you put on that chicken
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.800]   costume earlier, nothing.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.840]   - I guess just water off a duck's back,
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.200]   you just cannot be, your salon cannot be dampened, okay?
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.640]   - That's, that's, I just love how dedicated they are.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.920]   So we live in a world where people say everything is a service.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.560]   I was reading a story about how one could argue
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.920]   that Apple's focus on services revenue
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.680]   should start to include iPhone revenue
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.560]   since you can actually sign up for a plan
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.080]   where you just get a new iPhone every year
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.880]   by paying them a monthly fee.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.160]   And all of this is my way of saying Microsoft
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.880]   announced a new thing called Xbox All Access.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.360]   And what is this?
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.640]   You get, and this is right after I bought an Xbox One X,
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.080]   by the way, so I was really thrilled to see this news.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.360]   You get Xbox Game Pass where you've got like more than
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.800]   a hundred games that you have access to.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.800]   You get Xbox Live Gold, which gives you access
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.120]   to a whole bunch of extra stuff too.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:23.120]   And either an Xbox One S console, or an Xbox One X console,
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.200]   if you want the One S, which is the cheaper one,
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.560]   it's $22 a month on a two year contract.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.560]   If you want the One X, it's $35 a month.
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.600]   So they've rolled all of their premium services
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.760]   and the box itself into a two year contract
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.240]   with a monthly fee.
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.240]   And Xbox as a service is here, I guess.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.240]   You don't need to buy the console, you just pay them
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.120]   $22 or $35 a month, and you got an Xbox with all the games
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.040]   that are on their services like right then, including,
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.320]   I think it's all of the exclusives go into Game Pass,
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.960]   all the Xbox exclusives of which there are not as many
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.480]   as on PlayStation, but still,
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.840]   Brie, I know you're a huge gamer.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.840]   What do you think about--
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.440]   - I used to be before I was running for--
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.400]   - Before you were running, okay, well, you know, okay,
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.680]   think back.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.880]   How do you feel about this idea of the console maker
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.120]   just saying, "I'm sure just past monthly
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.440]   "and we'll give you the box?"
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.680]   - So I think this is a fantastic deal for consumers.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.160]   I think this is an amazing deal with consumers for consumers.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.160]   That said, people don't understand just how expensive
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.640]   games are to develop.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:31.200]   Something Netflix works because the cost of developing
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.680]   content has really, really gone down,
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.160]   like the cost of delivering special effects,
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.440]   the cost of doing color correction.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.920]   It's gone down to a point where they can do that
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.880]   for Netflix shows.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:47.000]   For game development, what you're seeing is we haven't
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.920]   really found a way to bring those costs down.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.080]   And this has led to a real innovation crisis
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:57.720]   in our industry where if people are spending $150 million
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.080]   to make a game, well, that's why we're getting
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.960]   Call of Duty Black Ops 3 this year.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.840]   So I think this is a great deal.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.960]   I'm definitely gonna subscribe to it.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.720]   That said, I think this is going to send our industry
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:15.560]   into like once this becomes mainstream,
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.960]   I don't think this is gonna be good for developers at all.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.560]   I'm not gonna talk out of school,
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.200]   but I think if you talk to most developers that have
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:28.880]   participated in PlayStation Plus and the free games
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.160]   that come along with that, it has been a very mixed bag,
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.600]   whether or not that's been a financially good deal for them.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:41.280]   Often they'll just give you like 30,000, $40,000
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.520]   to like basically have the game on the service forever,
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.280]   which isn't great for a lot of people.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.640]   It doesn't recoup costs.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.440]   So yeah, gave for consumers really bad for our industry
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.640]   and it's just gonna make our innovation crisis
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.480]   that much worse.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.080]   - I will say knowing some people in the VFX industry,
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.680]   I think there are some similar issues there
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.080]   where the price of visual effects has been pushed down
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.000]   but also the job security and the payment to those people
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.240]   and it's the most important thing
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:11.840]   and movies and TV today and yet they have very little power
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.800]   and a lot of those companies go out of business
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.920]   just like game studios do.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.040]   It's actually kind of, I mean,
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.200]   there are some parallels there too.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.080]   Ben and Andy, what do you guys think about Microsoft
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.840]   as Xbox as a Surface?
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:25.880]   It's a thing now, just pay a month and you get a game
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.720]   and you get a conference.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.880]   - It's crazy, it reminds me of cell phones, right?
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.280]   - Like, yeah, it is, it's your Xbox plan,
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.080]   your monthly Xbox plan.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.880]   - Yeah, and I don't know, there is something compelling
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.240]   about the idea of not necessarily having to buy
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.160]   a new console every five years
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.440]   or whatever the heck it is for $400
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.880]   and for some reason, even though I might eventually pay
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:55.080]   more than that, paying a monthly fee instead
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.880]   feels better somehow.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.720]   I do think it's an interesting idea,
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.240]   the question is, I don't know,
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.840]   how many people will jump onto it
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.320]   and how many people will be like me
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.400]   where they really just wanna buy the thing and own the thing
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.800]   and this is another old man grumbling thing, I guess,
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.160]   but I spend a lot of my time complaining about
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.240]   how you used to own the game, you bought the game
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.640]   and it came on a DVD and you owned that thing
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.400]   or you owned the software,
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:28.760]   it came on an actual physical thing
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.760]   that you owned a copy of it.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.040]   And now this, I don't know, this move to everything
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.840]   as an internet-based service,
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.720]   there are things about that
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.160]   where you're just kind of borrowing it.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.920]   Everything from when we're talking about digital music
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.840]   to software, to games becomes, I think,
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.360]   frustrating in a lot of ways to say nothing of the impact
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:55.600]   it has on the actual people whose jobs it is
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.880]   to make this stuff.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   I think it does actually create some annoyances
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.520]   for the user that you wouldn't have imagined before
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.320]   when you were so excited about how convenient it was.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.920]   - Well, it is nice that you do,
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.360]   after spending, what, $600 to $800,
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.880]   you do get to keep the console at the end of the agreement.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880]   That's nice.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.080]   But my big reaction is that this really
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:26.400]   shows you how valuable customer acquisition is
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.520]   for any service that if you can get,
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.400]   now, I think it's especially a big problem
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.200]   for a lot of players now that every TV comes with
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.040]   a Netflix, excuse me, a Netflix client
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:42.240]   and a Hulu client and a YouTube client built in.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.880]   If you can somehow get more people to basically choose
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   your box as the pipe through which all of their content comes
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.320]   boy, that sucks money out of their bank account.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.680]   At some point, they're gonna buy stuff.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.240]   And at some point, they are gonna forget to turn off
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.760]   certain controls that let you observe exactly
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   how they're playing and what they're watching.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.760]   And that's why it's such a good example
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:14.200]   to compare this to early days of the phones
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.200]   where they would give you the phone if you just sign up
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.560]   because the most important thing is if they can get you
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.800]   to sign up for two years to use AT&T
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.040]   or to use Verizon, chances are you're gonna still be
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.480]   a customer four, five, six, seven, eight years later
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.880]   no matter how you abuse them.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.880]   So that's a sign of exactly how the streaming world is going
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.760]   and it shows you what things might change in the next year
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.840]   or two if Apple does decide to deliver streaming package
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.120]   through Apple TV or if Google does decide to expand
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.560]   their YouTube TV service to become your point of access
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.520]   to pretty much every piece of streamed entertainment
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:52.560]   that you might wanna access.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   So this is gonna be cheap money,
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.400]   this is gonna be long money for Microsoft, I think.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.240]   - And from a purely consumer buying psychology standpoint,
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.200]   the fact is a smaller monthly bill seems better
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.320]   than having to go over that hurdle of spending $400
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.520]   or $300 on the console, even though if you net it out
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.280]   over two years, you're spending a lot of money
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.440]   on all of this stuff, but you don't have to put down
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.280]   a large sum of money, it's just like buying a $1,000 phone.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.440]   It's a lot easier to agree to add to your contract
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.280]   for a small two digit sum instead of shelling out a lot of money
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.680]   but you're still spending the money is the thing.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.640]   - Yeah, this sort of deal does tend to bring in a lot more
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.440]   people of middle and lower income
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.720]   because they can get a hold of 35 bucks
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.840]   over the course of a month.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.040]   They might not necessarily be able to get a hold
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.320]   of $500 all at once, particularly when they know
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:47.080]   that they're handing over $500 and getting a game console.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:52.080]   So this is why biases in pricing tends
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.600]   to really have a long impact.
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.840]   There's the old saying that there's nothing more expensive
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.840]   than cheap pair of boots because these $100 boots,
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:03.000]   you're gonna have to replace in a year
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.800]   where as if you buy a pair of $500 boots
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.960]   that'll last you 10, 15, 20 years,
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.560]   but the thing is that a lot of people they will not have
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.960]   that they don't have that $500 to spend at once
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:17.040]   on a pair of boots, but they can get a hundred bucks.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.680]   And then they need boots right now.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.280]   So just 19,000 payments of 1999.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.560]   - Oh, well, sign me up.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.640]   - So I mean, yes, Bri, what would you like to say?
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.400]   - Yeah, I was just gonna say,
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:32.280]   I also think it's worth thinking about the fact
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.880]   that our industry profits so much by re-releasing games
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.000]   to run on modern systems, ask any gamer
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.080]   how many copies of Final Fantasy VI
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.240]   or Final Fantasy IV they bought.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.800]   I probably bought 20 different versions of it
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.000]   for different platforms.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.760]   Like, so I do think this is gonna really cut into that revenue.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.960]   I mean, again, it's great for the consumer,
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.200]   but like, look at Valkyria Chronicles.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.880]   This is a fantastic example.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.680]   Sega puts out this game.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.040]   It's kind of a cult classic.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.720]   They sell it again to you by selling the PS4 upscale remaster
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.920]   that's essentially just a re-release.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.200]   And they do very well with that.
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.400]   I think if the service catches on,
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.840]   that's just another way that, again, great for the consumer.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.040]   Why should I have to buy Valkyria Chronicles again
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:23.480]   to run on my PS4 when I buy it from my PS3?
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.000]   But not super great for the people
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.680]   actually making these games.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.000]   - And there are a lot of games that are not
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.480]   in these subscription services
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.120]   that people can still buy separately,
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:34.600]   but I've seen it firsthand with my son
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.760]   in our one month trial of Xbox Game Pass
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:40.920]   that we got when we bought the 1X and with Live Gold
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.840]   that the fact is the existence of those libraries
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.120]   suppresses his desire to buy other games.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.880]   So it does have a carry on effect.
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:51.280]   And I'm sure it then pressures those developers
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.560]   to get in because now their revenues are down,
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.040]   it pressures their developers to get into these deals,
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.200]   which are bad deals for them.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.480]   And I can see that.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.920]   I can see it happening in my house
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.760]   that he's definitely less interested in buying games
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.800]   because he's got this huge catalog now.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.120]   - Yeah.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.240]   Even Apple is looking at the problem of,
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.400]   if we can't necessarily attain more customers,
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.680]   how can we make more money off of each transaction?
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.840]   And that was one of the highlights of the sales call
[01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.640]   that they, excuse me, the analyst call a few months ago
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.240]   that although five phone sales are a little bit flat,
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.000]   they're making money on more money
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.040]   with every off of every customer.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.560]   So now Microsoft is kind of doing that same thing
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.360]   where we can have customers, but make more money
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.880]   by selling them services, access to old games as opposed.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.080]   And as Bree says, it kind of throws a knife
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.360]   in developers' backs.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.520]   If Microsoft is more concerned with selling subscriptions
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.840]   to Microsoft services, then they are helping developers
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:51.840]   sell games.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.000]   - I wanna shift gears for a minute.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.920]   One of the other topics I wanted to talk about briefly,
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.720]   touch on briefly, is something I noticed this week,
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.800]   it was a report in the Financial Times by about Uber.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.320]   And in specific, it was a conversation
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.760]   that one of the reporters had with Dara Kastrashahi
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.440]   who is the CEO of Uber now.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:17.000]   And what he said was, they are planning a long-term shift
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.880]   from cars to electric bicycles and scooters.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.600]   And they already bought an e-bike company, Jump,
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.760]   and they have a deal with Lime,
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.200]   the bike and scooter rental system.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.000]   And what the CEO of Uber said is,
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.720]   "There are lots of cases," and this is kind of a no-brainer,
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.120]   but to hear the CEO of Uber say it is interesting.
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.200]   There are a lot of cases where you're in an urban core
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.160]   and you need to take one person a few blocks,
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.440]   and there is no reason for that to happen in a car
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.080]   that weighs a ton when you could hop on a little electric
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.280]   scooter and just zip there in a few minutes
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.040]   and not have to deal with gridlock downtown.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.040]   And so I was intrigued by this because it seems to me
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.720]   that if you're a new Uber driver, you're like,
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.080]   "Well, wait a second, that's one of my fairies,"
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080]   you just took away from me.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.720]   But I get kind of the larger point,
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.040]   which is that this is a recognition by Uber
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.040]   that maybe as advanced a disruptive technology transportation
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:15.760]   platform as they are, if all their chips are on cars,
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.960]   they're missing out on the potential of e-bikes and scooters.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.080]   - Yeah, wait, I mean, Uber, oh sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.080]   - I'll just then be quick.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.440]   My first reaction is that they're clearly,
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:31.320]   you wanna own all the railroads on the Monopoly board.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.480]   And so that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.320]   This is gonna be the popularity of as much damage
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:41.080]   as they do these early iterations of these
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.000]   dockless scooter and bicycle rentals,
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.720]   the fact that they're so popular,
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.280]   last time I was in DC,
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.360]   you see just people riding these things everywhere.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.200]   That means that it's fulfilling, just like Uber
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.040]   was fulfilling a need that was invisible
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:56.560]   until this service became available.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.280]   They can't stand by and let someone else take again,
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.680]   one of the other railroads on the board
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.160]   when they have the ability to take it themselves.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.120]   - Yeah, I was gonna use a different analogy,
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   which is basically like owning the whole chain, right?
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.560]   Like they wanna own everything from planes,
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.720]   trains, automobiles.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:15.640]   - How far do you wanna go?
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.960]   We've got something for you.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.000]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.960]   And I actually do, as a user, like I do,
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.640]   I do see the potential beauty of that future, right?
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.040]   Like if I'm, it's the same thing,
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.320]   it basically is the same thing as Amazon,
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.920]   but for travel, right?
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.840]   Like if I'm a prime Uber member,
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.400]   I just like get out of my car
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:40.240]   and I get onto my Uber scooter
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.960]   and then I get onto my Uber train.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.080]   And then, you know what I mean?
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.720]   Like I think reducing that friction
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:49.680]   of having to sort of like get the car rental
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.800]   and then do this, like when you're on vacation,
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.320]   for instance, to just be able to like swipe your fob
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   or whatever the heck just to do everything
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.800]   in your travel schedule or on your itinerary
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.920]   with one company, I think makes a lot of sense.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.400]   So I can totally see,
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:07.880]   I makes total sense why Uber would be trying
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.240]   to do this sort of thing.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.920]   - Brie, what are you thinking?
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.320]   - I'm thinking the exact same thing.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.600]   Yeah, I think sometimes when we talk about technology,
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.240]   there tends to be a very American centric point of view.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.080]   If you look at China, like they've innovated
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:25.280]   with rideshare bicycle sharing services
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.640]   and scooter services.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.440]   So this just seems like an entirely new way to do this.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.520]   You know, Jason, I was at WWC this year
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.680]   where I saw your great show on Relay and--
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.440]   - We were riding electric scooters, weren't we?
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:39.280]   All of us.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.000]   - Well, no, well, I felt bad for my hotel,
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.600]   like getting an Uber to drive down there.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.520]   Like it's gorgeous, I'm outside,
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:46.760]   I'm not having to smile
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.960]   'cause I'm not running for anything at that moment.
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:54.960]   And I remember looking at the very bare bicycle sharing
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.760]   surface that was down there
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.280]   and thinking how great that would be
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.640]   if it were more expanded.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:03.760]   So I would just, I love this idea
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.240]   and I would love to see it, it happened.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:09.200]   Though I will say there are plenty of times,
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.480]   you know, like when you're riding with elderly people,
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.680]   like not everyone can get on a scooter
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.920]   because of that last mile.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.120]   I would like for the option to be there for you
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.920]   to just get driven all the way.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.760]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.760]   - It's also another regulation nightmare.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.600]   - Oh yeah.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:27.840]   - Like it's an absolute, I can't say,
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.120]   well, the other half of this,
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:30.680]   but it's an absolute cluster, right?
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.400]   - Yes, that was my,
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.080]   several of my friends at Apple's developer conference
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:37.920]   in San Jose where they were bird and lime scooters everywhere.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.720]   We rode the scooters and they were a lot of fun.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.000]   And I'll tell you, the general response was,
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.080]   ride 'em while they're legal
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.520]   'cause they should not be legal.
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.680]   They're super dangerous.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:48.520]   - Yeah, they're--
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:50.240]   - Because what you need, I went into Amsterdam this summer
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.760]   and like what you need is you need the city
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.040]   to adjust to the existence of these vehicles
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.760]   'cause right now, one of those scooters,
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.240]   you're supposed to not ride on the sidewalk
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.120]   which is good 'cause you will plow down pedestrians.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:29:59.960]   That's not good.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.840]   But if you go in the bike lane, you will die
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.280]   because there will be big cars there that will hit you
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.960]   and there will be bikes that will be angry at you.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.400]   So like you just, we all need to adjust
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.960]   our cities to this stuff, but as Andy pointed out,
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.920]   the demand shows you there's something there.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.640]   There's clearly something there.
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:20.640]   - That's why I really really like these dockless vehicles.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.240]   And I think it's super, super important
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.080]   that these companies work with communities
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.920]   as opposed to simply these.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.920]   Every single, wow, there's a van driving around
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:37.120]   just dumping bikes and dumping scooters everywhere.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:38.120]   - What could go wrong with that?
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.120]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.720]   They need to, that's why San Francisco decided,
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.560]   guess what?
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.200]   The two biggest players, because you've been jerks,
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.880]   you don't get to operate in the city.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.400]   - It turns out that if you ask for forgiveness
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:54.040]   instead of permission, when you go against the supervisors,
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.720]   they say, no, we're not gonna give the contract to you then.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.840]   - But we don't forgive you.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.520]   - Everybody gives, no forgiveness.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.360]   - We don't forgive this.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.480]   - But the reason why I think that we should definitely
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:07.160]   let these things happen and grow is that
[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.880]   because again, not only because people have demonstrated
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.880]   that we have a use for these, these are fulfilling a need,
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:14.360]   it will also help solve so many problems
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:17.080]   that are hitherto a bit unsolvable.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.800]   I, as I've been saying, another, I've said before,
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.640]   another podcast, that I gave up my car a few years ago
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.200]   because my bike was, and public transportation
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.720]   were working so well, and the system worked so well
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.920]   that I took only like a portion of the money
[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:34.840]   that I was gonna be spending on, to replace the car
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.000]   that I gave up a few years ago.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   It basically, the salt, salt corrosion got to it before I did.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.680]   That's why I gave up the car.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.240]   But I've done that, I've replaced that
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.240]   with not an electric pedal assist bike.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.440]   And the reason why more people aren't using these
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.800]   electric bicycles and electric scooters is because,
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:58.560]   as you say, even if a city is advanced enough
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:02.280]   to put down a bike lane, no, but the drivers don't care.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:05.360]   UPS drivers will still park over that lane
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.680]   as they go, "Oh, we're just gonna drop off a couple packages."
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.320]   And UPS will have a big fit
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.560]   if they start getting ticketed for
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.000]   bought blocking the bike lane.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.760]   But once this becomes part of the assumed infrastructure
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.520]   of how people get around, once it's ordinary people
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.680]   who haven't necessarily spent $3,000 on an electric bike,
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.360]   haven't necessarily bought an electric skateboard,
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.280]   but the people who do count on,
[01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:30.360]   if they were meeting somebody a mile and a half away,
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.960]   instead of getting a cab or taking public transportation,
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.640]   if they know that, can just grab a scooter
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.760]   and get there without having to walk the whole way,
[01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:41.760]   once they start saying, "Hey, I've been forced to go into the street,
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.520]   that's unsafe, I won't have this,"
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.480]   or, "I've been forced to go on the sidewalk
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.320]   where I'm in danger with other people, I won't have this."
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.120]   That's when cities start to see,
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.560]   "Here's how many people are getting from here to there
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.960]   on personal electric vehicles or personal vehicles."
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.720]   And so we're gonna have to make sure
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.560]   that there's infrastructure to accommodate them safely,
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.280]   which, and part of that infrastructure is
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.200]   that guess what UPS driver, now you are getting ticketed
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:09.080]   every time you block that green thing.
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.240]   So it's not just gonna help out people
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:14.240]   who like to use these dockless vehicles,
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.880]   but it's also gonna help people who maybe decide,
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.720]   "Gee, I use these bicycles so much,
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:22.760]   maybe I will buy myself a folding bicycle
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.600]   so that I can get from the office too,
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.800]   where I need to go from time to time,
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.400]   or people who wanna have those electric bikes."
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.440]   So just like, again, you have to develop a city
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.000]   that incorporates this stuff,
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.480]   and you have to make sure that you support these people.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.560]   Once people have support for using these vehicles,
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.640]   more people will use them,
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.920]   and that's how you get more cars out of the city,
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.000]   all the unnecessary cars out of your city.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:45.920]   - Yeah, walking around Amsterdam,
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.320]   it's just great in seeing that that is a city
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.600]   that has been redesigned for bicycles being a major part,
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.960]   and it is, and it is, and it's huge.
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:56.360]   I do, I wonder about what might happen
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.280]   in a city like that, where they have,
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:33:59.920]   they actually have bicyclists of service there,
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.880]   where literally there's so much bike theft
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   that it's better to just pay for a service,
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:04.880]   and if somebody steals your bike,
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.160]   they just bring you another one,
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.160]   it's like a disposable bike.
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.640]   Interesting, and you mentioned pedal assist,
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:11.880]   I wanted to say one of the things,
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:14.520]   and since Grie especially mentioned accessibility,
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.400]   the idea that can you ride on a scooter?
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.480]   Are you well enough to ride on a scooter, for example?
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.280]   One of the things about eBikes that's great
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:24.240]   is that they aren't traditional bikes,
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.600]   they've got the electric assist,
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.600]   which means if you're somebody who isn't comfortable
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.520]   riding up a hill, or you don't want to get super sweaty
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.480]   when you get to the office at the end for your commute,
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.120]   because you've had to pedal up a hill,
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.520]   that's what's great about eBikes,
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.520]   is they're accessible to way more people
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.840]   than who would use a traditional bike
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.480]   where they have to supply all the power themselves,
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.480]   which is, it's a good thing for transportation,
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.440]   maybe not as great a workout,
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.600]   but good for transportation in urban areas.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.440]   - But that's still the--
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.240]   - I'm also curious about tech solutions
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.560]   to some of the logistical challenges.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:58.560]   Like, could you, if your phone knows what your altitude is
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.840]   and what the temperature is,
[01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.200]   and where you are exactly,
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.520]   can you almost apply some similar technology,
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.120]   like solutions to making sure
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.680]   that none of these scooters, for instance,
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.120]   ride on the sidewalk?
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.520]   Like, again, this is a little bit futuristic, I suppose,
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.160]   but can you, as you're designing cities
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.240]   to be more open to these multimodal transportation,
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.120]   or however you want to describe it,
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.960]   you should be able to get these companies
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:31.560]   to make some tech changes
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.480]   to the modes of transportation themselves,
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.080]   to make sure that they stay in their lane
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.800]   for lack of a better term.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.640]   - Oh, goodness.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.320]   I have to say, I don't,
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.240]   I mean, I obviously think that could be a component of it,
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:50.000]   but I think the core issue here is we need to start
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.920]   planning our cities for the future.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.880]   That means funding infrastructure,
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.240]   that means thinking about a future
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.280]   when maybe not everyone has a car.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.640]   I think here in Massachusetts,
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.160]   that might even, and I know this is an extreme political view,
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.760]   maybe we should fund the tea, maybe, I don't know,
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.560]   but I think we've got to start funding
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.120]   infrastructure to the city,
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.920]   and not have a four year plan that we have been having.
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.160]   I think we need a 20 year plan
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.600]   for what our major cities are going to look like.
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:20.440]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:21.280]   - I totally agree with that.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.440]   - There's a lot of experimentation going on
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.760]   at the city level, which is interesting,
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:27.000]   'cause we talk so much about how so much
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.360]   of our government can seem dysfunctional
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.480]   or gridlocked at times.
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.760]   And there are a lot of cities that are trying new things,
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.120]   and sometimes it goes well and sometimes it doesn't,
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.680]   but I think that there are some encouraging signs
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:42.560]   that you do have cities that are embracing these things
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.840]   and say, "Sure, let's give it a try and see what happens."
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.360]   - There are whole groups there.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   It's a whole culture of us,
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.600]   it's actually called city of the future planning,
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.400]   and there are a lot of research being done on it
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:54.560]   and a lot of advisory groups that,
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.760]   and the Obama administration actually had a lot of people
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.040]   who are very deeply involved in this.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.920]   I went to a couple of conferences
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.840]   during the last administration that are just mind blowing,
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.400]   but here is what happens once you start to get
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.720]   all the unnecessary cars off the road,
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.960]   once you start to build, essentially,
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.840]   if it really isn't if you build it,
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.120]   they will come sort of thing.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:20.120]   Once you create a thoroughfare that is appealing to,
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:24.280]   or even just basically safe for pedestrians
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.840]   and self-powered vehicles,
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.120]   people, more people see people on bicycles
[01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:32.600]   and on electric scooters in these lanes
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.160]   or going past stuck traffic
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.120]   that more people are gonna actually start to use this stuff.
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.840]   - Well, you know, one thing that hasn't been converted
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:44.520]   to entirely electricity is floating around
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.440]   in the Mediterranean and the cruise ship.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.800]   - Now, we should say that Leo is not weeping
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:52.000]   as he desperately tries to get the volleyball
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.040]   with his handprint on it, that is lured away from him.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.560]   We believe him to be safe.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.720]   - We don't know that for sure, Andy.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.360]   We don't know that.
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.560]   - Faith managers, Dax, you know that as much as we do.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.640]   - I do know that.
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.200]   Okay, I do think though that Leo is fine enough
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:10.560]   to tell us about our next sponsor.
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.560]   - Hi, Jason and company.
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:14.840]   One more quick spot before you wrap things up
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:17.400]   from our sponsor, LegalZoom.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.600]   LegalZoom, you know, when I started Twit,
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.600]   I went to Kevin Rose, I said, "I wanna start a company."
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:29.600]   What, he said, "You need to start an LLC?
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.280]   Go to legalzoom.com.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.920]   It's affordable, it's easy.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.160]   It protects you."
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:37.840]   He, I trademarked the Twit name and the logo,
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.280]   all with LegalZoom.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.920]   Over the past 17 years, I'm not alone.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.880]   More than a million Americans have used LegalZoom
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:45.600]   to launch their businesses.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.600]   Running a business has, there's a lot of paperwork.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.280]   There's taxes, there's contracts.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.880]   There's a lot of fine print.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.120]   LegalZoom makes it easy and it's a lot less expensive
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.120]   than, you know, going to a big law firm.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.480]   LegalZoom's not a law firm.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.920]   They have a network of independent attorneys
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:01.920]   and tax professionals though,
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.680]   who can give you the advice you need to get through
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.200]   the daily grind of running your business.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:09.120]   So it's like, you know, you've got lawyers working for you,
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.080]   but they're not a law firm.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.080]   You don't have to worry about driving to somebody's office
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.000]   or being billed by the hour.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.960]   You know what I mean?
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:19.280]   I've been in meetings with lawyers and I look around,
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.160]   I say, "150 an hour, 250 an hour, 350 an hour."
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.400]   And I add it all up.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.520]   Every minute's costing me hundreds of dollars.
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.880]   I'm going, "No!"
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.800]   LegalZoom, you don't have to worry about that.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:34.000]   They're not a law firm, but you can get great legal advice
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.560]   and you can count on LegalZoom to provide
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:37.600]   the business resources you need and the service
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.720]   that fits into your schedule.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.240]   Look, put your time and money where it counts
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:44.520]   in your growing business, let LegalZoom
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.800]   handle the paperwork, the legal stuff.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.320]   Like it is, for somebody starting out, it's a real bonus.
[01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.920]   One of the things that's really making it possible
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.400]   for people to become entrepreneurs, like you, right?
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.360]   You want to do it?
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.600]   Go to LegalZoom.com, use a promo code, Twitter,
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.920]   check out, they've got a little special savings for you.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.200]   Just to say thank you and thank you for me
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.760]   for using the offer code to it.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.240]   That way they know that you heard it here.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.040]   LegalZoom.com, use the offer code to it.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.200]   Like all our sponsors, we couldn't do it without them
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.720]   and we're very grateful.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.280]   So it's nice if you can support them, they support us.
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.320]   LegalZoom.com, use a promo code to it.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:26.960]   LegalZoom, where life meets legal.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:29.440]   And now I'd like you to meet Jason Snell, Jason.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:32.640]   Leo, are you on a barge?
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.760]   Are you on a boat?
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.600]   We don't know.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.600]   He said he was sorry to barge in and I started to wonder
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.480]   if he may be like in a shipping container
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:41.160]   with a little light bulb hanging down or something.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.000]   I don't know.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.080]   I don't know, we only have the one postcard from him so far.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.160]   So it's just an airplane.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:46.840]   And that's a plane, it is just a plane.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.920]   So there's really no facts here other than
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.080]   that they are going to.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:54.200]   Oh, I'm sending fresh iron goods down the Hudson River.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.040]   I'm sure everything is great.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:00.920]   And Leo, this is just me being envious of Leo
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.920]   being on an awesome vacation.
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:07.240]   And we are here, but friends, I have to add,
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:10.640]   it's sorry I have to do this, I'm sorry, but it's necessary.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.360]   It's a sad moment as we get to the end of the show here
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.120]   because as I said at the top of the show,
[01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:20.280]   I need to say RIP to an old friend, an old pal,
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:25.360]   was with us, it supported us, it put space on the outside
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:28.720]   of our displays so that we could put our fingers all over the edges.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.160]   And it didn't matter because we weren't touching the screen.
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.000]   Bezels, bezels are dead apparently.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:42.000]   The Verge reporting that at the IFA convention in Berlin,
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.480]   there were a lot of new laptops there.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.720]   Bezels are going away.
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.360]   It's a style thing.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.640]   I mean, who needs a bezel?
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.960]   The iPads, which we didn't even talk about earlier,
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.760]   are rumored to be losing their bezels as well
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:57.480]   in the same style as kind of the iPhone X.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:00.560]   I recently bought a television, a 4K TV.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.240]   I always thought the TV in my parents' house was enormous.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:06.720]   And I realized that my TV is actually
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:09.880]   quite larger screenwise than my mom's TV.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:15.160]   But she's got me be in bezels because her TV's 10 years old
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:18.440]   and it's got these gigantic bezels that my TV doesn't have.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:21.040]   So I just, you know, pour one out for the bezels
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:22.360]   is what I'm saying.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.000]   Does anybody have a strong pro bezel feelings
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:26.840]   that they want to get out?
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:28.800]   You might want to do it now because we may never talk
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.880]   about bezels ever again.
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.360]   Let them die.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.720]   Let them die.
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:35.080]   It's a natural way of things.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.440]   Natural way of things.
[01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:37.240]   They need to go.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:37.720]   I just--
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.440]   The Pinings of the Viewer, it's even now.
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:44.440]   You know, because the thing is on a laptop,
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:45.440]   here's one thing.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.520]   If you have a bezel, that means that you
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:53.200]   can have a really nice solid frame, a metal subframe around it,
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:57.000]   that maybe will protect the thing from flexing and breaking.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.960]   And if you have a bezel, that means
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.840]   that you don't have to have like a web camera that pops out
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.240]   from the damn keyboard, which is just plain wrong.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.000]   And if you have a bezel and you've
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.800]   got a computer with a touchscreen,
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.520]   it means that you've got a place when you're--
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:14.880]   when you're basically got your coffee in one hand
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.760]   and you're scrolling with your thumb on the other,
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.120]   you've got a place to rest your thumb without putting
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.240]   a mouse click in there.
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:23.160]   And I don't think bezels are a bad thing.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:25.560]   Do you know how grouchy you sound right now?
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.320]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.280]   I feel like I have--
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.480]   If Andy will not speak for the bezel, who will?
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.480]   I'll speak for him.
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.200]   Oh, Ben, I'm also a pro bezel.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:35.720]   OK.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.320]   I know I think--
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.480]   Talk to me.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.360]   I think the design thing, the design point
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.800]   that Andy makes when it comes to sort of protecting
[01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.040]   your screen is a really interesting one,
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:46.600]   because I do--
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:51.800]   I guess I don't have anything really that is bezel-less.
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:55.080]   Not even the mirrors in my house are bezel-less when I think
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:56.040]   about it.
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:59.280]   But I do think that that does seem like a potential design
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.640]   issue with breaking screens easily.
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:05.440]   I drop my laptop probably once a quarter,
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.960]   and I feel like when that happens with a bezel-less screen,
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:14.360]   it's going to be a bigger problem than it is right now.
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.040]   And I also think about--
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.520]   you think about frames for photographs.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:24.800]   I remember in the very early days of posting photos online--
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.480]   I want to see it was Instagram, but I actually
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.400]   don't know if that's true.
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.640]   But posting photos online, I would always add--
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.080]   you know how you could add the frame to the picture,
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.400]   like add a black frame around the picture?
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:37.240]   I used to always do that, because I just
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:38.680]   thought it looked better.
[01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.600]   So I'm curious to see what laptops will actually
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.200]   look and feel like without bezels.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:46.200]   I haven't seen one, IRL, yet.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:47.160]   So I don't know.
[01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.680]   I feel like we might miss the bezel.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.240]   It's possible.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.680]   I wanted to mention I have actually right in front of me
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.440]   for this entire show.
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.160]   I have an iPad with what is--
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.760]   this is called the Bridge Keyboard.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.680]   It's an add-on Bluetooth keyboard.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.120]   And the way it works, it's very good.
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:02.520]   It turns this into a full-on laptop style,
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.800]   and I can just lift the iPad out when I don't want it
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.960]   to be a laptop anymore.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:06.640]   I like it.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.560]   Except when you don't have a bezel on that,
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.520]   it's going to get tricky.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:13.080]   So the way this thing works, it's in these clips.
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:16.360]   And the clips are against the bezel.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.160]   And if the whole thing's a screen,
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.800]   the whole thing falls apart.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.960]   And now I don't even know how they're going to do it.
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.880]   I hope that there will be some way for them
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.520]   to make a keyboard like this for the next one,
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.080]   because it's just there you go.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.280]   The clips are touching the bezel.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.840]   That's how it works.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.400]   So I need a little bit of bezel there.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.600]   Plus, for yes, when I'm resting my thumb,
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.840]   you need a designated thumb resting area, I think.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:39.880]   I hope you'll forgive the joke, Jason,
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.240]   but that is the ultimate edge case, right?
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.040]   It is.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.440]   Well, yeah, my point is the bezels,
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.520]   you never know when you're going to need a bezel
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:49.520]   for your thumb or some weird add-on or whatever.
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.040]   But at the same time, I fully support
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.400]   pushing bezels further to the edges.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:01.400]   I do wonder if this is an extreme style change
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.200]   that might get backed off at some point,
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:04.520]   because there are going to be--
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.440]   Apple, when they narrowed the bezels on the iPad,
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.040]   had to write new software for their touch detection
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.480]   to ignore certain kinds of touches.
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:15.760]   And quite frankly, I can tell sometimes
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.360]   that I am mistouching the corner of the iPad,
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.360]   because my thumb is just a little bit over off
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.200]   onto the touch screen.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.000]   So maybe this could be solved technically
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.680]   so that Andy can rest his thumb wherever the heck he wants.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.720]   But it is an added complication.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.040]   Yeah, I just--
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:36.840]   I don't want people to start thinking that bezels are--
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.320]   if something has a bezel, then somebody screwed up,
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:42.880]   or somebody's not trying, or the worst phrase to find
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:45.240]   in any particular happens.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.360]   It happens to happen most often on an Apple blog.
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:51.520]   But you see, it just shows you these diseases,
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.920]   companies, they just don't get it.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.760]   Like, oh god.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.240]   I thought you were going to say if you see a bezel,
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.040]   they blew it.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:58.320]   That would be an interesting one.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:58.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:46:59.760]   That's also true.
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:02.640]   But I was having a conversation with somebody who was saying,
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:04.280]   well, see, in fairness, you know, if it--
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:06.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:10.960]   Someone was saying that, well, once again,
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:13.280]   because I will never stop complaining about phones
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:17.200]   and other certain devices that don't have jacks--
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:18.560]   actual headphones jacks on them.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.520]   Because I still think that's a bad--
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:25.560]   I still feel as though that is a--
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:28.800]   designing a headphone jack inside your device
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.040]   is something that the engineers don't want to do.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.480]   And so they'll much rather inconvenience the users
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.640]   rather than themselves.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.440]   But one of the problems that bezel-less devices
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:39.600]   causes that, as this person was saying to me,
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.240]   well, if they had--
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:45.240]   because they had to move display drivers places,
[01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:46.480]   if they put a headphone jack in,
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:48.880]   now you couldn't have a bezel-less screen.
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.000]   And I'm like, oh god.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000]   I don't want to live in a world that I can actually
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.240]   plug in headphones that I don't have to be stuck
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.440]   without music or video because I don't have the right kind
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:03.480]   of headphones with me.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:07.520]   But I do have that little sliver of a bezel someplace,
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:09.320]   that little snip of black, that's
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:13.840]   like a big, violent globule of pus with teeth and eyes
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:17.400]   that's telling me not every failure I've ever had.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.560]   It's just a bezel.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:19.720]   It's OK.
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.160]   You'll live.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.280]   I feel like I want to deliver the case against bezel-less
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.280]   because there are three very small bezel people here.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.680]   OK.
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.480]   Before you go, your vote is writing on this.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.680]   Not in your district.
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:34.680]   I don't think--
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:37.880]   Do you live in my district, do you?
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.680]   I'm saying conceptual.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.680]   I'm not your district.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:41.200]   OK.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.480]   I would if I could.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:43.000]   OK.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.800]   Because I'm like, what is your position?
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:45.320]   I think the mind.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:47.160]   What is your campaign's position on bezel?
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.160]   Position on bezel.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.880]   And many other things might be more relevant than my one
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:51.800]   on bezel.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:52.560]   But I would say this.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.960]   Have you picked up an iPhone 6+ or 7+ or 8+ lately?
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.200]   Because if you do, it's really--
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:04.760]   for me, it's like you get your iPhone 10, right?
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:05.880]   And you're holding it.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:10.680]   And something I love is I don't have the pain in my pinky finger
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:12.480]   that I used to have with the other because it's
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.680]   like resting this giant rectangle on it.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.720]   It's like for something like an iPhone,
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:20.600]   we are carrying it around all the time.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:22.960]   Every millimeter matters.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.920]   We're all happy when Apple gets it,
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.720]   like a few millimeters thinner.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.040]   So I think on the iPhone, we know how they did this.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.000]   It's not a mystery.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.640]   They developed the iPad and they made the bezel thinner.
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:37.560]   And along the way, Apple developed some anti-edge touching
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.880]   technology that they brought to their entire line of phones.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.520]   By that, they were able to use that space more efficiently.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.400]   For me, as a software engineer, I
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:48.760]   can't tell you how many times I've been looking at code.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:50.080]   And it's like 30 lines.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:52.120]   And you challenge yourself and go, well,
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.840]   can I get down to 28 lines?
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:55.880]   Can I think of another way to write this?
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.440]   Can I do it?
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:00.640]   So if I run data through this, it will do it more efficiently.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.320]   I love more efficient designs.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.920]   And I don't think bezels are always a waste.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:11.920]   But I think in your living room, that's certainly a waste of--
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.840]   it's like a waste of your living room.
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.040]   I think on a mobile device, it's really a waste of that.
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.600]   So is this like a blanket statement
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.040]   that you should never have bezels?
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.240]   Of course not.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:25.400]   But I do think, generally speaking,
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.240]   that trend is a positive thing for our industry.
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:29.680]   I would agree with that.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.720]   I think there's extremism in bezels.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.640]   I cannot believe that's a phrase I just said, where--
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:38.120]   I think some of it is a good striving to be--
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.760]   I'm sorry, I'm touching my bezels on my iPad as I talk.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.280]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:42.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:44.000]   That's the thumbs.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.200]   Look, it just rests right there.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.160]   Your bezels, they know we're talking about it,
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:48.920]   and it's worried.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.800]   That's why you should be caressing it and reassuring it.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:52.360]   It's OK.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.600]   It's OK.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.960]   So my point is, I think some of this may come out
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:56.960]   as being fashion.
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.000]   And people are like, you know what?
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.440]   A little bit of a frame around something.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.320]   It's OK.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:03.040]   But there are also places where bezels could get smaller,
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.640]   because they're probably too big.
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:06.720]   And I agree with that too.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:07.760]   That's-- look at me.
[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:09.280]   Everybody's a little bit right.
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.560]   And isn't that the best way to end this edition of "Twit?"
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.040]   I think maybe it is.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.880]   I want to thank my wonderful guests for being here.
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:20.760]   Ben Brock Johnson, thank you so much for being here.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.200]   Thank you very much for having me.
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.600]   It was great readin' with you.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.640]   Where can people find the stuff that you do?
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.120]   What's the best place?
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.480]   Yeah, so I make a podcast about Reddit.
[01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:30.800]   It's called Endless Thread.
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.600]   And you can find it at wbur.org/enlessthread.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.680]   We are also on Reddit as Endless_Thread.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:42.080]   And I am on Twitter as the Brock Johnson in my tribute
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:44.480]   to the next president of the United States,
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.720]   Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.240]   All right.
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:51.680]   And speaking of public radio in Boston, Andy and Nodko,
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:54.760]   where can people find the stuff that you do?
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:58.600]   I'm on WGBH every couple of weeks talking for half hour
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:51:59.240]   about technology.
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:01.640]   My next appearances, I think, are on for a ride A.
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:04.040]   I think at 11.30, I think we're actually
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.120]   at the Boston Public Library.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:07.280]   So if you want to watch--
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.280]   It's a great space.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.600]   You can have a sandwich and watch the radio live.
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:12.560]   It's beautiful.
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:18.160]   And I also do the Mac break weekly every week here on Tuesdays.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:22.080]   I do the material podcast for the Mighty Relay.fm.
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.800]   And you can find most of the stuff that I write
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.000]   or links to it on my Twitter feed and my Instagram feed.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.960]   Both are Nodko, the price of admission
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:30.760]   is you have to spell my last name.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:31.160]   That's right.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:33.880]   Just don't speak it backwards or get sat back into my--
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:34.640]   Focus.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:35.520]   And you can do it right.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.960]   Brianna Wu, Tuesday is Election Day.
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:40.640]   Where can people find you and the stuff that you do?
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:44.000]   So the reason I decided to come on Twitter this week,
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.280]   when we're in the middle of the GIA, get out the vote effort
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:51.400]   here in district days, because every time I come on,
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:55.600]   you're all so amazingly generous with your campaign donations.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:58.480]   Even as I'm sitting here, I watch people from the chat room
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:52:59.840]   donating to my campaign.
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:04.560]   So if you want to support real technological competence
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.440]   in Congress, which is a low bar--
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.280]   We need a lot of it.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.240]   --but it's--
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.200]   Well, we are here.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.680]   --you're going to be people in the house
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:12.280]   to know what we're doing.
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:14.080]   That is what I'm running for.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.480]   I would be honored to have your support.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:20.920]   And you can do that by going to supportbrianna.com.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:24.720]   And when I lose this time, I'm going to run again in 2020.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:26.080]   I'm in this field for good.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:30.160]   We need people to understand technology in Washington, DC.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:33.920]   I also do a podcast with the illustrious and awesome
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.840]   Christina Warren, who will have often appears here on Twitch.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:39.120]   And you can find that at Relay FM as well.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:39.480]   All right.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:41.960]   And yes, amen to all of that.
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.000]   You can find my stuff.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.760]   I do tech podcasts at Relay FM, including upgrade and download
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.360]   and other shows that have directions in them, probably.
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.200]   And you can find my pop culture podcast at the incomparable.com
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:55.840]   and my writing about technology at sixcolors.com.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:59.320]   Thank you so much to Leo and everybody here at Twitch
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.240]   for having me host The Big Show this week.
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.320]   It's an honor.
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:05.240]   And with that, I think it's all done.
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:07.880]   This episode of "Twit" is in the can.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:09.600]   And the can is bobbing into Mediterranean.
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:10.840]   We'll see you next week.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:13.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:14.600]   Do on the Twitter.
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:15.600]   All right.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.480]   Do on the Twitter, baby.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.280]   Do on the Twitter.
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:19.280]   All right.
