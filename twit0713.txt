[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.400]   Welcome back to Twit this week in tech. I am NOT Leo LePorte. Leo is on vacation. I
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.000]   should say on assignment. That's how they're supposed to do it professional like Leo is
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.800]   on assignment in Hawaii. Probably going to beach somewhere. But I am here to squire you
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.440]   through this week in Technologies Beggist stories and I have a wonderful group of people
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.840]   here with me to my left in person here at the Twit Studios. Is my old counterpart when
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.480]   I was Mr. Macworld? He was Mr. PCworld from Fast Company. It's Harry McCracken. Hi Harry.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.680]   Hey Jason. Thank you so much for joining me on my fill in episode of Twit. Also have
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.520]   somebody I've known for. I'm not going to. It's a very large number of years. My friend
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.960]   from all the way back in Macuser magazine which has not been published for more than
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.040]   20 years. It's Andy and not co. Hello Andy. Hello as I every time you bring that up I
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.560]   have to tell people we've known each other for so long that Jason is the person who
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.160]   taught me how to boldface text in HTML. That's right back when we did HTML in like text editors
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.960]   because there were no tools for HTML. Because we nobody knew what the web was. And somebody
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.400]   I've not known for too long. Although I have had her on many podcasts over the last few
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.960]   years. She is so smart at technology stuff from creative strategies. It's Carolina
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.520]   Melanesi. Hello. Hi there. Hi. We do a video podcast show. Thank you. I know I need to remember
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.360]   that the camera is on so I don't embarrass myself too much. We're watching. We're always watching.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.640]   The that was a little too creepy. But we'll get to our scary security stories at the end of the show.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.160]   Want to start talking about services and Apple just because it's sort of been one of the stories
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.040]   of the last couple of weeks. Apple's spent a couple of years telling everybody in Wall Street at
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.840]   least that services are very important to the future growth of Apple. We've gotten some details
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.120]   obviously at their media event a couple of weeks ago. And you know some interesting stuff going on
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.600]   in terms of the story behind the story about Apple's news plus service. They have made some
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.920]   deals with the Wall Street Journal, the LA Times and of course a bunch of magazines. And there was a
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.320]   piece in the New York Times this week about the behind the scenes a little bit media companies
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:01.080]   taking a big gamble on Apple. Apple obviously put the hard press on the Times and Washington Post
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.560]   didn't work out. But a lot of magazines are concerned about their business model as Harry
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.040]   and I and Andy as magazine veterans can attest. What is a magazine you might ask. And I thought
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.120]   this is I think it's really interesting to see Apple's pitch to these other media companies and
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.800]   the ones who say yes and the ones who say no and the ones who are like well this sounds like a bad
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.040]   idea but Apple's so big and they have so much money maybe we should just see what happens.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.840]   Which is not a great business model I got to say but I can kind of understand that if you're a
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.680]   magazine you might throw your lot in with Apple and hope for the best. Harry you you've been doing
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.840]   magazines you did it before I did I think. When you read these stories what do you think about
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.920]   how the magazine industry is handling this with Apple. Well it's intriguing partially because I
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.440]   have used texture for a long time. Texture being this magazine app that Apple bought as the foundation
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.200]   for the new news plus and texture for ten or fifteen dollars a month as I've heard you virtually
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.640]   every magazine you've ever heard of and competes directly with the individual apps of all those
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.680]   magazines which tend to maybe cost ten dollars a month or at least a few dollars a month on their
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.360]   own and texture was originally essentially started by a consortium of the magazine industry and was
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.400]   seen as a possible savior it was the Netflix of magazines and apparently got about a couple of
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.200]   hundred thousand paying subscribers so not nothing but also not huge numbers of people and apparently
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.600]   Apple in the couple of weeks since they announced news plus has 200,000 subscribers now they're
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.400]   getting a free trial so we don't know what that will boil down to when people start paying but
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.040]   the mere fact it's Apple makes it scary in a way that something rather similar not controlled by
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.120]   Apple did not scare the magazine industry for the last six or seven years. There might be some fear
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.760]   of success too because if this is successful then the the business model becomes everybody's just
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.880]   sort of in on Apple's platform and you're taking a percentage of a percentage of a percentage to
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.120]   get whatever your cut is. Texture was never going to have like millions and millions and millions of
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.640]   subscribers and Apple News Plus maybe at will at some point. I do start to feel though that like
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.680]   Apple News Plus is still a very magazine centric and about things a lot of what you're in magazine
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.800]   layouts and they come out once a week or once a month and I feel like that's never going to
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.640]   change the industry that much or probably destroy the industry just because when all of a sudden
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.200]   done it's a rather old school way to consume content these days and I'm not sure how compelling
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.680]   it is. I happily pay for it partially because I can look up stuff I've written on dead trees
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.240]   but but normal for normal people people I don't I don't see like magazines on an iPhone
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.080]   as being unbelievably compelling and the kind of thing that will destroy magazines as we've known
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.880]   them. Andy what do you think about this as a veteran of magazines of dead trees I have many
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.560]   words on dead trees you have many words on dead trees. Yeah well darn those trees they had a
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.480]   comment. I'm just glad we were able to get our little shivs in while we had the chance.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:15.560]   Yeah I'm just not really impressed with News Plus at all. I just think that for one thing the deal
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.200]   that Apple is offering all these publications particularly the heavy pitches that they're making
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:27.480]   to newspapers is really really weak sauce. They seem to be saying we won't hurt you if you come
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.000]   and join us and they're trying to say we will give you chicken feed and if you but that's more than
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.120]   having chicken feed is better than having absolutely nothing isn't it. Whereas every time I talk to
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.840]   somebody who is managing either a large paper or a small paper and you can define newspaper as
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.040]   any outfit that does journalism that affects one region as opposed to the New York Times or the
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.240]   Wall Street Journal they keep saying that they don't they're not terribly afraid of the future
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   because most of what they have been learning to do traditionally is to have this relationship
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.120]   with their readers and by readers they mean communities. So it's not just trying to optimize for clicks
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.760]   it's trying to figure out that wow our local political coverage is some for some reason has
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.920]   really gone up in the past year and a half we're going to basically we're going to put a lot more
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.000]   of our resources into that part of our coverage or there's we would have gotten a lot more play
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.120]   for this article a lot more reads for this article had we released it on Wednesday instead of Tuesday
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.160]   which is data that they have access to if they are just running things throughout their own sites
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:38.680]   certainly having subscriptions through their own readership to get access to premium content
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:45.240]   like you know more than 10 articles per month that's dicey but it's very much in their tradition
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.000]   that that they've been in the business they've been in for years and years and years again the
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.800]   relationship between the publication and the readers and apple is absolutely denying this
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.520]   they're making sure that I don't have a relationship with the Boston Globe I will have a relationship
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.400]   with apple and apple will will be responsible for creating a conduit between my eyeballs and
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.360]   the Boston Globe's content and if the globe wants to figure out that wow I didn't know that we had
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.120]   Andy lives like way outside of Boston I didn't know that we had such so many readers that were in
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.600]   that part of New England they are not going to figure that out because apple's going to keep that
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   stuff that stuff separate that information private and lastly just the app itself
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.480]   it really doesn't feel like a newspaper and it doesn't feel like even like a digital news app
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.440]   like google news it feels like the kindle app where I can go to this I can tap on this button
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.040]   and read this book called National Geographic magazine or read this book called the Wall Street
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.280]   Journal it just doesn't feel relevant to the way that even I a generation X or let alone
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.360]   millennials actually interact with news these days so I'm just not impressed it's pretty weak
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.120]   sauce I will point out one of the ways that organizations can gather information about the
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:10.360]   readers and apple news is to aggressively add a newsletter links to their stories and if you've
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.960]   ever read one of those wall street journal stories in news plus boy there's always a what's news
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.480]   newsletter sign up in there because they want to know who you are because they don't know
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   because you're an apple news plus subscriber and that's not you're not their customer yet but they
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.640]   want to find a way to convert you somehow and then upsell you on the on the full on journal
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.800]   carolina because what do you think about apple news plus as a service you know it doesn't make
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.040]   business sense for anybody does it who does this service make sense for isn't does it make sense
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:44.600]   for apple does it make sense for for publishers well apple is having a second go at this right
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:52.200]   they had news stand before and that wasn't a successful service I think the the beginning of
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.400]   news plus seems to suffer from a similar issue which is what and it was talking about the the
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:05.720]   fact that a lot of the content is not being optimized for digital consumption and so you have an
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:13.160]   as a sub-part experience compared to what you would get if you buy a real magazine the feel that
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.440]   harry was talking about when you're going through the glossy pages and you see the layout and it
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:25.560]   and it's very different to read a magazine the the reasons behind buying a magazine and a newspaper
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.840]   you know with the newspaper or a book you want the information the layout is somewhat
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:36.520]   less important than a magazine and it was interesting to see that they highlighted
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:44.520]   some of the magazine that work with apple in taking advantage of the digital format that is really
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:55.000]   where i think the providers will get new readers and so to the benefit is i think is expanding
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.600]   your audience and so met in making that experience appealing to millennials in gen z's that to
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:09.800]   end this point are used to consume news and read articles in a different way and or for instance
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:18.520]   for the washington um the wasterie journal um expanding away from a core audience of you know
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:26.440]   world street and and business people that are happy to pay for a full subscription so you know if
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:32.200]   you're not into that line of business but you're still interested in getting some of the news from
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:40.200]   the wasterie journal maybe you know the 999 that news plus offers you as as an alternative
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:50.280]   is more appealing to you so expanding your audience and for apple finding a new tie into the consumer
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:59.480]   i see it this way but i also get reminded by the fact that i perused all the magazines as soon as
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.400]   the app came out and last week the whole week went past and i didn't go to it once because
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:13.240]   everything stayed over and so one you know when i start having to pay for for it is ten dollars
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.280]   something that i can afford to pay if i go to it two three times a month maybe not
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:26.200]   yeah i was thinking about the um the web native training that we've all gotten to and harry you
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.600]   mentioned this the idea that if you're only dropping new content every week or every month
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:38.440]   um in an app that is kind of a glorified rss reader i wonder how relevant you can be and it
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.920]   started me thinking that maybe the long-term goal here is for apple to drag a lot of these
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:50.760]   magazines into a different place where they're more of a sort of a premium content behind a paywall
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.000]   business model than they are a monthly business model now a lot of these a lot of these magazines
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   are already posting their content on the web which conflicts with this but it just it struck me when
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.880]   sports illustrated had their baseball preview issue as part of the the first drop on news plus
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.400]   and i thought well what i really want is every time they post a baseball article to have it show
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:13.080]   it then my baseball news category but i'm not quite sure that they've thought that through if that's
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.320]   really how it's going to work and if i have to wait and i only get those articles once a week i'm not
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.080]   sure how useful it is to me it certainly is true that a lot of the publications on news plus either
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.400]   are instituting paywalls already and if they're not they're at least considering it i mean i don't
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.080]   think there's a publication that doesn't want to get more money from its readers but they like to
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.920]   get that money directly from their readers just because as Andy says they want to know who those
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.760]   people are and if you get the money directly from them it's likely to be more money i suppose apple's
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:53.080]   theory would be that um if uh news plus has a vastly larger number of readers in any single
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.120]   publication has the money might work out okay but it's yet to be seen
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:04.040]   yeah i think there was a lot of faith in that in the hope that apple will come through for them
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.160]   i'm sorry i think that was the waltzree journals point uh when they were talking to their own
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.320]   employees about why they're going with apple news plus not because they felt as though they were
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.360]   going to lose readers to news plus but because in their case they felt as though it would bring
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.440]   in a lot of people that weren't going to be coming to the product anyway right which kind of makes
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.000]   sense because it's a really expensive subscription and most of the people who buy it are buying it
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.360]   because they are in finance they are some they have some sort of business reason why they want the
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:37.720]   extra investigation and the extra analysis so if they're it's okay with them if they get whatever
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.800]   they get from apple news plus for the people who are just going to be reading the news the the tech
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:49.160]   coverage or the political coverage or what have you yeah and the um they're also one of the places
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.040]   that's gotten aggressive paywall and i think that is the other part of this story as harry said that
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:00.120]   if you've got an expensive huge subscription and then you've got hard paywall then something like apple
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:07.160]   news for apple news plus for some subset of it starts to feel good because like i can i kept seeing
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.160]   links to waltzree journal articles and being like nope i can't read this story because i don't subscribe
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.240]   and now i can search for that story in the waltzree journal and if it's within the last three days
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.120]   i can read that story because of apple news plus and that that's actually a pretty great feature
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:27.240]   that only is because the journal is so hard with their paywall so it works with the paywall i think
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.400]   i mean in theory i think there might be some value to a publication like fess company where
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   we're on news news and news plus uh we'll probably be exposed to some people who didn't already know
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:43.240]   about us if you discover fess company on news plus and like it i think there's a pretty good chance
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.400]   you will also come to our website you might subscribe to our newsletters which is great
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.960]   you might go out and buy a print magazine you might attend one of our conferences or listen to
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.640]   our podcast if our name gets in front of people who didn't know about us already that's useful
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:06.520]   and might be worth the gamble i do wonder as well how this balance between what the magazines and
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:12.760]   the papers won out of news plus and what they want out of a direct relationship with the caster
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:19.640]   is influencing how rich the user experience on news plus is going to be because right now it feels
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.160]   a little bit like uh do you remember when the ipad came out and you had some feature apps that
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:32.360]   were designed for ipads but mostly most apps were still that blow it up twice right from the iPhone
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.400]   kind of feels that way that you have some good examples of what news plus could be
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:45.560]   but the majority of the content in the app today is not being optimized and and i wonder how that
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.840]   balance is going to influence that as apple gets better with search which i've been on
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.400]   it's pretty poor so you know good luck to you and trying to go and find that article that you
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:03.560]   are looking for on on the world street journal if search gets better if more more um magazines are
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:10.840]   optimizing content i think that would be very compelling and so does that become more of a risk
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:16.600]   for the bigger um magazines and papers that already have an audience
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:23.000]   i will say that as somebody who pays for the new times in the washington post i um do not i'm very
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.760]   happy with them being in their own little app silo i think apple news plus is interesting maybe
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.880]   because it is the net netflix model it is it's providing you with at least some variety but
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.840]   that's not necessarily the same thing as having a primary um news source speaking of news by the
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.160]   way uh interesting story on recode by peter kafka about facebook and facebook's approach
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:49.240]   to news mark zuckerberg said in an interview with the ceo of axel spreinger that they're thinking
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:56.360]   about creating a section of facebook devoted to high quality news and may pay publishers that
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:03.080]   share their stuff there now this is interesting because i view this perhaps a little bit cynically
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:10.680]   as facebook realizing hey maybe the people who have the best ideas of what kind of content should
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.880]   be surfaced from news organizations are people who spend their days thinking about what content
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:21.720]   should be surfaced at news organizations as opposed to sort of letting the algorithm of your weird
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:30.120]   uncle churn up strange headlines um you know maybe say weird ants as well okay i'm an uncle i could
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.320]   be kind of weird but so they're they're weird ants too all right okay you're weird and and uncle and
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:41.240]   possibly grandpa or grandma we're just anybody some strange person you knew when kindergarten
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:47.320]   who is now believes that the earth is flat and is going to the point here is that you know i want
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.880]   to be an optimist about facebook and that is very very hard to do these days but i like the idea
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:57.960]   that mark zuckerberg may finally have have had a realization that um the way they surface news and
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.880]   facebook is not necessarily the best way to get a sense of what's going on in the world am i wrong
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:10.200]   to be at least somewhat optimistic about a statement like this oh this is not a new idea apple i'm sorry
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:17.000]   facebook a few years ago did an app called paper um which was along the lines of a flip board or an
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.120]   apple news plus and that the presentation was very beautiful and it was organized much more
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:27.880]   like a newsstand with publications and their own little silos and a lot of professional content
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:33.640]   and i loved it i mean when that existed that was my primary interface to facebook but it didn't go
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:39.400]   much of anywhere and they eventually killed it and um so like a lot of the the things that facebook
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.120]   comes up with it's it's not new in a lot of cases it's stuff they've tried before and they did not
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.320]   have the patience to stick with it well that's the challenge right is that facebook's goals here
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:55.000]   well i mean facebook's goals have always been to increase engagement that is uh that can lead
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.040]   down some very strange paths it is true that facebook's goal these days probably also was to stay
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.320]   out of trouble um and so it makes me wonder if that changes their philosophy a little bit just
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:11.800]   because of all the criticism that they've gotten carolina what is it i'm with you on the skepticism
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:19.880]   because it does seem to me like a way um to not avoid solving their own problem with news but
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:27.960]   kind of deflecting a bit and and having a different source uh reputable source is interesting that
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.120]   he also mentioned that he's willing to pay publishers for it and the customers are not going to be
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:40.840]   able to pay which raises other questions as far as am i paying another way you know is facebook
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:47.880]   now gonna know what i'm reading within that page what articles i'm reading and find out even more
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:57.000]   about me reading reputable sources of of news but it does feel a bit why now why you know to
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.320]   her is going they tried before and did it stick with it now it seems to try and take away from
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:11.960]   all the other interesting news and sources that you mentioned and and like their suggestion about
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:21.800]   having government involved to monitor and and um rectify to some extent the hay speech it seems
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:29.320]   to me they're finding other ways and putting the burden of what should be their job onto somebody else
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   yeah it's uh yeah it's for one thing anytime that that zuckerberg says he's playing on anything
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:45.240]   i mean i just don't know what i just don't think that he fundamentally understands the
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.880]   sense of responsibility that a company of the scale of facebook has i think that he really does
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:57.400]   a part of him really does think that this is harvard he can still be the the the the bad little boy who
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:03.320]   can do anything you know move fast break things without realizing that when you get to a certain
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.080]   scale when you break things you break systems and you break infrastructure and you who create big big
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.880]   problems last year uh their big announcement about news was chiefly uh a reaction to think to the
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.000]   cateburn general analytica scandal saying that guess what we're gonna deem we're not gonna have
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.120]   quite so much news in people's news feeds anymore which i thought that was an acknowledgement that
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.800]   this is getting us in trouble the way that news feeds are manipulating people either through our
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:38.760]   intention to sell more ads or through be or through uh our inattentiveness to the problems of running
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.160]   this sort of service i think they that returned up that they only they switched it from about a 5%
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:49.160]   uh content of news to 4% but okay whatever uh so i think this is them trying to dip their toe back
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:55.320]   in the water i do like the idea of a service that's making a lot of money saying that what if we were
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:02.120]   to actually pay for content that appears in people's news feeds so that we don't have to get them to
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:09.000]   sign up for some sort of a new uh ad promotion we don't have to get news providers to uh license
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.440]   to to uh set up a business an exclusive business arrangement with us just simply we will have human
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:20.280]   beings and algorithms that are looking for uh fast moving stories that require really good coverage
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.920]   and as soon as we identify that we will simply pay the washington post we will pay the boston globe
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.800]   we will pay the lowl sun or whatever this publication is to give it a larger audience
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.560]   that's really interesting but it will depend on how well they curate this stuff um if anything
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.680]   all of everything we've been seeing in the past couple of months has really made me appreciate
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:47.400]   what google news is doing where they're trying to keep an algorithmic sort of a so focused approach
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:54.040]   while at the same time realizing that they kind of screwed up by not thinking that news was quite
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.400]   as important as it actually is it's not simply uh assert something that people search for it's
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.240]   something that people search for with the intention of finding uh valid valid content if they don't
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.760]   find valid content if they find something someone who's saying that vaccinations cause diseases
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:16.200]   that has an effect on society that they will then be responsible for i really like when uh the the
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:23.320]   mule report was was uh was released and i went to news.google.com and they really had like i think
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.360]   like six different tiers from the top to the bottom the top being here here is news items
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:34.600]   related to the mule report release from trusted and verified news agencies here are videos that
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:40.360]   again have been from trusted news agencies here is a timeline of the story from from the start to
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:47.160]   the finish here are uh editorials that are specifically labeled as opinions opinions and
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.200]   analysis but still from trusted stories here's social media and then at the very very bottom
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   do you get the purely uh algorithmic here is just what some joker who has a blog spot account
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:03.240]   is saying about the mule report uh that shows exactly how much work and also maybe how much
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:10.200]   vulnerability google feels uh at being regulated back into the stone age if they don't take uh take
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.080]   uh the bull by the horns and making sure that they're not weaponizing news or allowing anybody
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.600]   else to weaponize news for them there's a purely competitive aspect of this i think which is you
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.680]   know you mentioned google news something like apple news leaving a site even the apple news
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.400]   plus apple has a team of editorial people who are picking stories to do news summaries
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.600]   it is you know i wonder if facebook realizes that even though people use facebook as a source of
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:42.120]   news if it becomes or has become already such a source that everybody thinks of it is not trustworthy
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.440]   that they there are other sources and then one aspect of controlling your digital life
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.240]   leaves facebook's control which is bad for facebook they may be too late i don't know but certainly
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.760]   something like google news something like apple news those are competitors for your time on your
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:02.760]   devices and if they give you a better news experience then um what facebook is giving then then that's
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.400]   bad for facebook at least you know facebook facebook is a casino where they got to keep you
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:13.720]   inside the casino they got to keep a gambling if you leave that place to go to a hotel room or to
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.120]   or to go to a restaurant that's time in which the you're not being observed you're not being
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:23.320]   controlled so if they can make sure that you're not tempted to leave facebook for apple news or
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:29.480]   for google news and get your news directly from facebook again that makes it that makes you within
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:36.440]   the wall garden of facebook and therefore valuable in of use to the mothership all right we have much
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.320]   more to talk about we're going to talk about five g apple may have painted itself in a corner when
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:47.400]   it comes to supporting 5g on the iphone lots of interesting stuff about wearables in your ears or
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.840]   should we call them hearables i say we should not and uh there's some more stuff google youtube we
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:28:00.280]   got more security stories to terrify you all of that is coming next but first i sense far away from
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:05.720]   from a beach somewhere that leo loport is demanding that we take a break to let you hear about one
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:11.240]   of our sponsors leo thank you uh Jason for doing twit for me i really appreciate it we'll get back
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.160]   to the show in just a second but first well as they say a word from our sponsor fresh books they
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.560]   want me to do the ads for fresh books because i use fresh books that fresh books save my life
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:27.960]   uh i love fresh books back when i was working up in toronto for call for help i had an invoice in
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:35.000]   canadian dollars plus two expenses and i would put it off and put it off fresh books was such a relief
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   fresh books starts by making an easy invoice really easy you do it all online you send it by email
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   but you also can import expenses with the fresh books app on your smartphone you just take a
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.120]   picture of the receipts goes right into the invoice or just into your books so you always know your
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:59.640]   expenses you always have a record of everything very easily uh it also has a pay me now button as
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.040]   soon as you start using fresh books you could start accepting online payments and it turns out
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:09.080]   by doing that you're going to get paid on average twice as fast clients love it
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:15.400]   fresh books is a web app so it's always getting better always getting new features they just added
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:21.160]   ach payments bank transfers you know automated clearing house ach that's a network that connects
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.520]   all the financial institutions across the united states it's fast you get paid twice as fast it's
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:32.120]   great for large invoices people don't want to write big checks on those amounts and it's inexpensive
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:38.120]   there's a 1% transaction fee but that's an example of them always adding new features to fresh books
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:47.400]   i've been using it for i started using it 2004 i think a long time ago it's just gotten better and
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:54.040]   better and better frankly fresh books essentially is doing accounting simply by creating and
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:30:01.320]   customizing invoices logging your hours of time tracking scheduling payments categorizing expenses
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.800]   they've got the books done you're ready when tax time comes and i know it's coming
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:11.720]   it's too late for this year right but next year you'll be glad you started using fresh books
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.960]   and there's lots of easy to understand reports you'll know for instance something i never knew

[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:37.400]   don't let me read the ads. Let's talk about 5G gotta talk about 5G now rolling out slowly
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:46.520]   it's an interesting thing cellular networks going up to 5G. Apple and the iPhone it's already
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:53.640]   been reported they are unlikely to release a 5G iPhone in 2019 but everybody thought well 2020
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:58.360]   that'll probably be okay that's a long way off the fall of 2020 but they might be able to make it
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   and now we've been hearing some things about apples attempts to get 5G in 2020 and as Mark Sullivan
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:10.280]   who Harry and I used to work with and who works with Harriet fast company now he reports not so fast
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:18.520]   maybe that will be a shaky plan too because Intel may or may not be able to get enough of its 5G
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:25.000]   modems to Apple for Apple to test and for Apple to put in their iPhones in the fall of 2020 remind
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   you again not this fall next fall and Apple meanwhile is also staffing up a new chip division to presumably
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.960]   build modems for for their mobile devices going forward how do we know this partially it's because
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.760]   they are hiring lots of people in San Diego basically across the street from Qualcomm
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:53.800]   suspicious so Harry this is a story that originated with fast company I think it's a really great
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.440]   story where Mark really lays down that Apple has painted itself into a corner with all of its
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:04.840]   lawsuits with Qualcomm and now having to count on Intel to provide a 5G modem yeah I mean for
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.440]   anybody else Qualcomm would be a very logical provider of this modem but the legal war between
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.880]   Qualcomm and Apple is really one of the most bitter ones I can remember I mean I think it's way worse
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.280]   on something like when Apple and Samsung were at odds with each other at the same time they're
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:27.720]   also doing business together and Intel really wants to have a modem business they are building
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.760]   these fabs to build modem chips which need to be paid for and having a nice large customer like
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:38.680]   Apple which they already do for LTE modems is appealing to them right if you have an iPhone
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:44.120]   XS or a 10R there's an Intel modem in there now but they haven't come out with a 5G modem yet
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:50.360]   and you know Mark's story says that Intel is having issues hitting these deadlines Apple is a
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:57.880]   famously difficult customer they set very demanding deadlines they're not going to give you a fast
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.480]   profit margin on the modems you're making for them if you start to blow those deadlines I don't think
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.560]   they're terribly forgiving and then Apple doesn't have a lot of options they will have an option
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:13.000]   someday presumably because they will be able to make their own modems but even if they hire twice as
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.080]   many 5G modem engineers that doesn't mean they can cut their timetable in half that pretty clearly
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:25.640]   has something for 2021 or beyond and Intel has a new CEO as well who according to Mark's story has
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:31.000]   has possibly been saying why are we bending over backwards to take care of these guys is this really
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.360]   a good business that we need to have Apple as our as our client here I don't know and it is okay in
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:44.120]   some ways just because you mentioned the CNET story by Jessica Dolkart where she went out so good
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:51.480]   and tried a 2G modem phone in Chicago and it it it ranged from really good to really terrible
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:57.240]   randomly so there's no reason for anybody to rush out and buy a 5G modem today or in six months
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:04.120]   and if Apple does get a 5G phone out a year and a half from now that does feel like it's probably
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   pretty good timing but then the networks will be out there and they'll probably work pretty well
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:15.880]   and it's classic Apple to not to have the first 5G phone but to have the 5G phone that arrives when
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:22.040]   it makes sense but 2021 would be really late that's most likely that's pretty late yeah the
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:27.800]   it's a great story on CNET by Jessica Dolkart about I think the one of the headlines was it brought
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.440]   literally brought me to tears and not necessarily the good kind and going back and forth 5G is kind
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   of not real right now but I think the question is like as Harry said by the fall of 2020 it will
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:47.800]   be maybe a lot harder to stand up on a stage and say we still can't do 5G right I think that so
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:54.440]   long as they can stay on stand on a stage and say that we will have 5G by this date because there's
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:01.160]   so many problems in getting 5G deployed this is nothing like the there's nothing like 3G and 4G
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.400]   there's nothing like LTE this really is they're gonna have all these providers are going to have
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.800]   to build out an entirely new network we're not talking about just adding new
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:15.720]   adding new cell sites or adding new software adding new gear to existing sites it's totally new
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:22.520]   it's very very short throw it's very very susceptible to you can't really bounce signals off of
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:31.080]   off of standing structures like you can with LTE the difference in speed is it's going to be a
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:38.200]   while until services and mobile devices are spry enough to make you appreciate those extra that
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:44.520]   extra speed the and the other thing is that it's not just getting these modem chips to work it's
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:50.120]   also getting antenna systems on mobile devices to work because again this not this has been a
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:56.360]   solved problem for 3G and 4G LTE networks remember how much trouble Apple got in when they tried to
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.480]   do a clever antenna design and they realized that really wasn't that easy of five or six years ago
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.480]   when they were when they were creating the new the new iPhone the antenna gate you're holding it
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.480]   wrong sort of thing well with every single manufacturer is probably going to go through
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.040]   their own version of antenna gate for the next couple of next year or two trying to figure out
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.720]   how do you get these 5G antennas to always find a signal when a signal is present
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:26.680]   whilst also having antennas that are going to be compatible with 4G and LTE so I think that a lot
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:33.640]   of these companies have a lot of time before it starts to look embarrassing Apple certainly has
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:40.680]   the ability to simply say well if you if you're unhappy with your super fast LTE speed and you are
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.440]   upset with us because the 5G network which probably isn't available in your area yet and won't be for
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.880]   another year and doesn't actually deliver the sort of features that you're hoping to get from 5G
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:58.840]   if that's enough for you to leave all of your iOS services and apps to go to Android good luck
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.080]   with that so Apple certainly is not really on the hook there but the whole point of this
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:09.480]   of this article is really important where you have Intel which isn't as doesn't have the capability
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:15.560]   yet to create modem chips as well as Qualcomm can create modem modem chips and meanwhile
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:23.480]   there is a certain amount of 2P 2 middle-aged people across the table from each other with squinty eyes
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:28.920]   Apple and Qualcomm say I'll I'd rather set our company on fire than buy our chips from you
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:34.360]   yeah well I'd rather shoot myself in the head right here and now than sell you chips it really
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.760]   is getting nasty and personal between these two companies so for those of us who aren't invested
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.920]   in either of these two companies it's going to be fun to watch
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:52.520]   it really depends on yeah it really depends how late Intel really is right because the timeline
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:39:01.000]   was supposed to be first half of 2020 which usually when you say first half in tech means June
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:09.000]   never means January right and that would have already put some pressure for Apple to do a
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.680]   September launch which is what we've been accustomed to for the iPhone if Intel is only say a couple
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:24.920]   of months late you couldn't envision a scenario whereby Apple does the usual September launch
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:33.240]   without a 5G and so without a flagship iPhone because I very much doubt that Apple will come in and put
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:39.800]   5G on all the phones right so you're going to have a flagship product with 5G and the rest
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:51.080]   will not so they could stagger that launch as long as the 5G can happen in Q1 of 2021 now if Intel
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:59.000]   is very late you are looking at fervor into 2021 I agree with both Andy and Harry that of course
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:07.480]   there's there's still a lot of TV issues with deployment and even when things are going to go
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:13.880]   well it's not going to be everywhere right so depending where you are located you might be
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:21.960]   interested or not but we also have to think that with phones we have seen a longer replacement cycle
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:30.040]   which means that if I'm investing in something in 2020 I do think ahead and I do want to be ready
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:37.240]   for when 5G will come to wherever I live or when you know the connectivity gets better and that's
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:44.920]   the part that I think that Apple is needs to think about is you know one it will it differ
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:54.360]   upgrades and so will people wait till they have 5G and or will people be concerned about the
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:41:02.280]   lack of 5G and decide not to wait and go somewhere else I also agree with Andy that it's not
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.200]   actually it's not been for quite some time that you don't just think of the phone in isolation
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:16.280]   you know if you're an iPhone user and you are deep into the ecosystem moving to Android has
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:23.400]   other ramifications not just I'm moving with my phone but is you know what else what other devices
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.720]   do I have what services I am bringing and so you know going back to what we were discussing before
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:37.480]   about News Plus but also TV and and the credit card that Apple is is bringing in all this year
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:44.600]   all those things will tie consumers into the Apple ecosystem even more so you know well they
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:51.080]   have to just suck it up and wait maybe I keep thinking of summer of 2020 and follow me here
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.920]   there's an ad from Samsung in the summer of 2020 I mean they could do it now but they definitely
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:03.800]   let's give them a year that is here is how fast the Samsung 5G phone is and here is how slow
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.920]   the flagship iPhone is and this is why you should buy a Samsung I think the the marketing will be
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.640]   out there because if you've got an advantage why not press it I think the real question is will
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.480]   consumers really care about 5G will the marketing make them care about something that may not really
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:25.000]   have an impact on them because I am very skeptical of whether 5G is as a technology is really going
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.320]   to make a difference for most consumers it is going to make differences in like other categories for
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:36.120]   other kinds of devices we've seen demos with like hospitals and all of that but you've got to be
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:43.080]   in a 5G area those 5G areas maybe spotty and do you really need are there applications that you
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.360]   will really you know stretch your bandwidth to the point where you need 5G instead of 4G I'm
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:54.680]   skeptical of that but it may not matter if consumers think they need it and think they can't get it
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.840]   from Apple I think that's Apple's weakness in the short term it's going to be great for things
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.320]   like cars yeah cars are going to be able to suck up a lot more data which they will need if they're
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.680]   going to be driving themselves and on phones it might be kind of a nice to have rather than
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:15.000]   something transformative yeah also we talk about Intel I just want to point out Andy's got this
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.640]   argument of the two men across the table for each other like all right I'm never ever ever
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.720]   going to make a deal with you then Apple turns around and there's another table with Intel and
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.840]   Apple says I really need those modems but in two years I won't use you as a supplier anymore
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.920]   right because everybody knows that Apple is not going to use Intel as a modem supplier in the
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:39.080]   long run they're going to make their own so yeah I also a question of whether Intel is actually
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.880]   interested in keeping that business going or not not just because Apple my or my not be a
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:51.000]   difficult customer but because you know they have a new CEO and I think that Bob Swan has questioned
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:59.640]   whether being in the modem business period is a good thing for Intel okay I think Carolina made a
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:05.400]   great point a little while ago in which people are holding on to their phones longer for more and
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.520]   more years than they used to but five or ten years ago where I think the cycle of hey I've
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.840]   this phone that I have is working perfectly fine but it's two years old now I'd much rather have
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.480]   the new phone now people are holding on for three four or five years sometimes so if someone has
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:25.240]   dropped their phone or if someone really wants whatever that really cool new triple face ID feature
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:31.000]   is they don't really care about 5G but maybe in three years time during the lifespan of that phone
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.920]   when 5G is actually a practical thing they don't want to have to buy a brand new phone again simply
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:43.400]   because the phone that they bought in 2019 or 2020 is not 5G compatible so I wonder if Apple could do
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:51.960]   something would be even so bold as have a on their really really high-end phone have a 5G chip and a
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:59.640]   5G antenna that was LTE LTE down compatible but leave that switched off so that they will say oh
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.440]   it's you've got the hardware you will it'll just be a firmware upgrade when we're ready to enable it
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.400]   we want to make sure that our 5G implementation doesn't jump the gun unlike the Samsung phone which
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:16.600]   is causing birds and small creatures within an 80 feet radius to convulse and die because
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:21.080]   they didn't they didn't do their radios correctly but at some you will not have to buy a brand new
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:26.120]   phone to get 5G it's just not going to be switched on until we switch on 5G servers for the entire
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:31.960]   Apple ecosystem it's it's an interesting thing to think about all right let's shift gears a little
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.920]   bit I want to talk about something that is again Apple related I swear we're almost done with my
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.640]   Apple queue here but it's you know I'm going to talk about Apple a little bit but Amazon relates
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:47.560]   to this too and it's about wearables and especially growth in the wireless headphones market really
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.400]   there was a study that referred to it as the Herables market I think that is a terrible name
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.320]   do not call them Herables they're just things that you stick in your ears they're wearables and you
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.960]   wear them in your ears so Apple released the AirPods 2 and they announced this week through their
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:05.160]   Beats sub brand that they're going to do a power Beats Pro which is a different set of again little
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:12.040]   earbuds that you stick in your ears those are more sporty and then there is Amazon which Bloomberg
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:20.360]   reports is making a rival to AirPods as the first wearable also I want to throw out there for
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:27.160]   discussion a fantastic story by Brian Chen in the New York Times called you know basically AirPods
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:33.160]   are great but they also don't last which is true as we found out about two years in to having AirPods
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:38.360]   everybody's AirPod batteries are dying because look at them they're so small the batteries inside
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:43.400]   there are incredibly small and batteries wear out I love my AirPods but there's no denying that
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:50.840]   after a couple of years they are on their last legs so pros and cons of the oh Herables market
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:55.560]   you know I think it's really interesting that Amazon's getting into this space I think Apple
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.440]   obviously thinks there's a huge opportunity here so therefore the Beats as well as the AirPods
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:04.040]   themselves Carolina you know what does this market look like to you is this a
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:10.600]   market ripe for explosion in terms of growth with is that why Amazon is coming in here
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:20.120]   I think it's a market that is very strictly linked to the rise of the the assistance right and so
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:27.640]   this digital assistance that is supposed to whisper in your ear useful stuff to you as you go by your
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:33.080]   day and not just about listening to music we'll be listening to music for longer than I can't
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:40.200]   remember on the phone and you've used different type of headsets for that or getting your call
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:46.280]   but the fact that you have now always something in your ear and that's why some people are starting
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:51.960]   calling you more the earable market because you have that sense of a wearable device that is no
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:58.760]   longer a accessory but it is a device that you think a lot of when you're purchasing because you
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:03.960]   always have it with you you wear it all day it does different things for you and for Amazon I think
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:12.840]   is a way to take out of the home and hopefully in a creating more of a relationship with the user
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:20.040]   you know the experience on the phone through the it's not great and you know there's so many
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:26.520]   different steps that you have to take and as I speak I can see all sorts of lights going on
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:35.960]   because I forgot to mute it but the you know the idea that now you have or in your ear and you
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:41.880]   can have more of a direct relationship is very important to them and so I think is for every vendor
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:48.120]   including Google you know they tried before with the Pixel Buds and they've not been particularly
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:55.000]   successful so hopefully the second generation will be better but we all get in there and it's part of
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.600]   what ambient computing will be you know where you're gonna have other devices out of your phone
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:09.960]   that will have data and will be connected and so having earables having buds that you have with you
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:16.200]   linked to those devices is gonna be more and more important. If we're cited in the dictionary
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.360]   defining when hearables became a thing I'm gonna be very upset with all of us.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:27.080]   I think I think Christina the H is unnecessary I think she found the problem there it's
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:34.680]   earables no. Earables earables. So yeah Harry thoughts about that I mean I love my earpods I
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:39.960]   think there's something there there right. Oh I mean totally although I love my earpods but I never
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:45.720]   use Siri on them I mean as of right now they're just saying really nice wireless headphones but I
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:51.080]   think there clearly is a future for these devices becoming smarter and starting to become little
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:57.160]   computing devices and Apple is already well positioned for that future because a very high
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:02.360]   percentage of iPhone users either have earpods or would like to have earpods it's a little bit
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:09.320]   tougher for Amazon simply because they do not control a phone platform the fire phone having
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:15.000]   gone not nowhere and Apple has the advantages of being able to do an extra level of integration
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.240]   with an iPhone that certainly helps with making the connection smooth and Amazon will have to rely
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:27.000]   whatever can do over playing vanilla, Bluetooth. I think Amazon also on the other hand does have
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.280]   the potential to do something that's a lot cheaper than the earpods. Amazon is completely
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:38.280]   happy to sell you something and make little or no money or maybe even lose a little money to get
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:43.400]   it out there in a way that Apple generally speaking does not want to do and if Amazon had
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:48.920]   something well done at like $99 sounds like a pretty cool product and certainly a good way to
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:57.640]   get more people using on devices other than speakers. Amazon products are always kind of
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.680]   their own separate thing because we forget that Amazon when they get into a market they have had
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:09.400]   the opportunity for the past five years to watch other people shop for this exact same product
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.760]   so if they're getting into it it might not just be an idea that they want to
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:19.160]   expand the reach of their Alleosa personal assistant. I don't want everyone to activate their
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:27.000]   devices so I always call it Alleosa but they realize that here's there's a lot of money to be made
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.800]   in these totally cordless Bluetooth headphones let's make our own and it would be nice if we
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:37.960]   could also use it to kind of make our voice assistant a little bit more present in people's lives but
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:44.520]   that's the they don't have the sort of reach that Google or Apple has right now but I really do think
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:53.640]   that earables is there's just no other way to say like we're gonna we're gonna call it the iWatch
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   because it's just a better name okay I'm sorry the it's I think that that's a very very
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:06.840]   fruitful sort of avenue for personal assistants to go into we always envision the idea of aware of
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:14.280]   a augmented reality device that is visual in nature but how do you find a way to get people to put
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:20.680]   something on their faces that can actually deliver that kind that kind of information in a handy way
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.920]   without making it look like a total dork just the problem of if you can put this into a pair of
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:30.520]   regular glasses well that's fine for people like us who actually wear glasses all day long but
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:35.640]   what about people who don't but when you have the idea of you can have an earpiece in your in just
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:41.400]   just one ear and you can have an assistant that will simply as as the day goes by give you reminders
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:48.040]   or listen to cues for you to give it give you some information or take notes then that in itself
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:54.680]   is really really super useful now imagine a scenario like like remember the movie with the
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:53:02.520]   Joaquin Phoenix her her yeah a few years ago so it's about a very very like a next a next generation
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:08.440]   sort of personal system so so that the personal system can see like your environment walking
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:13.160]   Phoenix like puts a safety pin in his chest pocket so that when he puts a phone in his pocket the
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.680]   camera is sort of peeking up over the over the margin so imagine something like that where you
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:24.600]   can wear your phone like either in a pouch around your neck or even have like a google clips type
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:30.520]   little clip on camera somewhere just to give your personal assistant eyes on the world around you
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:35.160]   and imagine you're navigating through and someone says hey Andy it's free to see you again and your
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:40.440]   personal assistant says that's Jason Snell you've known him since about 1990
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:49.000]   ah Jason how are you Snell and your wife and your two kids it's great to see you um
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:58.440]   Andy yes Andy's friend and no one needs to know and that article i owe you is already in the
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:04.760]   drop-off but that but it's a way to put that sort of stuff in a way that is doesn't distract
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:10.600]   you from your interactions with human beings but still gives you information like that that red
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.680]   that well red building if you turn to your left is the building where you're having your meeting
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:20.440]   in 10 minutes that's the sort of stuff that is super super exciting and it's not an impossible
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:25.400]   thing for anybody to pull off we have the at least the materials technology to make it happen so if
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:30.120]   amazon's not going to get there with it but it does show how important is that apple still works
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:36.120]   on this and google still works on this and yeah i agree with you that we're not very far off and
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:42.760]   yet it feels still years and years and years away right to the point that harry was saying it
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:48.120]   doesn't use serie it's not because of air pods that you don't use serie it's because of serie
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:56.280]   that you don't use serie and you know and that's a reality and and i think if you look at the ability
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:03.640]   of you know putting together what you know about me and being on me and being linked to a camera
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:10.760]   out there's so much more that you could do even just today that is not being done because it's not
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:17.640]   easy and and i think you know we'll talk about scary things later on in the in the program but
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:24.920]   a lot of it is linked to privacy and and people that you have around you that might not
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:31.560]   actually be signed up to see what you see and hear what you hear and be involved in what you are
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:40.120]   recording and happy to share with your assistant and i think that moving from the home to
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:47.880]   the world is going to be a big challenge for for amazon because things are different there's so
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:55.400]   many variables in the real world that makes it harder for any assistant to be useful because
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.800]   there's so much more of a minute to take into account but one fascinating thing for me when
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:05.880]   specifically we're talking about air pods is to see and maybe this is a clue to how important this
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:17.160]   segment in the market will be is to see how similar to the i pod this product doesn't seem to have
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:28.760]   a barrier of age gender income you see people wearing air pods that come from all sorts of
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:35.240]   you know walk of life and and and i think that that's fascinating because they are not you know
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:41.640]   they're they're expensive yeah it is it has been one of apple's most successful products of the
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:46.760]   last few years and i think rightly so i love this product category too i think it's great i think
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:53.720]   um i feel like our software our virtual assistants are really letting the hardware down um so so
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:58.840]   i guess it's time for the software to catch up because um i really love the hardware but the
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:04.600]   software i don't even bother talking to it like harry because i don't like what it has to say
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:09.160]   uh we have much more coming up on twit we're going to talk about google and youtube and scary things
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:15.320]   from security as has been foretold it's like i'm uh in a halloween episode spooky security stories
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:21.480]   are coming but first leo is going to be here to tell you about our next sponsor we'll have more
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:26.840]   with Jason Snell and friends on this weekend tech sorry i can't be here i'm in hoeye but i had to
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:36.040]   i had to do this ad because i am such a massive fan of last pass and i think you know this i talked
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.680]   i've been talking it up for 10 years since i you know they started and i started using them then i
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:45.800]   had used other password managers there's nothing better than last pass and in fact my my you know
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:52.040]   faith in last pass was justified not too long ago when steve gipson interviewed joe seagress the
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:57.560]   creator joe shared the source code explained exactly what they're doing and steve said this is it this
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:01.880]   is the right way to do a password manager it's gotten better and better ever since
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:07.880]   steve gipson uses it i use it your business should use it we've been using last pass enterprise
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:11.080]   it twit for a long time ever since one of our employees
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:17.320]   i laugh now i was painful at the time put all his passwords in a public website because he
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.920]   couldn't remember him it's like oh we need last pass i'd been using it so it was like of course
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:28.600]   and wrestle agrees by the way uh wrestle our it guy was quick to set it up he manages it he likes it
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:34.600]   because he as the uh it guy because he gets over a hundred policies that he can enforce to make sure
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:40.520]   that our business passwords are super secure for instance we require two-factor authentication
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:45.080]   the employees have to use it whether they like it or not uh we have minimum requirements for
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:50.680]   their password it's got to be good password resets too because they keep forgetting things like that
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:57.720]   it is the best way to manage your passwords in a business effect you can even make it that the
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:03.160]   for instance uh the people have to log in to our bank accounts don't actually get the bank account
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.480]   password they just get they open last pass click the link to the bank it opens up for them
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:12.520]   after it sends a authenticator message they say approved an eye on that last pass
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:16.280]   authenticator they say approve and then it logs in for them they never see the password which is
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.400]   good because research shows that most employees more than half share passwords and not just with
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:25.000]   other employees but with other people outside the company you don't want that
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   you really don't want that last pass is true trust no one
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   encrypted end-to-end that means it's only decrypted on the device and every device is supported
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:43.320]   Windows Mac iOS Android I use it on Linux to every browser chrome firefox safari
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:51.400]   opera you have plugins automatic fill-in on iOS and android means it's the first in app I install
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:56.920]   when I get a new phone because it makes setting up the rest of the apps to snap I just the
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:02.280]   automatically fills in the passwords I log in it's great for families too by the way we use
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:08.040]   last pass families at home because uh you can share passwords for things like medical accounts
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:14.280]   credit cards entertainment Lisa always needs like the Comcast login so I share that with her
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:18.920]   automatically and if I updated it gets updated automatically it's really a great way to do it
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.120]   it also has a feature I really appreciate called emergency access I know we don't want to talk
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:30.840]   about that but if I should become disabled or die she gets access to the last pass after some
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:37.080]   checks you know and that's really important you don't want to just leave your family holding the
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:43.160]   bag they can't get in your accounts or anything last pass is got it all figured out and I just
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.840]   sent an eight when I get a new account I sent an invitation Lisa she gets the account shared
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.160]   with her couldn't be better that's last pass families if you have a small business last pass
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:57.320]   teams is fantastic teams are 50 or fewer individuals use last pass premium that's what I used for
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:03.000]   years until I got married then we used families and then for the business we use last pass enterprise
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.960]   there's a last pass that's right for you join the 13 and a half million people who use last pass
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:17.480]   it's the number one most preferred password manager it's the one I use and if you do nothing else today
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:23.240]   secure your stuff and by the way when is it they say in the airplane put your mask on your face
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:30.840]   before you help others get last pass but then help others tell friends family business partners
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:39.720]   gotta have last pass it just solves it last pass dot com slash twit last pass dot com slash
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:44.920]   twit you can tell him that URL to that's a way of supporting our network just as last pass does

[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.960]   don't believe him he's not actually here he's far far away but we're here to talk about something
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.640]   that it made me laugh it's also sad because I've used some of these products
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:13.880]   piece by Ron Amadeo at ours Technica called Google Google's constant product showdowns are
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:19.000]   damaging its brand and this this made me laugh we are 91 days into the year and so far Google is
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.120]   racking up an unprecedented body count if we just take the official shutdown dates that have already
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:31.640]   occurred in 2019 a Google branded product feature or service has died on average every nine days
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.960]   such things as Chromecast audio YouTube annotations Google fiber android things
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:44.680]   Google's laptop and tablet division Google aloe spotlight stories the goog.gl URL shortener
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:50.840]   let's see what else Google inbox Google Hangouts classic Google music's migration to YouTube music
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.280]   um you know Google likes to try lots of things and some of them work and some of them don't and they
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:01.240]   rethink some of them but I have to say this story resonated with me a little bit as somebody who
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:07.160]   has used lots of Google services over the years and sometimes they stick around Google voice still
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:12.600]   works although they don't talk about it anymore that's a bad sign uh Andy you talk about Google a
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:19.560]   lot you have a podcast about android I wanted to come to you first for this one um you know it
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:25.640]   should we get mad about Google sun setting to use a california-ism uh so many products or is this
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   just the nature of the beast well you know they they only implode the building when everybody has
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:37.000]   left and hasn't come back for two or three years so that's kind of okay but the the problem is when
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   you have a problem a product like uh like Google wave which I which was innovative it was boy it
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.440]   could have really been it was such a paradigm shift in how you communicate with people that they could
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:57.720]   it could have been slack before slack existed uh and they lost faith in it and they killed it before
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.960]   it had it before people outside of Google had a chance to figure out how to uh find the awesome
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:11.720]   in this new service however a lot of the stuff that was in Google wave uh made it into other products
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:16.360]   like the idea of you can have an agent that lives inside this uh inside this chat window that is
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.920]   automatically doing simultaneous translation between you and somebody else the idea that you can have
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:27.640]   that location can be totally irrelevant that it will find you wherever you've asked to be found
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.880]   and make sure that the messages are routed to you correctly but it really does mean that you
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.680]   never have that sort of savory for so many of these uh these products that are just being launched
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:42.600]   it's it's hard to develop that sort of savory experience where uh you will acknowledge that
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:48.120]   maybe a service is not 100% the best thing ever but gosh I've been using it for so long I really
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.520]   really love it and all my friends use it and we've developed it's been a long around long enough
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:58.120]   that we've developed our entire workflow around this tool that they almost never kind of let things
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:04.600]   savor simmer in the pot long enough for that to happen uh but it really does it does point to kind
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.920]   of the limitations of having a company that gives away stuff for free because there's always that
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.640]   attitude that if we're giving this away for free we don't really have a contract with our users we
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:20.840]   can always pull this at any time whereas uh if any other company were to dis if apple were to decide
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.200]   to just get rid of FaceTime they would have they would do the walk of shame and they would be
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.400]   feeling it for two or three years uh because of all the time they've put into this and the fact that
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.480]   they they've run their entire business around this and this is a point of pride for them
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:41.800]   it must be hard to be part of a product engineering group inside google knowing that you can put your
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:46.600]   life and soul into this wonderful piece of technology that you're developing and not know if it's going
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:53.480]   to be around a year after you go into public beta so it is it is it's as if it becomes a signature
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:58.440]   problem for google you don't want to be associated with somebody who just has not doesn't have the
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.080]   sort of endurance to develop something and have so much faith in it as a company that you're
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:09.480]   willing to write it out for year after year after year and let people find it yeah i'm part of the
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.640]   issue and and we're seeing some chatter in the chat room about this too is are people using this
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.880]   stuff and sometimes these are products that google launches with a lot of fanfare and then nobody
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.680]   uses them and you kill them so that that you know FaceTime people use FaceTime so they probably
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.920]   apple probably wouldn't kill it ping you know apple nobody used that and they and they did kill
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.800]   it and they did do the walk of shame but some of these products do get used i keep hearing from
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:39.320]   people to this day angry about google reader going away i still used hangouts for uh for some
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:45.960]   podcasts but hangouts is being shut off the classic version of hangouts which is not the slack clone
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.600]   that is the new version of hangouts and i i think you make a good point like okay they're free
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.240]   but what part of the goal there is you it's free and then you use it and then it becomes popular
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:00.280]   and then it becomes a business model eventually something like gmail but why should i try this
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:05.880]   free product if i am worried that it's just going to die um and if i'm a somebody building products
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.200]   at google i had that same concern i'm pretty much right now if you're still using google plus
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:17.160]   because you love you love the thing yeah and google being google um they like things have
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.480]   another billion users and they're probably plenty of social networks that would be happy to have
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:27.720]   however many users google plus still has but for google it's puny an inbox is never going to have
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.440]   a billion users like gmail even though it's pretty good yeah and the people who love inbox really
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:38.600]   love it i mean this has been going on for five or six years um when larry page came back to be
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:44.760]   ceo of google again he introduced a strategy called um putting more wood behind fewer arrows
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:50.760]   which was basically let's make the stuff that's really popular as good as it can be and weed out
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:59.240]   the less important stuff so it's it's not new but um even though google is not quite as weird and
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:05.000]   wacky and as experimental as it once was it still has been launching stuff like inbox and alal and
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.320]   again alal the idea was that they could compete successfully with what's app and messenger
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.960]   they never came anywhere close to it and if they can't do it it's kind of pointless from google
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.360]   standpoint to offer alal even though i'm sure there are people who loved it yeah and there's an
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.440]   argument to be made that that is being disciplined to say we're going to try stuff but if it doesn't
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.880]   work we're not going to just be stuck with it we want to do something that might work so we're
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:32.440]   going to stop doing this thing that doesn't work and and move on from there as i do kill google
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.400]   voice all all of a sudden be a lot angrier because i do use google voice and i never was all that
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:45.640]   end in box or plus right yeah that's that's how they do things right they a lot of what they do is
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:54.440]   based on real market feedback and so you go out you launch it you have people try it out and then see
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:02.600]   if you get critical mass or not that's the way to do it versus you know the way that apple does it
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.920]   where they go out not to try it actually you know they go out with the service and then it might
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:17.800]   or might not work you know we're talking about news earlier if if we're google doing news plus
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:23.560]   i'm sure that would have been like some kind of beta version coming out and then you'll have the
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:29.320]   real product further down the line when they had more content that was optimized but that's not
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:36.520]   the way apple does things i do think that as all of you have implied that the fact that consumers
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:46.440]   don't pay for it makes it a little bit more okay um to kind of swallow the the the product even if
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:52.120]   you liked it so much was canceled but it's interesting that a lot of times this comes
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:58.760]   in all shape or form think about you know it can be the product that is canceled or the product
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:05.480]   that changes forms as far as going from free to paid what happened to flicker for instance it was
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:12.200]   something that a lot of people were really upset about because a lot of uh photographer were using
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.640]   flicker and so the changes that came to the service were something that they were very upset
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:25.080]   this week there was a news from uh Microsoft deciding that they're no longer gonna sell books
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:31.320]   within their app store and if you know only you know they're not gonna sell books so you can't buy
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:38.200]   them anymore but if you did buy books in the past because the books were delivered to you via a
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:45.880]   web browser you no longer have those books um and you paid for those you know so maybe you thought
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:52.040]   about it that if it was a browser it wasn't really yours because you couldn't download it on your
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:11:00.920]   device but i don't know that for a lot of people that little step clicked so now you feel like they
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:07.000]   took your money and your left with nothing i think Microsoft is giving everybody essentially refunds
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.440]   for all the books they bought which is um you know that's that's some money back in your pocket but
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:17.880]   it's still for uh frustration if you bought this book i thought the refund were for pre-orders were
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.560]   they and well i that's why i might be totally mistaken oh no yeah it would very much stink if
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.960]   you bought something uh even if it was just a license to it uh to have it digitally and then
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:33.480]   just have the vendor say sorry it's gone that would be that'd be not good that you know that
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.600]   that brings up something that i didn't even think about that uh if if there's a if there's an app
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.320]   that i really really like for my macbook and the company goes out of business they stop supporting
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.200]   it so long as apple doesn't do anything to the operating system that causes that app to stop
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:54.680]   working i can still use that old copy of file maker or that or whatever out of business company
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.240]   app that i've used i can i can continue to use nicest writer as long as i want to use it
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:06.360]   whereas when you put all of your workflow and all of your creativity into an app that is web-based
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.840]   and they decided just flip a switch and shut down that web server you don't have that app anymore and
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:19.320]   it's we shouldn't understate how big a disruption it is when all the machinery that you've put into
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:26.040]   your office to make your money or to just be creative suddenly disappears just just like that
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.680]   how hard it is to find another art app or how it is how hard it is to find another spreadsheet
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:36.600]   or what processor or project manager that works that way so if this causes people to have less
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:43.720]   faith in google the question is going to be is that lack of faith more powerful than your desire to
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:49.480]   never ever ever ever pay for electrons ever under any circumstances which is a feature that google
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.200]   is always more than happy to provide in spades and i have a follow-up indeed microsoft is going to
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:00.120]   give you money back for your pre-orders and for all of your purchases in that store and if you
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.360]   marked up any of those books they'll give you an additional twenty five dollar credit because
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.920]   presumably you're going to have to download try to download your notes or copy them somewhere else
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.800]   but so that that's doing the right thing but still that's a service that you were relying on that is
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:19.400]   uh that is just going to go away it's it's the bizarro world version of a college textbook industry
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.920]   we will give you 100 percent of your money back exactly what you paid and if the more you use
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:30.200]   them the more we'll pay you good store pays you um that's i didn't know what's going to do
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:36.920]   yak off shmirnoff um let's talk about the line with the surprise the uh australia has passed
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:45.640]   legislation that will punish social media companies for uh failing to remove violent material
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:51.720]   abhorrent violent material from their platforms obviously this law was opposed by the tech industry
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:59.560]   and is a uh one of the strongest laws most likely a world first in australia i was thinking about
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:06.200]   this in terms of some other stories that we saw this week about youtube letting um toxic videos
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:13.160]   run rampant on uh on its service a bloomberg story about that how there were lots of proposals
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:20.760]   but in the end the goal was engagement and longer videos and videos that were perhaps toxic in
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:27.240]   terms of their content did do well in terms of the engagement metrics they were looking at and uh
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:32.840]   it's not uh not a great situation i think these stories are linked in terms of these uh um
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:38.520]   social media companies trying to prioritize the wrong thing and i don't love the idea of
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.720]   governments coming in and saying well we've we've got a solution and it's this regulation uh we've
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:49.800]   seen how most laws that are created aren't really created with knowledge of technology in mind
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.680]   but at the same time it's hard to argue that there aren't some serious problems in terms of how
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.560]   these companies are prioritizing what uh what they leave on their services and what they take
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:06.360]   off of their services yeah i think it's it's pretty scary when you have laws like this including
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:13.160]   laws that uh it's the what was happening in the copyright directive that the EU passed a couple
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:19.000]   weeks ago right that when you're it's not just a problem of being so broad as to include everything
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   when you have this new australian law that says that number one as a service provider you are
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.320]   responsible number two you're responsible for doing this in a timely fashion and these are so vague
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:34.920]   that uh not only does it make it really really hard to comply with these rules the knee jerk
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:41.320]   reaction is going to be to stifle free speech to make sure that if we don't know that this post is
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:48.920]   absolutely as pure as ivory snow we are not going to allow this to be posted and also and so what
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.640]   how does that help someone who uh needs to report from the field all the way down to someone who
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:58.840]   just wants to share these crocheting tips that they found useful as they're learning how to crochet
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:04.840]   it's uh it's the the other big problem is that i just don't think that a lot of these laws appreciate
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:11.960]   how difficult this problem is it's so easy for a wetware for a human brain to look at a piece of
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:17.720]   posted content and say this is obviously not see material this is obviously white supremacist
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:23.240]   material it is really really difficult for an algorithm to do that and when you have when you
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.840]   have the the volume of content being uploaded every single hour on a surface like youtube
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:35.400]   it you have to have a system that allows these companies to try to fight the battle instead of
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:42.040]   having to withdraw withdraw withdraw for a for a fear of being sued out of existence uh every
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:47.880]   other thursday i mean everything andy said is true but i also think that the likes of youtube and
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:53.400]   facebook have not done themselves any favors because there's stuff they could have done which they
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:00.920]   have not and so even before you get to the truly difficult questions uh and the things that are
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:06.440]   truly difficult to do with technology they could have done more and so they leave themselves looking
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:11.320]   like they don't take it seriously enough which they probably don't which means the laws are more
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.520]   likely to come along and some of these laws already exist germany is this law that basically says
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.480]   you have to quickly take down anything bad and it's anybody says about anybody on the internet
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:28.680]   and so yeah there are difficult questions but they're also relatively easy ones that
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.320]   these companies have not handled well it's certainly true and and you mentioned the copyright
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:39.160]   directives you end up with this chilling effect where it becomes very hard for companies they
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:44.760]   have to do a lot of filtering which might lead you to over filtering you know right taking out
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:50.680]   the bad stuff and also some stuff that's perfectly fine i mean i know somebody who has a podcast about
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:57.240]   knitting i want to say and had her facebook group removed for um you know basically being
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:03.640]   a bad actor and i'm like well but it's knitting in sweetening it's not and yeah cozy was a false flag
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:08.520]   over it and i know it right well i mean yeah knitters you know my wife is a knitter i think knitters
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.720]   are generally okay but you never know they could be up to something uh but that makes people angry
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:18.840]   right but um when you pass a law that says you are going to be in huge trouble if you don't filter
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.800]   everything one of the things that will happen is all these platforms that will accept sort of
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:29.320]   anything from the internet anything that comes across the transom and post it are going to become
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:35.480]   much less functional and that is a good thing in terms of really gross awful stuff but it's a
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:39.560]   bad thing if you're somebody who is used to having your voice be heard about something that is
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.360]   potentially much more innocuous and it also creates a barrier for anybody else who wants to create
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.800]   any business or service on the internet because only the biggest companies are going to be able to
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:56.520]   hire staffs of people and build complicated algorithms to scan everything to make sure that it's okay
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:01.320]   and that's the other problem with uh with stuff like this carolina do you have any thoughts about
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:09.720]   this yeah and especially as uh not just from a tech perspective but as a mother of an 11 year old
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:19.080]   um who happens to spend some time on youtube's and yes we have the age um limits and you know we
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:26.760]   we are careful about what she watches but it is so easy to go from an innocuous search to content
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:35.720]   that is clearly not for her so i agree with everything that you guys have said uh it is a concern when
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:43.640]   government starts to come in with very little understanding of how the world is in 2019 and try
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:53.240]   and and dictate what can and cannot be done i also agree with harry that um it doesn't feel
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:20:06.760]   the monitoring and improving the health of uh social media in general has been a priority for a lot
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:17.000]   of these companies and so something has to change you know if you if the CEOs and and whoever it
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:25.080]   doesn't feel accountable for providing a service that is as best as they can with the understanding
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:32.760]   that it will never be perfect because i'm sure that they you know they can paddle as much as a duck
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:41.480]   does underwater but still have somebody ahead of them um is you know you you should feel that they
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:48.920]   are trying and personally i don't feel that i feel that there's more time focused on ai
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:57.000]   features and improvements for their benefit than than not that was listening to someone
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:04.520]   say you know they know so much and they can be so good at certain things uh and yet something that
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:12.040]   is and twitter i think is a great example of that right um of people being suspended for something
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:22.520]   that obviously it wasn't um worth a suspension and people being uh very abusive and yet you know
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:28.600]   twitter not finding anything wrong with what they tweeted uh so i don't know if he's ai i don't know
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:36.440]   if he's human because even from a human perspective people have different um ideas of what is uh
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:43.320]   right and what is wrong but something has to be done and if it's not a government level
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:51.400]   law or dictate who's going to take that responsibility and i don't have an answer for it i do think that
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:22:02.840]   we as consumers uh should demand better yeah and the fact is you know the laws are often 10 years
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:08.360]   behind and crafted by people who don't understand technology the services don't seem to be showing
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.640]   as much desire to decrease engagement in order to increase quality and get some of this stuff off
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:19.960]   of their services and we're left with this kind of conundrum of is the threat of being uh legislated
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:25.640]   against enough to make the services behave better is there a way to create some legislation that
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:33.080]   threads that needle and gets them to do a reasonable job of this i don't know i mean the in the u.s the
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:39.160]   track record with legislation involving copyright and involving safe harbor provisions and all
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:44.040]   sorts of other things that we've seen in the last 20 years track record is not good in terms of
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.920]   those laws actually doing what they thought they were going to do so um not to not to leave you
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:53.240]   on a downer note there but i think this is a big challenge for the tech industry as a whole um
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:58.680]   we need to move on and i need to scare you with scary security stories of the week i promised
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:02.760]   you there would be some frightening things coming up at first somebody who's not frightening at all
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.480]   because we love him it's Leo hey thank you Jason and uh on we go with a show in just a minute but
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:12.840]   first a word from capterra i am uh because of the radio show i think i i'm the point man for a lot
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:19.160]   of people uh who are i could just i i know it when they call they work for a business and the
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   and the boss has said we need better software find it and so they call me they say i lee oh i need a
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:34.040]   cms or i need a crm or i need a email marketing tool or i need a social media marketing tool or i need
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:38.680]   sometimes i get people call i i have i run a dentist office you got any good dental office
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.800]   software i don't know but i don't want to send him to google that's even worse google
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:47.960]   dental office management software you'll get it just a pile of results with no way to figure out
[01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:56.040]   what's right i've got a much better way don't call me don't go google it go to capterra it's
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:03.080]   the search engine for business software and i love it over 700 categories too i mean everything you
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:09.160]   could ever need from project management email marketing yoga studio management it's all there
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:18.040]   dog groomer it's all there and best of all 800 000 reviews and counting from actual users they're
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:23.000]   very careful they vet the reviews those are people use the program so what you do is you go to capterra
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.400]   you find the category you're looking for they'll give you check boxes for features you check the
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:31.960]   boxes of the stuff you've got to have it'll show you all the programs that have that you can compare
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:38.760]   them side by side if you want you can read all the reviews this is the best way to research business
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:44.680]   software now when i just described to you you'd probably pay 10 20 30 50 dollars a month for and
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:49.800]   i'm sure you're expecting to so you're maybe going to be a little skeptical when i tell you capterra
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:57.000]   is free and i mean free free there there's no upsell that's it that's why millions of people use it
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.520]   every month it's free go to capterra.com/twit you'll find the right tools to make it informed decision
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.800]   for your business sometimes people are using old business software you know that's why so many
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:15.480]   people still use windows xp they get an old program that won't work on anything more modern
[01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:25.240]   get with the times go to capterra.com/twit find the best modern software for your business capterra.com/twit

[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:47.320]   now on with the show spooky scary security not a podcast but it could be instead it's going to be
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.920]   a segment here i can't tell you how many stories i found this week just this week while looking up
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:26:00.360]   headlines for twit that uh chilled me to the bone perhaps the one that did it most this was this was
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:09.400]   a week ago today and it's the story of hacking tesla's auto drive with stickers you love stickers you
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:14.200]   can put them on your laptop they're great but in this case small stickers were used to create what
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:21.480]   is called a fake lane attack which is not a phrase i ever wanted to learn but now i've heard it they
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:29.720]   were able to stick stickers on a street so that the tesla automatic pilot thought the lane was
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:37.400]   shifting to the left when it wasn't and got the tesla to move i don't like this story i don't like
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:45.240]   the fact that some guy with stickers can make tesla's veer into the wrong lane but i guess that's uh
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.680]   that's where we live now is we live in a world where a sticker pack could be used to hijack a car
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:56.600]   i'm just saying it can happen it's just that's just great so not only can i not not afford a tesla
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:02.440]   and not only am i gonna be like jeopardized by people who use autopilot like they can take a nap
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:07.400]   but also i gotta be be jeopardized by people putting stickers on the road i feel as though
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.440]   i need to buy a tesla just so i can return the fire
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.880]   yeah it is scary if it's like you know somebody's out there putting stickers and you got a dodge
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:19.880]   tesla's that are coming from who knows what direction because the stickers are there it's
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:25.000]   a true story i i think tesla has already said that they're working on a fix to this and i think
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.160]   it's good that security researchers if that was who did this um are working on stuff like this but
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:37.240]   also it it's just is disturbing the idea that um we've trained cars to drive themselves in
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.360]   certain circumstances but then if mischievous people put stickers in the wrong place it all is
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:46.680]   ruined it's all for now this is this isn't Dennis the menace let's say we can save really really
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:53.240]   bad jerks who want to kill people yes exactly the the worst jerks all the people are doing this are
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:28:00.040]   attempting to disclose this problem before the jerks figure it out indeed much better to have
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:06.280]   a researcher find it out than to learn about it when somebody does it in a major city for sure for
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.280]   sure and presumably there will be problems akin to this that we do learn about when somebody does
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:15.240]   it and it's extremely effective yes and i like the fact that you know tesla is going to do some
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:20.600]   analysis and they're going to figure out how to how to uh combat it and i just don't like the idea
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.720]   that i hadn't really thought about the fact that some reflective stickers placed on a roadway can
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.840]   create a false lane and that's you that's your fake lane attack that i don't want to know about
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:36.600]   how about this one speaking of people i would be concerned if you if you thought about it just saying
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:43.960]   yeah yeah i don't like i don't like it okay so let's uh let's go one better worse um fake
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:53.880]   cancer in ct scans created by malware to trick radiologists researchers in israel created malware
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:29:04.280]   that would make false tumors false cancerous nodules show up on ct scans and in mr eyes again i'm not
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:09.800]   quite sure why but the i think the idea here is that you can potentially do an attack on a on a
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:16.760]   country's health system where suddenly all of their health scanners would be unreliable or um one
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:22.680]   example given was you want to drive a politician out of a race you trick them into thinking they
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:27.400]   have cancer when they don't and uh and they get out right they use the example of hillary clinton
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.560]   having once you fainted and there were all these rumors going around and what if they had uh
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.640]   attacked her data at that moment and uh and made her or somebody like her think that they were uh
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:43.960]   we had a had a tumor somewhere and they drop out of the race yeah it really is a major i'm sorry go
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:48.760]   ahead no i was going to say this is kind of going back to what i was saying earlier we can do all
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:57.320]   these things and yet we cannot solve the problem violent content on social media go figure well i
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:03.320]   see it's it's it's there's so many industries that they need to have that moment of a wake-up call
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:10.200]   where they realize that you're you're so excited about this amazing 3d imaging technology that you
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:16.920]   don't spend any time on the 1993 technology to make sure that these systems are secure from an
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:23.160]   outside attack and you you're really really proud of this autopilot system that can figure that can
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:29.560]   lead to self-driving cars you don't decide that why don't we apply basic principles to make sure
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:35.080]   that an outside party cannot take control of the car and steer the car into a into a bridge
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.360]   abutment and that's the that's the commonality for all these stories it's not that uh it's it's
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:46.840]   it's disappointing that pranksters who are looking out for the lulls can put stickers on a road and
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:52.280]   trick a tesla into going to oncoming traffic that's that's that's what you learn when you keep
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:57.400]   developing brand new technology but when you when you learn that other people haven't be able to get
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:03.160]   into these systems uh from the outside and take over the car it seems as though there's a way to
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:09.880]   develop a computer on board the the car that is highly resistant to that sort of attack uh the
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:15.240]   another another story that was coming out belatedly the past couple weeks is how uh the
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:22.200]   personal data that gets on to these on board navigation systems and control systems
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:28.440]   isn't being stored in a secure way so if you buy a rec tesla you can get every piece of information
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:34.920]   pretty much about that person who used that tesla just by pulling it off of the storage of the device
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:39.640]   that was built into it and uh similar to the similar to the reasons why i keep a bluetooth
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.720]   speaker with me when i travel and i have to rent a car because i know that if i actually use the
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:48.040]   built-in bluetooth it's going to immediately suck all my contacts into the center console
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:52.840]   and i don't know how good this center console is going to be at erasing this stuff when i
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.360]   disconnect and salt i forget about my phone uh so there's so many
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:04.680]   simple things that are drilled into our heads if we've ever had a a one hour seminar or
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:11.000]   read one article about data privacy and security that just don't seem to be being followed on these
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.120]   systems that we're entrusting so much information and so much of our safety too it's very disappointing
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:22.760]   yeah a related story to that is uh bloomberg reported this week that um facebook user data
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.320]   or um third-party apps now we already heard about this with kambridge analytic but this was a new one
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.600]   which is several of those third-party apps had taken all of that facebook user data and put it
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:39.800]   in plaintext on a publicly accessible amazon server yep so again like you could have one layer
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:44.680]   of security and then there's another layer of security and then somebody in the chain
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:50.840]   does something stupid and there's all your data it's out there one uh i mean facebook had already
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:55.480]   tightened up that stuff but the horse was already out of the barn right because in the old days
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:01.000]   if you were facebook's partner they'd give you the data and you were responsible for taking care of
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.400]   it right and not everybody with great power comes great responsibility people but back in those days
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:13.160]   not so much so just plain text of all your friends out on on amazon um i do want to mention iced tea
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:19.320]   not the not the guy the drink the lovely beverage who doesn't like iced tea oh god what are hackers
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:24.440]   doing to our lip then well arizona beverages uh makers of the arizona iced tea product that so
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:29.960]   many of the kids like today uh they told all their uh workers this week don't touch your computers
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:36.360]   don't turn them on don't even look at them because they're infected by ransomware more than 200
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:41.960]   servers and network computers we're told what a way to start the day what a monday your network
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:48.120]   was hacked and encrypted and uh and they brought in it took them five days i love this it took them
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:52.680]   five days before they brought in incident responders to handle this i like to imagine that the it staff
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:57.320]   was just like huddled in the back room somewhere being like what do we do man what do we do for five
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:04.680]   days before they uh realized that they needed to uh take care of that situation so if your thirsty um
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:09.320]   i'm sure that the iced tea hasn't been encrypted i'm sure the iced tea itself is fine but all of their
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:15.080]   data has been encrypted that's a bad day that's a bad week if you're the it guide arizona iced tea
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:21.320]   um nobody has iced tea related things well then i'm going to move on to sandwiches i'm going to
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:30.840]   ruin sandwiches for you now because two million credit cards for uh restaurants including buca
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.840]   debepo planet hollywood and earl of sandwich a tasty sandwich shop that i go to when i'm in
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:43.800]   san hose at california um my credit card's probably been exposed this is earl enterprises that owns
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:49.400]   uh these restaurants and uh they've had another large data breach so if you like sandwiches
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:55.400]   the earl of sandwich if you like the giant meatball the size of your head at buca debepo check your
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:00.520]   credit cards yeah that this this is why this is such a good time for apple to be introducing
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:06.360]   the apple credit card to put the the certain features front and center saying that you can have a
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:12.120]   you can have like a burner credit card number that is absolutely good as a master card and then
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:16.440]   as soon as you get back from your week-long vacation you can absolutely destroy it so that
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.400]   no one no one will ever be able to use that number again without having to sign up for a new card
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:26.920]   or get a new whatever a new pin sent to you uh these are features that are on other bank cards but
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:34.200]   banks are going to have to up their game because it's it's the ability to create burner credit card
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:39.080]   numbers has got to be more easy for them than to actually make sure that all transactions
[01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:45.400]   are stored securely and not i don't know on a windows xp machine uh that's still that's with
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:51.160]   the gateway logo on it and getting back to the iced tea folks oh yes sorry i didn't want to skip
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:55.960]   over the iced tea i mean it sounds like not that they deserve for it to happen but they did they
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:36:00.760]   were running like ancient software and they had not been patching it and there is probably an
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:05.800]   alternate universe where this didn't happen because they were on top of things before they had to be
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:12.200]   yes the new mexico iced tea is fine in a parallel universe but uh here in ours yeah i mean this is
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.040]   this is the thing right at computers it's great you know i remember when not everybody had a
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:20.120]   computer and not everybody was on the internet but now everybody's got a computer everybody's on the
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:27.240]   internet not everybody who's taking all that data is uh is thinking about security as much as
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.280]   they should that's the truth and these facts keep happening example
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:37.560]   Equifax new patch head server yeah yeah yeah it's uh and it's going to keep happening until we have
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:43.720]   enough people who are trained well enough to think about this and enough managers who let them do
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:49.720]   what they need to do and in some cases as harry pointed out it's about uh spending the money to
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:55.080]   upgrade your systems uh that's part of it too if you've got some old system that has a known exploit
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:59.800]   and nobody will fund you to replace it then you're just going to sit there and be vulnerable
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:05.880]   with customer data potentially which is not good um i had one more um oh go ahead Andy just a just
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.440]   a quickly i think one of the huge problems though is that there's absolutely no consequences for
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:15.000]   these companies outside of a pr consequence when they have a massive data breach like this that
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.440]   turns out to be because they were absolutely inept at protecting customer data i mean i keep
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:27.240]   thinking about how there was a time where there was almost no incentive 100 years ago to uh to
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:32.200]   make sure that if you're if you're a butcher shop you're selling meat that isn't spoiled that if
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:37.000]   you're that you're if you're selling flour that it's not contaminated with all kinds of things that
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.640]   you would definitely that are present in warehouses by the animals that infest the places but you don't
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.920]   want to ever eat or drink there's just no reason for them to there's there's no punishment for them
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:52.920]   if they find out that they're selling food or selling a drug that is making people sick until
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:57.960]   we kind of got fed up as a society and said well guess what we're creating an entirely new government
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.920]   level administration that doesn't try to regulate you into existence but simply says that you are
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:07.640]   absolutely on the hook if people die because something that you advertise as a cough syrup is
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.960]   actually poisoning people with lead and mercury and i think that that's the point that we have to get
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:17.800]   to very very quickly to say that if you want to again keep running your running your data on
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:23.080]   windows XP device as a point of sale terminal if you want to have things on an open if you want
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:27.800]   to let your research your department take data that's supposed to be in a really really secure
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.040]   server and put it someplace where it's really really easy and handy if you to get to but it's
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:36.440]   available to everybody else go ahead and do that but you're not going to just simply be offering
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:42.360]   your customers six months worth of free credit credit report tracking you are going to be hit with
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:48.600]   huge huge penalties as a result that is the only thing that is going to assure that our data is
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:54.200]   getting the sort of security and attention that it's supposed to be getting sign up for that um
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:59.240]   one more bad story to share with you you're you trust in black for a reason did you
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:03.800]   sir i have the sad duty to report you leave and cleave of podcast hosting this one you've
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.520]   probably already heard the story i just want to point out again a woman walked into
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:14.680]   mara lago the winter white house the president of the united states was nearby
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:22.920]   she she said she wanted to go swimming she had four smartphones a laptop and a usb key
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:28.360]   containing malware um i don't really have any i mean first off it's great there was actually
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:32.760]   a receptionist who was like wait a second this seems like a bad idea and stopped her
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:39.240]   but i just am i just like the idea of four cell phones a laptop and a and a usb key with malware in it
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:45.000]   what what could she be doing i'm sure it was just a misunderstanding i'm sure it was just a
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:52.040]   simple statement yeah she was actually i think i think she was uh she the front desk said that
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:57.640]   she i'm a member i really am i just came in to use the pool and be rather than they thought they'd
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:01.960]   recognize her name from some place so they webbed her through it was the secret service that said
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.600]   huh we took a look at her things and she doesn't seem to have a swimsuit and now she's saying that
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:11.160]   she's there for some sort of a china trade conference that's happening later tonight and she wanted to
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.800]   get pictures of the area to make sure that she knew where the reception death where the where the
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:24.120]   sign-in desk was supposed to be but yeah see there's that's this is problematic i love the swimming
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:27.960]   no i just need to use the pool yeah yeah i like i love that just throw that in there i don't have
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:32.760]   a swimsuit but that's a poker player i need to use the ball that's it at least she didn't say golfing
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:39.800]   in our chat room stoic squirrel pointed out leo has four cell phones do we know that leo's in Hawaii
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:47.960]   do we know that for sure see at marlago right now possible i'm just i'm just offended that you
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:52.440]   try to get around the system if you want to get personal or data from mover on the president
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.760]   you're gonna have to sign up for a half a million dollar membership just like every other lobbyist
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:02.120]   an international figure there's a system there's a reason why that system works i'm just here to
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:08.120]   use the pool just just here for the pool all right speaking of leo we have one more sponsor for leo
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:16.200]   to read and uh it will happen right now uh we'll have more with uh jason snell and the team and
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:21.960]   just a bit more twig coming up i'm sorry i'm not there i wish i were it sounds like fun oh i'm i
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:26.200]   know i'm having a horrible time in the sun and fun it's why i'm on the beach i know it's just the
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.880]   murder i'll be back next week i promise meanwhile
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:38.360]   meanwhile i'd like to talk about i'd like to talk to the it team in your
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:44.360]   business it is the heart of any business these days really i mean that's where it all
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.320]   happens here in any business thanks to the cloud and all of this it's it teams
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:57.560]   are empowering business and who empowers it teams at lassian the collaboration software company
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:05.080]   that empowers it teams all over the world staying competitive and increasing the cloud-based world
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:10.440]   means you have to have it teams that are the top of their form they can plan they can execute
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:18.280]   their fast their agile their smart and i'm gonna underline this because it's important to me
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:24.680]   they know how to communicate with their stakeholders they can coordinate between ops and software
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:31.800]   development teams they're good communicators and that's what lassian does at lassian supports
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:38.520]   it at the center of your operation and you know probably jira right that's the that's the that's
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:42.920]   the brand everybody knows with it lassian well i if that's the first way i experienced it lassian
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.840]   we use jira for developing our new website it's a great way now we use it to keep track of all
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:53.880]   the projects around the studio we know who's responsible what stage it's at what they're doing
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:43:00.440]   and of course there's that great satisfying feeling when you move that task over to the completed column
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:06.840]   jira is really the best way to manage complex projects but the thing i like about jira is it
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:13.000]   works with another elasium product called confluence and because it's so tightly integrated it makes
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.040]   it very easy for our team our it guys our studio staff and so forth to document what they did
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:26.200]   and documentation to me is also important so they can pass on their knowledge right so
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:30.680]   everybody understands what's going on there's no mystery this is what kind of the backbone
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:36.600]   of elasian i think sometimes people think it's just for developers it's not elasian offers in a
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:42.680]   affordable reliable suite of tools for teams of all types all sizes from dev ops to agile to
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:49.720]   it apps to ops to it's em and whatever you've got in your building they provide that technology
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:54.760]   backbone to help modern it organizations plan service and support exactly the kind of change
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.960]   you want to propel your business so i mentioned jira and confluence um if you've got a code database
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:05.800]   there's the the great bit bucket but also ops chaney and if you need to keep track of incidents
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:12.200]   and coordinate response efforts they got trello now i mean i can there's a bunch of tools i can go

[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:26.680]   that hawaii stuff i'm uh i'm here in california rainy rainy terrible okay it's not that bad in
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:32.040]   california it's fine um one last story we're on the downhill slide now but this is a story that i
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:38.760]   had to talk about it involves steven spielberg and yes the department of justice uh and it goes
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:44.760]   like this steven spielberg has come out as saying that he doesn't think that netflix movies should
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:50.280]   be eligible for academy awards even if they jump through the hoops of award eligibility and
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:56.600]   show the movies for a week in la and new york in order to be eligible steven spielberg actually told
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.880]   somebody at i tv news in an interview that he considers any movie on netflix a tv movie
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:09.560]   um i've seen roma if please do not tell me that is a tv movie come on man steven spielberg who by
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:16.120]   the way two weeks ago stood on stage exactly at apple's campus to extol the virtues of his
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.320]   technically tv show yes on a streaming service at apple apple's gonna have movies too presumably
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.520]   if they screen them in the right theaters they'll be eligible for an oscar anyway netflix shot back
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:30.760]   and said one of the things they always say which is so many more people have access to netflix
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:35.560]   then often can see especially smaller movies in movie theaters so there are lots of reasons
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:39.960]   that netflix thinks they are film friendly and they're making movies and funding movies that
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:45.160]   otherwise might not even get made well spielberg said he was going to go to the academy and say
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:49.880]   they shouldn't be eligible for oscars we should just ban netflix from being eligible for oscars
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:57.000]   um which got a letter sent to him and the academy by the department of justice saying
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.720]   you know if a bunch of companies who compete with a different company conspire to kick them
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:08.600]   out of awards and that therefore leads to their business being harmed in some way and then making
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:15.320]   less money than normal that's uh that's collusion and illegal and you might want to rethink things a
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.560]   little bit now i think this is sort of silly that it's escalated the point where there's a letter
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:23.080]   from the department of justice but then again i think it's kind of silly that steven spielberg
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:29.560]   thinks roma is a tv movie because it's not and i love steven spielberg and i love his movies but
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:36.600]   well i didn't like hook i think hook is really bad but i love him in general and you know what
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:42.040]   what is the story here andy andy help me out here is there bring reason to this conversation
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:49.480]   yeah i mean it's a really dogmatic idea that if you have a movie that is not being made for a
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:54.840]   huge projection screen to be a shared experience with strangers then it's not technically a movie
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:00.520]   which dogmatically okay that's fine but it shouldn't exclude a movie as you make such a good point
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:06.680]   roma from being considered for an Oscar a movie that by the way was screened in 150 us theaters and
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:11.720]   something that and many more outside of the united states there's a there's a very very simple
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:17.880]   rule for how you make a movie eligible you simply have to run it for one week in a theater in l.a. or
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:23.400]   new york during a certain period of the day in an advertised sort of screening but they were
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:28.280]   actually did it they actually did it as a real release as basically as a really major release of
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.880]   an important foreign movie from an important director which is what it was the only the only
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:41.720]   complaints that they make that might have some sort of teeth to it is the idea that a Netflix movie
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.760]   or streaming movie has an advantage over a traditional theatrical movie because
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:54.840]   the current rules don't establish a window of exclusivity for the theatrical release so they
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.720]   can start their one week qualifying run in l.a. and then i think like on that exact same day as
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:04.680]   soon as it screened once they can now open it up they can now have a drop on their streaming
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:12.920]   service which means that whereas a traditional hollywood movie is going to be released for home
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:19.400]   streaming months after its release and maybe only barely before Oscar season starts essentially
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:25.240]   everybody who could be voting on this or nominating movies could have been watching this movie since
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:32.280]   september october november that might give them an advantage uh again that's that's a thing to
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.400]   discuss but the the fact the matter is that i think netflix's argument is the one that's more
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:42.840]   important that the the fact the matter is that you have all the movies that are being released
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:48.120]   the big blockbusters are happening this month they're not just going to one screen in one
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:53.640]   multiplex they're taking over every single if you got the multiplex that has 20 screens on it
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:59.160]   the marvel movie has six screens plus both the iMac screens the dc movies might have another two or
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:06.840]   three screens got transformer movie so as a result the the the movies that traditionally are
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:15.880]   oscar baked or at least are more uh and get more attention from from awards just can't find a place
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:20.440]   to run and can't find a place to get that kind of attention whereas netflix and hulu and hopefully
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:26.520]   apple are going to give these smaller movies uh and and but even but even there the the argument
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:32.760]   can kind of go a little bit south uh martin scresese's next movie with robert and euro with
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:37.160]   everybody is going to be costing about two hundred million dollars and it is a direct to netflix
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:42.520]   release with it with a theatrical release for qualification so but i i don't i hope that really i
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:47.000]   hope that if they make any changes to the rules it is something that makes a movie like roma
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.000]   harder to be recognized this was we forget that this was like the first best director uh not just
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.880]   best foreign film director but the best director of any movie last year went to a foreign movie the
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:03.480]   first time that mexico won best foreign film and you can't deny that that this was a movie that was
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:07.560]   you can't say that this was a movie made for phone screens this was a real darn movie
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:15.160]   yeah it really was emotionally i have to say and even though i feel guilty about it i'm sort of on
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:21.000]   spielberg's side first of all i think you should taking the oscar's seriously it's kind of silly
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:28.760]   but i do but i do sort of like this this like a 115 year old communal experience of going out
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:33.240]   somewhere ensuring an experience with other people it's quite a different experience since
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:38.760]   sitting at home watching a movie i think it's something valuable i can understand why steven
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:43.880]   spielberg also thinks it's valuable and is a little bit defensive about it
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:51.880]   yeah i i hear that i i think in the end yes you could argue then why not nominate like a season of
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:57.160]   tv for an oscar at that point should it should yeah at the at the same time you know the work of
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:02.120]   art isn't any different based on exactly where it premieres or if it runs for a week and that i think
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:06.600]   that's part of the problem right is is it sounds like they're trying to rig the rules in order to get
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:11.960]   netflix out as opposed to trying to encourage now what uh the ken film festival did is they said
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:16.600]   this movie needs to run and not be on streaming for a month in french theaters or we won't consider
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:21.640]   it and that's a much harsher rule but it's fair if you really want to say that that is the rule
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:25.560]   that's required but then every movie would be required yeah why don't why don't the oscar's just
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:31.320]   tighten it up and say it's not just a week it's six weeks or whatever although i guess there are
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:36.120]   there are theatrical releases who never make it to six weeks probably that's true but they wouldn't
[01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:41.160]   be eligible for an oscar then i mean that's part of the challenge it's also it's also really really
[01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:46.360]   silly because one of the problems that uh the oscar's telecast has had year after year is that
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:52.120]   the movies that uh the movies that are being nominated are movies that the general public just has never
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:57.640]   ever seen and as they're turning to streaming services to see feature movies more and more
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:03.000]   they are sort of turning their backs on a way to revitalize the awards to make it seem more accessible
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:09.720]   and important to to absolutely everybody i mean there was a there was a time when the
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:15.240]   emmys would say that no no you're you're a cable tv tv show you you're not qualified for an
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:20.440]   emmy and they had the cable ace awards for that instead at some point somebody slapped the emmy
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:24.280]   organization really really hard or they slapped themselves really hard and saying there's no way
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:30.040]   that the sopranos is not as not television and they are we're all seeing this through a television
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:34.520]   screen they should be allowed to compete for the regular emmys as well it's and it hasn't
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:37.720]   seemed to hurt to have hurt the the emmy awards at all this is just silly
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:41.880]   karolina do you have opinions about spielberg or about hook
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:49.560]   well uh i'm not sure about hook i i don't think that i can show this um i do think that clearly
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:54.680]   for spielberg it you know it's like this this is unfair until i make a movie for apple and then
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:54:01.960]   that's okay um but if we're looking at you know changing the rules how about going the other way
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:09.960]   and and and shortening even more uh the gap between the theater and um the the streaming services or
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:17.400]   or if people still bivin blue rays and so forth because i totally hear you jason when you say
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:25.080]   the smaller movies just don't get the same uh airtime at the theaters we were um in the in the winter
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:33.720]   we were looking at um uh the hate you give which is a great movie on the back of a great book and he
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:41.400]   was in the theater near us for one day because it was a time where there were big releases coming out
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:48.600]   and those were taking all the the the theaters inside the amc close to us and and that's the point
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:54.760]   like you know captain marvel comes out and there are seven screening that take over the whole
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:01.880]   theater so it is tough for certain um movies smaller movies and at the same time i think that
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:07.560]   although i i agree is a great experience to go to a cinema and and as a family we do that quite
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:15.640]   often there are a lot of people that don have access to a theater and or physically don't like
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:22.440]   going to a theater because they might have either disability issues or um anxiety issues or whatever
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:30.040]   else so i think there's you know you shouldn't be denied access to great content based on whether
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:36.920]   or not you can get yourself to a theater yep i agree with that i agree with that it's a yeah
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:43.240]   yes awards are silly they are so awards for art are extra silly but at the same time i do have a
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:49.720]   problem with this idea that just the uh a business-based mechanism of delivery is the only reason but
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:53.960]   harry's got a great point if you wanted to create as the academy and incentive to have
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:59.560]   movies stay in movie theaters for longer than they do you can change the rules for everybody
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:03.320]   and make them keep those movies in the theater longer and you know what
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:09.000]   Netflix for Roma would have done whatever it took in order to get that movie up for an Oscar and
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.720]   i think it deserved what it won and i thought it was the best picture of the year but i don't get
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:19.240]   a vote i'm not in the academy so that i'm not allowed to put one quick note probably the reason
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:24.840]   why the DOJ letter came when it did was that the academy has an annual meeting that's that
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.720]   happens i think the next couple of weeks in which they just routinely discuss proposed rule changes
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:34.040]   so it's probably why they decided to boot up boot off that letter also because i think that the
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:40.280]   DOJ has its own Oscar picks that they're trying there the the the DOJ office Oscar pool integrity
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:44.280]   has to be maintained it's a nice award you got here it would be a shame if something happened to
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:50.680]   it like a DOJ investigation um yeah i can't wait to see the steven spielberg movie about
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:56.200]   the investigation in steven spielberg by the justice department it'll be released on Netflix so
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:01.320]   up for an Emmy i guess all right that brings us to the end of this week's edition of twit
