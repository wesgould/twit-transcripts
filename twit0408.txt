[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.920]   with a great panel as always starting all the way
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.760]   to the left with the man in the screen and the collar.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.160]   It's Mr. Father, Robert Ballaser,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.200]   host of this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.840]   Robert's shutting down his lab as he moves out here
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.920]   to the West Coast.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.480]   So that's everything behind you has to go.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.720]   - Everything has to be packed up.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.200]   In fact, this is pretty much all that's left in the lab.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.120]   I've torn everything else down.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.080]   Most of it's already in California.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.880]   So I'm just waiting until the beginning of July
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.280]   where I can officially throw the switch and make it dark.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.360]   - You're not throwing stuff out.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.200]   You're not gazelling it.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.920]   You're just gonna-- - Oh.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.880]   - There's so much stuff that's leaving out behind.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.720]   Throwing out.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.600]   I kid you not last week, I shipped out half a ton.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.040]   - What? - A year back to '90.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.360]   Half a ton.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.720]   - Oh, back to the manufacturers.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.920]   Not to keep. - Yeah.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.760]   - Oh, no, no, no.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.840]   That's one of the nice things about moving every once in a while.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.880]   You kind of divest.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.000]   You get rid of all this stuff.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.320]   The theory is get rid of anything
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.040]   that I haven't actually seen for a year.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.160]   - The chumby guy said, "Hey, we don't want it back, Robert.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.320]   You really?"
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.160]   - Really?
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.000]   - Thanks.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.960]   What are we gonna do with this now?
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.560]   Anyway, great to have you, Robert Ballister.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.360]   Also here, my old buddy, Roger Chang,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.560]   used to be at the ScreenSavers.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.160]   Now he's at Revision 3, producing Texilla.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.000]   And what else do you do?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.360]   - Texilla, HD Nation, and Jim's talk show.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.960]   - And Jim's talk show.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   Is it called Jim's talk show?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.360]   - No, it's got downloaded.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.200]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.600]   Jim Laderback, the CEO.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.880]   How's things going now that you're part of Discovery?
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.720]   - It's good.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.560]   It's been really busy.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.080]   They've just launched a new channel or a network called
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.280]   YouTube, or not YouTube TestTube at TestTube.com.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.040]   And the sentence on it is essentially,
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.640]   if Discovery channel came out and was geared online
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.480]   for millennials.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.800]   - If you started F on the internet.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.040]   Yeah, interesting, testTube.com.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.280]   How cool, you're gonna get to work on that a little bit?
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.400]   - Potentially.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.240]   There's a lot of great stuff on there.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.680]   And I really encourage to anyone who's super into science
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   and any of these curiosity stuff that you're interested.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.600]   Actually, they have Tori, I think Tori from the Mythbusters
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.240]   has a new show coming up.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   - Wow, this is interesting.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.040]   This kind of looks like a YouTube for Discovery.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.640]   - Yeah, and one of the shows up there at the top
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.760]   of the Scorpion is Distort where David Prager.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.360]   - Is gonna get stung by a Scorpion and slow motion.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.680]   Why would you do that?
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.720]   - Because they wanted to get the slow motion action
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.560]   of a Scorpion.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.840]   - Oh yeah, he has this new show that he does with Mauricio
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.600]   where they do stuff at Super Slow-Mo.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.240]   - Yep, with a Phantom camera.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.080]   - What camera they're using?
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.400]   The Phantom?
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.280]   How slow, how, like is it 20,000 frames?
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.120]   What is it?
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.960]   - 100.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.720]   - 100, wow.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.400]   But why David, you shouldn't let a Scorpion sting you.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.920]   It's not a good, that's David's apartment by the way.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   - Yes.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.600]   - They shoot this in his house.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   (laughs)
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.800]   - Did he survive the Scorpion sting?
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.640]   - He had it.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.320]   - I thought they're poisonous.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.880]   - He was in the office the other day, so I saw him.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.360]   - Oh no, don't show it.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.680]   Oh God, that's horrible.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.040]   - Also with us from Time Magazine,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   Harry McCracken, the technologist.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.680]   It's great to have you, Harry.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.520]   - Great to be here, Lee.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.520]   - And I owe you a debt of gratitude because Time Magazine,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.240]   at your particular section of it,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.280]   named as one of the top 50 websites of the year, thank you.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.000]   - Thank you, I kind of recused myself from that decision.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.840]   - Did you?
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.280]   - But I didn't fight for us?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   You said, well, I'm not gonna say anything.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.320]   - I was happy to see it, but as I'm not a saint,
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.440]   I didn't write it up myself.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.120]   Some of my colleagues were equally enthusiastic about the idea.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.920]   - Well, we're very grateful, that's very nice.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.400]   It was came as a somewhat of a shock to me.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.040]   - I think we were shocked that you had never been on,
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.080]   you've been doing this long before I got there,
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080]   and I think we were surprised you hadn't been on before.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.000]   - I was surprised that you'd even heard of me,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.120]   so thank you, I appreciate that.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.520]   I wanna start off, I hate to start off with sad news,
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.760]   but it is appropriate, you know, Oculus Rift
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.160]   has been getting such great reviews,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.080]   I just got my developer kit this week.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.120]   This was a Kickstarter project raised more than a million
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.640]   dollars last year to make a virtual reality helmet
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.400]   that many have said, this is the first time it really works,
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.480]   it's really cool, but what's so sad about it
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.760]   is the 33 year old co-founder of Oculus Rift,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.240]   Andrew Rice had got hit by a car,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   a hit and run during a police chase in Irvine,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.260]   and actually Santa Ana, and it died.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.320]   So huge loss, apparently it was some gang members
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.160]   who were being chased by the cops,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.720]   he was crossing the street, they ran a red light,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.800]   and they just plowed him down.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.200]   I don't know what will happen to Oculus Rift as a result,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.080]   I'm sure they'll continue on because they've got
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.360]   an amazing technology, but boy that is a terrible,
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.640]   terrible loss to the tech community, 33 years old,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.000]   33 years old, so young.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So I'm gonna keep the Oculus Rift, we did a review,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.800]   if you wanna see our review, Tony Wang got his,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.160]   and have you played with it?
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.720]   - I have not. - It's awesome,
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.120]   it's kind of amazing, like real time,
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.200]   turn your head and it's just perfect.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.040]   Anyway, I hope they keep doing this,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.160]   but just a great tragedy.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.840]   Tragedy of another kind for photographers in Chicago,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.120]   and I'm really curious what you guys are gonna say
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.560]   about this, I'm getting a lot of email and tweets about it,
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   the Chicago Sun Times has fired their staff reporters
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.640]   and 28 photographers, they fired him on Friday,
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.760]   and this is where it gets weird,
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   apparently the writing reporters, the written reporters
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.000]   for the newspaper are gonna be trained in eye phonography,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.040]   they're apparently expected to pick up the slack
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.000]   and take pictures with their cameras.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.320]   - A sign of the Times.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.880]   - Well this is what intrigued me about this,
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.600]   that so many people were up in arms about this,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.160]   and of course when people get fired it's terrible,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   but this is a measure of the fact that newspapers
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:55.960]   are just dying.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.040]   - Well, I don't hear that when 28 reporters get fired.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.800]   - It's interesting because there's a parallel in television news,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.080]   especially local news, where a lot of camera guys,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.480]   a lot of studio guys got asked as soon as they started
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.000]   automating the studios with robot,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.960]   if you've never seen them robot cameras,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.280]   where you can remote--
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.480]   - They're scary, 'cause they are fast and they're heavy.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.000]   And if you get in the way, you can get clobbered.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.680]   - And one of the things, especially if you're in the business
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.880]   and you're applying for a job,
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.040]   you'll notice that a lot of the listings say they want a predator,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.600]   which is essentially a producer that can edit as well as write
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.960]   and do all the other stuff that used to be covered
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.560]   by two other individuals.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.400]   So in a way it's just a cost saving measure,
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.960]   whether or not you'll get the same level of quality--
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.200]   - Not from an iPhone, I can pretty much guarantee you.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.760]   But I agree with you, I thought this was very interesting,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.840]   'cause when reporters are laid off,
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.880]   a hundred reporters are laid off
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.120]   when Rupert Murdoch's daily went under.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.640]   You know, nobody goes, oh my God, this is horrible,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.200]   look what's happening in newspapers.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.160]   - Reporters do, but I don't think--
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.480]   - Reporters do.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.920]   - But the internet community got very up and arms
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.120]   about the photographers getting fired.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.080]   I saw a Trey Radcliffe and others writing about this,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.480]   very upset.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.400]   - Well, you want both, you want both pros using great equipment.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.080]   But if you are a journalist today,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.160]   you should be taking photos as well,
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.800]   you should be shooting video,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.000]   you should be doing all kinds of stuff,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.760]   you can't just be a word person.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.400]   - Dave McDinnard, chat room informs me.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.000]   The Metropolitan Opera fired their entire ballet company
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.680]   this week, not one word in the press.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.600]   But I think it's because we identify with photographers,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.880]   photographers are kind of the new heroes
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   of the geek, of new media, right?
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.200]   And so these 28 guys, by the way,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.800]   of all the people who could possibly be fired
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.400]   at a newspaper, the photographers
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.240]   are most likely to find work immediately, right?
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.400]   - Oh yeah, you would switch topics,
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.680]   you wouldn't be shooting a news story,
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.600]   you'd shoot a wedding or a birthday party.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.840]   - But there's kind of be work for you.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.200]   - Well, you know-- - Not a lot of work for a compositor.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.760]   - Well, that's the thing, is like even some
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.040]   of these photographers probably have some editing,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.800]   compositing post-production skills on photos
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.400]   because you cannot survive,
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.000]   especially in today's environment,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.800]   on just being good at one particular aspect of your job.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.120]   You wanna be able to maybe not be incredibly good
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.480]   at everything but at least competent.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.800]   Because you don't wanna be in the position
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.760]   where the company's looking to save a few dollars
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.520]   and looking at some, "Well, you know,
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.800]   can you edit?"
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.840]   I mean, you're a great anchor person
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.200]   but can you edit too?
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.760]   'Cause it saves us a lot of money and, you know,
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.680]   or that will hire the new guy who comes at half the rate.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.720]   - Chris Markbert. - But look at it.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.560]   - Yeah, go ahead.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.320]   - This is the business that we're in, right?
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.360]   I mean, this is what Twit does,
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.200]   this is what new media does.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.760]   We have figured out that the work,
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.080]   the production work that used to take millions of dollars
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.680]   and a huge studio to do, we can now do,
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.480]   not on the cheap but with a much different type of crew,
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.680]   different type of equipment.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.560]   The same thing happens to photography.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.160]   The newspapers have realized camera phones
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.360]   or, you know, prosumer cameras have become so good
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.280]   and amateur photographers get so many different angles
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.000]   that they can essentially get the same coverage,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.200]   they can get the same material,
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.280]   the same content that they need at a much lower price.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.440]   So in essence, if you're gonna be blaming the newspaper,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.640]   you should be blaming content creators like us
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.240]   and amateur content creators.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.680]   - And craigslist. - Just a game.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.160]   - And craigslist, which is completely undermined
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.640]   the entire financial structure.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.920]   - You would essentially be blaming everyone
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.760]   that has a piece of technology that allows them to catch her
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.800]   is still image, a moving image and recording audio.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.760]   I mean, think about the last three big news stories
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.200]   where most of the content came from people
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.840]   not associated with the press.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.840]   I mean, the soldier in London that was hacked to death,
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.480]   a lot of those videos.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.640]   - There were iPhone videos.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.920]   - There were iPhone videos that the Boston bombing,
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.600]   those were all captured, either by CCTV's or--
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.120]   - Photojournalists are important,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.320]   maybe one arguably the most important form
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.480]   of journalism today since we are in a much,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.040]   Vince LaFoure, who was a great photographer,
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.120]   wrote a blog post, "How to ensure your extinction,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.720]   "look at what newspapers are doing."
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   And he says, you know, he's talking about
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.760]   we're in the heyday of photography.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.960]   He says, well, it's sarcastically, yeah,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.600]   obviously teenagers are clearly reading 300 to 1200 word articles
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.480]   on newspaper websites in a regular basis.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.560]   They're not, they're looking at pictures, right?
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.360]   And you look at what the Boston Globe does
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.880]   with the big picture, which is wonderful.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.760]   Clearly they're making money on their photojournalists.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.560]   So maybe really the shortsightedness was
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.600]   that the Chicago sometimes couldn't figure out a way
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.800]   to make these guys pay.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.560]   - I'm kind of astounded they had 28--
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.960]   - 20 kids, it's a lot.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.800]   - Time.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.480]   Unbelievable.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.120]   - Get to go from what sounds like a pretty plush
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.960]   photography staff to nothing, must be kind of jarring.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.920]   I am kind of curious what their front page will look like.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.160]   - Well, if it's iPhone photos.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.640]   - Yeah, but if it's iPhone photos--
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.960]   - A lot of Instagram.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.000]   - Non-professionals.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.440]   - Well, it's one of those things where, you know,
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.600]   I mean, Leo, you know this.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.200]   You don't necessarily want to cut out, you know,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.360]   try to bridge everything with one person,
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.240]   but you want to pick and choose where you have that one
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.760]   or two individuals that are really good at photography
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.240]   and send them out on that story.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.000]   And everything else like, oh yeah, you're covering,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.080]   you know, the latest city council, you know,
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.760]   debate on whether or not a new park needs a tree or something.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.280]   You can send someone with an iPhone and cover that.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.720]   But if it's something that, you know,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.000]   is going to make the front page
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.360]   or something that's incredibly timely,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.520]   yeah, you want to send out the best person for that job.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.000]   - Vince is arguing they should have fired more reporters
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.760]   and kept the photographers, he might have a point there.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.480]   The photographers in this day and age
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.640]   might be more important.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.480]   But I think, you know--
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.320]   - Leo.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.160]   - Go ahead.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.000]   - Can I ask you a question?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.720]   Is there still the room for the pure photographer?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.000]   I mean, is it now?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.480]   No, you have to be a media creator,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.520]   you have to be a content creator.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.360]   You can't just do photography, you need to do videography.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.200]   You need to do editing.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.400]   Like Roger said, you have to have the talent
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.040]   along the entire spectrum.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.560]   It's, you can't any longer just be the guy with the great eye.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.200]   You have to be able to deliver on many different levels
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.880]   in the new media world, right?
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.720]   I mean--
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.360]   - That's a good point in fact.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.200]   In fact, you might have hit the nail on the head.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.400]   The guy who did this, Tim Knight,
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.760]   was the publisher at Newsday
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.360]   when they did exactly the same thing.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.440]   In 2008, they fired 20 people from their staff,
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.960]   but they allowed them, and this may happen
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.480]   at the Chicago Sun times, to reapply for multimedia jobs.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.800]   So they allowed them to say, okay, you know,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.960]   we're not still photos are,
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.880]   look at all the attention the New York Times got
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.480]   for that snow, the avalanche piece that they did.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.240]   It was, and it was a multimedia piece.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.360]   It wasn't just stills, it was video, it was moving.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.840]   Clearly, newspapers are maybe looking more to the web
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.200]   and more to being multimedia producers,
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.240]   so maybe that's what's going on.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.160]   So I don't think anybody in their right mind
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.600]   would say we are in a less visual age.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.520]   What is time, does Time Magazine have staff?
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.000]   - We have a lot of freelance.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.080]   - A lot of us are in by freelance.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.160]   We have astounding photography done by people
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.880]   who've done it for decades, and have won all kinds of awards.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.240]   But when I went to the deconferenced last week,
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.080]   I was taking photos and putting them up too,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   so they're not mutually exclusive.
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.840]   You want to have the best possible photographers doing work
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.000]   with the best possible equipment,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.560]   and people just sort of telling the story
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.560]   with whatever they have at hand at the moment.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.880]   - Well, you look at CNN, I often wonder if CNN wants
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.800]   to replace all its reporters with our reporters.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.240]   - No, CNN's really bad.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.080]   - That's a bad example, I think.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.560]   - I just have looked at watching.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.800]   - Yeah, no, that's a good point.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.160]   - But it's interesting, it's because, you know,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.080]   for years, people are saying like,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.920]   newspapers are dying out, and, you know,
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.720]   online web is gonna be the future.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.040]   And it's kind of 50/50, yes, that's true.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.320]   But also, I mean, you still need experienced reporters
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.360]   who know and understand a story.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.960]   One of the things that, I used to read the Economist a lot,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.640]   and within the past five years,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.760]   there's been a significant turnover,
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.120]   and their writers, they shifted.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:00.960]   - Really?
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.320]   - Like either a lot of them retired,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.880]   and they got on a bunch of new ones.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.040]   But, I mean, the quality of the writing is still good,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.240]   but the analysis that the Economist used to be famous for,
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.320]   at least in my personal opinion, has been lacking.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   And most of it, in case you still get back hot,
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.600]   or one of the colonists who write a really good piece,
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.200]   but overall, I mean, just the quality of the information
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.560]   isn't there that I would say it was there 10 years ago.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.720]   - Well, and it's not exactly information,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.000]   it's analysis, isn't it?
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.840]   - Yes.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.000]   - The facts, it's easy, maybe not that easy,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.120]   but it doesn't require nearly as much skill
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.200]   to gather facts as it does to analyze and present
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.440]   and argue and give people an understanding
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.560]   as opposed to just a list of facts.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.680]   - I mean, that's one thing that I think most people
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   would agree when you watch the news or you read about it.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.040]   There's very little analysis, they'll throw you out numbers,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.640]   they'll throw you out locations,
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.080]   and they'll give you a couple of sound bites
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.320]   from important people who said something.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.360]   But, you know, other than that, it just gives you kind of,
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.240]   it gives you kind of the 500 foot view of what's happening,
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.000]   but doesn't really give you a good appreciation
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.240]   of what's going on.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.760]   - And I would argue in the internet age
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.440]   that facts are a commodity at this point.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.160]   - Well, they're a total commodity.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.880]   - You can get it, it's a Google search.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.280]   - There are exceptions, if there are facts coming
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.040]   from somebody on the ground in Syria,
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.880]   that is not a commodity.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.960]   - And investigative reporting.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.920]   - But certainly, for tech stuff,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.400]   most of the facts are a commodity,
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.480]   and it's the analysis that makes her breaks a story.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.760]   - And our organization runs several worldwide
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.760]   news organizations, newspapers, magazines,
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.840]   etcetera, etcetera.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.320]   And what we found, at least in the last five years,
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   is we've been shutting down more and more of them,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.600]   because they haven't been able to shift to the new model.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.800]   We have one magazine that's run out of New York,
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.880]   was award winning for many, many years,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.200]   but the problem is they operated under the old model,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.680]   which is you had a staff of writers and investigators
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.800]   who basically would write one or two hard-hitting stories
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.840]   a month.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.400]   And now we're telling them, look,
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.680]   you gotta be filing five stories a day.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.520]   - Wow.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.120]   - And it's just numbers.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.360]   We need that much productivity out of them
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.360]   in order to make the publication stay in the black.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.440]   And we all lament the fact that, oh my gosh,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.280]   well, we can't hit as hard as we used to.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.400]   We can't investigate as much as we used to.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.120]   But unfortunately, nobody has figured out a way
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.600]   to really monetize hard-hitting news versus tweets.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.120]   - Well, and we talk about this a lot with Jeff Jarvis
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.560]   on this week in Google,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.880]   'cause he's a journalism professor,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.080]   but also a media critic.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.480]   And we need people out there gathering facts
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.600]   because we need the facts as the grist for the mill
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.800]   so that we can start to understand it.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.840]   So we do need reporting.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.400]   We especially investigative reporting.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.920]   Places like Syria, though, people on the ground
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.400]   might be doing a better job than an embedded reporter, right?
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.240]   - Certainly in some cases.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.000]   - That's what we saw in Egypt, for instance,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.600]   during the uprising.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.440]   We're gonna take a break.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.520]   Harry McCrackett is here from the technologizer,
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.760]   from Time Magazine, Roger Chang,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.040]   from Discovery and Tekzilla, my old friend,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.720]   and of course, Father Robert Ballisor,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.240]   from this week in Enterprise Tech,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.920]   and new shows coming to Twitch soon.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.440]   We're working on Right Now.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.560]   We got plans for you, Robert.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.640]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.800]   My Beloved.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.640]   (laughs)
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.840]   This is one of my favorite things,
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.480]   and it has been for more than a decade now.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.720]   I started listening to audiobooks from Audible
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.880]   in 2000 when I was commuting to the screen savers,
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.040]   and it was a two hour a day drive,
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.680]   sometimes more if traffic was bad.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.160]   And I tell you, I would have strangled somebody
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.720]   if I hadn't found Audible.com.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.560]   - I agree.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.960]   I remember transcribing a lot of your memos,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.600]   voice memos.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.040]   - Yeah, you were gonna strangle me.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.120]   For a while, I was dictating in the car.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.960]   Wasn't I?
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.800]   I forgot about that.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.640]   You had to do that?
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.480]   - Yes.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.320]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.160]   - No, no, it was--
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.640]   - And then I think we should do a show about the 386.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.480]   - Oh no.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.360]   - It's going to be important in the scheme.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.200]   What?
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.080]   - You got upset at someone who cut you off
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.920]   while you were dictating it.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.160]   - Oh, during the, you're dictating
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.880]   and you made a really lewd comment.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.960]   (laughs)
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.480]   - And you're listening and you go, "Whoa!"
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.280]   God, I forgot I used to do that.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.400]   Thank God for Audible.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.960]   You never had to transcribe anymore,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.200]   and I didn't have to yell obscenities out the window.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.240]   It was literally a lifesaver.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.040]   Now you can be an Audible listener yourself.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.520]   In fact, we've got two free books for you.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.760]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.280]   You'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.520]   That's the two book a month subscription.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.880]   By the way, with subscriptions,
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.200]   you also get either the Daily Audio,
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.640]   a bridge audio edition of the New York Times
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.760]   or the Wall Street Journal.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.720]   You get to pick, which is a great thing
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.560]   for listening to the car.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.400]   I just saw this.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   The Audis are the Audible Audible Book Awards every year.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.600]   They're not just Audible, they're all the audiobooks.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.760]   They were awarded the New York City this week
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.080]   and an interesting choice.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.640]   This was the book of the year, a classic Graham Green novel.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.520]   Actually, one of my favorite, The End of the Affair,
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.560]   but Colin Firth narrates it.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.000]   One of the things Audible's doing
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.360]   is getting these great actors to enact these.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.120]   In fact, this was an Audible production.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.160]   Let me play a little of Colin Firth.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.640]   - A story has no beginning.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.040]   - Oh, sorry, it's so loud.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   Hey, my audio's working.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:21.960]   - But you really won't choose this,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   that man can experience from--
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.440]   - I'll turn it down.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.560]   - We can look ahead.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.920]   - I say one chooses with the inaccurate pride
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.600]   of a professional writer who, when he is--
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.360]   - Wasn't he King, he was birdy?
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.200]   - He was praised for his technical--
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.080]   - But was he in the King's speech?
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.200]   - But you are, in fact, of my own will.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.080]   - I guess he's fixed the stuttering--
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   - Wet January night on the common in 1946.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.640]   - I can't wait, I cannot wait.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.880]   He's the perfect guy to narrate a Graham Green novel.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.640]   Dustin Hoffman narrates being there
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.880]   by Jersey Kuzinski.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.040]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.160]   They start articles doing these recordings
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.520]   by great performers, Jennifer Connolly
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.680]   doing the sheltering Skye, Claire Danes
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.720]   doing the Handmaid's Tale.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.280]   Now that I'm gonna listen to it
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.360]   'cause I'm a Homeland fan.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.240]   The Handmaid's Tale's a great book.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.080]   Diane Keaton slouching towards Bethlehem.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.760]   Nicole Kidman doing the Immortal Virginia Wolf
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.600]   to the Lighthouse.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.800]   These are great classics narrated
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.640]   by some of the best actors of our time.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.680]   That's just one of many reasons to go to Audible.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.720]   They've got fiction and nonfiction.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.920]   I listen to a lot of biography, a lot of history.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.520]   The challenge is gonna be picking two books,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.840]   but you've got two free books coming your way.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.400]   If you go to audible.com/twit2,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.960]   that gives you 30 days of Audible.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.640]   Your first two credits are free.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.600]   You can cancel at any time those books are yours to keep,
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.440]   but I have a feeling you're gonna wanna stick around.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.060]   Anne Hathaway reading The Wizard of Oz.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.560]   What do you think?
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.120]   I love Anne, she's my imaginary girlfriend.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.720]   I'm trying to imagine the voice reading The Wizard of Oz.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.240]   Imagine no longer, let's listen.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.400]   I'm first after press play.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.040]   We cannot be fought from the road of yellow brick now.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.280]   The mark the scarecrow is he stood beside the girl.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.720]   But we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.120]   The tin woodman was about to reply.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   I think it's a little sped up.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.520]   It's a little low growl and turning his head
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.120]   to work beautifully on hinges.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:14.960]   He saw a dame--
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.320]   I think it's something wrong with--
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.160]   I wish you'd--
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.360]   I think you're being a munchkin.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.960]   Your laptop is so overblown,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.280]   I'm trying to bring down the level.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.560]   Yeah, so it's crunchy.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.520]   Oh, that's what it is, I'm too hot.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.320]   Yeah, it's a lot.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.200]   Let me turn it down, I'll turn it down.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.120]   I'm using a new laptop.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.680]   Oh yeah, it's all the way up, let's just turn it down.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.000]   Turn it down, now let's try it.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.240]   All right, let me see how this sounds.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.480]   Inge beast, compounding over the grass towards them.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.400]   It was indeed a great yellow--
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.920]   So it's a little speed up, sped up.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.760]   And the woodman thought it was a--
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.240]   Maybe a flash, yeah, it's definitely a flash drop.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   Oh yeah, weird.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.520]   Yeah, I don't think Anne Hathaway's had like this.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.200]   Maybe she's being a munchkin, I don't know.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.240]   Maybe she had a bunch of balloons for a birthday party.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.680]   Oh, do me a favor, will you go listen, go to audible.com
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.960]   and listen to the wonderful Wizard of Oz
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.680]   and tell me if it's sped up.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.600]   Not you, the people at home, people who are not yet
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.280]   members of Audible.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.520]   In fact, while you're there, join audibleaudible.com/twit-to.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.000]   We thank them for their support, a great place.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.560]   By the way, that audiobook, $0.99
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.840]   when you buy the Kindle edition.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.280]   And then it's whisper synced.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.280]   So you can follow along.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.240]   This is a great way to get kids reading.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.680]   You give them the Kindle, and as Anne Hathaway's reading,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.120]   they see the words highlighted.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:18.720]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.360]   Isn't that cool?
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.280]   That's great.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.840]   And because of whisper sync, you can read it
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.160]   and then start listening to Audible where you picked up.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   It's synergy.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.600]   What a word.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.560]   Audible.com.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.760]   We thank them for their support.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.040]   So you were at all things D.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:36.840]   I was.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.800]   Harry McCracken, the technologizer.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   That seemed like-- was it a good year to go this year?
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.400]   You had some big names.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.000]   It's a great event.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.120]   They always have big names.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.240]   Walt Mossberg and Cara Swisher do the interviews.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.200]   They don't shy away from tough questions.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.400]   Tim Cook's appearance was kind of the keynote, wasn't it?
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.720]   It was kind of the highlight of the thing.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.160]   He's kind of the lead-off guy in the last year as well.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.120]   Lead-offs are a better word, because I think many agree
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.200]   Elon Musk was the highlight of the event.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.880]   He was good.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.280]   I mean, Tim Cook is never going to say anything fascinating,
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.440]   unless he's announcing your products, which he's not going to do.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.920]   He's not going to do it at all things D.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.800]   At all things D.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.080]   Especially in 10 days, he's going to be taking the stage on his own.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.160]   Steve Jobs could get away with no announcing things
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.120]   and still being interesting, but that's tough to do.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.080]   So I wasn't expecting him to announce anything great.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.840]   And so I wasn't surprised when he didn't--
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.200]   was treading water for the next 10 days.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.320]   It was kind of amazing, because all the tech blogs, the Virgin
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.000]   and Gadget and Gizmo, were live blogging,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.240]   as if he's going to say anything of newsworthy.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.080]   Well, I heard-- yeah, I heard he was just--
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.720]   he was like the most incredibly boring and uninteresting--
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.240]   He's a CEO.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.720]   He's a CEO, says nothing.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.720]   Why do they have him on that phone?
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.520]   I think there was some hope that he might do,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.440]   because he's in the past hinted at stuff.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.800]   Are they spike his water?
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   Nobody says something.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.400]   That's not water, Mr. Cook.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.440]   He did hint, but he hinted at the same stuff he's been hitting
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.080]   at for a while.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.880]   Nothing new.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.680]   We love TV.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.040]   There are big opportunities in TV.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.240]   And Cara pushed him and said, is there going to be a TV?
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.160]   And he wouldn't say.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.960]   No.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.640]   He said Google's glass is not mainstream.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.800]   Well, in the course not, it's $1,500.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.040]   That's not an insight.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.760]   It doesn't work with people who need corrective eyewear
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.760]   and don't use contacts.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.040]   Like the people at this table.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.000]   And he did say, though, that Apple's very interested
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.080]   in the space, but didn't say that they're
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.200]   doing anything in the space.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.720]   As he has sat in the room, and he has--
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.400]   Was there anything-- I mean, you're sitting there,
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.680]   you're looking at him.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   Was there anything?
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.200]   No.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.440]   It was sort of-- yeah, he was repeating stuff he's sad,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.240]   because he does have lots of stuff to talk about,
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.400]   but not at that event.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.760]   The first question is from Walt was about the stock,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.640]   and then Cara says, or can we start with taxes?
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.480]   Walt says, is Apple in trouble?
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.320]   Tim Cook says, no.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.080]   And then they move on.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.800]   It's just-- yeah.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.440]   So nothing to say.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.840]   June 10 isn't so far away.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.680]   It's a week from tomorrow.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.000]   That's the WWDC.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   There's some things we are pretty sure we know.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.200]   iOS 7 will be at least shown, if not--
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.000]   if they don't give us a ship date.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.440]   New version of OS 10, too, I think.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.200]   They said they would say something about that.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.680]   Yeah, they'll always have some details.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.000]   What kind of animal is it?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.840]   What cat?
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.680]   It's got to be a big cat, right?
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.520]   Then they use them all already?
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.120]   I think they ran out.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.440]   Because Cougar is a mountain lion.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.240]   Yes.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.080]   Is a-- they're like-- so--
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.720]   Well, the big cats are like the tiger.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.280]   They already did that.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280]   They got a tiger.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.280]   Cheetah.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.120]   That was one of their pre-buildings.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.720]   I thought there was something else, maybe.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.240]   They'll move on the canines.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.080]   Right.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.440]   The Bernard, the C. Bernard.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.000]   The Mastiff.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.040]   The OS 10 Mastiff.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.600]   That sounds rather imposing.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.040]   I was rooting for Lyke.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.280]   Ocelots aren't big cats.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.320]   They're actually-- ocelots aren't
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.360]   any bigger than a house cat.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.360]   Chatroom thinks Koon Cat, Tabby.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.080]   Caracle, those are medium-sized cats.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.560]   That's like a bobcat size.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.480]   I'd like to see them move to house cats.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.800]   Mac OS 10 Maru.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.680]   That's good.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.880]   In the box.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.320]   Garfield.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.640]   Grumpy Cat.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.480]   OS 10 Grumpy Cat.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.240]   No.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.880]   Well, anyway, we will see an OS 10 10.9.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.760]   We don't know what it'll be.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.560]   Apple's got to be looking a little bit at Microsoft saying,
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.480]   gee, that thing about moving the desktop to a tablet
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.960]   didn't work so well for Microsoft.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.880]   There's the Grumpy Cat.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.960]   Thank you, chat.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.520]   It's OS 10 FU.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.840]   Aw, Grumpy Cat.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.560]   Do you think Apple might retrench a little bit?
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.040]   They've been moving in the direction of making OS 10,
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.400]   the desktop operating system, more
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.400]   like their iOS portable operating system.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.920]   Full-screen apps.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.000]   But then Microsoft's Metro didn't go over so well.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.200]   So maybe--
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.400]   You know, it depends.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.960]   I mean, if they introduce a new and iMac with a touchscreen.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.160]   Oh, do you think they will?
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.960]   I think there's a real debate about that.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.560]   We talk about that on Macbreak Weekly all the time.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   I like touch.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.360]   It needs to be an option because if you're
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   going to put this OS on a machine that
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.200]   doesn't have a touchscreen interface,
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.760]   that metaphor is kind of clunky.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.960]   Like, I have Windows 8 and I immediately ditch it
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.000]   as soon as I get into it because it doesn't work for me.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.400]   It's very frustrating.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.360]   But if you're essentially going to start
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.320]   rolling out machines that support it in some fashion,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   I don't know.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.080]   It's-- I don't know if that actually
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.760]   works in a desktop environment.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.640]   I mean, if you look at how well Windows touch screen
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.400]   machines are selling, I don't--
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.800]   How well are they selling?
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.040]   Not well, as far as I can tell.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.680]   I think the industry is still trying
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.880]   to convince Windows 8, even people who are excited about
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.520]   Windows 8 that they want a Windows 8 touch machine.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.520]   But I would like to see Apple do as kind of the opposite.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.240]   I would like them to see them take iOS and put it on a laptop
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.840]   of some sort.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.560]   You know, some people are making noises about Android laptops.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.200]   I saw some manufacturer doing an Android laptop.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.560]   That's kind of an intriguing idea.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.920]   Instead of trying to take a desktop OS
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.120]   and make it more mobile, just take your mobile OS.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.880]   Yeah, I mean, Android and iOS are already
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.760]   designed to work well with touch.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.360]   It's way easier to give something that already
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.600]   works well with touch, a physical keyboard,
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.720]   than to go the other way around.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.640]   This is why, I mean--
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:41.360]   HP, HP's making this Slatebook X2, which is an Android laptop.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.600]   HP is doing Android laptops that look quite a bit
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.440]   like their Windows UltraBooks.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.040]   But it's very natural touch.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.200]   People who use Android are going to be fairly comfortable
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:51.920]   with it.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.120]   Is it as functional as a desktop OS?
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.440]   Can you do as much?
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   Well, the issue with Android and then
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.800]   Easter thing larger than a phone is not enough apps that
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.280]   take advantage of a large screen well.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.480]   Well, we saw that when the first Android tablets came out.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.760]   There was just a dearth of apps.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.560]   Although it's been a while now.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   And I think there--
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.080]   It's better.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.480]   And obviously--
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.080]   It's much better.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.280]   You can do a great battery life on an Android laptop
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.000]   easier than you can with Windows right now.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.440]   Because it's ARM.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.320]   Has well, will change that.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.400]   You should see Windows laptops with much better
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:22.800]   battery life coming up shortly.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.320]   Right.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.160]   Has that came up--
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   I like the approach of--
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.000]   Go ahead.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.640]   I like to approach it from a different angle.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.000]   And that is--
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.160]   if you look at what touch adds to a desktop,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.600]   if you're trying to sell a touch desktop,
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.520]   it's actually a hard sell.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   It's even a harder sell than selling a touch laptop.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.880]   And I use a touch laptop.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.440]   I enjoy it.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.040]   I actually find myself reaching up to the screen just naturally.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.880]   You and I use the same one, the Acer S7.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.440]   Exactly.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.160]   Yes, seven.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.000]   But I don't think that's how you should be looking at it.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.120]   You're not selling a touch desktop.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.440]   You're selling a desktop that has touch enabled.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.480]   It does add another dimension.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.200]   And I think eventually we will get to the point
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.800]   where you're just going to expect everything to have touch.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.400]   I have seen my nieces and my nephews and my cousins
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   who are all younger moving to a desktop after having
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.920]   worked on an iPad or an Android tablet, basically
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.160]   their entire young lives.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.920]   And then beating frustrated, I see them reaching up
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.960]   to the screen and it doesn't do anything.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.520]   So I think there is that to be said about touch,
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.120]   which is it's not going to be a super selling feature,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.520]   but it's going to be expected.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.720]   It's going to be like the ability to do 3D in TVs.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.560]   Most of us aren't going to buy a TV because it does 3D.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.840]   It's just going to be baked in because, well, why not?
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.080]   That's the cost of doing business.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.000]   It is an option.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.720]   I have a mouse.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.480]   I have a trackpad.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.600]   I have a keyboard and I could touch the screen.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.920]   And I notice with touch devices that I
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   will do some combination of all of them.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.440]   Depending on how I feel, I might tap a button.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.840]   I tend to forget, actually, on the Acer.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.080]   I tend to forget I have touch.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.200]   I think part of it is when you got to a GUI desktop,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.880]   the mouse was the addition to your keyboard.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.760]   With touch, I mean--
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.440]   Isn't it more natural than a mouse, though?
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.920]   It's more interesting.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.840]   It is, but when I have a traditional laptop,
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.200]   my first inclination is to go with it.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.840]   I actually-- what's the Lenovo Yoga,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.520]   where you can convert it into--
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.120]   and you put in the little tent mode,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.200]   where you can touch the screen.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.800]   It works a lot better that way than if you actually
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.960]   have the keyboard on front.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.640]   And you're using as Windows RT or Windows 8.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.600]   So it makes more sense.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.280]   And I think part of it is the man machine interface
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   physically--
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.800]   This is the bet that Microsoft made
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.360]   was that computing is moving to tablets.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.120]   And that's why-- I mean, I think that's
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.280]   why they made Windows 8.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.800]   So tablet-centric, so touch-centric.
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.240]   You get the feeling they don't think desktop computing
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.280]   as much as it does.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.640]   But at the same time, they're trying to bridge--
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.560]   They have to bridge it.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.400]   They have to bridge it.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.320]   And the thing, unlike OS 10, Windows
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.560]   has this huge legacy footprint.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.720]   You have literally millions upon millions of users
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.480]   who still run a traditional desktop.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.600]   Some of them still have a CRT.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   You need to--
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.040]   You need to-- you need to--
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.480]   You need to-- you need--
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.440]   Is that louder back still using that CRT or--
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.160]   My dad.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.480]   But it's one of those things.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.080]   When you're a company with a smaller footprint,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.200]   you can be a lot more nimble.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.960]   But if you have to carry all these other people with you
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.840]   with all their legacy devices, you can't be as well.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.680]   I'm going to just cut you off right here.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.160]   You know, everyone just uses Windows 7,
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.360]   and then everyone else with a touch screen.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.240]   I have to say, the reaction 8.1, it felt like Pete.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.240]   They were doing that.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.440]   This is it.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.320]   It's our way or the highway.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.680]   They didn't really listen to people.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.040]   It's funny.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.760]   Steven Sonofsky, who was later severed from Microsoft--
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.320]   we don't know how exactly.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.240]   The guy behind Windows 8 was also at all things,
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.320]   D talking.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.440]   And it was a little snide.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.400]   First of all, he said, I'm using an HTC One phone,
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.000]   not a Windows phone.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.760]   And he tweeted something that was very delphic.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.440]   He said, something like, you have
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.920]   to listen to users, but not too much.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.360]   I mean, Steve Jobs said something very similar.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.240]   It's like most people don't know what they want.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.800]   Well, and this is a subject we've talked about a lot on Windows
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.080]   Weekly.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.760]   I think Steve Jobs poisoned the water
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.160]   because he did so well at Apple, not listening to users
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.800]   saying our way or the highway that companies now
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.960]   like Microsoft and Google are saying, well, gee,
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.720]   that works for Steve.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.760]   Maybe we should try that.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.120]   Let's stop listening.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.080]   And then you get Windows 8.1, and everybody's pissed.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.520]   Do you use it and like it?
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.440]   I use Windows 8, and I actually don't like the tablet interface.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.040]   Unless I'm on a device like the Lenovo Yoga that supports it
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.200]   out of the box.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.960]   And it's one of those things where I think the kind of device
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.280]   you use will dictate the kind of interface you prefer to use.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.800]   I mean, remember when they used to cram keyboards
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.160]   onto the smartphone and you had to pop them out,
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.120]   the side cake, or whatever.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.000]   They worked real well and worked well for the BlackBerry.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   But as soon as you could get more screen real estate
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.680]   and then have a functional virtual keyboard, everyone's looking
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.320]   at it, I don't really need a keyboard.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.720]   This predictive text typing, correcting my typos as I go along,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.120]   works just as well as a physical keyboard.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.920]   And so I think part of it is maybe we just
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.280]   lose the keyboard at some point.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.800]   I would prefer to lose a mouse.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.960]   Maybe not though.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.360]   Keyboard is 19th century, isn't it?
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.560]   But we're getting to the point where it doesn't really matter.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.200]   This was actually the biggest thing I took from the Xbox
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:26.800]   one announcement.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.280]   And that was that you had stripped down Windows 8
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.960]   for the media side and a game operating system both running
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.200]   in VMs.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.040]   Microsoft has really been pushing VDI virtual desktop
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:44.120]   infrastructure, which is an easy way to say that is the ability
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.200]   to take anything.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.960]   Your Windows desktop, your OS 10 desktop, put it up in the cloud
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.680]   and bringing it up on any screen, any device.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.280]   It doesn't matter.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.920]   It could be your laptop, your desktop, your tablet, your phone.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.520]   That's what most of the larger manufacturers are pushing to.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:05.080]   They want this ecosystem where you can work the way you want
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.160]   on the device that you want.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.840]   And you don't really have to worry about moving from one
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.400]   format to another.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.800]   If you want to work with a keyboard,
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.160]   fine.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.200]   If you want to-- if you find working with a touch screen,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.160]   you can do that.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.280]   And you can be using all the same products,
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.160]   all the same programs, the same desktop that you're
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.000]   used to at work, at home, et cetera.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.040]   That's a different way of looking at touch,
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.840]   non-touch, one format or another format.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.200]   Now you're just looking at the screen.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.680]   What about things like the Leap and others,
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.920]   non-standard interfaces?
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.600]   Is there something there that might take over?
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.760]   The Leap-- the Leap--
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.280]   the Leap is a little thing you put in front of the keyboard.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.560]   And then now you can do Tom Cruise style.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.400]   Minority report.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.840]   Minority report gestures.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.280]   You know, and that's the thing is it sounds really--
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.440]   I mean, I looked at it and I've actually never tested it out
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.000]   in person.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.920]   But I mean, the think behind it's really cool
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.840]   in that you can just kind of touch the air.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.000]   But after a while, I mean, having
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.640]   you use the weed in every other kind of weird gesture device,
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.080]   you can't-- the arms kind of get tired
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.160]   and you just want to put the stuff on something and type.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:12.600]   I know it's--
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.080]   Your mouse kind of work.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.320]   And that's why people are so reluctant to move.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.400]   Because yeah, I can be up there and I
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.640]   can go through my aerobic routine while I'm typing.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.080]   But after a while, have you ever tried
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.400]   to keep up your arms up for any long length of time?
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.520]   It's like a minute.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.600]   It's hard.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.480]   It gets fatiguing.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.120]   Anyone-- the amount of typing you do in a day, do it,
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.840]   and do it in the air and see how long you would last.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.040]   Versus, hey, let me put my palms on the top of my computer
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.280]   keyboard and I can type.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.440]   It's--
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.240]   So are you going to buy a leap motion?
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.560]   They're not too expensive.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.360]   No, it's pretty cheap.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.480]   And HP will be building it into systems.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.040]   Oh, will they?
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.880]   One of the cooler things--
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   HP is really being a little innovative in a long for the place.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.920]   One of the cooler things that D was this company called
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.680]   at the Air Labs.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.360]   They have 3D glasses.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.960]   So you can see 3D images.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.680]   You can also see what's around you.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.960]   It runs Android.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.200]   And it also essentially has connector leap type technology
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200]   built in.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.520]   So you can see something on these glasses.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.720]   And then gesture in front of you.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.840]   So you can touch things, which are part of the augmented
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.800]   reality view.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.880]   So it's like Tony Stark reaching in in Ironman.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.320]   Doesn't he?
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.520]   It's interesting.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:34.040]   I'm wondering how much of this is just because we've
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.960]   relied so much on a QWERTY keyboard layout.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.200]   It's essentially carry over from the typewriter.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.240]   It is carry over from typewriter.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.320]   What if you do what stenographers do?
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.920]   I actually had a class with a classmate who she was deaf.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.600]   And they had a stenographer for her to take notes.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.840]   And one of the things you notice is that they make do with a
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.520]   much smaller keyboard set.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:59.600]   But they can still type out full paragraphs.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.360]   Maybe that's a good thing.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.960]   It's a deep learning curve, but they're a lot faster.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.040]   They're a lot faster.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:06.240]   The fewer keys that you need to press, and would actually
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.320]   lend itself, I think, a lot more than--
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.960]   Well, what that shows you is there are better ways in the
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.280]   mouse and the keyboard.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.200]   But we are so entrenched with the mouse and the keyboard
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.880]   that it's going to take something unusual to convince
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.560]   people to change.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.640]   And I think it's got to be easy to use, because we know
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.200]   that you could be 10 times faster if you use a stenography
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.560]   machine.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.640]   We know that.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.800]   People do it all the time, but it's just hard to learn.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.280]   Who learns it?
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.400]   Nobody.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:32.720]   Except--
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.960]   Stenogrzka.
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.800]   Court reporters.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.840]   I want to talk more about D in just a second.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.000]   Love having you here, Robert Ballaser.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.720]   When are you moving?
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.480]   I start my move at the start of August, as soon as I get
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.160]   back from Rio.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.480]   From where?
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.080]   Rio de Janeiro and Brazil.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.360]   And why are you going to Rio?
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.920]   We've got this big event.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.280]   It's a church thing.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.480]   We've got 5 million students from around the world that come
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.440]   into go see the new Pope.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.360]   Wow.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.000]   Oh, you're going with the Pope?
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.680]   Now, are you going with the Pope or are you going to see the
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.160]   Pope?
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.520]   Are you writing in the Pope or feel?
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.480]   More with and see.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.160]   It's work time for me.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.400]   Have you met the new Pope?
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.600]   I know you knew Benedict pretty well.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.920]   You'd have a beer together.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.760]   We were close.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.880]   But have you met Francis yet?
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.520]   I have.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.640]   He's a very good man, very humble man.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.160]   And he's funny.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.320]   He's got a great sense of humor.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.840]   I have to say, I kind of admire what I've heard about him.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.440]   He doesn't live in the fancy papal apartments.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.720]   He lives in a little apartment for visiting priests at the Vatican.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.720]   And he was kind of right on.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.560]   I was talking about the 1% and the 99%.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.040]   I mean, I think this guy is kind of interesting.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.000]   He's interesting.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.960]   And he's got a lot of people--
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.480]   I probably shouldn't say this, but I'm going to.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.520]   He's got a lot of people in the Vatican really scared
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.080]   because it sounds like he's actually
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.200]   going to be cleaning house.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.200]   Uh-oh.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:01.080]   He doesn't want the old stigma of the church
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.360]   to be hanging open them.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.560]   I think that's not a bad thing.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.080]   That should happen every once in a while.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.440]   It's for any organization.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.120]   And an organization that's several centuries old--
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.480]   how old is the Catholic Church?
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.560]   A couple of thousand years?
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.320]   What is it?
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:15.880]   What do you mean by that?
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.320]   When are you read at the beginning?
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.400]   From St. Peter?
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.320]   Or--
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.800]   The official word is, the church has been around since time
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.160]   immemorial.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.240]   That means I don't know.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.760]   I can't remember.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.160]   All right.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:29.560]   Anyway, it's great to have you, Robert.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.360]   He's going to be a little closer.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.680]   So we're going to see a lot more of him
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.920]   at the brick house, and I couldn't be happier
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.520]   about that Roger Chang also here.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.760]   And from the Technologizer blog and Time magazine--
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.080]   what's called Techland, right?
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.280]   What is that with the--
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.320]   officially, it's not--
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.800]   Time Tech is the official name of the Tech section.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.480]   But if you look at our Twitter account,
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.520]   that's still Techland.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.440]   And around the shop, we call it Techland, too.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:53.800]   All right.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.560]   That's the over--
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.760]   that was the overarching name for all our tech coverage.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.520]   Mr. Techland.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.240]   Technologizer is my stuff.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.920]   Tom Merritt has been--
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.680]   we do this great show Monday through Friday,
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.760]   if you like Tech News, where you can keep up on the latest.
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.360]   In fact, we're thinking of doing--
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.960]   and I'd love to get some input on this-- maybe an evening
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.920]   kind of update as well.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.200]   So Tom starts the day with TNT Tech News today every morning,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.280]   10 AM Pacific.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.600]   It's kind of not morning if you're not
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.240]   in the West Coast, on the East Coast,
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.680]   about 1 in the afternoon, 1,800 UTC.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.840]   And they do all the news.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   And then we're thinking maybe we should
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.560]   do a little wrap up at the end of the day.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.840]   Just a quickie.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.600]   Anyway, I'd love to know what you think about that.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.040]   Let's see what Tom's going to be covering in the week ahead.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.540]   Tom?
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.040]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.920]   Here's a look at some of the things
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.960]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.800]   Monday, June 3rd, we're expecting Mo Jang's scrolls.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.120]   The only news from the Minecraft creator
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.040]   to release in open beta.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.320]   Tuesday, June 4th kicks off Computex in Taipei.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.080]   Big day, Wednesday, June 5th.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.200]   Tivo yanks its free version of its PC software.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.520]   HTC One and BlackBerry Q10 launching on T-Mobile USA.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.920]   L'Oeob London kicks off.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.600]   YouTube's One channel becomes the standard.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.480]   And augmented world expo is taking place
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.040]   in Santa Clara, California.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.360]   Thursday, June 6th, the BlackBerry Q10 comes to Verizon.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.720]   Google Mibo Bar becomes inactive, such a sad day.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.440]   Microsoft is launching as your cloud computing services
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.200]   in China.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.560]   And inside social apps happens in San Francisco.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:24.400]   Friday, June 7th, one event only Microsoft's surface pro
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.040]   tablet that 256 gigabyte that comes with office,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.960]   launches in Japan.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.280]   And that's a look at the week ahead.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.680]   Back to you, Liam.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.120]   I'm sorry, I launched the scrolls trailer.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:34.760]   I wanted to see.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.400]   It's a card game.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.280]   Are you excited, Jeff?
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.360]   Because you're a big Minecraft.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.240]   I am.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.120]   So yeah, this is behind the guise of Minecraft.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.360]   It's a card game.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.040]   It's like an online trading card game.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.600]   Oh, it's an online card game.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.920]   So you could play with friends, and you have your own board,
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.600]   and you collect your own deck.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.920]   And--
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.440]   You pick a chew in it?
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.680]   And I don't think so.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.880]   Because I'm not playing if there's no Pikachu.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.800]   But there may be the thing that's hanging out behind Father
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:04.520]   Robert on there.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.000]   I don't know.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.560]   Oh, no.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.280]   Nabbas.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:07.800]   The nabbas.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.920]   I'm actually not incredibly sure what this thing--
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.080]   Yeah, I'm just going to keep this on the show.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:12.640]   That's creepy.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.880]   Stop it.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.640]   I'm actually not--
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.040]   You're not--
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.880]   Not sure what is going to be in the video game.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.560]   They haven't really announced what it's going to be.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:23.880]   And it looks like chess meets card game.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.840]   Like magic, the gathering a little bit.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.400]   And you get to gather cards and your deck builds over time.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.800]   And so it looks like magic.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.160]   So this is really interesting.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.000]   Because Natch is kind of--
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.760]   I mean, everybody agrees that Minecraft was
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.400]   this brilliant inspiration that came out of left field.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.120]   I mean, who thought that all the kids
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.720]   would be wanting to play eight-bit graphic games?
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.880]   And it's huge.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.000]   How many copies of Minecraft is he so?
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.760]   I think 10 million.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.560]   I think of something like 25 million
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:54.880]   if you count all the versions.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.200]   Right.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:56.280]   It's like what?
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:56.880]   $20?
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.480]   Not 10 million for the PC version.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.280]   Right.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.080]   God.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.440]   Quick question.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.080]   Is this a card game that they turned into a video game?
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.880]   Or is it starting out as a video game card game?
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.120]   It's all video.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:08.880]   I think it's starting to--
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   Wow.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   Sweet, generous.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.280]   Are you saying it's like a magic
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.240]   the gathering that got pulled over?
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:14.760]   Right.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.200]   Like Pokemon became a video game.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.840]   Magic became a video game.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.040]   No.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.200]   This is pure--
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:19.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.800]   I'm so rich in all about left card trading elements.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.120]   I think this guy is amazing.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.600]   We got to get Natch in.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.280]   Right.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:25.800]   So it's funny.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.760]   We were at E3 two years ago.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.680]   And I'm walking around in a guy with a beard and a hat.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.320]   Walked by.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.120]   We got a camera crew.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.240]   We're talking.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.160]   And I saw him, but I didn't think about it.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.960]   And the chat room's going crazy.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.040]   Natch.
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.720]   It's Natch.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:40.560]   It's just--
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.720]   And then we went in search of Natch, and we never found him.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.920]   That was for the PlayStation Vita announcement.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.360]   He just walked right by us.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.040]   And so yeah.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.880]   So this is statistic, which is just--
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.160]   is always going as 10 million people--
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.000]   But that's only the PC version.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.520]   It's just a game.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.960]   It's only the PC version.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.120]   And they've sold more on the mobile pocket edition
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.200]   and even more on the Xbox edition.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   Right.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.840]   I know this figure only because in last week's issue of Time
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.720]   Magazine, I have a feature on Minecraft.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:08.920]   It's pretty amazing phenomena.
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.520]   For which I went to Stockholm and visited--
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.080]   Oh, did you?
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.200]   --and talked to Natch?
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.840]   Oh, gosh.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.760]   How was that?
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.320]   Fun.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.600]   Are you a Minecraft player?
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.840]   You know, I did not know a whole lot about Minecraft
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.000]   before I started working on this story.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.720]   And it was fun to do something where I kind of learned
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.720]   from the ground up and got to go to Stockholm.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.680]   And I've met a lot.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.960]   I've met and talked to a lot of Minecraft players
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.720]   for the story, but I met even more people who have kids who
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.200]   are deeply into it with us.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:37.700]   Yes.
[00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.320]   So if you don't play Minecraft, there's
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.680]   a pretty good chance you have younger people in your family
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.480]   who do.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.400]   And it's so much more than just a game.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:48.120]   There are all these educational implications.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.400]   The United Nations is using it to help plan places that
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.840]   need improvement.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.960]   Like in Nairobi, they're trying to rebuild
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.720]   parks that are really dilapidated.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.600]   And they're using Minecraft.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.760]   And then they'll say, yeah.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.040]   Did you know that, Chad?
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.240]   I mean, Chad--
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.560]   Sorry, hosts are a Minecraft show.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.120]   I'm Gcraft.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:06.680]   Right.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.320]   And so I mean, it's so simple because editing the game
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.200]   is part of the game.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.960]   So it's not difficult, which was a brilliant, inspired move.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.520]   Right.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.760]   It's not difficult to give people the tools
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.000]   so that they can make the game their own.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.720]   And so this makes perfect, because I actually
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.720]   haven't heard of this specific story.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.880]   But I mean, also--
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.320]   I mean, there's hardware design built
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.200]   into the internal wiring system within Minecraft.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.160]   I mean, kids are learning and the orgates.
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.360]   Oh, no, I've seen kids do calculators in Minecraft.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.440]   They're computers.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.040]   It's amazing.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.000]   They're building hardware memory cells
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.560]   to keep their binary memory in check.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.080]   So good.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.000]   So we shouldn't worry about the future generation.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.920]   They're deploying Minecraft and learning.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.240]   And then, Dr. Skrull, even the Mojang guys
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.600]   are not trying to build up too much excitement
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.240]   for their future games, because they know it's
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.880]   going to be really hard to do.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.520]   Two, three, four, five games.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.000]   It's hard.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.880]   That if anything like the impact Minecraft has.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:05.000]   So is it a Mojang effort or is it not doing his next thing?
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.600]   I mean, is it the whole company behind it?
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   Skrulls.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   Skrulls is not Nachos game.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.960]   He's working on something called "10 to the C."
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.840]   Oh, that's what he's doing.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.160]   Because I remember hearing he was doing his own thing.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.040]   That is not just a thing.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.480]   And it sounds like it's going to be quite a while
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.160]   before that's out.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.120]   But he has been releasing teasers.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:21.160]   It's an amazing story.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.160]   Right.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:22.760]   There it is.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.280]   And there's been rumors that he's completely redone everything
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.920]   that is kind of on this website that he wasn't really
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.480]   super excited about how--
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.400]   there's an end-- but how things were shaping up.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.960]   Yeah, he told me he was sort of having a creative crisis
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.920]   and was trying to go over at--
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.800]   That's good.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.320]   Right.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.520]   You don't want it to be easy.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:42.840]   No.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.080]   And it just be another Minecraft.
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:45.120]   No.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.520]   All right, very good.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.160]   Tell me about Elon Musk at D. Because boy, I hear a lot of people
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.240]   say this is Tony Stark in Iron Man
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.080]   is kind of based on Elon Musk.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.600]   This is our real life Elon Musk.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.560]   He's launched a rocket.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.120]   He's built the Tesla.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.080]   He's talking about the Hyperloop.
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:02.800]   Yes.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.960]   What's the Hyperloop?
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.280]   Well, it's an Hyperloop.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.280]   Hyperloop.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.960]   Well, it's a way to get between Los Angeles and San Francisco
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.440]   in 30 minutes, supposedly.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.680]   We're building a train that'll do it in an hour and a half
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.840]   or two hours.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.760]   He says, just forget that.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.240]   Actually, the train's probably going to take through
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:17.760]   or longer.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.640]   And it's going to take a lot of money to--
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.360]   Remain everything around by the time it's--
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.880]   --he actually did it.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.320]   Yeah, Musk is great.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:24.520]   I mean--
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.080]   How does the loop work, though?
[00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.160]   He said that he wants to get more attention for Tesla stuff
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:30.600]   right now.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.080]   And when he's done with that, he will tell us what the deal is.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.880]   I imagine it's going to be a lot like a pneumatic tube,
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.160]   like the old pen.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.120]   And you get in the little-- no, you get in the little--
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.840]   You want to be the first person in that thing.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.720]   Really, the only thing you need to work out is the amount--
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.560]   Acceleration.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.080]   Acceleration.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.640]   Oh, well, GSA-- Acceleration.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.960]   And deceleration.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:51.720]   That's why it takes so long.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.880]   The middle part, you don't have to worry.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.280]   So--
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.720]   So they're going to accelerate a little slowly
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.040]   and decelerate a little slowly,
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.080]   so you don't turn into gray goo.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.720]   Hey, you wouldn't turn into gray goo.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.280]   Yes, you would.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.840]   You slam your head against the back of the--
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.760]   You'd be bruised.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.000]   Bruised.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.120]   You'd be bruised a lot.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.280]   You'd be a tomato.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.160]   If you Google around, there's an old theory
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.640]   that it would be possible to build an underground tube
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.480]   between the west coast and the east coast.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.920]   It would let you travel between them in 20 minutes.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.840]   And maybe the hyper-elope is based on some of these notions.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.680]   But how many other tech CEOs would
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.960]   even dream of doing this stuff?
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.400]   That's what I think that's why we admire him, right?
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.560]   That he's like nudge in some ways.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.560]   That he's really out of left field.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.000]   Didn't they have that in the remake of Total Recall?
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.440]   I think they called it the fall.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.520]   Well, it was used in the number of science fiction--
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.480]   They fell through the middle of the earth
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.960]   from northern hemisphere to southern hemisphere.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.160]   Yeah, there's a bunch of moons into it.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.720]   Conveniently ignoring the fact that there's
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.320]   a molten core in the middle.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.200]   That would melt anything that you went through.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.240]   But in the core, it's the mantle.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.440]   You'd be burned alive.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.360]   Well, yeah.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.400]   So the hyper-loop, apparently the technology already exists.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.320]   It's just basically superconducting electromagnets.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.240]   And put you in the vacuum.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.600]   Bullet and send you off.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.760]   I want it.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.000]   You would have to do it in the vacuum.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.120]   Otherwise, just the air friction alone
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.360]   would suck up all your power.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.400]   And you have to build a tunnel.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.000]   I mean, you're not doing it above ground.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.400]   We get the channel machine over here and just let it go.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.840]   It's the tunnel that's the hardest part,
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.480]   especially in the seismic--
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.000]   Right.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.760]   --actively seismic area like California.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.920]   Yeah, you don't really want to go right
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.400]   through the San Andreas fault.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:41.520]   VHST, a very high speed transporter travel, is this the notion here?
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.320]   Wow.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.720]   I remember when I was in grade school,
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.240]   and they said we were on the cusp of discovering materials
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.400]   that could give us room temperature superconducting material.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.120]   And here we are, what, 30 years later?
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.240]   And you're still trying to find room temperature superconducting
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:56.880]   material.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.440]   Right.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.160]   Hey, it's good there's dreamers in the world.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.520]   I was just thinking that in this discussion of input,
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.480]   new input forms, there's been some thought
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.840]   that maybe innovation is dead or plateaued
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.160]   a little bit in the tech industry.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.240]   But I don't know if that's true.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:10.960]   There seems to be--
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.680]   Look at Google Glass, look at the leap motion.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.080]   I mean, there's some innovation happening.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:21.040]   I think there's a false belief that advancement
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:25.440]   comes at a gradual, consistent pace when really what happens
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.000]   is it comes out in short.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.160]   Discognitities, spurts.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.640]   And so perhaps we're in that kind of low period--
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.160]   In between.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.280]   --over the next one.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.960]   So it's just that people assume
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.440]   evolution is a very slow gradual--
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.480]   We're in the refractory period, refractory period,
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.880]   between spurts.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.920]   Got to wait for the next spurts.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.240]   Next time, you know, it's fine.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.080]   Takes five minutes.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.040]   Last of the next one.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.320]   We'll be back with more in just a moment.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.240]   Our great panel here.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.200]   It's a show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.480]   who do a great product called GoToMyPC
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.000]   that anybody who works at an office
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.480]   is going to want to use because it really
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.520]   frees you from the chains that bind you
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.440]   to the office computer.
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.560]   Everything that you need is often
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:06.200]   at the office computer, corporate email, your OLAP cubes,
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.440]   your applications.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:12.600]   With GoToMyPC, you can be at work anywhere via your iPhone,
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.560]   your iPad, your Android device.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.880]   It's easy to install.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.480]   You don't need IT support.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.560]   Use is natural versatile so you don't have to punch security
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.880]   holes in the firewall.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.560]   And once you've installed it on-- in fact,
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.640]   you can do it right-- why don't you do it?
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.080]   If you're at work, do it right now.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.320]   Just go to visit the website.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.600]   Go to myPC.com, click the orange, try it free button.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.520]   Use the promo code to it.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.280]   You'll get 30 days free.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.120]   Then get the free apps for your tablet.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.440]   Your phone.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.280]   And then just leave work.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.920]   And then send your boss a note saying,
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.480]   I'm working really hard.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.760]   Please don't bother me.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.520]   And you could be like at the golf course or at home
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.600]   or in the pool or in a hotel anywhere.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.000]   Go to myPC goes with you wherever you go.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.960]   You could do anything you could do at your office computer,
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.720]   including sending receive email, run any program, access
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:00.520]   any network resource.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.480]   Try it today.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.640]   Orange button right there.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.960]   See it says, try it free.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.040]   But please, if you would do me a favor,
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.120]   type in the promo code TWIT.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.840]   So they know that you heard about it on this week in tech.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:17.160]   Go to myPC offer code.
[00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:17.680]   Twit.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.480]   What else-- anything else at all things D that you noted,
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.160]   you remarked upon?
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.240]   Motorola had a surprisingly good session.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.560]   Motorola.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.680]   They mentioned the X phone, didn't they?
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.720]   They talked about it in a fair amount of detail
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.480]   and about some of the sensors it will have
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:35.280]   and the fact that they're going to assemble it in Texas.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:35.760]   Good.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.480]   They talked about some crazy stuff like tattoos you can use
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.120]   instead of a password or instead of a fingerprint scan
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.520]   or even a vitamin you can eat, which turns your entire body
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.440]   into a system you can use to--
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.280]   What?
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.560]   Is that real or is it just--
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.280]   According to them, Motorola has not created this stuff,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.160]   but this stuff exists.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:04.280]   And Motorola is supposed to kind of walled off from Google
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.160]   so they have no advantages over other Android companies.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.640]   Yeah, Google has to say that so that no key and everybody else
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.960]   won't get upset or whoever it is.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.920]   But apparently they have in charge with Dreaming Big
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.640]   and their market share is so tiny with phones right now.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.040]   They don't know a lot to lose.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.200]   So when will the X be available?
[00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:22.880]   Do they say that?
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.120]   Next few months.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.400]   Soon.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.480]   I think by November.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.960]   That's another area that's growing great guns.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.360]   I mean, the Galaxy S4-- what is that?
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.720]   What are you doing?
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.640]   Is that your belt buff?
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.080]   I'm going to find the RFID tag that I swallowed.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.480]   I'm not pretty sure it's going to stand there.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.440]   What if it's not something you swallow?
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.400]   What if it's not the supposed to do it?
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.480]   Oh, it has to go in one end or the other.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.280]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.920]   All I know is it's something you want out of your body very quick.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.680]   You swallow this pill.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:55.520]   You swallow the pill.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.480]   And then what happens?
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.280]   You glow.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.240]   Basically, I'm not clearing all the details.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.000]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.240]   I think you can sign in by touching something your entire body.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.800]   This sounds like it needs more research.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.360]   That's like the worst--
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.280]   Well, they gave one of these vitamins to all MOSPER.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.640]   Walt MOSPER gave one?
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.480]   Yeah, but he looked at it.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   But he's also 80.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.080]   So he won't have any negative effects on him within any--
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:23.160]   Why don't we give him the pill and then put him in the loop?
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:26.480]   The person in charge of new projects
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:29.840]   that Motorola was formerly the head of DARPA.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.640]   Wow.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.680]   So she comes with a pretty impressive time on the stuff.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.760]   This is what-- if I were Larry Page and I had more money
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.560]   than God, it's exactly what I would have done with Motorola.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.600]   Said, don't tell us.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.920]   We don't want to know.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:43.960]   Here's a billion dollars.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.840]   Just make something really, really great.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.160]   That sounds like what they've been charged with.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.520]   That's kind of what they said.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.760]   They can be patient.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.440]   They don't have to rush.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.640]   And we'll see.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.720]   I mean, it's a lot easier to talk about this stuff
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:57.960]   than to actually do it.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.920]   Is this why Google did not announce a new Nexus phone at I/O?
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.320]   In fact, all they've really said is, well,
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.080]   we're going to make a Galaxy S4 and an HTC One that
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.480]   is pure Google experience.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.560]   We're not even going to make it.
[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.640]   We're going to sell it.
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.520]   Well, soon they're pitch high.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:15.000]   It was also a D. And he said they will do more Nexus products.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.200]   They're doing the Nexus on--
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:18.640]   Will they make them or will they--
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.920]   I assume it'll be like Nexus has been in the past
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.080]   where they pick a partner.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.840]   Somebody else makes it.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.880]   And Google's in charge of the software.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.000]   But it does seem like a somewhat fuzzy distinction between that
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.960]   and a Galaxy S4 and HTC One with the pure Google experience.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.840]   But supposedly, the Nexus devices
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.680]   will push the limits of hardware.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.960]   It'll be made at the FlexTronics plan in Fort Worth.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.120]   They once made Nokia phones there.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.320]   Assembles might be a better word than they made.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.520]   The phone will be designed, engineered, and assembled
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.200]   in the US, but not all the components
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.640]   will be made in the US.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.240]   Processor and screen will be made elsewhere, of course.
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.400]   Wow, that sounds like it might be worth waiting to find out
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.920]   what they're going to do.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:00.640]   That's cool.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.960]   I came away a little bit more hopeful about Motorola
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.120]   than I had been.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.320]   They have not had great phones.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.040]   In fact, Google's CFO even said that.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.480]   There's nothing going on at Motorola
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.560]   that we were really excited about.
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.440]   But I think he didn't finish that sentence,
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.400]   but that there's going to be.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.720]   Nothing we've seen before we acquired them.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.800]   Pretty exciting.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:19.800]   Pretty exciting.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.640]   Google says they're going to put Google Play music,
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:24.920]   and they're all access streaming on iOS in the next few weeks.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.800]   They needed to do that.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.480]   It's a pretty compelling platform.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.800]   I kind of like it.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.680]   It just makes us wonder, where is Apple?
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.440]   Where's their Apple iRadio?
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:35.920]   They've been talking-- everybody's been talking about it.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.280]   So I'll be interesting.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.600]   I mean, suddenly, what's the space
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.320]   that Apple used to have almost exclusively to itself
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.280]   is getting really crowded.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.760]   In every respect.
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.360]   Every respect.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.560]   I'm really curious to know how--
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.360]   What can they do?
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.000]   Especially after post-jobs.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.400]   I mean, this is kind of the litmus test.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.320]   This is it right now.
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.720]   The pressure's on.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.040]   I mean, to be fair, it's crowded with services,
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:04.000]   which either are successful and losing a fortune,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.400]   or not all that successful.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.360]   There hasn't been a breakout hit, which has been good both
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.960]   at getting customers and figuring out
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.440]   the business model for subscription.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.600]   One thing Google did that I really like,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:23.640]   and unfortunately, they seem to have lost in court,
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.760]   is fight the FBI.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.120]   The FBI has sent Google--
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:34.360]   Well, it's an interesting story because it's all been--
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.960]   What do they call that when you can't speak?
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.920]   Oh, it's been--
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.520]   They're all-- so here's the deal.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.400]   Gagged.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.720]   Gagged order.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.320]   The national security letters-- something
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.240]   actually has been around since before the Patriot Act,
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.480]   but the Patriot Act really strengthened them.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.320]   They've been used for some time.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:06.840]   They were originally used by the FBI as a way to do
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.120]   investigations on foreign espionage, basically.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.600]   They sent a national security letter
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.120]   to demand for data, but it's confidential.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.720]   You can't talk about it if you get an NSL.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.360]   Since the Patriot Act, since 9/11,
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.240]   there's been a huge increase in the use of NSLs,
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.640]   and not just an espionage.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:28.600]   According to the inspector general,
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.240]   the FBI made 50,000 requests in 2006 alone, 50,000 NSLs
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.560]   in 2006 alone, and almost all of them,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.800]   97% had mandatory gag orders.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.960]   That means you can't even say you got one.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.640]   Now, so that's why we're not sure.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.840]   But apparently, it's Google that said, no,
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.360]   we're not going to give you the information
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.360]   and took it to court.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.560]   They followed a lawsuit in April 22nd,
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:01.120]   and a judge this week told Google, no,
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.880]   you got to hand over the data.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.760]   Now, what's interesting is it's more complicated
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.000]   than all of this, because apparently the Ninth Circuit is
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.280]   reviewing the constitutionality of NSLs in general.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.160]   And so apparently, the judge didn't want to make a decision
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:23.160]   that would in some way impinge on that ongoing thing.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.360]   But according to the AP, Google has to comply with the FBI,
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:29.800]   handing over data about a customer or customers,
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.840]   including who the customer is, their address,
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.480]   personal information in response to a national security
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:35.800]   letter.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.680]   You can't say no.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.560]   Google was fighting it on First Amendment grounds.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.440]   A little disappointed.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:48.240]   Google contested the constitutionality.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.160]   So the real-- the bottom line at this point is, without warrant,
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.000]   there's no court or oversight.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   The feds can ask for information from Google.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.440]   They have to hand it over.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.240]   And they can't tell you that they did.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.200]   They're gagged.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.280]   - It's hard to touch the information.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.840]   I was a little unclear about this.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.040]   So sorry.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.320]   Is this within the framework of the 1986 Computer Security
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.160]   Act?
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.000]   - No.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.560]   - No, so this is a whole other level.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.240]   We don't have to wait 90 days.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   We just want it now.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.800]   - And there's no FISA court involved.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.080]   There's no oversight at all.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.960]   And there's no warrant.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.440]   And the fear is, of course, that the FBI will use this not
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:30.640]   judiciously, but use it as a phishing expedition,
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.560]   trying to find illegal activity.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.800]   And the fact that they filed 50,000 of these in one year
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.920]   in 2006 is kind of in a little bit of an indicator
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.280]   that maybe that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.720]   - I think the lack of any kind of judicial oversight
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.320]   is kind of the most worrying aspect.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.160]   - Yes.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.560]   - You know, ideally you would think that you would put
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.840]   some sort of restraint on it.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.840]   I mean, even with the whole AP DOJ,
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   I mean, they did get a warrant for that information.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.120]   - Get the email records of the AP reporters
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.040]   and try to track down these leaks.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.440]   - I mean, granted it's cold comfort,
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.400]   but it's still in a way a lot better.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.760]   - Hey, if you got to get a warrant,
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.880]   that's a lot better than just saying,
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.200]   hey, give me that information, Google.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.760]   And by the way, don't mention this.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.560]   It's just between you and me.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.560]   - It's a little too behind the wall.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:25.040]   - There's a lot of question marks because of the gag order.
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.600]   We don't know what kind of information
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.960]   the government was trying to get.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.920]   We don't know who the government was trying
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.720]   to get information on or if there was one or many.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.480]   In fact, it wasn't until recently we even knew it was Google.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.920]   The proceedings are closed to the public.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.840]   - So, I mean, what's the fallout?
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.560]   Would you say that this would encourage companies
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.320]   to not base in the US, even if they do provide--
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.400]   - Well, let me ask Padre this
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.240]   because you cover enterprise technology.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.040]   Is there some concern about using cloud storage
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.920]   in the US because of this?
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.760]   - Absolutely.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.400]   I mean, this has been a recurring theme
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.320]   on this weekend enterprise tech.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.040]   We've, Brian Chie is a cloud expert.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:08.680]   I mean, he's been writing books since its inception.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.520]   And what we were trying to make people realize
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.680]   is they need to write to the representative
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:18.080]   because if you delegate, denigrate the security,
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.440]   the supposed security of information in the cloud,
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.320]   if you allow governments to seize it,
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.280]   if you allow governments to take servers,
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.880]   if you allow them to take shortcuts
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.680]   around due process for seizure of information,
[01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.680]   it kills a multi-trillion dollar industry in its infancy.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.880]   There is no enterprise on this planet
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.800]   that is being responsible about its data
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.680]   that is going to put its information in a place
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.080]   that could be subject to any court ruling
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.760]   about whether or not the government can peak
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.080]   on a phishing expedition.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.480]   I mean, because remember what you're talking about is
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.400]   you're not talking about a federal agent
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   coming to a court and saying,
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.640]   "We think X company did something illegal.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.320]   "We wanna look at this."
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.080]   It's a letter saying,
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.560]   "We think there's something going wrong at this ISP.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.800]   "We'd like to be able to look at all their users."
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.760]   That's, there's so many things that are wrong with that.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.880]   That it drives the enterprise into getting away from the cloud,
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.440]   putting everything back on premise where I can control it.
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.960]   If you wanna get into my data,
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:13.480]   you have to get into my server room,
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.480]   which is all my property, so I wanna see a warrant.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.360]   Thank you very much.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.520]   That's a really good point.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.200]   Are the protections stronger for stuff that you house
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.040]   in your own environment?
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.160]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.320]   One of the cases that came up not too long ago
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.880]   was during the mega case with Kim.com.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.800]   And in order to get around not having a warrant
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.880]   for individual users,
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.120]   the federal government tried to make the argument
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.920]   that they weren't seizing data, they were seizing servers.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.760]   Right.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.760]   And the data just happened to be on it.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.760]   Just happens to have data on it.
[01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.440]   It just happens to have data.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.520]   If you try to do that in the United States,
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.600]   so I have a business in the United States,
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.120]   the States and San Francisco,
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.680]   if you wanna come on my premise,
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:59.560]   get into my server closet and confiscate a server,
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.320]   I get to see a warrant before I let you take one step
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.160]   on my property.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.640]   That's the law.
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.680]   It's just that because it's now in the cloud
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.680]   and my data could be shared with other people
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.720]   on the server that I don't really control or own,
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.360]   that the federal government can now step in and say,
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.360]   well, we weren't really looking for your information.
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.880]   But look at what we found.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.680]   But looky here.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.280]   That's very depressing.
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.440]   And I think it's unfortunate.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.720]   But there is some hope
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.680]   and we'll watch with interest with the Ninth Circuit does.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.400]   There's some indication that they probably will, in fact,
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.200]   rule these NSLs unconstitutional.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:40.960]   I guess the bottom line for me is you should really,
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.800]   you know, there's so many people worried about Google,
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.360]   Microsoft and Yahoo now.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.520]   It's really the,
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.120]   I'm a little more worried about what the government wants to know
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:49.880]   than all of that.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.840]   That's good to see Google push back.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.880]   And I'm really thrilled to see them push back.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.520]   Absolutely.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.760]   Crypting, crypting, crypt.
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.240]   Trust no one.
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.320]   Google does say they don't want to get in trouble.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.840]   They're not going to prove any glass applications
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:09.360]   that have face recognition until there are protections in place.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.200]   I don't know what that means.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.840]   Maybe some sort of system where you give permission
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.160]   for me to recognize you.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.760]   Perhaps some sort of legal protection
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.760]   so they can never be seen more like that.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.360]   I want face recognition.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.720]   That to me is one of the one of the great values
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.080]   of augmented reality,
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.840]   the idea that I can be looking through glasses
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.440]   like straight out of Daniel Suarez's Damon.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.920]   I can be looking through glass and I can say,
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.840]   Oh, you're Roger.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.680]   I remember you.
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.600]   I worked with you at tech TV and.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.240]   Why'd you have to look down?
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.040]   Right.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.560]   See now I can look at my eyebrow and find that.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.720]   Are you stirring off the space?
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.400]   What?
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.560]   They're worried, I think a little bit about,
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.480]   of course, lawsuits.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.040]   They're worried about stalking.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.600]   Stocking is the creepiest.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.120]   Yeah, privacy invasions.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:51.760]   And so.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.720]   Hey, what's the name?
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.160]   What's that girl's name over there?
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.080]   So I mean, the problem with Google Glass
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.000]   is it's on your face the entire time
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.920]   unless you make the active effort to take it off.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.960]   It's not like a phone where,
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.200]   say you're sitting down and you're eating at a restaurant.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.360]   But that's what I like about it.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.680]   It's not, it's not surreptitious.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.680]   People know you're doing it.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.480]   You could surreptitiously look at your phone.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.040]   I've been doing that all day.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.440]   Except you have to turn it on.
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:19.520]   Like kids, like kids think that we don't know
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.720]   that they're texting when they sit at the table
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.960]   with their hands in their lap
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.720]   and there's this motion going on
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.720]   "Henry, what are you doing?
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.080]   Nothing, you're texting, aren't you?"
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.920]   No, no, no, I'm not.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920]   Hold on.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.920]   Period.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:35.760]   Period.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.120]   There is a serious side of this though.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.280]   There is, that is back to the reasonable expectation
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.400]   of privacy.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.200]   Do you have the reasonable expectation of privacy
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.320]   if you're in the public?
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.160]   You're in public.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.600]   If you're in public, someone walks by you,
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.160]   was wearing Google Glass and it happens
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.120]   to face recognize you.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.680]   It doesn't seem to me that you can make a complaint
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.520]   against that.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.720]   If you're in public, they could have done that.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.280]   It would have taken longer if they didn't have glass,
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.320]   but they could have done it if they really wanted to.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.240]   I think a lot of it has to do with the fact
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.960]   that traditionally when you've dealt with people in that manner,
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.440]   people don't have a perfect memory.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.480]   So if they see, it's like, no, they may not remember
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.240]   because you have a mustache or your hair's a little different.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.080]   Now, if you had the same issue with someone who had
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.720]   perfect total recall, they could remember every,
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.800]   I mean, there are people with visibility
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.120]   that could remember every instance
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   at any point in their life and recall it like
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.480]   it was just a second ago.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.280]   And everyone had that, but it would be kind of freaky
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.120]   because people would know who you are,
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:36.720]   even if you were, what, eight or nine and 30 years later.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:38.760]   I think that's part of it is just now that people have
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.560]   this ability to kind of cross-referencing
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.160]   with this immense database that's--
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.760]   Scobel says he put a G+ post up on this.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.400]   He said, you know, you don't need face recognition,
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.480]   you need fact recognition.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.280]   So I, you know, it's not so much your name
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.240]   that I need to find out.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.640]   It's the ability to go, who the hell is Roger Chang
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.800]   and have that in my glass?
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.920]   So it's actually the information that's valuable.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.160]   And he says, you know, getting somebody's name
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.640]   is not the hard part.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.760]   It's then being able to look up the stuff that's so valuable.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.400]   - Be great for door-to-door salesman
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.440]   if they're still around.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:12.280]   - Yeah.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.200]   - Is the lady of the house home?
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.000]   Oh, I happen to know you're not the lady of the house.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.840]   You're the man of the house.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.440]   - Well, you know, this is one of the more troubling things.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.920]   If you could cross-reference, okay,
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.480]   I know this person live here.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.440]   They're single.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.640]   They work at these hours.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.080]   I know their house is empty.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.400]   - Yeah.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.800]   - Well, just get a better lock.
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.120]   - All right.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.960]   - We played with a product at Interop this last year.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.800]   It was just a project that a bunch of us geeks
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.960]   were putting together.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.840]   And it was a set of glasses that actually had a bunch
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.480]   of miniature LEDs built into them,
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.880]   broadcasting on a non-visible spectrum.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.360]   If you tried to point a CCD or a CMOS sensor
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.960]   you could make that.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960]   Colleen was gonna make that for me.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.640]   So I could walk around and blind cameras.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.200]   Yeah, it's non-visible to humans, but it blinds cameras.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.120]   - I see that as being the next growth industry.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.120]   That's the next big picture.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:05.960]   - That's actually a good idea.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.120]   - A Google Glass Blinder.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.360]   An anti-Google Glass pair of glasses.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.200]   - Yeah.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.040]   You know what?
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040]   That's really,
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.280]   'cause Jennifer never wanted to walk in the studio.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.840]   She never wanted to have a picture taken of herself.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.840]   So we were gonna make a little collar
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:19.080]   that she could wear,
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.880]   that she would just be a blob when she came in
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.960]   and there'd just be this bright light
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.160]   that comes in the studio.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.000]   - It's an angel.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   - It was an idea Colleen had.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:25.880]   We never really,
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.120]   never worked out the details,
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.360]   but that I think was a good idea.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.600]   Yeah, it's an angel.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.080]   It's a white light.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.280]   - It's like those RFID blocking wallets
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.160]   that they sell on TV.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.200]   - Those work.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.680]   - Just put foil around it.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.520]   - Yeah.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.520]   - Just put make you have a metal wallet.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.680]   Google is now putting calorie information in its search.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.200]   So you can...
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.240]   - So next time I swing by in and out.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.080]   - Yeah.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.760]   - Tell me how many calories I don't need.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.760]   I wonder if I just type Kale, one cop.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.080]   Is it, is it, now see it's not,
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.880]   I guess it's part of the knowledge graph,
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880]   but it's not there yet.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.280]   Although if you just do a search,
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.640]   you're gonna get that information.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.480]   What's that?
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:04.440]   - A calories of the food.
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.560]   I thought it was how many calories
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.760]   I'm burning by searching.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.920]   (laughing)
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.880]   - Let me just put in double, double animal style.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.880]   - Oh, don't tell me that.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.160]   Don't tell me that I love those.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.320]   - No, those are good, aren't they?
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.680]   That's why you're moving out here really,
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.880]   is for double doubles.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.120]   - Yeah, animal style.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:19.960]   - I miss them.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.080]   - Oh, see now I'm getting pictures
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.560]   and it's just making me hungry.
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.480]   (screaming)
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.120]   Oh, here's the in and out secret menu.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.920]   Do you know about that?
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.840]   - Well, double, double animal style,
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.400]   no spread protein style, which is absolutely--
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.240]   - Yeah, that's what I--
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.080]   - That's what I--
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.400]   - Yeah, it's lettuce instead of a,
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.440]   but do you know you can also say chopped chilies
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.440]   and they'll add yellow chilies
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.080]   to the bottom of your burger?
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.240]   - Yes.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.640]   - That's what you do the four by four?
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.480]   - What's four by four?
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.320]   - Four, four, four--
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.160]   - Four patties.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.000]   - Four patties.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:49.840]   - That's disgusting.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.400]   - I heard they stopped anything above four by four.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.840]   So they'll do three by three, four by four,
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.200]   but they won't do the bigger ones.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.040]   - It's because--
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:56.880]   - It just got to two or three.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.320]   - People are ordering 12 by 12.
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.160]   - Yeah.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.480]   - It's like how do you pack that?
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.480]   (laughing)
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.640]   - Yeah.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.920]   - M by C refers to a burger with very number of meat patties,
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.400]   M by slices of cheese, C.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.200]   It's a math problem.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.640]   - See, that's the new thing,
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.160]   is to kind of have that,
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.160]   you have your standardize meant offering
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.920]   and then you have that only hip kids can find it.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.960]   Here is a picture of a 20 by 20, if you ever wanted to know.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:22.800]   (laughing)
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.640]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.560]   (laughing)
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.880]   - That guy must have humongous fingers.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.800]   - Can I tell you a very bad thing about myself
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.080]   that's making me hungry.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.040]   All right, looks good.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.320]   - You know, that's the thing about American cheese.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.160]   - Oh, there you go.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.680]   You search for something that lettuce calories,
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.040]   there's the knowledge graph.
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.520]   But look at that, that's pretty good.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.360]   - 53.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.480]   - That's really nice.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.760]   Google's really giving me the information.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.840]   - Do a double double double. - But nobody searches
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.040]   for lettuce, they search for double doubles.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:50.880]   - Yeah.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.720]   - Nobody ever searches for,
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.760]   oh, how many calories in lettuce?
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.440]   None, very little.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.640]   - Yeah, there's no calories in lettuce,
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.880]   you can't digest it, why would there be any calories?
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.000]   - See, you're getting, I'm not getting it.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.440]   You must be in some sort of special program.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.280]   - That's pretty low for me.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.520]   - Are you signed into your apps account?
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.920]   - No, I'm signing my regular account.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.760]   - Even if you do, like hand-showing.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.520]   - You search for hamburger calories.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.080]   - Yeah, 250 for that, that seems unusually low.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.680]   - That's not a double double, I'll tell you that right now.
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.240]   - Double patty.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.880]   - That's like a hamburger from the 19th.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.320]   - Like they got a drop down, they got a quantity.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.560]   Yeah, that's before super size.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.200]   - Little drawing of a burger.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.840]   - That's probably a slider.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.440]   - Chad, I don't have that, I'm so jealous.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.280]   - Sorry.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.560]   - You must be on some special list.
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.400]   - Perhaps.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.040]   - You must be on the Weight Watchers list.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.520]   - I would love to have that.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.360]   - Or deal with me.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.080]   - So far, only a thousand items in there,
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.520]   but presumably more is to come.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.280]   Let's see if you have it.
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.120]   - Although I'm on a very bad--
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:44.960]   - That's a good idea.
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.800]   - That's not gonna happen.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.720]   - That's not gonna even, no.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.560]   - Nope.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.760]   - Nope, but I'm on Chrome, I don't understand it.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.800]   - For me, I can't seem to search a name brand,
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.080]   so I couldn't search Cheetos.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.520]   - See, the great tab name brand.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.640]   - Right, or Doritos.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.240]   - Will it do sushi?
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.080]   - Let me find out.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.240]   - The next thing is the camera sees what you're eating
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.920]   and just tells you.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.760]   - So be like--
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.600]   - By the way.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.400]   - Do you like your spouse, nag you?
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.240]   - It does not do sushi.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.720]   - Not that actually would be awesome.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.800]   If Google Glass could tell me how many calories
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.360]   are on the plate before me,
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.200]   I would feel better as I eat it all.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.720]   - That's more valuable than face recognition.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.080]   - We'd also have to keep an accurate record of your diet
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.240]   for length of time to figure out why you're not eating it.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.280]   - You know, the new Samsung Galaxy S4
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.160]   has a health companion that was always monitoring my steps,
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.640]   so it's like a pedometer.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.360]   And it has a place where you could log stuff,
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.200]   but you know, the camera should just recognize
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.360]   what I'm eating.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.960]   I should just leave it like hanging out a little bit.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.200]   And then just should see everything that I eat.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.040]   Then that would be useful.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.320]   - Someone in chat mentioned the Happy Fork,
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.600]   which I reviewed, it's the fork which--
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.400]   - Yes, that's the silliest thing ever.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.240]   - Slowly.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.240]   - You and everybody else reviewed that.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.160]   You know, there was the smartest thing that,
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.480]   I don't know who the PR company was,
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.600]   but they put them in, Robert did it too.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.800]   They put it in the front of the CES,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.160]   the opening day Sunday thing--
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.400]   - CES unveiled. - Unveiled.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.840]   There was nothing else worth covering.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.680]   - See everything.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.680]   - They got like 20 minutes from every major,
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.560]   from Time Magazine, from Twitter, ABC, NBC, CBS.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.520]   It's a stupid vibrating fork.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:17.600]   - All right, sorry.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.760]   Do you think the Happy Fork is gonna change the world?
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.000]   - You know, I used it for one meal like six weeks ago,
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.800]   and I'm still eating more slowly with normal forks,
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.400]   so it's possible you don't need to--
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.720]   - It gives you half-time-- - Half-dicks on that.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.520]   - Half-dicks on that. - feedback while you're eating.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.720]   They are selling it now.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:36.160]   Oh, it's a Kickstarter now.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   - I can't try it. - They're on Kickstarter.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.160]   - I tried it.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.640]   That's not shoving until later this year.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.360]   I just kept eating with the vibrations.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:45.200]   I just, I learned to like the vibration on my teeth.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.720]   So I think the next person needs to actually shock me.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.400]   - It should be the happy prod.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.720]   - I was when you eat something that can't even have fork--
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.400]   - I can see that thing being hacked in so many ways.
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.000]   (laughing)
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.240]   - All right, let's take a break.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.680]   When we come back, I wanna talk a little bit about Haswell,
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:05.160]   Xbox One, and anything else that's on your mind,
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.960]   good panel for that from "Twiant,"
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.920]   this week in Enterprise Tech,
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.800]   Father Robert Ballaser from Tekzilla,
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:14.720]   and revision three, my friend, Roger Chang,
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.120]   and from "Tech Land," the Technologizer,
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.560]   Time Magazine's Harry McCracken.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:21.120]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.520]   This is actually a good time.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.040]   I think this month is gonna be a good month for new products.
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.720]   So you should go look at Gazelle.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.360]   In fact, this could be your Sunday project
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.640]   as you're listening to the show.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.840]   Just Gazelle, everything in that drawer,
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.720]   you know that gadget drawer you have
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:35.240]   with all the wires coming out of it,
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.440]   or the closets, I mean, we'll have a closet.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.960]   Full of old gadgets, maybe like the Vorac,
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.360]   you have a room above a gas station filled with old crap.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.640]   You can get some money for that.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:49.480]   Maybe a lot of money at gazelle.com.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.880]   iPhones, cell phones from a variety of manufacturers.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.120]   They're now taking tablets from not just Apple,
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.880]   but Amazon, Asus, Google, Microsoft,
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   even Surface RT, you know, Surface Pro,
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.760]   Samsung, Macbooks, Macs, iPods.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.960]   Go over to Gazelle, you want that new iPod touch
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.920]   that just came out?
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.280]   I bet you do.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.640]   Let's see how much your old iPod touch is worth.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.120]   That's a 32 gig fifth generation iPod touch
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.780]   in flawless condition.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:20.720]   In graving or personalization, no,
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.920]   I was too cheap to buy that.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.560]   107 bucks, that's great.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.520]   I mean, that thing I've had for a while.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.960]   So here's the deal, go to Gazelle,
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.160]   and these quotes are good for 30 days.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.880]   iPhone 4S 200 bucks, right there.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.000]   That's a new phone right there for you.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.920]   They're good for 30 days, so you can get the quotes.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.560]   It's not an obligation to sell it to them.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.200]   It's just, you know, you're gonna get the price.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.360]   When you decide you wanna buy, you wanna sell,
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.560]   click the box, they'll send you a postage paid box.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.880]   They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.800]   You send it back to them, they turn it around very quickly.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.200]   Their data experts will wipe the data off too,
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.320]   so you don't have to do that.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.080]   They'll even, I've seen this happen time and time again,
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.360]   up your offer, if they say, you know,
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360]   this is in actually better shape than you said.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.440]   So we're gonna give you more money.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.920]   And then they will send you a check.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:07.880]   You can, if you're in a hurry and get a PayPal credit,
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.520]   or even, and I like this, the Amazon gift card,
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.480]   that's a good choice if you buy a lot of stuff on Amazon,
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.800]   because they bump the value 5% on Amazon.
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.800]   So that is a great way to get rid of all these old gadgets,
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.880]   so you have some cash in your pocket to buy the new stuff.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.040]   New stuff is coming, we know that much.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:26.320]   And I know another thing,
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.120]   your gadgets not getting any more valuable.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.360]   I hate to tell you.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.000]   So get the price now, and then get the gadget,
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.720]   the new stuff next month.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:38.720]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, Gazelle.com.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:42.400]   Has well is here, Intel and Asset of Computex.
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:47.240]   It is the talk of Intel's TikTok cycle.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.560]   The tick is reducing the--
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.920]   - The die size. - The die size, the process.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.320]   They got it down to 22 nanometers.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.720]   And then the talk is improving the code in there.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:03.720]   In this case, they're moving code in for power savings,
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:07.880]   so they claim 50% better power on the Haswell chips.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.880]   They won't say Haswell, you won't hear it.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.200]   You'll see fourth generation core processor.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.680]   - But they'll still call it Core i7, Core i5.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.040]   - They won't know. - Yeah.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.160]   - They don't want you to know.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.280]   - Yeah, but you do want this if you're getting a laptop,
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.760]   'cause it's 50% battery life, mate.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.600]   Have you seen any Haswells yet, Robert?
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.240]   - I have, actually, I've got one on its way.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.120]   The brand new Acer S7 uses in Haswell.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.120]   - Oh, I hate it, damn it, I just got that.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.120]   - I know, I know, I know, I know.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.960]   It's brand-sparking new. - And I swear to,
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.120]   I swear to priest, I'm in D-W-E-Paw.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.720]   (laughing)
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:45.200]   - But you're talking about DDR4 support.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.480]   It has lower thermal dissipation requirements,
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.240]   so you don't have to run the fan nearly as long,
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.400]   so that noisy fan from the back of the S7,
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.200]   that pretty much goes away.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.320]   Lower power requirements,
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.200]   so it saves power, runs longer on a standard battery.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.040]   And one of the cool unspoken features
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.800]   is they're starting to move components
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.280]   off the motherboard, like the power regulator.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.760]   - It's in the chip. - It's in the chip, yeah.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.000]   - It's in the chip now, right?
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.200]   So it allows you to use smaller motherboards
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.600]   and more system-on-chip type designs.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.320]   - So this is worth waiting for, it seems.
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.320]   Also better graphics processing.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.680]   The onboard motherboard graphics will be,
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:24.800]   they say comparable to kind of a low-end Nvidia now.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.640]   - Right, right.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.760]   - So I think this is well worth waiting for,
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.520]   and it is, I have a feeling what Apple was waiting for.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.360]   Rumors are very strong, we'll see new MacBooks,
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.480]   some of the Ming-Chi-Quo or whatever, the analyst.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.280]   That's not her name.
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:43.280]   Anyway, said that we expect new, very thin MacBook Pro Retina.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:46.560]   It's thin enough that you almost could call them an Air.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.120]   The 13-inch in particular will be,
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.200]   as thin as it can be,
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.440]   and still have those connectors on there.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.880]   With Haswell, which means, I don't know,
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.440]   six hours, seven hours of battery life.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.840]   And there was some interesting news
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.920]   that the Mac Pros are no longer,
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.040]   they're going out of stock at some real tailors.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:07.520]   Which indicates maybe there will be a new Mac Pro issue.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.040]   - Entering up the channel.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:11.560]   - I would love to see that.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.160]   - It's been like three years, just about,
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.080]   since the last major upgrade.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:17.200]   - I did, in fact, we did it on a KnowHow episode.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.880]   I did what I could to make my old,
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.480]   my, I have the last Mac Pro that came out,
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.080]   which is almost three years old.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.840]   I put an SSD and that made a big difference,
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.600]   especially on the Express card bus.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.560]   That thing is fast.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.800]   And then I put in a more modern video card in there.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.200]   And it did make a difference, but it's still not,
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.920]   I mean, it's an older processor at this point.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.360]   - Well, it's interesting is that,
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.600]   I mean, at least from the preliminary testing
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.120]   that people have done is that,
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.560]   Intel isn't out of the gate,
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.760]   isn't focusing on performance.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.120]   They're focusing strictly on battery life and packaging.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.360]   - I think we've seen kind of almost the end of the line on,
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:56.840]   I mean, how much faster do we need a processor to be, really?
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.640]   - What's also telling that,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.640]   Intel's phasing out motherboard production,
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:05.640]   or, and so, there's the eventual talk of,
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.760]   of course, what's the new,
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.080]   what does Intel call it,
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.320]   the new processing form factor,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.040]   basically a new computer form factor
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:18.120]   that isn't based around an ATX or micro ATX.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.200]   - Oh, there's something new.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.920]   - Oh, they're developing it, and it was general.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.080]   - Do you know that what that is, Robert,
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.640]   what the new motherboard form factor is?
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.480]   - It's all new.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.480]   - And you see, NUC.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.320]   That's that right?
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.480]   - Yes.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.760]   - Was that new something something?
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.520]   - No, new unit of computing.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.800]   - A new unit of computing.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.000]   Hallelujah.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.960]   What was wrong with the older unit of computing?
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.160]   - They wanted something smaller, not so.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.480]   - You see.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.320]   - Well, I mean, if you think about it,
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.160]   what's in the, what's it?
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160]   - Ooh.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.360]   Ooh, these are cute.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.240]   - They sell them right now.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.160]   - They sell them now?
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.000]   - Yeah.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.640]   - These are, boy, they almost look like a hockey puck sized.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.880]   They look like an Apple TV, almost, or a Roku box.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.360]   - I think the idea is to get away from the legacy
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.120]   of having all these expansion slots and an oversized.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.680]   - So this might be what a Mac Pro ends up looking like
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.560]   a little bit, maybe make that an aluminum
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.320]   and have it stackable so you can,
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.080]   I mean, isn't that the idea that you would stack
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.440]   the same capabilities up on top of it?
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.720]   - Potentially, yeah.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.280]   I mean, the X-I3, the guys that were showing off the--
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.200]   - Those are cool.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.040]   Was that a nook?
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.360]   - No, but I mean, it's essentially along the same line
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.160]   where you get much like you have multiple cores
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.000]   on a die, you have multiple computing units.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.400]   On your desktop, you need more power.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.440]   You don't upgrade or replace them when you've just
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.640]   added another one.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.520]   - Maybe that's the future of the Mac Mini.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.040]   - Well, this certainly looks like a Mini.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:48.240]   Just no drive or no disk drive.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.320]   - But you could make a Pro this way too, couldn't you?
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.160]   'Cause what is the point of getting a Mac Pro?
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.360]   It's expandability.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.520]   It's the slots.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:56.360]   - In the old days, you wanted all those slots
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.920]   and drive bays and some people still do it,
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.640]   but there's not as much need for them anymore.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.840]   - If they can incorporate Thunderbolt, I mean,
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.840]   the limit is-- - Yeah, that's right.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:04.680]   That's why you solve that.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.960]   - That eliminates 85% of the expansion issue.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.200]   - That's your bus, it's basically an internal bus.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:12.040]   - It's an external-- - Basic, I think,
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.520]   a four lane PCI express.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.080]   - Yeah, really, it's four lane, wow.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.480]   - So, I mean, you can get a good deal out of that,
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.320]   especially when it comes to video editing.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.160]   - This current NUC is a third generation,
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.880]   so there will be Haswell NUCs.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.780]   - It's in point.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:30.880]   - Brian Chi, my co-host on this week in Enterprise Tech,
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.720]   has been playing with the NUCs and the form factor
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.880]   and the amount of functionality that he's been able to get
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.880]   off of them, running hypervisor VMs, is astounding.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.760]   And yet, it really is designed so that as you need more power,
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.200]   you just stack up a couple more--
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.040]   - Worth that. - And you're ready to go.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.440]   - I love that.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.120]   - And now, of course, Intel's starting to do
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.120]   the fiber optic version of Thunderbolt,
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.640]   'cause they couldn't get that working right away.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.040]   They were copper only. - They can get in cheap enough.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.320]   - So they get that-- - From what I understood.
[01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.480]   - Now you've got some, that even more speed.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.640]   And this is amazing, this always blows me away.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.160]   The tick on this, they will do Haswell chips next year
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.220]   in 14 nanometers.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.720]   We're getting close to zero nanometers.
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.880]   - That's what you, don't you come into some sort of quantum--
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.760]   - I think we're getting close to the end of Moore's Law.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:20.920]   I don't know how you can make these much smaller.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.440]   - 'Til they do. - 14 billionths
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.280]   of a meter.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.120]   Unbelievable, it's amazing.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.960]   A SUS is gonna release a 4K 30-inch display this month.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.640]   Mmm.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.880]   - And there will still be no content to run on it.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.920]   - It's not just a TV, it's also, it is a TV,
[01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.960]   but it's, in fact I saw an ad for Sony's UH TV on,
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.720]   I think it was on CNN today.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.400]   - How much did they want? - They're pushing it.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.040]   Well this is 31 inches, 3840 by 2160,
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.240]   it's a computer monitor.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.920]   140 pixels per inch.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.480]   - Been no pricing.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.720]   - Display port.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.600]   - Have you seen the Seiki?
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.920]   - The Seiki, we have seen the Seiki, that's pretty cool.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.440]   - Yeah we have one. - Brian Shroud opened one
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.920]   and I was impressed.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.880]   - Robert was, Robert Herron was testing one of the--
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.320]   - What do you think?
[01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:13.080]   - For what you paid, he paid--
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.560]   - It's a-- - 13 something, 13--
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:17.320]   - $13,000 a hike, $5K display.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.440]   - UHD display.
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:19.520]   - I was-- - TV.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.080]   - I was playing Bioshock Infinite.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.920]   Now this is the thing, at 4K,
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:27.760]   your frames per second drop below 30.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:28.600]   - Yeah you need pretty help.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.800]   - You won't go past it. - You won't go past it.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.760]   - You can't, you can't.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.080]   - Because the TV won't update.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.480]   - Oh the HDMI doesn't go that fast either.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.160]   - No the TV won't, at 4K. - The TV won't.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.680]   - I'm sorry. - Ah, that's right.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.320]   It's 30 frames per second.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   - Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:43.720]   - So, but it was, I was amazed at what you can scale up
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.320]   to 4K and it still looks great.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.320]   - Windows 8.1 will support it.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.480]   This would be another thing to look for
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.320]   in 10.9 next week from Apple.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.560]   It doesn't currently support UHD displays,
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.280]   but you will need it.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.960]   It says a triple or quad GPU
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.320]   to drive the damn thing.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:09.200]   Wow, I think, I love these super high res displays.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.320]   I just think they look fabulous.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.840]   Who's buying an Xbox One?
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.280]   - I'm gonna wait.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:17.120]   - Till?
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:17.960]   - I'm gonna wait to see--
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:18.800]   - The Xbox Two?
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.840]   - No, no, no, I'm gonna wait.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.600]   I'm gonna wait about three months after everyone
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.480]   either complains, restock.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.680]   And I find out if there are any minor issues with it.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.480]   - I saw you raise your hand, Robert, you're excited.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.480]   - I just wanna get it because I wanna see how quick I can,
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:37.760]   I can crack the bootloader and load other VMs on the thing.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.400]   - Oh, aren't you weird?
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.040]   Now-- - The enterprise thing.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.600]   - Microsoft has been, according to Polygon,
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.240]   filed a patent application that talks about
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.320]   what it could do with Connect.
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.000]   You know, and the new Connect has a 1080p camera
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.400]   watching you all the time,
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.360]   little glowing eye in your living room.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.120]   And they filed a patent that detailed how Connect
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.160]   could watch viewers make sure they're sitting through
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:04.520]   commercials and then reward them for watching them
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.000]   with achievements.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.440]   (laughing)
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:13.040]   - You watched 15 commercials this week, you get a star.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.360]   - Achievement unlocked.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.920]   - Achievement unlocked.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.920]   I think I'm, I seriously, I don't need to get
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:21.240]   a Leo shape dummy in the house.
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.880]   - Well, be interesting how it tracks.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.360]   - It can see you, it knows who you are.
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.200]   - There's a lot of research going into that.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.120]   - Other people too.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.840]   - Oh, Lord.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.280]   - It could tell how excited you are
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:35.360]   because it can actually see your heartbeat.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.120]   - Because it can actually detect the difference
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.200]   in the coloration of your skin.
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:42.840]   - So that's how it knows if you're dummy or not.
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.680]   If you don't have a heartbeat, you're not alive.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.840]   - And TV shows will still be crap.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.640]   - It can see if you're smiling.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.640]   - It knows when you're good and knows when you're bad.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.480]   - Oh boy.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.000]   - So he's on the list.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.600]   - Joysticks is my-- - Brad would talk about
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:55.720]   this on "Twiet."
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.720]   And he would say, and we were talking about how,
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.120]   wouldn't it be amazing if Microsoft actually started
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.840]   tracking information about what you look like
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.680]   as you're watching your pro--
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:04.520]   - Oh no.
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.720]   - They could tell people when you got excited.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.600]   - You just ate your fifth bag of Doritos.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.360]   - You know what this is, right?
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.920]   It's the ultimate Nielsen box.
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.760]   - Yes.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.600]   - Yeah.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.160]   - Stick, you don't even need to issue out boxes.
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.080]   You just sign up and just say, well,
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.680]   for this between this day and this day,
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:20.720]   sit in front of your TV.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:21.560]   - Oh Lord.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.480]   - We'll see what you do.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.360]   And we'll give you like 20 bucks at the end of the week.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.520]   - It also knows who you are.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.200]   It's if there are four people in the family
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.080]   that can tell who's sitting in front of it.
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.520]   - Microsoft's putting $1 billion into games.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.040]   We're gonna hear more about the games.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.520]   It's a little challenging for us
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.960]   'cause June 10th, Microsoft's holding its press conference
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.320]   at 930 Pacific in the morning.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:44.720]   Apple's Tim Cook takes a stage at 10 in the morning.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:48.240]   So I think we're gonna do coverage on Monday,
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.800]   a week from Monday, but I'm gonna have stereo.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.000]   So we'll have Tim Cook in one ear
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.840]   and Microsoft in the other ear.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.680]   - Whoa.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:57.840]   - And split screen.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:58.680]   (laughs)
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.000]   - Blue hearts and stereo.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:00.920]   (laughs)
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.760]   - I don't know.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.440]   Actually what we're gonna do is we're gonna have
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:05.480]   one of our reporters, Glen Rubenstein,
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.880]   he'll be monitoring the Microsoft announcement
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.560]   and we'll periodically check in with him.
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.840]   See who's having the better show.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:15.680]   - You should have a little poll going.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.680]   - We could.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:17.520]   That's a good idea.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520]   We could have a meter.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.640]   And if the meter tilts one way,
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:22.440]   we could switch programming over to the Microsoft side
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.960]   or vice versa.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:26.640]   Microsoft says we're gonna put $1 billion into games
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.120]   and that's what we'll see of course at E3.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.760]   Financing not only new studios
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.640]   but getting exclusives for the Xbox One.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.800]   - And they did a really poor job
[01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.000]   with the initial unveiling.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.320]   - I think that they knew.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.880]   Yeah but I think that they knew
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.640]   that this was about non-gamers.
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.800]   And then 'cause at E3 we'll talk about the games.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.600]   This was for people like me who say,
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:50.000]   "Oh the NFL and I can have my fantasy team stats
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:50.920]   on the screen."
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.920]   - I mean ultimately I mean sales will determine,
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:56.000]   you know, what was more successful?
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.320]   - You're more excited about the PS4.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.640]   - You know what, I'm kinda over both of them at this point
[01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.440]   because you know, Steam provides pretty much all the gaming.
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:07.920]   I need and my PC works fine.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:12.080]   What I am more annoyed about is that there is no carryover
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.920]   from, I can understand if 360 games don't play fine.
[01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:20.280]   But Xbox Live games that I bought, I mean the stuff.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.160]   - Yeah but they're written for the Power PC.
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:23.800]   They're not, it's a different processor.
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.320]   - Well no, they could at least give you a coupon
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:26.560]   for anyone who rewrites it.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.960]   - Oh I guess they could.
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.840]   - But Microsoft isn't competing against Sony.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.280]   And that's what a lot of people are utilizing.
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.640]   - Oh they're not?
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.680]   - They're not, it's not, the one will not compete
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.040]   with the PS4.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.240]   The hardcore gamers are gonna get both consoles.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.080]   - Right.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080]   - It's gonna be something that's possible.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:42.920]   - Or they're not gonna care.
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:43.760]   - Right.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.920]   - They're not gonna care, exactly.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.720]   What they're really competing against is Apple.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.400]   They're competing against the Apple TV.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.440]   I mean Tim Cook did make a big push at All Things D
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:55.280]   saying how they've sold 14 million Apple TVs
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.280]   and half of those were this year.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.720]   But on the other hand you have Microsoft
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.920]   who in almost the same amount of time,
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.400]   so in eight years versus seven years,
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:07.880]   will have sold 300 million Xboxes.
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.040]   They wanna keep that.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:13.160]   They don't want Apple encroaching on their set top share.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.600]   Which again, it's not really, well push or pull with Sony.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.440]   It's gonna be push or pull with the competing devices
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.720]   to get media into your TV.
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.680]   That's what that first press conference was about.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.240]   Like you said, it wasn't for gaming.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:26.320]   - I mean, I mean ultimately,
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.160]   I mean it kinda disagree with you
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.160]   because they actually are competing against each other
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.000]   as well as Apple,
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.840]   but every other kind of set top box and entertainment device.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.480]   - It's all competing for your attention.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.800]   Everything's going for your attention.
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.560]   - 'Cause they, 'cause at least so much screen time.
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:42.280]   - At least Microsoft is at the point where they know
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.760]   they're not trying to sell you a box,
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.280]   they're trying to sell you their services,
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.360]   their boxes, their gateway to get you to buy stuff.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:52.200]   And so with everyone in digital,
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.400]   they're all kind of jockeying for position
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.160]   and a way to make it the most compelling service
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:01.000]   that you will gladly subscribe to on an annual basis.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.440]   And then you zone in on whether it's games,
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.280]   whether it's TV, whether it's sports,
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.400]   whether it's one faster or another.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.240]   As long as you use their network,
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.800]   use their service and use their box, they're fine.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.320]   Whatever you do on it.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.160]   - Right.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.000]   - I think it's gonna be fascinating with the Xbox One
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.520]   to see at whatever price it ends up being.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.320]   Whether people who really don't care about games at all
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.600]   or hardly at all will buy it.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:29.280]   Because the two most successful TV boxes
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.680]   lately have been Apple TV and Roku.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:36.520]   And for those, $99 is the high end of that price range
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.720]   and unless Microsoft comes up with some really new approach
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.520]   to subsidies, the Xbox One is gonna be way more than $99.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.880]   - That's 500 bucks pretty certainly, right?
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.360]   - I would think 400 at least.
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.160]   - Yeah, well so, but there are rumors
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.800]   and this will probably be unveiled
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:55.760]   in the couple of weeks at E3
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.920]   is that they might roll in subscriptions.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:01.080]   So if you sign up for basically like you do
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.200]   with cell phones now.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:03.440]   - You get like Netflix or something.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.960]   - Yeah, you get Netflix or you get whatever,
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:08.080]   you sign up for so many years, you get a contract,
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:11.440]   you get the box at a discounted rate or subsidized rate.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:14.480]   - Well, it kinda did that with the Xbox Live subscription, right?
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:17.400]   You got a $99 Xbox but you committed to a year
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:18.400]   of Xbox Live which--
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.880]   - And then of course all consoles are almost all except
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.760]   for Nintendo or subsidized to some degree.
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:25.720]   - Actually Nintendo's subsidizing that.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:28.320]   - Now even Nintendo with the new Wii.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.600]   - Which is interesting, you look at the Wii,
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:35.520]   Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft and they're basically,
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:38.560]   they look like they're all after the same market
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.520]   but only I think Sony and Microsoft
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.000]   are kind of going after a big picture
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.400]   while Nintendo's were still a toy company.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.640]   - I just know what Nintendo's up to.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.920]   - Well, I mean the thing to understand
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.160]   is Nintendo's a toy company
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.800]   and it always will be a toy company.
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:53.440]   Sony's an electronics company
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.800]   and Microsoft is software services network company
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:01.640]   and they're all approaching how to release your wallet
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.440]   from your hand to their bank account, the quickest.
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:07.320]   - And Sony's big pitch right now as we're the company
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.560]   that cares about gamers and we're not gonna try
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.120]   to make it into a Swiss Army knife.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.200]   - No they will, of course that's the only one
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.040]   they're gonna survive.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:14.880]   - Did you see this story?
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.920]   Sony's profit center is not electronics.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:23.200]   In fact, they lose money on almost everything they sell.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.480]   You know what keeps Sony afloat?
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:27.720]   63% of their profits come from insurance
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.320]   that they sell in Japan.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:32.000]   - Well, you know, one of the Samsung's largest arms
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:33.200]   is a finance arm.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.040]   I mean, when you wanna come to--
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.160]   - But Samsung's making money in consumer electronics.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:42.160]   Sony apparently loses money in consumer electronics.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.840]   They started a life insurance venture in 1981
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:51.400]   in conjunction with Prudential and that's where--
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.720]   - And then they bought a movie studio
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.440]   and a record studio, that was a flop.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.680]   - But that's, you see, that's not unusual for conglomerate.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:38:00.160]   I mean, Ford used to have an aerospace division.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.640]   GM still has GMAC.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.120]   They finance your purchase.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:07.280]   I mean, they all get into this business.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.080]   I mean, Sears and, you know, choose any other fortune
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:13.360]   500 company, you need to diversify at some point
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:15.680]   because you just can't keep making
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:17.560]   empty number of cars and expect to grow.
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.080]   - Well, in some ways they're doing the reverse
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.000]   of diversifying.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.920]   They have one unit that's making all the money.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.840]   - Well, they definitely do have to slim down at that point.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.800]   All right, one more story then we're gonna take a break.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.680]   I thought this was from The Onion.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.560]   On Tuesday, BuzzFeed will unveil CNN, BuzzFeed,
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.560]   a YouTube channel based on content from CNN.
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.720]   I'm confused.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.080]   - I'm gonna file a takedown note.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.240]   (laughs)
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.760]   - BuzzFeed, which I thought, and I read it
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.960]   was like an internet meme engine
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:53.200]   and a place to see bikini pictures.
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:57.520]   But apparently CNN feels they're the future of news
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.280]   and the future of news is on YouTube.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:03.320]   This is an example of where media is just confused as hell.
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:07.120]   - This is an example of people kind of grasping at straws.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:09.120]   - Yeah, grasping at straws, good phrase, yes.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:12.240]   - Let me jump on the bandwagon after everyone else got off.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:15.200]   - And I think of companies like BuzzFeed saying,
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:17.640]   "Yeah, we'll take that some of that CNN money."
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:20.120]   - I don't mind what could be wrong with that.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.000]   BuzzFeed is trying to establish itself
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.520]   as a news source for 18 to 34 year olds.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:25.640]   - Oh, geez.
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:28.240]   - Who else was marketing 18 to 34 year olds?
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.800]   - Everybody wants 18 to 34 year olds.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:32.480]   It's not easy to get them 'cause they're fickle.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.720]   They're a fickle bunch.
[01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.960]   - Yeah, because you can't group them that way.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.040]   18 to 34.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:37.880]   - You're right.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:40.160]   - You might as well group people from 20 to 90.
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.000]   (laughs)
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.480]   Anyone with a pulse, you're a 24 year old.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:44.280]   - A 34 year old's very different from 18 year old.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.360]   I agree with you on that.
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.840]   - 18 year olds very different from 21 year old.
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.880]   - So it's, I don't know.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.720]   Sometimes I think people just need a round number
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.560]   or something.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:53.400]   - Right.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.560]   - Shut down.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.040]   - When we come back, I wanna talk a little bit
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.440]   about the podcast troll and some good news,
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:03.800]   but first a word from our friends at stamps.com.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.040]   And this is the place to go if you have to mail stuff.
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.960]   Now, this is not if you mail a postcard occasionally
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:10.840]   to your girlfriend in Japan.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.160]   You got one nearby, right?
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.440]   - She no longer lives in Japan.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.520]   - That's really my girlfriend.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.480]   - Okay, we broke up.
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:18.480]   So we don't need to mail those postcards anymore.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.320]   So,
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.440]   (laughs)
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:21.440]   I just made that up.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.320]   I didn't even know if you had a girlfriend in Japan.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.160]   I just made that up.
[01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.000]   - I'm just depressing.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.640]   (laughs)
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.280]   - But apparently I touched a nerve.
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.120]   - That's fine.
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:31.360]   - I'm sorry, I had no idea.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.280]   (laughs)
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.840]   But maybe you have to send out invoices
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:37.840]   or marketing material.
[01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:41.760]   Maybe you sell little voodoo figures of the girl in Japan
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.640]   on Etsy.
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.320]   Maybe you have--
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.160]   - Potentially.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.440]   - Maybe you have,
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.280]   I don't know, an Amazon or an eBay selling thing.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:53.880]   You know, you sell an old military paraphernalia
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:55.640]   and memorabilia online.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:56.760]   This is a great way to do it
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:01.400]   because it's kind of like pro mailing in your own office.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:02.560]   You don't have to go to the post office.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.720]   You don't have to use a postage meter.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.520]   You don't have to use special links.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.680]   You just use what you got.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.680]   Your computer, your printer in stamps.com,
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:10.080]   it's postage on demand.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:11.740]   You always have the right postage.
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.840]   If they've got a USB scale, you just plop it down
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.920]   so you never pay more or less than you need to.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:18.640]   You don't want to send a client a postage to invoice.
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.680]   That's a bad form.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.760]   It'll even suggest what kind of,
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.800]   what class of mail is right for different stuff.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.200]   So it really helps you.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.200]   You can print your logo along with a postage,
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.320]   along with a return address right on an envelope.
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.640]   It'll take the sender's address from your QuickBooks
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.080]   or your address book or any of those websites,
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.040]   PayPal, Etsy, Amazon, eBay.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.200]   It fills out international forms
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.040]   automatically for you.
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:42.960]   I mean, I can just go on and on.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.740]   This is a really great solution.
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:45.900]   For me, it does a lot of mailing.
[01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:47.180]   And then the mail carrier comes to you.
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.500]   You can even schedule free pick-ups.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:49.880]   So you don't even have to get up.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:51.040]   They take care of it all.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.160]   Stamps.com, you probably, if you get mailing at all,
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.460]   you're probably getting it from somebody
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:56.700]   who uses stamps.com.
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.500]   We've got a very special trial offer.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:41:59.540]   If you've got a small business,
[01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:01.500]   we've been using it for years here.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:02.660]   Don't, now you're gonna say,
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.700]   oh, that $80 offer on the front page, that's good.
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:05.540]   I'll take that.
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:06.620]   No, click the microphone.
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.900]   In the upper right-hand corner, here's a little secret path.
[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:10.580]   Type in the promo code TWIT
[01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:14.720]   and the $80 special offer goes to a $110 offer,
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.640]   $55 in free postage for the first few months of your account.
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:21.120]   You get the digital scale, the USB scale.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:24.600]   You get a supply kit and a four-week trial of stamps.com.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.400]   It really is a great deal.
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.160]   Cancel anytime the scale is yours to keep.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.880]   Stamps.com, it's the pro tip for anybody
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.480]   who does a lot of mailing.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.000]   Stamps.com, give it a try today.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.440]   So some good news, the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.960]   I think this was on Friday.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:44.960]   Decided to get involved in the save podcasting movement,
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.480]   and I wanted to mention that.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.160]   Now, a number of companies have been sued.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:53.880]   We have not by a podcast troll called
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:58.120]   Personal Audio, LLC.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.720]   Interesting story behind this company.
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:01.760]   They have patent, a recent patent,
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.960]   it's only a few years old,
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:06.200]   but it was based on a patent that came out in 1996.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.880]   And EFF believes, as I do,
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.400]   that the patent that they got in 1996 is bizarre and bogus.
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.840]   It's basically they patented the playlist.
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.880]   And so what EFF has decided to do,
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.800]   and I think this is the right attitude,
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.640]   is not to fight him in court,
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.360]   but to go to the patent and trademark office.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:25.160]   This is another defense, if you're getting involved,
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.320]   I've learned a lot about this in the last few months.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:29.280]   If you get involved in a patent case,
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.960]   you can go to the patent and trademark office
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.160]   and if you have prior art and say,
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.480]   "You know what, this was a bad patent.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.160]   "You should never have given this patent, and here's why."
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.160]   And so they have raised some money,
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:40.240]   raised quite a bit of money.
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:42.520]   They said they needed $30,000 to do this
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.920]   interpartase challenge of the patent.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.360]   In under 10 hours, they raised the $30,000.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.360]   They're now at 60,000 with 1,000 supporters.
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.720]   We put in 2,500 bucks,
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.840]   'cause it could save us a lot of money in court
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.480]   'cause if this goes through.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.760]   I encourage you to visit EFF.org.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:02.240]   If you wanna give a couple of bucks,
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.080]   help support this.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.560]   They are gathering prior art right now.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:09.760]   In fact, if you look at the website,
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.080]   there is a button that says,
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:13.440]   "Save Podcasting Prior Art,"
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:17.040]   that it goes to askpatents@patents.stackexchange.com,
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:18.400]   and they've already collected,
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.920]   I think, some very significant examples
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:24.640]   of pre-1996 playlists, audio subscriptions,
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.480]   things like that.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:28.440]   It's pretty obvious to anybody who's been in this business
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.920]   that podcasting wasn't invented in 1996,
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.040]   that it's been around for a lot longer.
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:34.960]   It's a bad patent.
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.760]   I've always thought it was a bad patent.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.880]   And a number of our friends have been sued,
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.560]   like Adam Corolla,
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:42.960]   instead of, you could fight it in court,
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.240]   but I think the best way to do this
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.680]   and save podcasting for everybody
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.280]   is to just get the patent overturned.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.000]   So help EFF do that.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.640]   I have very high hopes of this.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.240]   When I looked at the prior art, I thought,
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.480]   "Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, remember they did that?
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.560]   "Oh yeah, it's pretty obvious."
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:02.160]   It goes way back, way, way, way back.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.000]   So--
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.280]   - This case is interesting because
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:08.320]   it's not a typical patent troll.
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.400]   Most patent trolls are NPE,
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.640]   non-practicing entities that never made anything,
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.720]   never tried to make anything.
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.000]   All they did was they acquired a bunch of patents
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.880]   and then they go out and they sue people.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.840]   Personal audio actually is a failed maker.
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.440]   They tried to make a podcast device, an MP3 player.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.040]   And in the process of doing that,
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:29.600]   they filed for what is now,
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.880]   what we know is an incredibly vague patent
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:33.560]   that should not have been granted.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:35.200]   So on the one hand, yeah,
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.680]   there's absolutely a patent troll.
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:37.760]   On the other hand,
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.120]   they're not, their lineage isn't that of a patent troll.
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.760]   - Okay, I'm gonna argue with you a little bit.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.240]   So the guy in '96 who got this patent
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.000]   is supposedly part of this company,
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.720]   but that's very common with patent trolls.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.200]   You go to the original patent inventor
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.360]   and you say, "Hey."
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:54.000]   They are truly a non-practicing entity
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.040]   in the sense that they never made anything.
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:45:58.880]   And they never, and they currently are not
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:00.080]   a practicing entity.
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.600]   So you could debate what a patent troll is,
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.360]   but it's pretty clear that the companies
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.160]   that are doing this at this point
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:11.560]   are doing it to make money off of what was clearly a bad patent.
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.600]   Not trying to make money by making something,
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.760]   but trying to make money by people like us
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.600]   and other podcasters who are using something
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.440]   that's very obvious technology.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:24.680]   The Cyber Law Clinic at Harvard's Berkman Center
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:27.080]   is gonna participate in this with the EFF.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:28.560]   That encourages me.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:30.720]   You've got some pretty heavy hitters on this.
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.200]   Of course, the company is gonna say,
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:39.400]   "Well, no, we made something, but I don't think
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:40.360]   that's really the case."
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.480]   And they're going after, they say,
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.600]   "We're just going after NBC and CBS big companies."
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:48.160]   No. (laughs)
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:49.960]   They're going after everybody.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.160]   - Well, they went after Apple
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:52.520]   and they got an $8 million settlement.
[01:46:52.520 --> 01:46:53.360]   - Different patent.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.360]   - That's the war chest, right?
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.760]   - Yeah, but it was a completely different patent.
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.160]   So yeah, I've done a little research into this
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.520]   'cause I've been curious what's going on.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.120]   And I'm encouraged by it.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:03.960]   If you want to support it,
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.400]   I think the best thing to do is read more about it at EFF.org.
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:10.680]   I'm an ongoing contributor to EFF.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.840]   But I thought this was a good one to give them a little extra money.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:18.280]   We were glad to help them do that.
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.920]   I don't know how long the inter-partase process takes.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:23.480]   When we talked to our attorneys,
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:27.920]   we actually hired a very good law firm that does deal with this
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.800]   specific subject in kind of a defensive way.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.440]   They said that this is a good approach as long as it works.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:38.800]   And the patent office is a little unpredictable.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.480]   But after looking at the prior art,
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.920]   I think there's a very strong case here.
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.840]   So help the EFF.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.640]   It would help all of us and preserve
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:49.760]   what I think is a very important medium for us all.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:52.560]   Hey, if you missed anything, as an example,
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.120]   if you missed anything this week,
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.760]   this is the kind of stuff that we did
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:56.800]   that we'd like to keep doing.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.840]   Here's what you saw this week.
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:01.200]   Previously on "Twit, Map Break Weekly."
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.160]   It's not a gadget, it's jewelry.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.840]   It doesn't have to, jewelry, well, how about just a cool watch?
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.760]   A cool watch is jewelry.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.080]   (laughing)
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:13.760]   So if I go upstairs and get my Millennium Falcon wrist watch,
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:16.320]   the one that had a die-cast Millennium Falcon,
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.760]   like a pocket watch, we have to pop open the top,
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.520]   would you identify that as jewelry or as a cool watch?
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.840]   Well, that's something else,
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:25.200]   but I don't think there's a Millennium Falcon watch.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.600]   It's a cool watch.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.160]   NSFW.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.640]   Allie Gertz.

[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:32.440]   She was great.

[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.960]   It's a possibility, but I would argue it's a remote one.
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.200]   You know, neuroplasticity is real.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.720]   You know, a kid who's raised playing with Barbies
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:58.720]   is gonna have a different kind of brain
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.600]   than a kid who's raised playing exclusively with Legos
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.760]   or with video games over the iPad.
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:08.760]   But, you know, the range of neural outcomes
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.920]   is kind of limited, you know, in so far anyway.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.120]   We haven't really seen anybody who can be
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.440]   in more than one place at the same time.
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.680]   Great interview.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.280]   Broadcasting from the capital of the free world.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:21.480]   Petaluma, California.
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:22.840]   (laughing)
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.800]   Not commonly known, but it is in fact
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:25.800]   the capital of the free world.
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.160]   He was great, Douglas Russ Rushkoff,
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.080]   if you didn't see that triangulation on Wednesday.
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:30.080]   Really interesting guy.
[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.840]   We were talking about the idea that humans could adapt
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:35.280]   to this hurry up world we live in.
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:36.120]   No.
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.200]   Yeah, you don't believe that.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.040]   No.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:39.120]   No.
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:40.120]   No, everybody says no.
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.200]   (laughing)
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.000]   Must listen, every single week we do a great,
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.320]   we have so much fun with triangulation.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.640]   And thanks to the brilliant Jim Cutler, by the way,
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:49.720]   we know credit him enough.
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:51.560]   He's the voice of those promos.
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:54.240]   And he comes up with those funny tags at the end, right, Chad?
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.800]   I don't think we send them to him.
[01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:56.640]   He just says them.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:59.760]   No, he can ad lib like no one else.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.600]   So good.
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.600]   You remember Jim from a tech TV?
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:02.760]   He was the voice of tech TV.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:03.600]   Oh yeah.
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:04.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.280]   Really great guy.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:08.640]   One of the best booth announcers in America.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:11.320]   This guy does work for all the big companies.
[01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.000]   And he donates his time to do it.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.240]   Yeah, super professional too.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.120]   Jim, we love you.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.120]   Mwah.
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:17.120]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.800]   Thank you Harry McCracken, the technologizertime.com,
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:21.600]   techland.com.
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.200]   And thank you for making Twit one of the fifth.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.440]   I know you recused yourself,
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.160]   but you must have given him some money under the table
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.000]   or something.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.320]   We're happy you're happy.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.160]   Thank you Harry.
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.560]   Great to see you and Marie again.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:31.640]   Thank you, Roger Chang.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.680]   I'm sorry about the girlfriend,
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:34.600]   but I'm glad things are going well at Techzilla.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:35.440]   Yes.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:36.280]   (laughing)
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.440]   They're going fine.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:40.800]   Jolly Roger on Twitter, which you must follow.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.920]   And @jollyrodger.
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.760]   And of course, techzilla.com.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.600]   Yes.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.680]   TEKZ, I double LA.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.520]   Oh, you say Z.
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:53.520]   I say Z because I feel it's more clear that way.
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:55.360]   Also, thanks to Father Robert Ballisor.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.320]   We'll be moving out here soon.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.160]   Every noon on Monday, he's here 3 p.m. Eastern time, 1800.
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.680]   I'm sorry, 2000 UTC.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:05.280]   He's here to do this weekend enterprise tech,
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.120]   which is a great show.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.000]   We love it.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.400]   We're working on a programming show,
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:09.720]   computer programming show with Robert.
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:11.640]   I can't wait.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:14.640]   Robert's going to teach Shannon Morris how to program.
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.480]   Oh, nice.
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:16.400]   Is that awesome?
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.240]   Yup for that, Robert?
[01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:18.160]   There's a lot of stuff in the tube.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:19.000]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:19.840]   All right.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.240]   The next couple of months is going to be amazing.
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.240]   I can't wait.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:23.480]   We're very excited.
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.320]   I gave lots of fun.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.560]   I gave lots of programming in college.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.560]   Well, this will be good for you.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.160]   We're going to do different units every eight weeks,
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:30.000]   a new unit, no new programming language.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.960]   Took two years of, no two semesters of C#.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:36.040]   I, well, no wonder.
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:36.880]   What?
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:37.720]   That's a time--
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.560]   That's not a good starting language.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:39.400]   It's a good language.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.800]   It's a great language, but not a good language to start with.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:44.360]   No, maybe C would have been better even at C#.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360]   What are you going to start?
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360]   What's your first line?
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.360]   Were you going to do Python?
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.360]   We're probably going to do Python.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:49.360]   I'm lobbying for Python.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:56.080]   I've got an expert in Python who is willing to come into the studio and do some great demonstrations
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.080]   with us.
[01:51:57.080 --> 01:51:58.080]   I'm a opinion.
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.720]   Python is a great starter at first language.
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:00.720]   Oh, it is.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:02.720]   It is.
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:03.720 --> 01:52:04.720]   We thought about Java for a while.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:05.720]   No.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.720]   I veto.
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.720]   No, I loathe Java.
[01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:08.720]   I veto that.
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:09.720]   I said, we are not.
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.720]   You know, my kids high school, that's the programming language.
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:11.720]   They teach it.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:12.720]   I think it's true in a lot of high schools.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:13.800]   It's like, no.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:15.800]   It's a very bad thing to start with, I think.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.760]   You eventually you'll need to learn it.
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.200]   Lots of people hate Python too, apparently.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:22.000]   I'm seeing the chat room go crazy.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000]   So, thank you, Robert.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000]   Thank you, Harry.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000]   Thank you, Roger.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000]   Thank you for being here.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000]   We're glad you watch.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000]   If you can watch live, do.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000]   It's fun.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.600]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:37.120]   That's 2300 UTC on Twit.tv, but if you can't watch live, don't worry.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:41.200]   You can always get on-demand audio and video after the fact on our website, Twit.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:48.560]   W-I-T-V or wherever, find our podcasts or aggregated, distributed according to the
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:54.760]   rules established many years ago by the fathers of the internet.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.760]   That would include iTunes in the Zoom marketplace in Xbox as well.
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:58.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:52:59.760]   We'll see you next time.
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:00.760]   Another Twit.
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:13.920]   The Can.
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.920]   12 by 12.
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.120]   What about that for a title, huh?
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.120]   Hmm.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:20.520]   Now I'm hungry.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.480]   There isn't any out very near here.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.240]   On the way out of town, as Robert knows.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.240]   I went to it yesterday.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.240]   It's not good.
[01:53:28.240 --> 01:53:29.240]   Don't go there.
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:30.240]   Don't go there.
[01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:35.800]   I've always been a little surprised at the almost slavish following that-
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:37.840]   Are you a five-guys guy?
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:42.080]   I actually don't like most hamburgers, just because they always find them to be overcooked
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:44.200]   or really greasy.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.000]   That's what I like about it in and out.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000]   Overcooked and greasy.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.560]   I'm going over to Ray's Hellburger.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.560]   Ooh, that sounds good.
[01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:50.560]   Is that in DC?
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:52.560]   It's in Virginia.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.400]   It's the place that Obama gets his burgers.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.400]   Oh.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:59.040]   Does he like send out the Secret Service?
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.800]   Do they like show up at Ray's Hellburger?
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.280]   No, he shows up.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:05.440]   POTUS would like a sack of double doubles with everything.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:09.560]   People would wonder, like, do they have a food tester that just sticks a meter in it
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.760]   and makes sure it's not one?
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:15.760]   You're saying President Obama goes to Ray's Hellburger and orders one?
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:20.800]   They have a picture of him showing up ordering his burger and I'm believing that the restaurant
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.640]   was populated by Secret Service people.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:24.640]   Even the guy buying the counter.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:25.640]   Don't eat that.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:27.760]   So where he asked the guy if he wanted fries?
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:28.760]   I like five guys.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:30.000]   Have you been to five guys?
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000]   Yes.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000]   I like five guys.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000]   You know what I really like?
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000]   We don't have them out here.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000]   Stake and shake.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.000]   Oh, I hate to take a check.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000]   I actually have never tried it, but I'm looking at their menu.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000]   I think I would.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.000]   It's very good.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.000]   I don't like their titty titty fries.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000]   You never even tried.
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000]   Well, you will read many fries.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000]   You will read many fries.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.000]   You will read many fries.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000]   Weird.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000]   I love white cats.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.800]   I talk about overcooked and greasy.
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:50.840]   It's fast.
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:53.040]   My freezer is full of white castle hamburgers.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.000]   But you had your start in fast food, so you know.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000]   Oh, I know.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000]   I worked in fast food.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000]   The business very well.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.280]   Yeah, I still have calluses on my fingers here from flipping the burgers.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:03.280]   That was the old days.
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:07.320]   You know, it's odd that you mentioned because every now and then when I get really bored
[01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:12.320]   for some reason, I look up training videos on YouTube and I came across an old Wendy's
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.960]   one where they basically taught the guy how to cook by using a rap video.
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:22.680]   Oh, you got to put your food in the fridge.
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:23.680]   Here we go.
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:24.680]   Here's hot drinks.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:25.680]   There's one that's like, yeah.
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:26.680]   Is it the 80s?
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:27.680]   The chili.
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.680]   No, this is a hot treat.
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:29.680]   No, no, no.
[01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:30.680]   The chili?
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:31.680]   No, no, this one.
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:35.160]   1980s Wendy's training video.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.440]   Good lord from File Cabinet.
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:39.360]   Right here in it.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:41.400]   Put it in the microwave and we're done.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.400]   Are you plugged in?
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.680]   You're seeing it, but you're not hearing it.
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:46.680]   Yeah, I'm not even.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.840]   Why am I having so much trouble?
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:51.000]   It must be Linux.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]   It's all the way up.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000]   That's what's odd.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.200]   What is that one called?
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:57.360]   It's a 1980s Wendy's training video.
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:58.360]   Wow.
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.800]   You're way, way, way, way.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:01.800]   Wow.
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:02.800]   Already I'm enjoying it.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.200]   I have a special place for this because when I worked at the Olive Garden for all of three
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.440]   weeks, it gave me a video on how to bust.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:19.440]   The training is very important when you have minimum wage workers.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.200]   We never had anything this good at McDonald's.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.200]   This is psychedelic.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.200]   I think they have videotape.
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:29.360]   And then tapes for training.
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.360]   Real skills.
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:35.280]   I can't even understand it.
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.120]   Now he's in the video.
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.080]   It looks like a microwave.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.440]   This stuff is great.
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.040]   It's like gold.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:47.280]   It's like for my nightmares.
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:54.280]   And MC Hammer has really come down a long way.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:57:02.280]   Most of all, you got to have your tools.
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:06.280]   Most of all, you got to have your tools.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.560]   Now beats got gray to adjust like wood.
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:13.920]   You got to follow the arrow to lay it down like you should.
[01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.920]   From the front to the back, you got to lay it down.
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:16.920]   Race it evenly.
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:17.920]   Not scattered around.
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:22.920]   Next, you got to soften me from the back to the front to make the taste complete.
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:23.920]   Not too little.
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:24.920]   Not too much.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.920]   Oh my god.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:28.920]   Oh, this is too much for me.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:29.920]   This is good.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:30.920]   What's good?
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:31.920]   Next is I keep two susceptible.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:33.920]   Turn to me and do a 400 press.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:34.920]   Don't wait too long.
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.920]   Infoside or the meat won't reach the proper side.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.920]   When things stop the system, you're ready to go.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:41.920]   Just turn to me.
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.920]   But don't be slow.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:43.920]   Just turn them over.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:45.920]   Now, of course, it's all automate.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.920]   Even at McDonald's, they have machines.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:51.920]   I don't flip it anymore.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:53.920]   Press the grease out of you.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:54.920]   It's gross.
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:58.920]   I know meat had green just like wood.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.920]   It does, but not when you grind it.
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:09.920]   I've learned a lot here.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:16.920]   Oh, the singing patties.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.920]   When you see it, it's on the top of the meat.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:21.920]   It's time to give the turn and press the re-feed.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:23.920]   Kind of depressing all the flavor out of it.
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:26.920]   Never do that.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.920]   That's because it's filled with water.
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:31.920]   You're like super fed to me.
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:37.920]   You also do that because they don't want to get sued for giving salmonella.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.920]   I know now.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:48.920]   I love lettuce.
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:56.920]   I'm a medicine cook.
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.920]   Green moisty.
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.920]   Green moisty.
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.920]   Green moisty.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920]   Green moisty.
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:08.920]   I didn't take acid before I saw this.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:09.920]   What?
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:10.920]   Gonna be what?
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:11.920]   What?
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:12.920]   Gonna be what?
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:15.920]   Oh, green moisty.
[01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:16.920]   Not green gray.
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:17.920]   Oh.
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:18.920]   Green moisty.
[01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:19.920]   Green moisty.
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:23.920]   That's the title of this week's episode.
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.180]   (laughing)
