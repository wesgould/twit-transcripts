[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, John C. Devorah.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200]   Hi, John.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   Hey, I just got in from China.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   Yeah, did you get that in China?
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   Yeah, I got it at the Great Wall.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.200]   That's me.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   What do you think I paid for this hat?
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200]   43 yuan.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Two bucks.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200]   Two bucks.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   I know.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   It's stuff's cheap and short.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   They have a long bill.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   I used to hat for it, keys to the wire from the mic.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   For those who are not watching the video, he's now bonking the mic with the bill of his cap.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   That's kind of sad.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   That way I can't get too close.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.200]   I can't over-magerely.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.200]   That's a good idea.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   I need that.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   Yeah, you do.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   Yeah, it's a mic away.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Also, here Lisa Bettany from the beautiful Vancouver, Washington.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   Hi, Lisa.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   It's great to see you.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   Vancouver, Washington?
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   I mean, Vancouver, Canada.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   Vancouver, Washington.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   Well, isn't that like just over the border?
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   No, no, that's the joke of it.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   It's across from Portland.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Oh, that's very confusing.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   It's actually quite a drive.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   So did they steal your name or did you steal their name?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   I'd like to think that we were the first Vancouver.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   You were.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   I'm sorry, because Gassie Jack blew up the gas works there in 1802.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   And that was the founding.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   No, I know.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   I know.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   I know my Vancouver history.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   You're pretty amazed, aren't you?
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   I thought that Vancouver's name came from the island.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   Wasn't Vancouver Island named before the city?
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   I'm just going to hold the camera.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Lisa, till she says something.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   What?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   That's Hugo.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   She's Wikipediaing.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   Oh, there you have it.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   Are you a bit?
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   Lisa, you're not.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Saskatoon is the Paris of Canada.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   It's the Paris of Saskatchewan.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   I'll give you that.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   That's what somebody told me once.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   I've never been there.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   I've always wanted to visit Saskatoon.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200]   What is Saskatoon?
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   All I know from Saskatoon is the show Corner Gas.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   It's a college town.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   Is it?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   Saskatoon itself is a really pretty city.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   There's lots of rivers and bridges and that kind of thing.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   But you got out of there as soon as you could.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   I don't like the cold.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   She doesn't have the Saskatoon accent.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   She doesn't.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   I can put it on though, eh?
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   There you go.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   Now you're talking.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   Is that how they talk in Saskatoon?
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   Of course.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   I don't think so.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   I think that's more of like a...
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   That's Edmonton.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   Edmonton is wow.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   That's Alberta.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.200]   That's how they talk in Alberta.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   This tour of Canadian accents brought to you by Ford Sync.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   No, no.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   I won't do that.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Let's also introduce Andrew Warner.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   I'm so glad Andrew's here.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   I've wanted to get Andrew on the show for some time actually.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.200]   He has interviewed me for his website, MixerG.com.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   Andrew's an entrepreneur, man who at a very young age, founded a business that reached $30 million in annual sales, cashed out after the web bust.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   You survived and did well.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   And then I guess you're just kind of, you know, taking it easy, living a life of Riley.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   And you decided to start a site called MixerG.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200]   How would you describe MixerG, Andrew?
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   Well, you know the way that you guys on Mac Break Weekly investigate insanely every Apple product that comes out?
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   Yeah, obsessively.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   I do the same thing with internet businesses.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   So you study entrepreneurship?
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.200]   Exactly.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   I want to know everything about how they got their first users, how they made their first few dollars, how they grew, how they sold.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   Like that kind of in-depth conversations, what I do with entrepreneurs.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   Like you, you came on MixerG, as you said, and you talked about how you built up Twit?
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   Yeah, so you've got Gary Vaynerchuk, Tim Ferriss, Jimmy Wales, that kind of people.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   And the reason you're on, we're going to talk about this in a bit, you just interviewed Chandra Seikar, Ratha Krishnan, the guy who is building the juju, the guy who took the crunch pad from Mike Arrington.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   And we're going to get his side of the story.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   I'm fascinated to hear what happened, and it's not the same story we've heard so far.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   Ha! Ha!
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   So that should be interesting.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   We have all the tech news too, but before we go too much farther, I want to mention somebody who's a friend of Twit, Raz Savage, who did a show with us for a long time.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   Raz Rose, she's the woman who was rowing across the Atlantic.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   She was a first one to row across the Atlantic, and then she roed, is rowing across the Atlantic.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   The road is rowing across the Pacific right now with the idea to become the first woman to row solo across the Pacific Ocean.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   She's doing it stage by stage. She's completed stage one and stage two.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   We covered those with the Raz Rose podcast.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   She walked to Copenhagen from London for the Copenhagen Climate Summit.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   In Copenhagen, everything she owns was stolen.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   Her computer, her laptop, her phone, all her gear, everything.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   Was stolen. Last night my coat and bag were stolen while I was at an event in Copenhagen in my bag, where my laptop and iPhone, I have no insurance, no money.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   She walked there, no ride home and now no credit cards.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   How do you walk there? It's a long walk.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   How do you get there? She's an adventurer.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   But from London, how do you walk to Copenhagen?
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   Well, there probably was a fairy involved.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   Well, that's not the same as walking.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.200]   She walked while she was on the ferry. She probably kept stepping.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.200]   A RAN to keep up with the fairies.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   Anyway, there is a fundraiser.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   This is the last day of the fundraiser.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield organized this to try to get enough money together to get Raz, at least kind of somewhat replace her stuff.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   It's on giveforward.com.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   If you go to giveforward.com/razestuff, R-O-Z-S-S-T-U-F-F,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   the last chance to donate there about halfway to the goal,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   they've raised a lot of money, $3,600, but they need $6,500 to replace everything, including your laptop and your phone.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   And Raz is a great person who really has...
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   What is that? You're flashing, John. What is that?
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   Visit channeltaforac.com.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.200]   Only John would be crass enough to plug.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   Channeltaforac.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   Well, I'm giving an impassioned plea.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   Hey, we should get the girls some gear from some of these vendors and just have them ship their new equipment.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   Come on.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   But, you know, I think it's kind of cool that her fans have...
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   Yeah, no, I think it's great.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   ...got together and they've raised so much money.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   And so, I wanted to give that a plug.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.200]   How'd she get at what happened? Did she wish she did?
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   Did she... Did she... Did she... Did she hit the bus stop?
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   She turned around, boom, her stuff was stolen.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   I mean, how much thievery is there in Denmark?
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Well, you wouldn't think.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   I mean, I thought Denmark was like safe and, you know, I don't know.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   It's the Vancouver of Denmark.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   Really?
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   Okay.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   I've been to wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   It's a beautiful city.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Yeah, I've been there a few times.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   It's nice.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   It's gorgeous.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   Tivoli Gardens.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   Beautiful.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   I've never made the gardens, unfortunately.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   Well, you got to go.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   I was with kids and you know what's kind of an amusement park.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   I was there.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   It was really fun.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   So, Andrew Warner, you got to speak with Chandra Sekar.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   Chandra, he's called...
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   By the way, he never introduced me to you.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   I believe I did remember the hat that bumps into the microphone.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   You mean this?
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   We...
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   John, you turn it into my mom and I'm not sure how I feel about that.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.200]   Hey, your mom's my biggest fan.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   She loves you.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   She said, "You cut that part out where I said I was as big as fan."
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   I said, "No, I didn't cut that out.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   You were in there, mom."
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   Mom got out of it.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   Oh, sorry.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   Go ahead.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   I was just reading it.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   I'm got a lot of fan mail.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   Andrew's turned bright green.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   What's going on, Andrew?
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   Where's my camera?
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   He's plugging it in a movie.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   Can I turn my camera off and back on?
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   I see myself in the little window on Skype.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   Yeah, plug it in.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   I don't know what happened.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   He's married.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   He's married.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   Oh, there we go.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   Yeah, I've been broadcasting it.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   It looks like it's back.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.200]   It's...
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   All right, so let's hear the story, the real story, or the one of the stories.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   So, you interviewed, and you can hear this interview at MixerG.com.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   This week, you interviewed Chandra.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   Tell us his side of the story.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   Maybe we should recap that Mike Arrington at TechCrunch, a year ago, announced that
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.800]   he was going to build a tablet, a touch tablet, called the Crunchpad that was going to be
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.920]   kind of open source, community developed.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.200]   At some point, teamed up with Chandra's company, which is called What's a Long Garage?
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   Fusion Garage.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.560]   And then they were about to debut this a couple of weeks ago, and the two days before the
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:13.800]   debut, according to Mike, Fusion Garage shows up, sends him an email saying, "That's it.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   We're taking the prototype.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.480]   We're going to sell it on our own.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.600]   They renamed it the Juju Pad.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.440]   Mike says, "We're going to court, but the Crunchpad is dead."
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.240]   All we've heard so far is mostly Mike's point of view, and then now they did do a demo of
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.240]   the Juju Pad.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.400]   We've seen video of it.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.600]   What does Chandra say happened, Andrew?
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.240]   Well, first of all, I saw that demo.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.040]   I had him demo it in the interview, and this device is beautiful, and it just reaffirms
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.120]   our excitement for a tablet.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.120]   You see it, and you start to instantly understand where it fits into people's lives.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.360]   I could see myself flipping through magazines, watching videos on this device.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.840]   What Chandra says is that he had the device before he ever got together with Michael Arrington.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.160]   He says he met Mike at TechCrunch 50.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.400]   He showed him a prototype of the device, and Michael Arrington got so excited about it
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.040]   that he said, "I want to buy out your business."
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.760]   Right there, same day, he's been talking.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.960]   Is this after Arrington has said we're going to do a Crunchpad?
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   Yes.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.560]   As I understand it, yes.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.560]   Okay.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.320]   Oh, wait, let's get the time left.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.080]   This is what you hypothesized happened.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.240]   What's the timeline?
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.400]   The timeline, I actually don't know the exact dates on this, but Michael Arrington has
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.400]   to want to know the sequence of events.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.400]   I see.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.400]   Okay.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.840]   It sounds like Arrington had announced the Crunchpad and began development of it.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.920]   TechCrunch 50, was it this year's TechCrunch 50 or a year ago's TechCrunch 50?
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.080]   A year ago, it sounds like.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.080]   Okay.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.680]   So it would have been very shortly after the Crunchpad was announced then.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.680]   Right.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.280]   So, Michael Arrington decides instead of building it himself, this guy, according to Chandra,
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.840]   Chandra's got a device that's already getting close.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   He's got a prototype.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.640]   He says, "I want to buy your business."
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.560]   Chandra gets excited that he has a potential buyout, and he starts to talk with Michael
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.440]   Arrington and his people about how they can work together, how they can buy out his business.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.600]   He says that it sounds to me like he's being a little mysterious here about what went on
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   behind the scenes partially because of the lawsuit.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.760]   But what he's saying is that because there wasn't a buyout, he couldn't put the name
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.640]   Crunchpad on his device.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.560]   And because there wasn't a buyout, Arrington and the TechCrunch people didn't contribute
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.920]   nearly enough to claim partial ownership of this.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:42.240]   So, he says that basically Mike defaulted on his agreement to buy a buyout.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   Yes.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.200]   And he also says that the guys from TechCrunch had nothing to do with the development of the
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   pad.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.560]   Now, Mike says we bought a house.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.520]   We had developers from a fusion garage and Crunchpad developers all working together in
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   a house.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.080]   Does Chandra deny that?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.600]   He denies that they've had any input in the creation of the device.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.200]   He says that he and his people designed it everything from the software to the hardware
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.440]   to the user experience.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.680]   And I press them on this over and over again because user experience is tough.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.840]   And for a company that's never created hardware like this before to come out and create something
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.520]   so beautiful, that's so intuitive, to me sound a little suspicious.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.560]   But he kept saying that he and his guys had the experience to build this thing and they
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.560]   did it on their own.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.080]   And he also says that that time that the TechCrunch people were in Singapore, where TechCrunch
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.560]   says that they were at Fusion Garage's office helping them think through the pad, Chandra
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.360]   says they were only in his office once.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.480]   The only reason that they flew to Singapore was to talk about a potential buyout.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.920]   It sounds like he thinks that TechCrunch was dragging their heels, that they weren't making
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.520]   this buyout happen fast enough.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.560]   And if they're not going to buy them out, they haven't contributed anything to the pad.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.080]   Or took the pad and named it and started selling it on his own.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.520]   So here's the chronology.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.920]   I'm looking at Wikipedia.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.880]   According to Wikipedia, the Crunchpad project was announced July 2008.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   Now TechCrunch 50 in 2008 was in September.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.680]   So Mike would have announced this in July and three months later, four months later,
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.920]   three months later I guess, seeing this device at TechCrunch 50.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.920]   And flipped.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:31.320]   Well, now, and now he did have a group led by Louis Monier working on a Crunchpad.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.560]   And they had prototypes.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.400]   They had prototypes that they showed in early 2009 and April 2009.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.480]   In June, they had the near final industrial design.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.360]   Was it their prototype or was it the other guys?
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.960]   Was it the Indians?
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.480]   Mike Harrington writes that the hardware, software, and industrial design improvements
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:57.720]   seen in prototype C, the third prototype, were all driven by Fusion Garage.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.120]   And this is a quote from TechCrunch.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.120]   But one thing I've learned about hardware in the last year is that you need partners
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.200]   to actually make things happen.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:10.760]   And the credit for what we saw today goes entirely to the Fusion Garage team.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.120]   So it was the Fusion Garage product.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.120]   Sounds like it.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   Yeah, he's a good man.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.680]   And that's what Chandra kept saying over and over again, the TechCrunch on their blog
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.440]   in person kept giving them credit for designing, developing this pad.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.840]   In July 2009, it was reported that Errington had founded a company of 14 employees around
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.440]   the tablet in Singapore.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.000]   But you're saying Chandra said that Singapore office was our office?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.920]   Yes, he's saying that as far as I know, TechCrunch should not have an office in Singapore.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.320]   But Chandra saying that the TechCrunch people only visited his office once, which sounds
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.240]   surprising that they go all the way to Singapore and only be in the office one time.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.800]   Even if you're doing due diligence to buy out a company, I'd expect after all that trip
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.640]   to go into their office and spend some time with them.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.160]   We got a real case of he said he said here.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.160]   I don't know.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.640]   But at least now we see both sides of it.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:09.520]   We see the Chandra saying that he did the whole thing on his own and TechCrunch didn't
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.920]   have any input on it.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:22.600]   In regards to the one visit to the office in Singapore, it's possible that he was going
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.400]   to Singapore for more than one thing.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.640]   There's a lot of things to do when you're in Singapore and it could have had meetings
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.800]   of all sorts.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   That's true too.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.360]   I don't think they took a trip to Singapore to stop by and say hello and then take off
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.760]   and go back home.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.560]   Here's the bigger question though.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.240]   You think that there is a market for this based on seeing an Andrew that you think this
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.280]   is a price?
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.600]   It's stunning and there's nothing like actually seeing the device, especially after we saw
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.160]   that ESPN video where they showed what they would do if there was a tablet out there.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.840]   When you see what magazines have in mind for this thing and you see the device itself,
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.000]   you start to imagine how it would fit into your life.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.160]   Now I don't want another device.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.160]   I've got my MacBook.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.160]   I've got my iPhone.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.520]   I buy too many gadgets as it is.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.920]   If you think about it, this thing is about the size of a magazine a little thicker than
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.920]   a magazine.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.480]   You could see yourself on the couch reading a magazine on this thing.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.440]   You can see yourself in bed reading a magazine with this thing.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.440]   In fact, you think about the Kindle which only does one thing which is read books.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.240]   You compare it to a tablet whether it comes from these guys or comes from Apple or someone
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.240]   else.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.640]   You say, who would want the Kindle that only does one thing?
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.640]   What do you think, Lisa?
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.360]   You're a gadget hound.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360]   I am a gadget hound.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.840]   Does a tablet attractive to you as something you'd want?
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.000]   I have to say that I wasn't swept up in the Kindle period at all.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.400]   Well, you couldn't be because you're in Canada.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   Right?
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   Exactly.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.160]   It doesn't work in Canada.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.480]   Exactly.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:18:00.160]   But even the concept of it, I mean, I actually read a lot of stuff on my iPhone.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.400]   I mean, when I'm not reading on my iPhone, I have a laptop or I don't know.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.040]   I guess the concept hasn't really caught on.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.800]   I like to work with it.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.440]   What if you could buy a device that's twice the size of the iPhone to read your books
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   on?
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:22.000]   But then I'd have that and an iPhone and a point and shoot and a camera and a laptop.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.880]   I think that if we're looking at devices becoming more all-inclusive and getting rid
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.440]   of all the bits and pieces, that's a good step forward.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.840]   But when I've already invested in all the stuff that I've got, I don't know if I want
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.160]   to add another piece of gear to my bag.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.360]   It sounds like you want the iPhone to do everything and are content with the iPhone
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   even as a reader.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   I love my iPhone.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.000]   Even if Apple, you haven't drank the Apple coolator the extent that if Apple came out
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.640]   with a tablet in the next nine months that you would say, "Okay, well, I'll buy that."
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.560]   No, because I haven't even hopped on board with the new MacBook Pros or, you know, I've
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.560]   just...
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.560]   I kind of have my iPad.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   It's kind of my feeling.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   I agree with you.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:18.040]   I mean, I've got what I need and, you know, I don't have the money to just go spending
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.320]   on every new little gizmo.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:28.240]   And I think what you're talking about isn't something that would appeal to me in that
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.240]   sense.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.240]   John, haven't we seen tablets already from a lot of companies?
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.640]   Microsoft tried to do this a couple of times?
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.640]   Well, the...
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.600]   I mean, the UMPC, the ultra mobile PC.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.000]   Yes, seen maybe four iterations of tablet computing going back.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.480]   Going back to grid and slate.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.800]   Going back further and further and further and they keep going back.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.320]   The problem, I still believe, you know, they keep improving the technology.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.480]   The publish still doesn't buy them.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.120]   And I think it has something to do with the price.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.760]   I think they're just too expensive.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.760]   You already have a laptop.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.760]   If you can get it...
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.760]   If you...
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.360]   Unless they bring them down to about a half the price of a laptop, I don't seem going anywhere.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.360]   Crunchpad was...
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.440]   Crunchpad was supposed to be 200.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.960]   And now the Juju is what, 400, Andrew?
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   Or $4.99.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   $4.99.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.960]   $4.99.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   Yeah, $4.99.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.960]   Yeah, $4.99.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.120]   That's a pretty high price point when you get a net book for $250.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.640]   I mean, why would you want that when you could have a net book or something that could do
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.840]   everything and you could type on?
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.240]   And yeah, I'm not following love.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.680]   Our friend feed chatters say, "Hey, you remember...
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   Yuppies.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   Yuppies won.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   Status symbol.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   Yuppies are dead.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.800]   All the yuppies are dead.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.640]   I think the yuppies, yeah, they got burned out.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.640]   They're wiped out.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.480]   Yeah, they're gone, man.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.720]   There's no yuppies here, man.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.880]   All the yuppies is gone.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880]   Well, so it's interesting.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.360]   What do you think is going to happen, Andrew?
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360]   Do you think this is...
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360]   You love this.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.760]   Do you think this is a market?
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760]   I do.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.840]   I think that now we're starting to see content being potentially created for this device.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.680]   I could see people getting into it as a laptop replacement.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   I'm not going to...
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   I'll tell you right now.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.080]   I'll tell you why there's a lawsuit swirling around it.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   Why?
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   Because...
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.520]   What the reason is to make...
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.920]   Because you don't know if that company's going to be around.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.920]   So what?
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.360]   People care about that, John.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.920]   People don't buy products or companies that are not going to be around.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.600]   Yeah, but what you want to do is to make it work.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.600]   You want to do it by the product?
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.840]   Either it works or it doesn't, and the company goes broke.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.840]   So what?
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.840]   No, look at Arco.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.040]   So Arco's has been making this kind of product for years, but because they're in France and
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.640]   nobody's ever heard of them, we even gave them the best of CES award in 2018.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.520]   In 2003, I think, for the early Arco's products.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.200]   But you know, this is where Apple has such an advantage.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.240]   And Amazon, too, has such an advantage.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.920]   They have the supply chain.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.160]   It's souped in nuts.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.400]   You know the company's going to be around their customers.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.480]   I think it contradicted yourself.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.880]   Is Arco still in business?
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.080]   They are, but they're not exactly...
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.360]   That seems to be a prerequisite for what you just said.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.680]   They have to stay in business.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.840]   They stayed in business and didn't do them any good.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.840]   They survived.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.520]   I don't think it's exactly thriving.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   I mean, people buy...
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   The Arco's has a tablet.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.200]   Did you know that Arco's has a tablet?
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.640]   As far as I'm concerned, if I buy a piece of gear and the company goes broke the next
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.960]   day, as long as the product still keeps working, I'm only going to have it for a couple of
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   years anyway.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.120]   I mean, I'm not going to keep the thing until...
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.360]   I mean, look at how many of you have, for example, let's take a look at the iPod.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.760]   How many iPods do you personally own?
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   Oh, God.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.520]   Well, there's a triple digits.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.760]   It's like candy.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.360]   No, I mean, probably half a dozen.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.480]   Well, John, I think a better question is, how many times have you returned one of
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.200]   your computers to Apple or had them replace a screen or had them fix a keyboard?
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.800]   These devices do potentially have trouble, whether it's scratches or dead pixels.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.040]   You want a company to stand behind you?
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.840]   My juju is broken.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.120]   Who's going to fix my juju?
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   I broke my juju.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.040]   I just even know the whole thing doesn't.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.320]   You broke your what?
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.640]   That's what they're calling it, the juju.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   Oh, I'm sorry I'm thinking something else.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.600]   Yeah, the name's a bit off-putting.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.200]   Yeah, more than a bit.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   Oh, well.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   All right.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.960]   So I enough said somebody just pointed out that I just bought a pioneer plasma TV, even
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.120]   though they're going to stop making a.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.360]   They got you nailed.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.200]   Yeah, that's the that's what I was looking for, that piece of tinuit.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.600]   John's always looking to nail me.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.600]   Well, not.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.600]   Yeah, not literally, but just, you know, you're always trying to catch me off.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.080]   Just catch you so you can try and make sure your game is, you know, you're on your game.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.760]   But I just feel like, look, pioneer's not going anywhere.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.080]   They're just not going to make the, I wouldn't buy.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.040]   Would you buy a TV from Joe's TV and appliance?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.720]   I know, probably not.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.000]   No, you want to buy it from a solvent company.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.240]   I think Fusion Garage is the tech equivalent of Joe's TV and appliance.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:06.800]   You know, I think the other thing that's that's hurting them is this potential Apple tablet.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.520]   We're all standing back and waiting to see if that comes out.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.600]   Nobody wants to buy the Juju or any other shoe has to drop.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   You're right.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.240]   Until Apple says one way or the other until we know it.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.280]   And rumors are that maybe nine months that may be September.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.440]   So it would be that be the Juju shoe?
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   The Juju shoe.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   Okay.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.560]   We have a name for the show anyway.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   Let me write that down.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   Juju shoe.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   It has to drop.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.480]   The Juju shoe is about to drop.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.600]   Hey, we're going to take a break and to come back with more with our great guests from
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.120]   Mixer G, Mr. Andrew Warner.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.280]   John's putting up.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.960]   John's putting up his card.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.240]   John C. Devorak from channel, Devorak.com.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.120]   It looks like you printed that out.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   You think?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   Like you're prepared.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   I just did it a minute ago.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.360]   Is this, is this so like you can change clothes?
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   Is this like the.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.360]   I'm going to go back to the wardrobe change.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.360]   This is monasty screen.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.160]   I just want to get to see what these different outfits look like and then I can determine
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.640]   what I have to do to look good on TV.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.640]   Lisa, do you know any other guys who call their clothes outfits?
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:15.280]   Um, maybe a few, but they're, they're very Metro.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.680]   So John's Metro.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.400]   John and pure Metro.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.520]   If anybody's not Metro, it's me.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.040]   I don't know what John is, but you're right.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.480]   I don't think it's Metro.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.840]   Lisa Bettany is also here for mostly Lisa.com.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.160]   We're going to continue with our conversation in just a bit, but I do want to remind you
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:39.800]   that Ford is just breaking new territory all the time with the amazing Ford sink.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.480]   And I hear we're going to hear some great stuff from them at CES.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.480]   We'll be there to cover it.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.840]   Uh, in fact, Lisa, we're, we're trying to figure out where I think we're going to get
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.080]   you to drive my Mustang down and.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.720]   Oh, me drive.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.240]   Oh, you didn't know that there was driving involved?
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.440]   Why thought Kiki was going to drive?
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   No, Kiki's flying.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.440]   What?
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.640]   I'd be driving by myself.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.600]   Well, we'll find some people.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.920]   So here's the deal.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.040]   So when we first started our CES thing, I thought it was just going to be fun.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.760]   So I booked eight first class tickets on Virgin America to Vegas for the staff.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.480]   It was going to be their reward for hard work, but then CES got, he started getting
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.480]   interest.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.520]   We started, well, we're now we're going to cover it.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.240]   So we're going down, but we've got those tickets, but we now are now shipping equipment
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   down.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.040]   I think Cody's going to be driving the equipment down or so you want me to drive your gear
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.040]   down.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   That's not it.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   No, we got a guy driving the gear down.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:42.120]   I want you to drive my brand new 2010 Ford Mustang, Candy Apple red 19 inch wheels V8.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.800]   Can you drive a stick?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   No.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.840]   Well, this whole idea is just gone to happen.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.920]   Lisa, you're not supposed to admit that.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   That's the whole idea.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   I'm trying to drive the car one way or the other.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   You'll figure it out.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   I can learn.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   I can learn.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.920]   I can take lessons.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.680]   I can learn on my Mustang.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   Okay.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.400]   Well, see, the idea was Ford was going to sponsor this trip.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:09.040]   We were going to stream Lisa driving to CES, the road to CES with Lisa and the Mustang,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.680]   listening to the tunes on Ford Sync.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.520]   Hey, I got to play you something.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.280]   This Ford Sync is the hands free Bluetooth music search turn by turn navigation.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.440]   I got an unsolicited email from John Belmont who is a good friend, an old radio guy, many,
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.960]   many years you've probably heard him on AP radio news on a was he on CBS radio news.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:35.640]   He's now he's currently on POTUS on XM and his brother is Jeff Detro is also a very well
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.920]   known radio guy.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:44.600]   He was with Jeff and chair on the morning team in San Diego and Jeff bought.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.760]   He's never heard the show before, but he bought a Ford flex and sent John this, this
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.080]   voicemail message.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.880]   And by the way, John's given us permission to replay this as his chair or Jeff brother.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.080]   And this is, this is unsolicited testimony.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.080]   Okay.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:07.680]   So I can, I, Lisa was up on my car and I actually bought my car on the bottom new Ford.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   So check this out.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:15.440]   You hook up your iPod to your Ford and it's probably, I think I have 4,000 songs on there
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.120]   about half my CDs loaded, right?
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   Check this out.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.120]   Here's how you play songs.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.120]   You're a little bit.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   All right.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.800]   So right now I'm listening to a great back rack song magic moments.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   Let's hear it go low.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   Oh, geez.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   I feel like listening to something else.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.800]   I'm just going to call it up here.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   All right.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   U.S.E.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   Play track South American getaway.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:41.280]   Thanks for a second and.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.720]   How cool was that?
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   This is an unsolicited testimony.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.720]   I'm like, 10,000 songs of this mammoth iPod that cost me $200.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.720]   All right.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.720]   Here we go again.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.720]   Ready?
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:03.320]   This is the guy who just got his Ford sink and completely unsolicited calls his brother
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:09.840]   and says this thing is amazing and does a demo for him.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   Shit.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   I'm not kidding.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   Here we go again.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   Here we go.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   One more time.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:21.120]   I'm just leaving a message.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.120]   You are.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.640]   I got to tell you, when you become a Ford sink owner, this is the kind of crazy message
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.280]   you leave.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.720]   Thank you, Jeff Detro for letting us play that and John Belmont for passing it along.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.880]   You got to try the Ford sink.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.320]   Go to sinkmyridepodcast.com and check it out or best thing to do.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.120]   Go to your nearby Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer and say, I want to test drive Ford sink
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.040]   and come see us in CES.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:51.240]   Watch Lisa Bettany strip the gears on my brand new Ford Mustang.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.080]   I'm an okay driver.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   I think it'll be fun.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.840]   We'll figure this out.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.200]   We want you to be at CES, but we need somebody.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.240]   We'll fly you to San Francisco.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.640]   You don't have to drive from Vancouver.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:06.560]   In fact, you know what we should probably just do is drive you to just outside of Vegas.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   Yes.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   And then put you in the car.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   I dropped you off.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.560]   I just pushed the car.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.480]   And you can just roll the car into town.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.760]   No, this was a great idea.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.080]   Kiki had she forgot she neglected to ask you a couple of things.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.160]   Now John's got his new outfit on.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.720]   He is wearing the Boise State Broncos T-shirt.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.440]   That's a T-shirt.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.720]   That somebody says, but this is the Kansas Jayhawks hoodie.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   Oh, man.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.920]   Kansas Jayhawks, baby.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.840]   Number one.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.440]   John, are you in a rap crew?
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:49.680]   You have like a special like, you know, what do they call that?
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.200]   What do they call that when you're in a group of rappers?
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   Is it a crew?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.040]   That's a party draw.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   That's it.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   That's a day.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   You're the crew.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   Good golly.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   Good golly, Miss.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.320]   Kansas Jayhawks, baby.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.480]   Number one.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   Number one.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Yeah, baby.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   Jayhawks.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.520]   All right, let's talk about some other stories.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.520]   Australia.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.520]   How about tech stories?
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.520]   Tech stories.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   Australia.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:21.360]   You know, we have a lot of listeners in Australia who are just going crazy about this.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.040]   Google in fact, has posted a blog.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   Mandatory.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.520]   The government in Australia plans to introduce mandatory ISP filtering.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.480]   The first of its kind among Western democracies.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.280]   Yeah, classic.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   Um, Professor's Catherine Lumbee, Lila Green and John Hartley untangling the net, the scope
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.480]   of content caught by mandatory internet filtering has found the kinds of content that could be
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:54.960]   prohibited under the proposed filtering regime includes not just child sexual abuse
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.400]   material, which of course is always, always the, you know, the, the stalking horse for
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.760]   this kind of filtering, but also socially and politically controversial material, educational
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:12.000]   content on safer drug drug use, politically controversial crimes such as euthanasia, content
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.120]   that's merely unpleasant or unpalatable to the regime.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.040]   Yeah, that's why why Devorak and sensor will be censored there.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.240]   So now Johnny Worthington is in, is in Australia.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.520]   He's listening to the show right now.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.920]   And John, I would love to get your opinion on this.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.740]   Let me give you a, let me give you a phone number to call Johnny because I would very
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.480]   much like to get your opinion on this one.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.880]   You can use Skype to do this, Johnny.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.440]   Just call that number, Johnny.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   Call it, Johnny.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   We're waiting for you.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.440]   Like saying Johnny.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   Like saying Johnny.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   Hey, Johnny.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   Hey, Johnny.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   Oh, God.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   Go ahead.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   Do that again.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   Yeah, you do that.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.440]   He'll call it a minute.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   Do that again.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   That was, I want to call now.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   I don't know what she is.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.440]   Hey, Johnny.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.320]   If you want to hear from you, why don't you just call?
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   How do you do that?
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   How do you do that voice?
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.880]   She says that voice built into her.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   Is it just built in?
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.880]   It's just there.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.520]   It's just ready to come out.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520]   Doesn't seem like whatever.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.160]   Doesn't seem like there he is.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   Hey, Johnny.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   Hello.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.680]   So what's a hello, Johnny.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.680]   Can you hear us?
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.200]   Yes, I can.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   From Brisbane.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.240]   Yes, Brisbane.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   That's in Australia.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.240]   Tell me he's part of it.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.800]   What's the story with his ISP filtering?
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:35.400]   Basically, the whole issue comes down to is that parents in Australia, and this is where
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.360]   it's pitched at, parents in Australia don't really understand the internet.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.480]   So rather than actually taking an interest in their kids or monitoring their kids, they're
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.400]   actually, it's easier for the politicians to go, "No, no, wait.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.040]   We'll do it for you.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.160]   You don't have to think about the scary computers.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.800]   Let us do it for you."
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.840]   And then they put in these filtering.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.440]   And the problem with it is it doesn't really work.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.400]   That's the biggest problem with all internet filtering.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   It's crap.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   It is.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   It's total.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.760]   It just doesn't work because the people who really want to find the stuff, or aren't
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.960]   doing it through the normal channels or find things that way is around it, and the people
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.660]   who are looking for it, the people who aren't looking for it, they're just going to get
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.000]   caught up in the web.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.080]   So it's basically just pure political crap.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.960]   Hasn't this been kind of floating around for at least a year or two?
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   It has.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   The only problem is that they haven't been able to make it work.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.200]   That's the big delay.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:41.240]   I remember that the first time they pitched this, they didn't they offer a free filter
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.440]   to all families on their own computers.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.280]   And it was cracked the first hour.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.920]   It was cracked.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   It is.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.520]   And they actually still have that.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.160]   And the biggest problem is that it's not opt in.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.160]   It's opt out.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.120]   Sorry, it's not opt out.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.920]   It's opt in.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.200]   So everyone gets switched on by default.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.080]   So rather than educating people and saying, look, hey, I actually think putting a mandatory
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.880]   filtering on ISPs is a good idea.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.840]   I think if parents can't understand and look after their kids, this is a really, really
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.880]   good thing to do.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   But they should choose it.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.800]   They should choose it.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.560]   So what is the status now?
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.600]   Is this law?
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   Not really.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.000]   It's kind of weird to our parliament sort of on a break at the moment for Christmas
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   and everything like that.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.200]   So they've tried to bring it in and it's not necessarily working.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.680]   And they've just finished the trial.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   And now they've gone right.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.680]   This is cool.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.040]   We're going to go ahead and do it.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.200]   But they're still going to get it through the parliament.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.640]   I believe the last little bit has got to go through the national parliament.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:54.800]   And the biggest problem for our peers is that geeks in general or people who use a lot
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.280]   of computers are very easily sidelined.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.680]   So if we make a lot of noise, they can go, oh, don't worry.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:07.320]   If you speak out against censorship or filtering against child pornography, everyone's going
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.720]   to go, hmm, why are you doing that?
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.960]   Rather than actually thinking of the issues and going, no, this is actually about freedom
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.960]   information.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.200]   I mean, I'm a 29 year old male.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.920]   I should have the right to view what I want on the internet.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.280]   The only problem is it's very hard for me to say that without someone going, oh, do you
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.760]   want to look at kitty porn?
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.280]   That's a straw man argument.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.280]   That's ridiculous.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.640]   They've made this thing the, you know, like the be all end all of all decision making.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.600]   Well, it's well, because it's a sacred cow.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.640]   You cannot a straw man sacred cow.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   You take your choice.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.640]   You cannot.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   It's a sacred straw man.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   It's a sacred straw man.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:50.440]   You cannot stand up and say, I'm against it because then they can easily say, oh, so
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.640]   you believe in child pornography.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.680]   Why someone think of the children?
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   Think of the children.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   But that's not what this is about.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.920]   The question I have is, why does the government want to do this?
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.920]   Is there some other reason or are they just stupid?
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.520]   Because it's actually very smart.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.400]   So they can say to the parents, look, you don't have to understand the internet.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.320]   You don't have to stand over your kids shoulders and watch what they're doing.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   We will do that for you.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.120]   Let the big government take care of it for you.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.680]   And it's kind of funny because the current government in there now is sort of my political
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:31.560]   meaning, but I'm looking at them wanting to slap them across the face going, no, this
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   is stupid.
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.560]   What are you doing?
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.520]   Johnny, I'm so glad you could call in.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.200]   I know you're practically always there in our friend feed room.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.840]   Johnny does a really great friend feed podcast called Fundercats.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.920]   And where would we find Fundercats?
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.720]   Fundercats is it Fundercats.com?
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.280]   That's two F's for awesome.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.560]   Two F's for awesome.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.560]   Fundercats.com.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.440]   Johnny, it's great to talk to you.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:05.880]   And we're starting to do something on the network where we do world news check-ins.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.200]   We call it our tech world beat.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.000]   And I'd love to add you to that list of people so we can, as we call around, talk to people.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   I would love to be over.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Thank you, Johnny.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Really appreciate it.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Johnny Worthington from Brisbane.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.560]   I thought best to get this story from somebody who's actually living there.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.040]   Kind of a crazy idea.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.560]   But you say, John, this is the kind of thing that you see in other countries doing.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.560]   That's kind of filtering.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.440]   Yeah, why would they do that?
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.800]   Well, half of Russia right now is filtered away.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   Really?
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:40.280]   There's a fact in Brazil where I'm fairly well known, half the country can't get to
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.600]   my blog.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.040]   So this is, so governmental filtering is not...
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:46.840]   These are mostly ISP filtering right now.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840]   Okay.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.840]   But why are they doing it?
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.480]   Yeah, what's their interest in it?
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:55.240]   Maybe that's a competitive thing if they say, "Hey, come to RISP.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.080]   We'll protect your kids."
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   Maybe.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.520]   But I'm fine with that because then I would say, "Okay, you have fun and I'll be somewhere
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.520]   else."
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.520]   Andrew, what's it like?
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.320]   Andrew's in Buenos Aires right now.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.320]   What's the Internet...
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.480]   You obviously have great bandwidth in Argentina.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.720]   And frankly, that's one of the reasons why I decided to come to Argentina.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.480]   I think governments need to understand that they no longer have a chokehold on their people.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   We can fly.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.560]   We can work from whatever country we want.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.720]   And we're more and more going to pick the countries that have freedom and that freedom
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.240]   to us is represented by what kind of internet access they give us because that's what exposes
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   us to ideas.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.080]   That's what lets the world hear the ideas that we have.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.800]   And if I'm going to start a company, I don't know that I would go to Australia and start
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   it because of this.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.160]   If I were an entrepreneur from Australia, I'd consider leaving and going someplace where
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.640]   I have the full internet at my disposal.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.240]   And I could see why RISPs actually would want to be a part of this.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.360]   It seems like RISPs are bothered that anything could go on their network.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   It lets them off the hook.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.360]   They want control.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.760]   And there's a subtle threat that if you don't do this, then you could be prosecuted as
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.520]   transporting child porn.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:10.280]   Because they've been letting off the hook up to now as common carriers that they're not
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.000]   responsible just as the phone company's not responsible for what you do on a phone.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.520]   They're not responsible for the data that goes across their network.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.720]   But if something like this happens, then it's kind of the implication as well if you don't
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.760]   do it, we might hold you responsible.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.080]   And then what are they going after next?
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.880]   Is it going to be what we watch?
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.040]   Is it going to be bit torrent?
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.800]   Is also the next step after that?
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   And then it's competitive.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.360]   There's some services behind all this lurks the RIAA and the MPA.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.160]   Why do I feel like that's the case?
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   I just always think that.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   Why do you feel that?
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.720]   Yeah, I wonder why.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.560]   Because it's always the case.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.560]   These guys, they're such jerks.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.400]   All right.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   Moving along.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   Another story.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.080]   Have anybody seen the BitTorrent at Avatar Boy that?
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.360]   Oh, I mean the no, I'm sorry.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.040]   Did I say BitTorrent?
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.800]   Anybody see Avatar yet in the theaters?
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   Anybody?
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.040]   Would you let no one's going to BitTorrent it because the experience is IMAX 3D.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.160]   See, why do you think it's IMAX 3D?
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.040]   That's how you bypassed the copyright worries.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.040]   Yep.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   Exactly.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.520]   You make it impossible to BitTorrent.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:21.160]   Although, get ready, the Blu-ray Disc Association, Buddha has, well it's BUDA, right?
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:28.000]   Buddha has decided that on a specification for delivering full 1080p high definition,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.320]   stereoscopic video on Blu-ray.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.840]   Yeah, what's the mechanism here?
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.800]   Those crappy glasses that get launched.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.880]   Well, you have to wear glasses at Avatar too, right?
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.960]   Yeah, but you don't wear shuttered glasses.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   Those are just polarizers.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.840]   Actually, they're doing something really weird with Avatar.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.400]   They're doing two different wavelengths.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.800]   And then you wear glasses that aren't shuttered and they aren't polarized.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.080]   They have filters for the different wavelengths.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.120]   So they separate the image using filters.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.560]   It's a very interesting technology.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.560]   I don't know.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.560]   I didn't know this.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   Yeah, no, this is how they're doing Avatar.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   What's technology is that?
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   Any software?
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   I have not seen it.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.920]   I've heard mixed reviews.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.920]   Some people love it.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.400]   Roger Ebert thought it was the greatest movie ever.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   You guys seen it?
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.760]   Okay, we got a couple of people in this.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.000]   Pull the microphone up there.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.360]   We got a couple of people in the studio who have apparently seen it.
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.440]   Adam Jones, you're from LA.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.440]   That's correct.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.680]   Pull that right up into your face so we can hear you.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   There you go.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   So what did you think?
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   Avatar thumbs up.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.920]   I haven't seen Avatar yet, but I do know a bit of it.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   Oh, screw you.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   I do know about that.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.480]   No, actually Adam works.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.560]   He's a camera specialist for stop motion animation.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.120]   So he actually knows a lot about this.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   That's true.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   That's true.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.120]   I didn't work on it.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   Okay, so tell us what this technology is.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.040]   Yes, the technology is a digital projection and it is using polarization.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.960]   And rather than wavelength slide, it's left spiraling and right spiraling.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.800]   The Avatar is not using that.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.280]   It's not using digital 3D.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.640]   It is not doing it that way.
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.720]   And that may be how they're going to do it with a blue rate.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:59.400]   Well, at least I talked to our home theater guy today on the radio show and he said they
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.560]   weren't using the spiraling.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.560]   I'm aware of the spiraling.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.880]   That's how everybody's been doing it up to now.
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.880]   And now there's a...
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.120]   They were using wavelength manipulation for the 3D.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.120]   Interesting.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   Is that for better color?
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.520]   I don't know.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:16.320]   I mean, the real problem with all of this is you got to wear these dorky glasses, right?
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.160]   It's Dolby 3D is what they're using and it uses...
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   So it's from Dolby John.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.040]   Well, I thought the Dolby technology was all polarizing.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.040]   No.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.480]   I'll read this to you here.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.160]   Let me find this here.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:31.520]   I've got it.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.920]   I found a post.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:33.920]   Is the...
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.560]   The app is probably the leader in this stuff.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.560]   Avatar.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:46.760]   This is from facepunch.com, the Avatar 3D viewing guide.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.320]   It's using these tinted glasses, which I guess some of them, some of them are, might be using
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   the iMac's spiraling.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.920]   It's really great to take time.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.560]   I think iMac is using spiraling.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:06.000]   If you go to a Dolby 3D studio or a theater, this is the real d competitor.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.800]   Real d is what a lot of people are using.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.360]   Okay, I'm going to read you the different technologies.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   Real d...
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   One of these days.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.720]   Is the most widely installed 3D system in the US.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.880]   This is a regular digitally protected theater using a 2K projector and a polarized 3D system.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   That's polarization.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.760]   Pros, less ghosting than the iMac's 3D, which uses the spiral polarization you were talking
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   about.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   Crystal clear and sharp digital projection.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.000]   Glasses are brand new and you can take them home with you.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.080]   You don't have to share glasses as you do it on iMac's.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.680]   You could buy your own real d compatible 3D glasses and designer brands on the net.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   Oh boy.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:48.000]   The Dolby 3D, which is the lead competitor, uses a color wheel 3D system off a single 2K
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   projector.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.840]   That's one of the advantages, one projector.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:55.040]   Glasses are slightly tinted red green.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.960]   They're transparent so screen brightness is not affected.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.000]   They're reported to be very comfortable.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.880]   Apparently, less ghosting than real d and a significant increase in the 3D effect.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:10.120]   The cons slight color aberrations can occur in certain scenes across the red green spectrum
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.480]   and glasses are reused.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.160]   So avatar is being seen in three different ways.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.000]   You can get the iMac.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.600]   They're actually doing, they did all three technologies.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   Apparently.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:26.520]   Well, you can just go see it three different ways.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.640]   Make a field trip.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:37.440]   And the same guide at facepunch.com says, for God's sake, don't watch avatar in a 2D
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.920]   theater.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.160]   This movie, which by the way leaves me out because I don't have stereo vision.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.600]   I only use one eye at a time so I can't see this.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.560]   This movie was made as a proof of concept for 3D movies.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.560]   It would be pointless.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.360]   You might as well watch the Wizard of Oz in black and white.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.000]   So what is the whirling thing you're telling me about?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.960]   So Adam Jones, describe this spiral technique.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   Is this what iMacs?
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.960]   I think it's what iMacs uses.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.240]   This is what real d has a digital projector.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:09.320]   So traditional film is projected in 24 frames per second.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:16.920]   But real d ups the, I'm sorry, to about 124 hertz or 148 hertz.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.520]   Anyway, because they have to do twice as many frames.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   Right, right.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.360]   So you have two images, two oculars and your 3D projection.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.160]   That's how they keep it from looking interlaced.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.680]   Well, they aren't interlaced at all.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:34.640]   In fact, actually they are projecting, like I said, six frames per one frame at 24 frames
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.640]   a second.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   Wow.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   Very cool.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.440]   So you have a screen in front that is synced to each image.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.640]   So it flashes lettering.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.320]   But left, right, left, right, left, right.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.160]   Reach one frame in a 24 frame per second.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.680]   And then your glasses are passive.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.520]   So left eye is left spiraling and right eye is right spiraling.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:58.440]   So by using spiral polarization, they don't have to have a shuttering.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.800]   So none of these use shuttering.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:02.560]   Yeah, the image is projected digitally.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.920]   So it's digitally shuttered.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:08.520]   And then the ocular division is made by a screen in front of the chain.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:12.240]   Can you go to any of these three technologies without the glasses or?
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.680]   You need to separate the image because you're just looking at it on the same screen.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   You'll look at it weird.
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.600]   And you need that just be bizarre.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.600]   Interocular division.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.120]   Can I use my glasses from up?
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.040]   Yes, that's the spiraling polarization.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.440]   The real glasses are.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.040]   IMAX was invented in Canada.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.040]   In Toronto.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.600]   That's probably some of my relatives.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.000]   Yeah, probably.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Because you're fully three dimensional.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I know.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   It's amazing.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.280]   Even now on Skype, I don't know how you're doing that, but you're three dimensional.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.960]   So it doesn't say how they're going to do this on TVs.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.760]   Do you know how they do it on TVs?
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.000]   Some TVs are already 3D compatible.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.440]   In fact, they'll show you.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.120]   Are they using one of these three technologies?
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.840]   I think they're using the spiraling technology.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.640]   But you need active glasses to filter out.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   Shattering glasses.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.440]   To filter out each different ocular.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.560]   Yeah, that'll ruin you.
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.880]   Well, actually the glasses are fairly comfortable.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.880]   They're expensive.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.880]   They're hundreds of dollars.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.880]   Right, and they're battery powered.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   So, yeah.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.880]   There's that.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   You got a problem with the glasses.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.360]   I mean, if you looked at the glasses when they first appeared, they didn't have these
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.880]   warnings out at first, but after a couple of incidents, I suppose.
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.680]   Now, if you buy a set of these, any of the shuttering devices, they tell you that if
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   you're under, I think, the age of nine or something like that.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   Prox seizures.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.080]   Well, no, it also does some screws up with your ocular nerve.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   Oh, that's good.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.160]   It's like Steve Martin and the jerk.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   He invented the handle that you put on your glasses, but it made everybody cross-eyed.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.520]   I've had great headaches from Portland 3D.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.840]   Oh, this is not good.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   You can really get eye-strained.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.480]   Oh, I can't wait to get this technology in my home.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.880]   And I thought you a lot of people said they get headaches just using put them on.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.560]   I'm getting a headache thinking about it.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.920]   The format relies for the, for this is for the new Buddha Blu-ray spec.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.080]   Relies in an extension to the H.264 encoding standard.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.320]   Provides for a fallback to 2D output on players that can't decode it.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:11.240]   You have to get a new player and a new TV.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:17.400]   It requires it goes along with an update to the HDMI spec to support it.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:24.040]   It's doing something called MVC, Multi-View Video Coding.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.960]   It's an extension of the H.264 AVC.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.480]   I wish they'd spend more money on good writing.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.960]   Give me a story.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.960]   You know what?
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   You know what?
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.960]   Okay.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.960]   Okay.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   You saw the movie Adam.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.960]   Oh, you didn't see the movie.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   It's a good time.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.880]   What a bunch of lame geeks you are.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.160]   It was released last week.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.680]   But you're supposed to go to the midnight show for crying.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   I know.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.440]   I usually I was there for Watchmen.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   I did up.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.040]   Aren't you glad you saw Watchmen before anyone else?
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.400]   That was pretty awesome.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   No.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.400]   No.
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   It was a crappy movie.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.400]   That was the wrong answer.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   It was a good.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.400]   It was a good.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   It was a good.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400]   It was a good movie.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   I like it.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.400]   See, I wait.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   It wasn't that bad.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   God awful.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.920]   I'll go back to the way you said you see like separate eyeballs.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   You got one eyeballs.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.320]   Like a chameleon one eyeball.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:12.480]   Is this so you could.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:15.600]   So one of your eyeballs can just keep an eye on all that cash you're making.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.560]   I always get an eye on you, John.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.400]   I've got to keep an eye on the Vorac because you never know what he's up to.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.360]   You can look at that and still do the show.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.400]   No, I was I was I was born that way.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:33.680]   It's something I can't remember what it's called, but it's strabism or something.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.640]   I think the Vorac's going to go a little cross side.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:40.120]   He's got one eye on you and your money and another eye on the sign that shows his website
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.200]   that he's flashing on his head pointing a third way.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.200]   It's crazy.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   The man's insane.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.440]   All right.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:50.200]   As long as we're visiting channel devoreac.com, why don't we visit one of our fine sponsors?
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.360]   How about that?
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.800]   John, you may go based your meat or whatever.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.040]   I always have to base their meat.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.240]   In the middle of his silly show.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.840]   Actually costume change for Mr. Devoreac.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:05.200]   I once saw Carol Channing and she had a in a I think was at the Vinny Shittram in the
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.200]   Fairmont where they have all the great acts and she had a you know, like what do they
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:14.560]   call those screens changing screens and she would like every song she'd go behind the
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.200]   changing screen and come out with a new outfit.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.840]   She wore 20 different outfits in one show.
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.240]   You're like that, John.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   Want to tell you a little bit about audible.com and I know Andrew, you're an audible listener.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.880]   I tell you, let me quote Jason Calicanis and say, oh, horrible.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.880]   I love it.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.800]   Anybody who spends any time and see Lisa, I was going to set you up in that Mustang with
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   all the audible books.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   You could listen to books driving down a Vegas.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.280]   It would have been so great.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.280]   I can learn.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.160]   You can't drive a stick.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.960]   You can teach me.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.880]   I'll teach you how to drive a stick.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.800]   I'm going to be I'm going to be teaching Abby and Henry, both my kids to drive a stick.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.320]   We can have like a little driver.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.160]   Yeah, we'll have a driver training thing.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.040]   I'll just get a second break and a steering wheel put in the car quick.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.160]   Audible is the leading provider of audio books, more than 60,000.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.760]   I think it's now up to 70,000 downloadable titles across all types of literature, including
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.400]   fiction, nonfiction, periodicals.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.920]   And right now you can get a free book just by joining Audible.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.080]   Actually, I'm going to give you two books.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.080]   Go to the platinum plan, audible.com/twit2.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:22.000]   First two books are free and Andrew, you got a recommendation for us?
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.600]   I got so many recommendations.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   Let me give you one.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.600]   If you let me on.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.920]   How long have you been an audio listener?
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.560]   So long that my username on Audible actually includes the word palm pilot.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.560]   Wow.
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.920]   Because I never thought I would have anything but a palm pilot to listen on.
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.640]   Yeah, now it's on 135 or something like that.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.280]   Devices, including your Zoom and your iPod.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.920]   So said, tell us some of your favorites.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.920]   All right.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.680]   Actually, here, let me give you two of them.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.680]   Okay.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.600]   First is a book called The Real Deal by James Kahn.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.760]   The only, I never heard of this guy before, to me James Kahn was the actor.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:58.600]   But apparently James Kahn is a businessman in the UK.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.120]   And Audible kept showing me his book as one of the best sellers.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.600]   And I finally said, all right, let's get it.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   Why not?
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.040]   Because you get these credits and it lets you experiment with books that you wouldn't
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.040]   otherwise listen to.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.320]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:13.600]   This is a guy who started out with nothing but a phone in a closet essentially.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.680]   And he built up one of the biggest businesses in the UK.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.840]   He was in the HR business in the head hunting space.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.680]   And you watch him through this story.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.760]   Go from being in this little room to building up a team of people in a smoky room that's
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:33.120]   still tiny but a little bigger than that little closet to a big company.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   And you watch it grow and you grow and you grow.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.960]   And I train for a marathon as I listen to this book and man, did I run hard because of
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   that.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.440]   And that's one of the reasons why I turned to Audible.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.400]   I love podcasts like yours and mine because you get about an hour and a half of information
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.280]   and it's fun to listen to.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.200]   But for longer runs, for longer commutes, I like to get lost in a book.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.760]   And some books like this one really motivate you and get me, get you fired up.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:02.840]   James Connell, just like the actor C double A and the real deal, my story from Brick Lane
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:05.320]   to Dragon's Den.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.320]   What else?
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.560]   All right, here's I'm going to give you another one because I listen to all your shows and
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.440]   I don't think I don't think you guys talking about this.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.480]   You don't just have to subscribe to books.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.960]   It's not just books that you can sign up for with Audible.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:22.720]   There's also magazines and radio shows and TV shows that you can listen to.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.640]   And one of my favorites is Charlie Rose.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.840]   I bought a one year subscription to Charlie Rose and I keep renewing it.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.920]   He's incredible.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.560]   He brings authors on and when he interviews an author, I almost don't need to read the
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.800]   book afterwards because he dives so deeply into it and makes it so interesting.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.240]   So Charlie Rose is my second suggestion.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.400]   You know, that's a really good point.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:47.600]   You don't mention often enough that Audible is more than just books and yeah, you can
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:52.360]   watch or listen to really TV shows like Charlie Rose.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.920]   You can get the Wall Street Journal, which I imagine for somebody like you, Andrew is
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   a real boon to have that kind of thing.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.600]   And I think they give you the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times for free with
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.000]   a subscription, but in addition to it, you can sign up to something like, and you could
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.720]   tell me if I'm wrong, but in addition to that, you can sign up to a show like Charlie Rose
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.040]   and you don't get just one episode for your credit.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.840]   You get a month's worth of shows for that one credit and you're giving people two credits
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.160]   so they can get more than that.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   That's a really good point.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.400]   I never get to see Charlie Rose.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.160]   I always wish I were seeing it.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.920]   A one month subscription can be added right to your cart.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.320]   Audible, this is Andrew.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.720]   I'm glad we got you on.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   Great.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.960]   Two really great picks.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:38.480]   Audible.com/twit2 you're going to get two credits when you sign up for the Platinum account
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.080]   and I promise you, you're going to love it.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:45.760]   The best way to spend time when you can't read a book, when you're stuck in the car
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.680]   or whatever, it's just fantastic.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:50.880]   Thank you so much, Andrew, for your recommendations.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.200]   We'll put those in the show notes so you can just click a link.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.360]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:02.880]   Thank you for your support, Audible.
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:03.880]   John, you back?
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.840]   No, the guy's not back yet.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.840]   What the hell?
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.840]   Who is that?
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.840]   Who is that there?
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.120]   There's a guy with a hunting cap and a beard on.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.720]   I'm the Tech Grouch.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.400]   Tech Grouch.mevo.com.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.480]   I've been watching your show and you are grouchy.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.560]   Why are you so angry, Tech Grouch?
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:26.640]   What else is there to do?
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   Well, you could listen to an Audible book or something.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.280]   I mean, you don't have to be so angry about everything.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.480]   Yeah, well, I'd listen to an Audible book once.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   What do you guys think?
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.640]   It was a guy talking in my ear.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   Where's the book?
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.320]   It's an audio book.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.320]   Huh.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.720]   Do you have a computer Tech Grouch?
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:50.720]   I'm a computer expert.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.320]   Oh, oh, you are.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.200]   Is that because you live next door to Devorak?
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   Yep.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.560]   He taught you everything he knows.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.640]   No, that's the joke of it.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.280]   I taught him everything he knows.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.160]   He doesn't know crap that guy.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.760]   You mean, you're the inspiration.
[00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:08.080]   You're the guy who teaches John C. Devorak all his stuff.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.080]   Yep.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:11.000]   It's always some old fart like me.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.320]   I didn't think there was anybody older than John C. Devorak.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.320]   Plenty.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.680]   So, is there anything in here we're going into the Christmas season, a little holiday
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.960]   cheer, a little holiday spirit from the Tech Grouch.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.200]   You can't be grouchy all the time.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.160]   Maybe there's something that you'd like to share with us that makes you happy.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:34.720]   Well, you know, there is a lot of, you can buy your own 3D glasses nowadays.
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.720]   Bring them with you.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.720]   Anywhere you go.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.680]   I think there's a lice problem with some of these glasses.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   Uh-huh.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.800]   They should not be recycling them.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   That's a good point.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.800]   Never really thought about that.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:47.800]   You don't know who's wearing that glass.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.120]   Also, portable radio is handy.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.120]   Portable radio?
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.400]   Why would you need a portable radio?
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.400]   Earthquake.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:58:01.800]   Always ready, are you?
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:05.320]   So the VORAC says he's going to be based on his meat for a while.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.920]   I don't know why he's taking us so long.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:08.920]   Well, why don't you join the show and you could-
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.520]   He's going to take some eight minutes or so.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.520]   I know.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.680]   He's a little slow today.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.760]   Let me introduce you to Andrew Warner here.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.560]   He is from MixerG.com.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.560]   Howdy.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:23.760]   Andrew, he does a, they're podcasts right, Andrew, about entrepreneurship and businesses
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.120]   on the internet.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.280]   I started out doing audio like you and then moved on to video the way you do.
[00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.600]   I'm going to follow everything you do.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.600]   Just go 3D.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   I go 3D, my friend.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.680]   You will never see me go 3D.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.280]   I think that's something we're just going to have to.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:40.520]   Unless I get to get Adam here to help us out, maybe he can't.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.920]   He does stop motion.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:43.240]   This is kind of cool.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.240]   Worked on Coraline.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.240]   Just really-
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.760]   You don't stop motion this weekend, Tech.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.520]   I don't even have to move.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:49.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.680]   And Tech Grunch, Tech Grunch.
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.680]   Tech Grouch.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.680]   Let me-
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.680]   Tech Grinch.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   Tech Grinch.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.160]   Yeah, for the holidays, I think we'll call you the Tech Grinch.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:03.000]   Right below you on the screen, Lisa Bettany from mostlyleaser.com.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.600]   Wow, she's a photographer.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   She's a photographer.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.160]   You know why she's interesting because she's been a model.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.840]   She's been an ice skater, professional ice skater.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:15.920]   But now she takes pictures of other models and is a very accomplished photographer.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:17.280]   She's vertically integrated.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.280]   That's what we'd skate.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   Yep.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.320]   And she cannot drive a stick.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.320]   I can't.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.840]   I can't be talented at everything.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.840]   I have to have my weekend.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.840]   That's because when you were a teenager, you didn't focus on the things normal teenagers
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:30.840]   focused on.
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.200]   You can't drive a stick.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.680]   Sorry.
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:38.360]   Tech Grunch is not happy.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.360]   Did you-
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:42.960]   How old were you when you started ice skating?
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:43.960]   Probably three.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   Two.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.720]   And when did you get really serious about it?
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.920]   Probably when I was maybe five or six.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.840]   What, really?
[00:59:54.840 --> 01:00:03.480]   I had to turn my head in nine.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:07.360]   And so you actually moved from Saskatoon to Vancouver to study with the- or was it Toronto?
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.000]   Where did you move to study with a coach?
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   Oh, well I lived in Calgary and Toronto both for following male partners because as you
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.840]   know there aren't many male figure-saters so you have to kind of go where they are.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.840]   Go where the guys are, huh?
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   So I saw you say-
