[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400]   I turned to Roger Daltry.

[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.000]   What is your title? Are you CEO?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.800]   Yeah, CEO.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.600]   Still the CEO.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.560]   I know, I don't think.

[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.760]   Very cool.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.840]   For more than two years, I've kind of pulled the wall over there.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.000]   Still the CEO.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.800]   David Spark is here, former PR flack, but now he's --
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.320]   No, never PR flack.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.840]   Rehabilitated.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.720]   I'm so sorry.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.200]   So David's here because I have to make an apology.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.720]   To make amends because last week we were talking and then we were talking --
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.880]   Two weeks ago, we were talking about your great article.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.640]   Was it on Mashable?
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.200]   Mashable.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   About ways people are monetizing.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.720]   I think John and I were talking about.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.960]   And thank you, John, for giving me props on the article.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.320]   You're welcome.
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.520]   What do you say?
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.560]   Call to say Mashi's?
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.360]   Yeah, I remember it was like Masha, Masha, Masha, Mashi.

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.920]   But it was all together.

[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.520]   Where did you moments ago saying that he's a pro when it comes to broadcast?
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.560]   He's an absolute --
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.040]   Look it.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.840]   Let me tell you something.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.280]   He knew it was Mashable.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.360]   He knows exactly what is going on.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.160]   I know.

[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.800]   Acron arrows.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.440]   Oh, arrows.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.160]   It does look like nerds from this.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   From this?
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.640]   You know what I'm even playing to Skype, John.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.960]   No, I don't think it's a Skype issue.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.960]   I think it actually is a poor logo, is what it is.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.720]   I think it's that hot purple issue.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.600]   That voice, ladies and gentlemen, you might recognize that voice.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.360]   It's the great Baratunde Thurston.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.080]   Wow.

[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.880]   Now let me see if I can get all the credits right.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.640]   You see him on the science channel with the show as called.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   Popular Science is Future of.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.880]   Future.

[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.560]   but normally every week in New York City at the --
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.440]   The Sage Theatre.

[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.120]   Did I get it all?
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.680]   I am the co-founder of Jack and Jill Politics.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.240]   I don't know that.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.720]   Is that a site?
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.600]   It's a political blog.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.160]   I love that.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.960]   Pimp that too.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.600]   I love that.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.320]   Why not?
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.440]   So, did I say everybody's name?
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.720]   I think everybody is here now.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   And we also have some audience members who are just here for fun.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.120]   Adding a little pulcretude to the ensemble.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.720]   And let's talk tech.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.400]   Starting with John, I want to start with a story
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.160]   that you just mentioned right before we began.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.680]   The face that everyone sees when they sleep.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.160]   By the way, my wife who has vivid dreams and kind of can go
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.680]   at dream and then remember most of it.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   She said she has never seen this face, A, and she went into her dream
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.160]   and asked everybody in the dream if they had ever seen this face.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.080]   And nobody -- everybody said, "No, this is bogus.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.320]   This whole thing is made up by somebody or other."
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.840]   The story is that some guy is going to his therapist's office.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.440]   And there's a drawing on the desk.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.680]   Is that how it happened?
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.560]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.080]   Apparently, there's somebody drew this face and this other guy said,
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.440]   "Well, I've seen that face."
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.320]   And then this guy looked into it and said, "Apparently,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.840]   these other people have seen this face too."
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.040]   So a lot of people are having a dream with this face in it,
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040]   which looks a lot like David Spark, I might add.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.280]   It looks like, actually, it looks like one of those --
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.480]   Does not look like me.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.000]   It looks like one of those --
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.480]   Whoa.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.800]   Identicate faces, you know, where they say --
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.880]   You know, Paul Schafer a little bit later.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.640]   The comedy Mitch Fattel.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.120]   Okay, but I'm asking you.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.320]   So universal, it's like a face with that's really nondescript.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.080]   That's very eyebrow-ish.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.280]   He's got big, bushy eyebrows.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.040]   Narrow lips, kind of a --
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.240]   Narrow top lip part.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.520]   Kind of a fat, lower lip.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.040]   You know what it looks like to me?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.560]   It looks like one of those, you know,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.400]   woolly, woolly, magnetic toys.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.760]   That's what it is.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.400]   People are just remembering their childhood with woolly, woolly.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Yes.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.880]   If we could just move the eyebrows down to the mustache and --
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.720]   You could spare some hair down there.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.600]   Let me --
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.360]   Now everybody's saying it's a hoax.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.160]   Well, of course it's --
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.080]   What do you think I was proposing?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.600]   That this was actually true?
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   So --
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.160]   So?
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.640]   So, hoax, what a discovery.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.920]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.640]   And you know what?
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.080]   There was nobody in the balloon.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.880]   Oh.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.520]   Oh.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.680]   I'm shocked to discover gambling.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.880]   I bet you'll be --
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.000]   Let me guess though that the baritunde --
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.280]   Some words are crooked.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.240]   -- Yeah.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.320]   What?
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.680]   I'm guessing tonight, baritunde,
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.840]   there'll be a little talk about Falcon the Balloon Boy.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.760]   You know, here's my thing with the balloon boy.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.000]   I successfully avoided knowing what that story was about for four days.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.480]   Me too.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.440]   I saw the hashtag.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.480]   I was like, I will not click this.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.040]   I will not click.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.160]   Don't send me links.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.320]   And I remained willfully and intelligently ignorant about this.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.480]   The only reason I knew about balloon boys
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.440]   because I happened to be attending the real-time web summit.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.040]   And we're all talking about balloon boy.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.440]   Balloon boy.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.600]   Blue-till it's the latest thing that's going on right now.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.280]   And it's all balloon boy nonsense.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.840]   And I was sick.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.880]   I was supposed to be there.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.280]   And I was laid up in my hotel room and I was like, I'm not clicking.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.320]   Not good for you.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.880]   Good.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.400]   You avoided the whole balloon boy contagion.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.720]   I have to say that this was an example of --
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.920]   I think the online world doing a much better job than mainstream media of this.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.000]   Almost immediately I saw a post saying,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.480]   well, I've calculated the capacity, the current capacity, the mylar balloon.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.040]   And it gives him the amount of square footage in the helium lift capacity.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.880]   That balloon could only hold 30 pounds.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.600]   There's absolutely no way there's a child in there.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.280]   Any idiot would know that.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.720]   I love the internet.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:03.080]   I love how you do a colossal impression of everybody that posts online.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.840]   That's how everybody sounds like that.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.640]   Universal nerd-voiced the neck beard voice.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.040]   You know why I could do that because I've got many of these people to come and visit our offices.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.240]   Now it's Jerry Lewis.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.120]   Oh, it's Jerry Lewis.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.560]   It is turning into GSR.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.840]   I like that though.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.240]   It's good.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.040]   It's a good Jerry Lewis.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.600]   Your doctor's professor.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.240]   It's Frank.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.320]   Yeah, professor Frank, exactly.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.560]   All right.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.440]   We've covered the two biggest stories of the week and neither of them had anything to do with tech.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.640]   Maybe we can just move on.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.600]   Balloons are very high.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.560]   Balloons are.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.040]   Balloons are.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.000]   Mylar.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.640]   It was mylar.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.840]   That's shiny.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.360]   Takes a lot of technology to make a helium balloon that can lift a 30-pound boy.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.200]   A real boy.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.920]   A real boy.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.360]   I want to be a real boy someday.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.840]   Well, it's the reverse of the boy getting stuck in the well.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.720]   That was baby Jessica.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.520]   No, up in the air.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.160]   That was baby Jessica.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.200]   She is the best child suffering victim of all time.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   Really?
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.400]   Oh my god.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.600]   She's got hours, days.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.720]   Days, days of coverage.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.440]   You didn't know well.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.920]   Who doesn't?
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.160]   Who no one has a well, but we're all compelled by this idea of a child in a well.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.880]   It's beautiful.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.640]   In fact, that became the canonical child loss story.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.320]   Anytime they're on the Simpsons, they want to mock TV news reporters,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.520]   they have them looking down a well.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.000]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.120]   It's just kind of like the thing you do.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.840]   Although, the mashup of the balloon and the girl down the well
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.760]   could have just ended that much more quickly.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.480]   That would have been awesome.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.680]   Send the balloon down the well.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.160]   Send the balloon down the well.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.600]   And I'm with the boy balloon.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.520]   There you go.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.480]   Hot.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.520]   Why didn't we think of it?
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.280]   She's not going to do make a positive.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.800]   Next week on Shrending Time.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.120]   Well, balloon boy.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.080]   Well, you actually, David, you've been doing a little studying on real time search.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.840]   I mean, trending topics is a real wasteland on Twitter.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.960]   And yet isn't that real time search?
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.560]   So, yeah, I happen to be actually writing an analyst report for Gigah Oman.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.680]   This very subject.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.880]   Which is why I'm proud of that.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:56.040]   I went to the real time web summit and their, well, Twitter has its own search.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.240]   And they have the trending topic.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.280]   By the way, have any of you seen the site, WhatTheTrend.com?
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.320]   I use, I use, I use, I use, yes.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.360]   Obviously.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.600]   How do you think he's quickly typing that?
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.400]   There for three seconds.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.960]   Oh, you've seen it.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.520]   It's in 24 seconds.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.720]   Oh, I have known about that for three seconds.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.960]   It's real time.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.680]   Oh my goodness.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.640]   It's real time.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.160]   No, but every time you go to look at whatever the trending topics are,
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.680]   how can you know by just the words or the, you know, what it is?
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.120]   If you go to the, WhatTheTrend, it will explain what these things are.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.640]   And usually it's a community like everything else with real time,
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.000]   web community adding in the definitions of what all these trends are.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.520]   I use, I use Brisley.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.000]   Same here.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.040]   Yeah, Brisley does that.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.160]   Oh, that's good.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.000]   Brisley is a, it's funny.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.520]   You know, I don't know how this is a business.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.840]   It's like, oh, well, this is the web page we think Twitter should have done.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.440]   But it has, one of the things it has is if you click on a trending topic,
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.800]   it'll, it has, and it's kind of like a wiki.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.520]   It explains it.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   There's a thing that says next to it, why.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.200]   So here's balloon boy and you click why.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.920]   It says, how do you spell Brisley?
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.400]   B-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.600]   Oh, why, of course they would.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.880]   Titans, Periturias, Pat's, Tom Brady, NFL, T-D's.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.160]   But you know, some of it's stupid.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.280]   Like every night, it's good night is when you're trending topics.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:11.720]   A lot of noise in these.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.200]   You'd think Twitter would kind of get little whys about that.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.960]   Now, Twitter added, I think, a feature this week that is actually
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.280]   revived Twitter from the dead for me.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.720]   And that's lists.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.000]   That's done, done, done.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.800]   Have you actually used it?
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.280]   Were you on the list?
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.240]   Yeah, I'm on the list.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.320]   You're not supposed to talk about it.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:29.800]   What?
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.200]   Because Calicarena has posted it out and then a minute later,
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.040]   he was like, oops, I wasn't supposed to say anything.
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.440]   Sorry.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.480]   They didn't end the Amy.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.120]   They just put it on--
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.520]   What are they?
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.680]   Sorry, Calicana spoke too soon.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.720]   Did I have reading this correct?
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.440]   What a shock.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.720]   So if you are one of the anointed,
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.160]   you'll get this thing on the right hand side of your Twitter that says lists.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.840]   And you can create lists.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.360]   You see, you get 20.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.800]   I've used all 20 of them.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.760]   And so let's see, I have a list of tweets.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.480]   And it's all the people in--
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.080]   I have 56 names in there.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.800]   And then people can follow--
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.320]   This is the thing.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.680]   There are two things that make it valuable.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.720]   First of all, you can follow somebody's lists on mass.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.920]   It's like a group follow.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.960]   That's patch follow.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.520]   That's a good--
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.720]   It's a group follow.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.520]   And that, frankly, replaces the suggested user list,
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.600]   which is really a broken feature on Twitter.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.880]   If you weren't on the list.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.160]   As all of us who weren't on the list.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.960]   Exactly.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.000]   It's so broken.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.680]   Everybody on the list is like, keep it going.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.880]   Well, you know who's on the list is people who have millions of followers.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.160]   That's how they got their list.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.760]   That's the only way.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.200]   In fact, it's interesting because I want to say Drew Barrymore.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.080]   Who's the guy Drew Carey on the Price is Right?
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.120]   Oh, Drew Carey, right.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.360]   He's asking to be on--
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.840]   He wants to give a buck per follower up to a million followers.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.240]   Yeah, I'll do it.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.800]   Exactly.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.120]   He will follow Drew from TV, at Drew from TV.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.280]   But he's only like at 100,000.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.640]   And my point is, even with the campaign where you get everybody saying,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.680]   follow Drew, follow Drew, you can't get to a million.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.280]   You need to be on the SUL list.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.720]   The person he needs to ask is Ev.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.320]   I want to be on SUL.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.680]   Anyway, maybe this list is--
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.520]   However, I digress, which is pretty much nice.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.480]   Yeah, come on.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.800]   This is kind of like the wave crap from Google, which is useless.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.240]   I don't think this is useless.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.600]   I think this is pretty good.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.800]   Yeah, thank you very much.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.240]   That doesn't even look like it.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.680]   What are you talking about?
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.040]   You just want to use the word wave.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.720]   I think you want to use the word crap.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.920]   Use the word wave in a sense.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.240]   Crap.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.960]   No, this could be cool.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.720]   I mean, I've used TweetDeck a lot because you can create groups.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.120]   I have a comedian group, political group, geeks.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.400]   But they sync with TweetDeck on the iPhone, but no other apps.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.000]   But even more valuable, I now go to @Baratunde.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And you've got a list of comics.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.720]   Exactly.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.960]   I press one button and I follow all those comics.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.400]   You can see what they're talking about.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.840]   So it's a great way for influencers to curate their influence even more.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.600]   Curation is exactly what it is.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.400]   Or it's Follow Friday taken to its illogical extremes.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.280]   Follow Friday is obnoxious.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.320]   Right, exactly.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.840]   Because it lacks context and I've been harping on this endlessly.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.960]   Well, this doesn't.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.520]   This is exactly what Follow Friday should have been.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.840]   And I think, frankly, this is a breakthrough for Twitter.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.640]   For several reasons.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.800]   First of all, it's the first time I can remember
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.400]   that Twitter has added a significant feature.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.960]   Right?
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.040]   I mean, they do not like adding features.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:18.600]   Rather than replies.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:19.720]   Right.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.840]   And they almost had to do that.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.400]   Kind of leave.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.840]   Oh, we got our API open.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.400]   So everyone else will add the features.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.480]   We don't have to add them.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.920]   But you need some core things like in the service itself.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.720]   I agree.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.880]   But well, let's find--
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.640]   It's the name, Radik.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   It's a radio.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.560]   John's taking care of that.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.120]   Go ahead, John.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.600]   What do you think?
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.960]   I think we're starting to talk about Twitter again.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.640]   It's quick like that.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.520]   It's that or the balloon boy, John.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.040]   I don't know.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:46.480]   Come on.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.760]   There is news out there.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.160]   All right.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.000]   Tell us your big story of the week.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.760]   Well, how about your friend Vivocundra, who obviously
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.120]   had something to do in Virginia some time ago.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.640]   And now there are $2 billion.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.160]   They have a whole Virginia computer system
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.240]   that they've been trying to put in for the last few years.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.120]   It just looks like they just throw billions and billions
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.240]   of dollars down the toilet.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.520]   And this is probably something that he--
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.080]   Why is him or his pal one of the two?
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.800]   Why'd you call him my friend?
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.400]   I don't think he's my friend.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.000]   Yeah, I know he's no fan of yours.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.160]   Well, I wouldn't think.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.640]   You've been trying to get Vivoc in trouble for a long time now.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.360]   Well, him and his other--
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.480]   Yeah, well, because why do we have at the top of government
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.880]   people that don't have any credentials that
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.640]   are making huge decisions that will cost the taxpayer
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.840]   lots of money?
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.320]   Isn't that what government does?
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.000]   Is that just defying government?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.880]   So we're supposed to say, oh, great.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.440]   That's what government does.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.600]   That's not what government's supposed to do.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.000]   District of Columbia this week hired a specialized search
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.840]   engine developer and entrepreneur.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.360]   Oh, that's a bad start right there.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.240]   As its new chief technology officer,
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.480]   overseeing what is arguably one of the most visible,
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   progressive, and troubled municipal technology
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.640]   operations in the US, Brian C. Vac
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.040]   is the founder of Enquirer, a privately held San Bruno,
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.440]   California-based knowledge management firm.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.560]   He succeeds Vivocundra, who, of course, is this nation's CIO.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.000]   Right.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.040]   Where's the story?
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.320]   I'm making it up as I go along.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:17.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.760]   Pretty good ad-libbing, though.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.280]   That's awesome.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.560]   That's so professional.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.400]   Well, that's my job.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.000]   That's what I do.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.960]   That's what I do.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.240]   All right.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.280]   No, this is a story in the computer world.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.200]   This is what you're talking about, though, right, John?
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.120]   That's kind of the tail end of the story.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.480]   The real problem is some contract they did with Grumman
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.240]   that apparently to revamp the entire state.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.080]   And it just hasn't gone anywhere.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.560]   I don't know why Grumman would get a big multi-billion dollar
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.760]   contract for computer services when there's a company like,
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.240]   let me think, IBM, UNISIS.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.080]   There's these companies that kind of specialize in that.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.440]   I'll tell you, I'll give you a big story for this week.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.520]   Google announced it's quarterly results
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.400]   and a resounding success.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.480]   Now, it's not its biggest quarter ever by any means,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.640]   but it was up 8%, and given that the online ad space has
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.400]   really been suffering, that's a huge--
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.960]   that's a big, big number.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.040]   Well, they also said they're on the acquisition trail again,
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.120]   which I think is interesting.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.560]   They're going to start buying.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.600]   And they're hiring again.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.680]   That's a go-go time for go-go Google.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.040]   Go-go Google, man.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:26.400]   Work it.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   Tim-ah.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.040]   Work it.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.480]   Tim-ah.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.240]   So why?
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.480]   And the other thing.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.960]   But I haven't finished.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.640]   So a new report out from Arbor, they
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   did a two-year study of internet use
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.480]   and found that Google was--
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.200]   Google traffic is 6% of all internet use.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.040]   There was a while ago, it was showing its highest 10%--
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.840]   as high as 10%--
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.320]   for Yahoo's because of all the property they own,
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.880]   they were getting 10% traffic.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   Huge traffic.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.200]   That's higher than Google.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.640]   And-- and this was the most interesting result
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.520]   from the whole thing.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.280]   In all likelihood, Google's bandwidth bill for all of this
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.840]   is zero.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.760]   Peering.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.680]   Very tuned-day.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.120]   Boo, yeah, you saw it from telecom too.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.620]   What?
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.120]   Good work.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:12.620]   Let's go.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.200]   It's getting to router time.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.040]   All right, I attempted on this weekend Google yesterday
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.040]   to define peering, and I didn't do such a good job.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   Would you please explain to the crew?
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.160]   So you would have--
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.840]   we used to have a really top-down system where small ISPs
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.800]   talked at large ISPs, talked at large ones,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.960]   and connect these big metro area exchanges.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.360]   Often, instead of billing between two parties,
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.280]   they'll pull their resources and simply swap traffic.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.760]   It simplifies billing, and you have
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.920]   sort of a net balance of payments, which occurs.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.520]   Instead of 100 billion going this way,
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.480]   99 billion going that way, the bill's net 1 billion.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.060]   Buying the greases that all together and says no cash.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.900]   The net result is free, isn't it?
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.860]   And then there are costs involved.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.060]   They're still moving traffic.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.420]   Well, the cost of actually the fiber--
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.500]   Yeah, the lane that fiber--
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.500]   --exactly own.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500]   It's not like--
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.100]   And you have to amortize that over a long period of time.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.460]   So they're still accounting charges taking place.
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.820]   But it's not in the same sort of ongoing operating
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.540]   expenses that you would think metering your electricity
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.900]   at home for a lot of money.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.220]   So the whole 500 million a year is--
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.060]   Doesn't really work that way.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.440]   Yeah, that was the number that was Credit Suisse
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.020]   or one of the analysts came up with it that YouTube alone
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.440]   must be costing them half a billion dollars a year.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.980]   In fact, it's--
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.940]   Gusek, the other thing that Google did this brilliant
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.200]   is when the dot bust happened in 2001,
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.820]   they went out and bought a lot of dark fiber.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.780]   Right, but the thing is--
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.860]   But they bought it, and now they're actually using it.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.660]   So they're actually amortizing.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:35.500]   They're actually--
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.000]   Really?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.820]   How much do we know that they're actually using?
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.380]   I don't know.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.180]   Do you have any documentation on Google's fiber access
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.580]   that they own?
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.820]   This report-- unfortunately, I think
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.660]   you have to buy this one of those analysts reports
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.980]   where they tease the content.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.500]   But I haven't been able to get the full report.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.940]   But Arbor has been doing this for two years.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.580]   I mean, they've been aggregating information from--
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.460]   I think they said 100 ISPs, backbone providers, institutions.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.100]   I mean, they've really been looking at it.
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.660]   So I would imagine that when they say that this is how much
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.300]   data Google's using, and this is how much of it
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.740]   is going over their own fiber that they probably
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.820]   know what they're talking about.
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.860]   But you're right, John.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.620]   I can't tell because I'm too cheap to buy the report.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.420]   Maybe someday I will.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.460]   John looks like Wilson--
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.020]   Anybody at the table has got the money.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.520]   Thank you.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.780]   Maybe you should have your own report.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.540]   They have a peering relationship with Arbor,
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.820]   and they can give you the report for free.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.100]   We benefit from peering.
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.500]   There you go.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.700]   Because bandwidth for the shows that we do in all the video
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.900]   would be hugely expanding.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.220]   We'd pay about $40,000 or $50,000 a month.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.980]   And AOL, who needs to have a peering relationship,
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.100]   because they're a big content sucker,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.380]   needs to be a content provider, gives us free bandwidth,
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.580]   cash fly to.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.700]   And I've convinced they haven't told me this,
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.780]   but I'm convinced it's to balance their peering relationships.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.500]   That makes sense, right?
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:49.980]   It does, right?
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.380]   Especially AOL.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.940]   Because AOL probably--
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.980]   although-- I don't know how much longer that's going to last.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.660]   There's still there.
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.140]   There's still headquarters and everything.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.580]   Actually, you know what's interesting about it?
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.500]   I think I mentioned this in the show a while ago.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.380]   But when they bought WebLogs, Inc. and all those blogs,
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.460]   they are now a huge content provider,
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.020]   because they have some of the best, most successful blogs
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.540]   in the industry, including a gadget.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.820]   It's a video podcast.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.660]   What's so funny in the fact that they own these top tier
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.940]   geek content, where before they're all about the lowest level
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.380]   content they could possibly handle.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.500]   They've re-invented themselves.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.620]   Yeah, they've re-invented.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.260]   They also have TMZ, though.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.020]   So let's be clear here.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.780]   Do they have TMZ?
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:30.780]   Wow.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.540]   But Yahoo's got OMG.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.500]   Have you seen OMG?
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.100]   No.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.940]   Go to OMG.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.420]   I haven't there once.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.420]   Yeah, who?
[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:37.460]   It's better than TMZ.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.460]   No, but the thing is, like, not--
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.460]   Do you work--
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.660]   That sounds way too smooth.
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.540]   Is that like saying the stuff on the bottom of your right shoe
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.540]   is better because it's part of your left shoe?
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.500]   Pretty close.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.980]   Pretty close.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.300]   All right, I got to do an ad speaking
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.100]   of appearing relationships.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.780]   So you may all take a break.
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.980]   John, if you want to baste your meat,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.140]   you just go right ahead.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.180]   Are you cooking--
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.700]   Are you cooking?
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:58.900]   I know.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.620]   It sounds nasty.
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.140]   It's not.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.780]   It's actually couldn't be more wholesome.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.740]   John, you love Sundays.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.020]   No, actually, I have to run down to the--
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.220]   What the hell is that?
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.660]   What is he doing?
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.860]   He's got a big fluffy animal in there.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.740]   Go ahead.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.900]   I have to run down to an event after the show.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.860]   So I'm not basting my meat today.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.420]   Oh, all right.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:19.940]   Nothing on the--
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.180]   I will change out of this purple outfit
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.260]   and put on something less flashy.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.780]   Would you clarify for me because there's
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.860]   some debate in the chat room.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.780]   Is that a sweatshirt or a sweat or?
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.780]   It's a sweatshirt.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.460]   OK, somebody thought it was knit, which would make it a sweat
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.460]   or a warm--
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.500]   No, I knew it.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.420]   --for our British listeners a jumper.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:38.860]   A jumper.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.860]   John, are you wearing a jumper today?
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.740]   All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.540]   I want to tell you about the great folks at Citrix
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.220]   and go to meeting.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.980]   Here comes the pitch.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.700]   Stand back.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.580]   That's a little baseball metaphor for those of you
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.500]   watching the post season.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.060]   Go to meeting.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.500]   How many times have you been on a phone call
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.420]   and tried to say, OK, now, imagine if you will.
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.340]   I've got a PowerPoint presentation.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.300]   Slide one, and you start describing the slide.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.620]   It just takes all the fun out of it.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.100]   See, this is the beauty of go to meeting.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.980]   With go to meeting, you set up that meeting ahead of time,
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.540]   send them an Outlook message.
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.620]   It does that automatically.
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.060]   Or you can even do it on the fly while you're on the phone.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.620]   It's that easy to use.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.740]   You just say, hey, look, I want to show you this.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.460]   I got some magic here, a little magic I want to show you.
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.620]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.780]   All right, see that button on the left there that says
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.900]   join a meeting, click that.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.180]   They don't have to install any software.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.500]   They just enter the meeting ID, and all of a sudden, boom.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.180]   They're seeing the PowerPoint for themselves.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.660]   You're walking them through the presentations.
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.860]   Great for sales.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.500]   You can collaborate on a document.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.580]   You've got a word processing document open.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.180]   You say, OK, I'm going to let you type here, too.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:48.380]   And you can both-- it's like Google Wave before there was a wave.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.780]   It also works for training.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.860]   So if you've got the software in your computer and they don't,
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.300]   you can say, well, let me show you how you use it.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.700]   OK, now, you want to try it?
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:56.460]   You can take control.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.580]   You can even swap control back and forth.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.340]   It's from Citrix.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.980]   These guys really know remote access.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.260]   They've been doing it for years.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.580]   Do you remember Jim, the good old days of comics?
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.380]   Do you ever meet Ed Jakobuchi?
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.980]   I've known Ed Jakobuchi for a while.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.060]   He actually almost drowned me in a hot tub at an industry event
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.740]   once.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.100]   Really?
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.580]   Yes.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.980]   But you were asking for it, right?
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.380]   No, I was asking for it.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.380]   You said trash.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.940]   It was late, and there was much frivolity going on.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.540]   It's a great guy, though.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.660]   I want to know the details of how you got into a hot tub with him.
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.060]   It was a large fellow.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.500]   He was a hot fellow.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   I think you're selling me all the o-s.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   He was on the O.I.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.780]   He didn't know this.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.300]   You can't do hot tub meetings.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   That doesn't work online.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.860]   That doesn't work online.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.060]   He was part of the OS2 team.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.500]   Well, that's what's interesting.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.140]   Because remember, there was a swap between Microsoft and IBM.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.700]   Ed was on the OS2 team.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.180]   And the OS2 team came to Redmond.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.700]   And Microsoft sent people to Boca.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.380]   And I think Microsoft ended up running most of OS2.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   And Ed wrote much of NT, which is how he got to know all
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.500]   the kernel, right?
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.260]   And so he was able to do the remote access stuff.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.660]   In fact, Microsoft licensed it right back immediately.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.820]   That's where the remote desktop came from, his Ed's code.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.340]   So anyway, this guy knows remote access.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:05.900]   He's no longer there.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.420]   I think he does like some sort of jet.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.260]   He has a jet company.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.060]   And I actually was in-- he's still in Florida.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.060]   I was down in Palm Springs.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.620]   And I put on Twitter that I was there, and I didn't check.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.980]   I got a message, and I'm like, you're here?
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.260]   Come have dinner with me.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.380]   And I totally missed out.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.220]   So I don't know.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.260]   I said, am I going to Florida?
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.300]   And if you listen to Twitter, please give us a call.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.340]   We can get you on the show sometime.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:23.820]   It'd be fun.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.820]   You know, I'm connected to him.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.060]   It's a good excuse me to reach out and get him to come up
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:27.660]   and be on the show.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.740]   He's awesome.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.340]   He's got a great voice for Rayman to have a deep voice.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.140]   So he'd be good.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.780]   He does funny because you've got to story about Ed.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.020]   I got to story Gina Smith and I were in a rental car with Ed
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.900]   when he backed into a pylon and totaled the car.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.540]   It was a rental car.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.860]   It was great fun.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:41.580]   Well, you're alive.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.100]   I'm alive.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:42.780]   So I'll be there.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.260]   We survived.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.700]   But it sounds like Ed was kind of--
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.060]   The tech is really dangerous.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.340]   Apparently so.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:48.700]   Yeah.
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.500]   It's like really dangerous.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.660]   We'll talk about comics.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.580]   Those were the good old days.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.060]   Anyway, GoToMeeting is from Citrix.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.260]   The roots of remote access are deep with these guys.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.060]   They know what they're--
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.780]   I almost sound like you.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.260]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.820]   What happened here with John?
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.020]   John's gone findly.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:04.500]   Oh, man.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.700]   He's got--
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.220]   This is no better, John.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.940]   Well, let me finish the commercial.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.620]   Then we're going to talk about John's sartorial shows.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.500]   We're still in the commercial.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.580]   We're still in the commercial.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.620]   Only can you keep derailing it.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.140]   GoToMeeting.com/twit.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.180]   That's the thing I got to say.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.460]   If you go there, you could sign up for a free 30-day trial.
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.300]   I'm not kidding.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.980]   This is the best.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.020]   We use it all the time.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.340]   We use it on the shows.
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.340]   It is the best.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.740]   GoToMeeting.com/twit.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.380]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.900]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first twit
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.100]   we've ever had a costume change during the show.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.420]   Very Britney Spears, if you chose.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.340]   It is.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.860]   It looks like it's not a Scottish whiskey.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.780]   Findlay?
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.140]   Findlay is the Division II NCAA football championship
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.220]   team from last season.
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.220]   Damn.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.940]   All right, here's a test for your listeners
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:51.940]   and your chatroom people.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.140]   I say OH.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.380]   You respond with--
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.060]   OH, wait.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.420]   Overheard.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.820]   See if the chatroom got it.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.180]   OH.
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.020]   Yes.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.420]   It goes to Foxman.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.260]   I owe.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.340]   Oh, they all got it.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.220]   Are you from Ohio?
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.500]   No, but I have family and friends there.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.180]   It's a great state.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.740]   I always love to get a little love to.
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.100]   That's good.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.220]   OHIO.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.940]   And it's just like when you're in Texas, if you go--
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.940]   What?
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.940]   What?
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.340]   I don't know how to speak Texas.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:19.860]   No, no, no.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.980]   In Texas, you go--
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.260]   If you go deep in the heart of Texas--
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.460]   They do this in the P.E.W. Herman movie.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:28.980]   Did they?
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.500]   Yeah, they were the reference to that.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.340]   [WHISTLE]
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.100]   OK, that's really-- we really want to say it.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.860]   Yeah, yeah, we could tell when I'm in Texas.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.500]   Yeah, no.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.340]   Hook 'em horns.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.380]   Hook 'em laugh when I see Jada that.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.060]   It's very orange.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.220]   But Jada thought it was going to tone it down.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.860]   I'm going to have to-- I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.460]   I think I'm with this orange.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.460]   I gave you a new camera.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.500]   We gave him the Vodjatek 9000.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.700]   And it's making you look like a Muppet.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.700]   There's some--
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.140]   I don't know if it's the clothes.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.660]   It's right.
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.220]   It may have to do with a helmet.
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.380]   Is there a Muppet setting on that camera?
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.020]   Because it has a lot of features.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.460]   I know it's got a lot of cool settings you can set it to.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.380]   That's so funny.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.620]   It's like super saturated.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.380]   Maybe it's just--
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.020]   What is with your collection of stuff, man?
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:16.940]   You never met him?
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.260]   You don't know him?
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:17.940]   Let me tell you.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.100]   Well, I used to read information week in high school.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.580]   There you go.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.180]   Some of them are nerd.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:21.700]   Oh, that's good.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.020]   But I never saw a stuffed animal collection in that town.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.860]   This guy used to be the back end of InfoWorld.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.420]   For many, many magazines.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.420]   Well, then PCU's also--
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:29.900]   Back end.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.900]   But you were the--
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.300]   Back end of InfoWorld.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:32.620]   You were the--
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.620]   I believe the John--
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.860]   That the puppets were ghost writing for them.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.540]   Or the stuff that--
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.060]   The Muppets.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.900]   Or whatever they are.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.820]   No, John was the last page in InfoWorld.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.940]   Weren't you, John?
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:44.860]   For a while.
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.900]   That was-- was that when you made your bones?
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.300]   No, actually, when I quit is when I--
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.300]   it was when I went to PC Magazine.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   PC Magazine is where you really became famous.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.220]   So we'll never forget the great inside track column, which
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.860]   is in how many years now they've been doing that?
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.180]   It's going private shortly.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:06.700]   Oh, yeah?
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.860]   It's been going on since 1981.
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:09.620]   Jesus.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.220]   I mean, jeez, Louise.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:11.780]   Yeah, I know.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.460]   It's ridiculous.
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.740]   It's like mentioned in Bacon, now I'm
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.100]   in trouble with the Christians.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.140]   Bacon's awesome.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.780]   Oh, by the way, why don't you tell us--
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.580]   tell the viewers out there, or listeners,
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.300]   that what happened in Dubai?
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.780]   I like Dubai.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.620]   You completely misinformed me.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:27.180]   I felt like--
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.780]   Well, I just said I thought it was creepy.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.780]   I felt like--
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.020]   It's what he does.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.460]   I felt like--
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.020]   I felt like Humphrey Bogard.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.700]   That's what he does.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.660]   Sorry.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.020]   I felt like Humphrey Bogard and Casablanca,
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.660]   and he's like, I came here for the waters.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.860]   But Greek, we are in a desert.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.540]   I wish mission formed.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.740]   You implied that there was something kind of odd about it.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.500]   In fact, I found it to be a vibrant, exciting place.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.380]   It's actually, I think, kind of inspirational.
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.580]   Because-- and everybody who's there is telling me this.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.780]   They love Sheikh Mohammed, the guy who runs it.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.700]   His father started it.
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.020]   Dubai is part of the United Arab Emirates.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.140]   But one of them, they have less oil than a lot of the people.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.100]   And they knew that they would have to have an economy,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.620]   post-oil economy.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.060]   So his dad and later Sheikh Mohammed said,
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.940]   we're going to build an economy not based on oil.
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.940]   Dubai is in a good position as kind of a hub from to Africa
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.140]   to the rest of the Middle East.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.380]   Boy, you really drank the Kool-Aid on this one?
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.140]   I got more.
[00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:28.740]   I'm not done.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.820]   The chamber got to me, man.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.020]   And so it's really go-go.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.940]   It's tax-free.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.580]   It is basically-- they're building 24/7, even in a recession.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.060]   No, you've never seen the photographs of how fast
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.300]   that city's building is out of control.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.580]   But a lot of people kind of focus on the ski slope
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.060]   and the mall, the world's--
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.660]   They don't focus on the slave labor.
[00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.540]   Well, I keep hearing slave labor.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.140]   What makes you think-- I mean, how are they slaves?
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.940]   Are they locked in?
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.100]   Just look it up.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.940]   They get these people.
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   They suck them in the cum and they give them a bunch of money
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.940]   in advance and they can't leave until they pay it off
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.100]   and then they don't give them the salaries they're supposed to get.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.100]   It's just a known scam that's going on.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.020]   Because sometimes they got you to work on some tavents.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:05.980]   It's not easy.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.540]   Oh, yeah, you guys are right.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.180]   It's fine what they're doing.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:10.620]   Well, I'm not-- I'm not kendony.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.060]   I just don't know.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.060]   I didn't ask people.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.300]   Oh, it's supposed to be in debt to the tuna about--
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.180]   But he's beating me off here.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.220]   No, I think he is.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.380]   And a lot of it's to Abu Dhabi.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.580]   They borrowed a lot of money from their sister, Emirate,
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.220]   which does have the oil.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.380]   But I think that he's leveraged because he's
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.580]   trying to build something.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.660]   I don't think-- one of the attitudes a lot of people
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.620]   say is a lot of the other shakes in the other countries
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.060]   will just take the oil money and enrich themselves.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.260]   And he's trying to at least build--
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.420]   That's not necessarily true.
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.380]   And Kuwait, they spread it amongst the public,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.380]   at least the citizenry.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.620]   Yeah, well, that's one thing that is true.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.660]   There is a very rigid class structure.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.540]   There's the Emirate.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.140]   There's only 300,000 of them.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.180]   There's 6 million expats.
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.180]   There's a managerial level that's all European and Indian.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.300]   The next level down the drivers, the white collar, blue collar
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.540]   jobs are Pakistanis.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.420]   And there's Chinese and Filipino service staff.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.260]   And below that, the construction workers--
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.780]   I'll tell you, if you're in 100 degree
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.380]   weather, being a construction worker is not a prime job.
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.460]   So I did ask one of the drivers.
[00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.220]   I said, tell me how you got here.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.940]   He said, well, he's from Pakistan.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.940]   He said, they have an agency in Karachi.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.340]   And I said, did they lie to you?
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.820]   And he said, well, they kind of--
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.220]   I said, it's like army recruiters, right?
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.620]   They kind of implied that it'd be this and that.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.660]   But he's not unhappy.
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.460]   He's making money.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.620]   He gets a month off every year to go home.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.780]   And he's sending money to his family.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.740]   And he has a three-year contract.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.140]   So at least you asked.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:44.540]   That's good.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.460]   Well, I wanted to know.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.180]   And I didn't talk to a construction worker.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.220]   I didn't run into any.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.340]   And I don't know if it's worse for them.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.860]   But I don't know if slave--
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.380]   look at John.
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.100]   I think it's probably a lot like New York City
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.380]   was in the 1880s.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.860]   Oh, there you go.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.180]   Probably like San Francisco was to the Chinese
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:00.700]   when they built their--
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.220]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.940]   Mrs. Not the 1880s anymore.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.460]   Yeah, it was probably like San Francisco in the 1860s.
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.420]   I mean, come on.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.820]   Yeah, it's a boom town.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.460]   You know, I don't know.
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:10.940]   You're right.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.020]   I'm not condoning or saying I even know anything
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.300]   about the human rights conditions there.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.620]   And it could very well be terrible.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.980]   But my experience of the place was very--
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.900]   it's being sold as the Vegas of the desert.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.300]   It's definitely not that.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.020]   It seems to me a boom economy much like Singapore, much like
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.060]   the Asian Tigers are Beijing.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.420]   Did you go skiing?
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.900]   On a skyscraper.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.540]   Jennifer said, we've seen malls.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.300]   Let's not go to the mall.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.180]   So we didn't go to the malls.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.580]   We went to--
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.500]   No, that's too bad.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.420]   It's not quite the same malls that you get.
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:40.940]   All right.
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:41.900]   I didn't shopping.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.500]   It was not valid.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.460]   We took the water taxi down the creek.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.100]   They call it the creek.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:45.940]   I don't know what it is.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.060]   It's a giant river.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.020]   And it took the water taxi down to this golden spice souks.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.660]   And that was kind of cool.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.580]   You know what the best thing was, John, is the event itself,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.700]   where they had a lot of speakers from all over the Arab world.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.220]   This is TEDx.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.740]   It was a TEDx, which is a franchise TED.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.300]   It was an all day event.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.780]   And they had speakers from Saudi Arabia.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.500]   And I met people from all the Arab world.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.020]   They had a speaker, Masarad, who goes to India.
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.300]   She has something she calls eight-day school, where they go to India.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.260]   She teaches girls who are really not being very well-educated
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.580]   about computers.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.780]   She says, we could go from knowing nothing about these
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.660]   to being able to use office.
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.580]   That's kind of-- I don't know if that's the best thing for them
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.620]   to learn, but how to use the internet, how to use Microsoft
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.780]   at office in eight days.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.740]   And it's really empowering.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.420]   I mean, it's really exciting what she's doing.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.140]   I met a lot of interesting people.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.100]   And I think I got a better picture of the Arab world.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.740]   And my message to them was, we need to hear your story.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.940]   Because we get a story in the US that is perhaps not reflective
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.220]   of who you are.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.620]   We hear about the extremists, the fundamentalists.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.340]   A lot of people came up to me and said,
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.900]   I'm not a religious fundamentalist.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.060]   This is not who we are.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.740]   It's like them getting a view of us from saying,
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.500]   Glenn Beck represents all of America.
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:52.860]   Exactly.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.980]   He represents some people.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.180]   Well, that's what I said.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.780]   I said, we have extremists, too.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.860]   And I understand.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.740]   And maybe this is what new media can really help us with,
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.700]   which is give you a chance through podcasts, through blogging,
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.700]   to tell your story.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.100]   And I think you need to tell your story,
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.900]   because we need to hear it.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.020]   That it's not this unified homogenized world
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.340]   that we get in our media.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.780]   So I think it was a very fruitful exchange of ideas.
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.580]   It was really great.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:20.940]   I had a great time.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.740]   And it doesn't hurt that we flew a business class on--
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:24.380]   Whatever it's--
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.100]   Is it true what they say?
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.900]   No, there is a shower, but I didn't see anybody in it.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.620]   How was the technology on the plane?
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.420]   What did they say?
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.780]   I don't know.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.100]   I came in a fourth to hear what business class
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:36.660]   emerged like.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.140]   It's very not.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.260]   It's like business class and other.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.700]   Although they have-- the screens are 20 inches.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.700]   They're big screens.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.740]   Their entertainment system's really good.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:44.900]   20 inches for each seat.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:45.700]   Nice.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.860]   It's a big screen right in front of you.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.260]   And a listener-- and I would say hi to Bruno, who's
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.300]   a pilot for Emirates.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.180]   He flies the 380.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.100]   The 380, the big--
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:55.780]   Oh, nice.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.900]   Did you take the 380?
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.900]   No, it was just 777.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.020]   He says, we don't get a lot of traffic from the US anymore.
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.580]   The economy's really killed us.
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.340]   But we get a lot of traffic from Toronto.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.180]   So we fly the 380 out of Toronto.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.380]   And it flies full every day.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.500]   He says, wow.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:10.580]   Massive.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.260]   Toronto, I was just in Toronto.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.780]   That economy is not hurting.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.540]   I was at a mall in Toronto.
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.940]   Jam packed.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.100]   No problem whatsoever.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.940]   I love Canada.
[00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.420]   I miss going up there.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.820]   Was there-- you want to go back?
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.020]   Well, I have a client now.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:25.940]   You can take joy.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.820]   The client?
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.100]   You in your PR business?
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.900]   No, not my PR.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.980]   What do you do?
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.260]   All right.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.460]   So I have--
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.860]   You sound like his mother.
[00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:35.020]   What do you do?
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:35.820]   Do, David.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.180]   Is it in computers?
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.340]   It is in technology.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.260]   Most of my clients are in technology.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.620]   I have a custom publishing company.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.660]   I help companies tell their story of their company
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.460]   to get the information out there.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.900]   But it's all publishing, publishing, print, radio, TV,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.620]   and online.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.220]   And would you disclose your client
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.780]   tells us we know if we can trust you?
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.180]   Entertainment Media is one of my clients in Toronto.
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.700]   And they actually are releasing a pretty cool new product.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.660]   It's called Itty Bitty.
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.420]   And the version that they're releasing is with NBC.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.060]   It's called the NBC.com communicator.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.940]   And it's kind of like a cross between Skype and Hulu.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.860]   So it's like a-- it's a communications app where you get--
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.220]   So you call somebody, but instead you get the Simpsons?
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.100]   Like everybody looks like bars.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.300]   It's not on NBC.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:17.800]   Oh.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.660]   But it's on Hulu.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.660]   No, but the idea--
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.740]   Yes, you can--
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:21.340]   Oh, yes, you're right.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.980]   But the idea is that you can have text, voice, and Zoom video
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.780]   chat.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.580]   And then also, all within the desktop app,
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.620]   also be able to watch videos of anything you want.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.540]   And anyways, it's going to be available at the end of this month.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.500]   I didn't ask you for a plug.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.500]   I just wanted to disclose your--
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   Yeah, geez.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.820]   NBC, Gmail, and YouTube.com.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.100]   You've now proven why I didn't want to have you on the show
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.220]   in the first place.
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.220]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.620]   No, I was getting my plug in.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.860]   David was--
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   worked with us at Tech TV's and old friend.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.780]   And I apologize for thinking you were a PR show.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.300]   I work sometimes with PR friends,
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.900]   but I don't do APR whatsoever.
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.220]   In fact, this is an all--
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.220]   I'm constantly on your channel, John.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.380]   This is an all Tech TV issue.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.100]   And I'm not seeing that--
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.220]   But John doesn't have any scruples about that kind of thing.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.220]   I'm the one who has the scruples.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.220]   One of the scruples.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.060]   One of the scruples is a make.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.740]   Well, you know, I think that that's actually
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.580]   an interesting question.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.020]   There seems to be a thread--
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.740]   and Jim, I want your opinion on this,
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.660]   because I follow the Jim Latterback ethical principles.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.820]   When we were at Tech TV, you had a great document.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.620]   We all signed that I think is still the template, the pattern
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.260]   for me, on ethical principles and journalism.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.220]   I thought it was really, really good.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.860]   But lately, it seems to be--
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.660]   and I was talking about this with Jay Rosen from NYU
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.020]   at Blog World.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.580]   There seems to be the trend that anything goes as long
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.180]   as you disclose.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:39.940]   So it's--
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.100]   It's a rhyme.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.420]   I know I like that.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.180]   I'm just working on my motivational speaking.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.300]   It's OK to take money.
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.380]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.020]   I was invited-- a good publicist I know
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.540]   said, we do these junkets to Asia.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.060]   And Sony and Nokia pay for it.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.820]   And I said, I don't do that.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.740]   Put me in the pocket of Sony and Nokia.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.140]   She said, what are you talking about?
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.180]   Everybody-- Tech, Crounge, everybody does this.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:05.620]   Everybody does this.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.060]   You just disclose it.
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.220]   And to me, disclosure does not compensate
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.220]   for the potential conflicts of interest.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.540]   But it all depends on what editorial brand
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.660]   that you're creating.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.460]   Well, that's right.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.220]   And that's what Jay said.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.940]   That's what Jay Conch is editorial brand.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.860]   It's very different from Twits editorial brand.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.380]   And if they don't have a problem with writing stories
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.300]   about companies they invest in just because they disclose it,
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.060]   then, and to story that they're editorial brand.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.260]   And that's exactly what Jay said.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.540]   And he said, the point is, as long as the viewer listener,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.420]   reader, knows, you let them decide.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.820]   But my point to Jay was, but there
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.260]   has to be somebody who stands above the fray.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.940]   Otherwise, we need that person.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.940]   Leading into the whole FCC nonsense is wrong.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.260]   Yes, we're going to get to that.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.180]   Very good.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.060]   Let me throw in my two senses.
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.820]   This is an issue.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:55.300]   First of all, most of these ethical considerations,
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.780]   which are not the same in Europe, by the way,
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.300]   as they are in the United States.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.740]   Neither is exact whatsoever.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.380]   In fact, in Europe, they expect the vendor.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.740]   For example, if you have a vendor event in Seoul, Korea--
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.980]   Did you see the lap dancers in the Japanese event,
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.740]   by the way, yesterday?
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.660]   Yahoo.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.540]   Yahoo hack had it.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:17.780]   They do this Yahoo hack-a-day thing where
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.140]   programmers come.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.260]   There's a video on YouTube.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.420]   They had lap dancers come.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.660]   So they'd get the programmers up on the stage, sit in the--
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.740]   and these lap dancers come and dance in their lap.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.740]   And they thought that this was cool.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.500]   Where was this?
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.820]   This was taking place in Japan.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:30.340]   Tokyo.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.100]   It's embarrassing.
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.020]   It's embarrassing to me.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.940]   Who was?
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.260]   I'm always done in Texas going out for lunch at a strip club.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.620]   Both men and women is a totally normal thing.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.180]   But that's a different country.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.180]   Dude.
[00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.340]   That's in Europe.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.580]   That's in Europe, isn't it?
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.700]   Can you just hear Carol Bartz, the new CEO of Yahoo,
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.980]   start talking about this?
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.420]   The four-letter words that are going to come out of her mouth
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:54.620]   and tie it in.
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:55.580]   She's great that way.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:56.420]   She's salty.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.140]   She's salty.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.620]   Love that.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.140]   By the way, can anyone explain Yahoo's current ad campaign
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.700]   to me?
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.700]   It's about you.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.700]   Why?
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.220]   Why explain?
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.700]   Why explain?
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   You take out the A and the H, the a part,
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.860]   and then you're left with you.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.220]   It's the crappiest.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.220]   That's what it is.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.380]   Is it worse than the windows have a party ad campaign?
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:17.140]   Hey, I'm having one Thursday.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:17.620]   Are you?
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.140]   I'm having one.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:18.820]   Come to my party.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.420]   Let me show you the party pack.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.420]   What?
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.420]   You got the party pack.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.420]   I was trying.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.420]   I was trying.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:28.380]   So I was trying to get Lloyd K, so I used to work with an extreme
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:28.900]   tech.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.540]   I asked, by the way, Silky here.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.540]   Beautiful.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.740]   So I was trying to get Lloyd to come into techzilla to do this
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:34.740]   on Thursday also.
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.260]   I don't know.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.260]   You can come to our party.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.260]   Come to our party.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.060]   CNET's going to come and visit.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.340]   So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Windows 7 party
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.340]   pack.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.340]   John, did you want to finish your thought before I open this
[00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.340]   box of fun?
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.340]   No, no, no.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.860]   I can-- I can blather on about this for days.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.460]   Can you supply it to your--
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.460]   So why is Europe different?
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.940]   I mean, you say we had to have more of a European perspective.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.020]   This whole thing, there's all this ethical stuff, including
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.020]   that document you're talking about, pretty much was designed by
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.620]   the New York Times for the sole purpose of giving the New York
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:05.300]   Times an advantage over smaller papers and smaller venues.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.260]   If you have an event, say, for example, that's taking place in
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.820]   Tokyo, there were breaking news that's going to take place, it
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:14.460]   would normally be expected in the European press that some
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.220]   companies would fly you out there, Sony, Nokia.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.820]   And if you read the European reports, they're not giving
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.500]   them any breaks just because they got a free flight.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.220]   The New York Times has it that no, no, no, you cannot go to
[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.900]   this event on Nokia's-- you cannot go to the Nokia event on
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.140]   Nokia's dime.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.420]   We have to pay for it ourselves on our dime, and then you can
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.380]   go and be more objective when you report on it.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.980]   I'm thinking this is just to keep out the smaller papers that
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.220]   aren't going to send anybody.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.900]   Or blodgers who can't afford to go.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.540]   The basic scam and the fact of the matter is if Nokia's
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:48.420]   putting on an event they want to drag you over to it, they
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.700]   should pay.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:51.620]   OK, that makes sense.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.900]   So calm.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.700]   You're missing the heart of some of the--
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.980]   I mean, yes, you're right about bringing people over, and I
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.500]   think that as long as you disclose, there's definitely an
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.460]   argument to be made there.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.860]   But it's the giving of equipment without telling people.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.300]   And it's just you need to make sure that people--
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.460]   that you disclose.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.540]   And I think you have to stand above it a little bit.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.060]   I applaud you.
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.580]   Well, yeah, but the thing is still about the editorial view.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.180]   If you want to be the--
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:16.980]   You're a great man.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.180]   You're telling me that's the profit.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.180]   You're right about anybody.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.180]   You're right about anybody.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.420]   So I'm going to be a car reviewer.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.380]   So I'm going to drive the Chevy Malibu one week.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.100]   Then I'm going to drive the Chevy, whatever they are.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.260]   Because then I'm going to afford--
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.500]   if you just-- anybody think I'm buying these cars?
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.980]   Consumer Reports actually buys their cars, don't they?
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.340]   Yeah, they do.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.580]   It's cool to get stuff in the model.
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.900]   But it's fine to get stuff loaned to you as long as you give it.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.260]   Fine.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.940]   Then Consumer Reports basically what you're saying.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.460]   And by the way, I would like to see that documented.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.380]   That they buy these cars.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:44.880]   They do.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.380]   They do.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:45.880]   They buy them.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.780]   And they also--
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.180]   They also didn't accept advertising.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:48.680]   That's right.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.180]   I don't have Kevin McCain on the show.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.180]   He's the editor of--
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.680]   He's the editor of PC World.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.180]   Anyway, you want to see my own assistant?
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.300]   I don't think the public.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.820]   Everybody's thinking, well, we're looking at stuff that's
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.180]   especially trade media.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.580]   Who cares?
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.180]   I mean, we--
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.180]   I can't tell you why.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:05.180]   I'll tell you why.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:05.680]   I think--
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.180]   I'll tell you why.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.180]   I think government and no one cares about that.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.380]   Trade media is the most important one.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:08.880]   Exactly.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.180]   Because you're closest to the subject that you cover.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.260]   It's the beltway problem.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.980]   If you cover the Washington political scene in Bar today,
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:15.980]   you weigh in on this one.
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:16.980]   I would rather be reading someone who
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.340]   knows something about Intel, who's an engineer,
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.540]   and even a guy who works at Intel-- in fact, by the way,
[00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.420]   there's a lot of new journalism that
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.060]   is going to start bringing people from actual places
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:30.220]   where they work and have them write about stuff.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.100]   Because they can write from a perspective that actually
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.140]   makes some sense as opposed to what we've
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.820]   been trained in these journalism schools.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.100]   They have some neutral observer who doesn't actually
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.900]   know anything, but they can maybe ask the right questions.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.540]   If they're lucky, the fact of the matter
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.860]   is in the 21st century, they don't
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.100]   know what questions to ask and they never will.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:48.660]   Well, you're right.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.780]   By the way, this is the model for my business, John.
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.060]   Thank you for setting me up.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:53.820]   Just make it free.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.820]   I appreciate it.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.180]   I help companies tell their own story,
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.620]   because the companies need to tell their own story.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.500]   If you go through a PR agent and tell a journalist
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.220]   and they sell it, you're like selling cocaine.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:06.700]   No, sure.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   We all three times.
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.220]   We all know.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.140]   You just sell uncut cocaine.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.140]   Any time you read a general press report about a subject
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.820]   you know about, whether it's poker or Pokemon,
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.060]   you know they get it wrong.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.060]   They never get it right.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.980]   If it's a deep subject, they never get it right.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.140]   So that's a good point.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.340]   But I'm with you, Jim.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.100]   Somebody has to stand above the fray
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.660]   and be editorially pure.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:26.700]   Not everybody.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.260]   And I think to say that it doesn't matter in trade press.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.540]   It sort of misses the point, because whatever the industry
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.300]   is, it does matter if you're making a purchasing decision.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:36.980]   If this is--
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:37.500]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:38.380]   You want somebody's system--
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.940]   That's assuming what you're assuming is that there's
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:41.980]   a level of corruption.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.900]   And I agree with that.
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.620]   No, it doesn't matter if somebody's out and out corrupt.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.980]   But we're as having to assume--
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.260]   we can't make that assumption.
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.260]   We have to assume that most of these people are honest.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.700]   And if they're not, you can get catch up.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:54.140]   Why do you have to assume people are honest?
[00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:54.980]   I assume people are honest.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.700]   Everything if they want to.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.140]   But I don't think--
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.540]   They're my practical reasons why.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.540]   Take a look at the individual writers
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.900]   and determine whether you think that they could be prejudiced.
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.260]   There's very few writers out there that aren't bigoted
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.060]   about one thing or another in terms of their--
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.380]   There are many, many shades of gray, John.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.260]   There is the completely honest journalist who takes
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.020]   90 dying from anybody and then the person who
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.860]   shields for anyone who throws them a buck.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:19.420]   And then there's so many shades in between.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.900]   And the point is is that--
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.780]   The point is is find where you want to be in between.
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.260]   There are more practical reasons, too,
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.860]   when you are testing a type of product
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.860]   and helping people to decide how to spend their $1,000
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.460]   on a notebook or $2,000 on a TV or whatever.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.540]   And if all you get is really expensive equipment for free
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.780]   and you're used to using it, you have no sense
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.100]   of how the normal person who's taking money out of their pocket
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.180]   that they worked an entire month for
[00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.380]   and what they're going to end up using.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.540]   And getting that into reviewers' heads--
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.020]   Yeah, I get a new computer every day and it goes back
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:48.780]   and I get another new--
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.460]   It's a very unrealistic point of view.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:50.960]   Exactly.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.380]   It's fine, but I think people can pick up on that.
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.260]   I think the more important things are, for example,
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.060]   during the era of WordStar, if you'll recall,
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.020]   every writer, no matter who it was,
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.020]   because they all had a free copy of WordStar
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.020]   at some point or another, or whether it's bootleged
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:08.220]   or given to them, compared every other Wordpress processor
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.300]   with WordStar as a standard that really wasn't a standard.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.500]   And now Microsoft Word is a standard.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.860]   That's not really a standard.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.460]   I'm more concerned about that kind of prejudice, bigotry,
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.660]   and skewed reviewing than the fact
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.540]   that somebody's reviewing a $5,000 LCD
[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.700]   and he thinks it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.580]   And yeah, maybe you don't sympathize with the guy
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.500]   that can't afford it, but the guy can't afford it.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.580]   He's not going to buy it anyway.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.620]   So what difference does it make?
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.420]   But the thing is, if you keep doing it,
[00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.460]   you will eventually get exposed.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.580]   And that's a wonderful thing about the internet is
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.540]   that they uncover frauds very, very quickly.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.180]   We aren't a better era for that.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.340]   That's where you are.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.180]   We need a new era for sure.
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.980]   Choose to not be transparent.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.700]   You will eventually be exposed.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.620]   Okay, well, let me tell you.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.740]   Do you think there's anything in there that's the same color
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.500]   as Dvorak's orange?
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.660]   I think there is.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.500]   I wanted to go over this.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.420]   I got this free from Microsoft.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.820]   There's a copy of Windows in there too, right?
[00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.820]   Yes. There's a free copy of Windows,
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.140]   and it's a free copy of Windows 7.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.700]   So now we can't believe what you say.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.300]   But Leo's having a party to pay for it.
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.740]   I am. You have to invite nine people.
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.660]   So that's why they give you nine napkins.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.420]   They have to be very nine neat people.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.980]   I complain via Twitter that I did not get invited
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:16.820]   to one of these and so I apologize.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.180]   You have to apply.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.380]   No, no, you go to ask.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.700]   You're invited.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.540]   Oh, you're invited.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.380]   Come to my party.
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:23.540]   I was looking at one of the--
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.820]   The Chachkis.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:29.420]   If you come October 22nd, you're all invited to the cottage.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.940]   Come by. That's the day Windows comes out.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.820]   Our party starts at 11.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:32.780]   Look what we've got.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.020]   We've got a blue streamer.
[00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:34.860]   11 AM.
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:35.660]   A streamer?
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.500]   A streamer?
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:36.980]   That is.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.820]   That is John.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.820]   That's John.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:39.820]   The Borac Orange.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.300]   Can I open it?
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.180]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.020]   That's almost as good.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:42.860]   Wait, you're going to ruin it.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:43.700]   It's for the party.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:44.620]   Don't drink it.
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.460]   It's for the party.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:46.460]   All right, all right.
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.300]   All right, all right.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.300]   Let's see.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.140]   The Borac Orange.
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:49.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.660]   It's exact match.
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.780]   How did you know, John?
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.340]   John and Microsoft pay you to wear that orange jacket.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:55.820]   OK.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:56.580]   And here's--
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.420]   It's a hoodie.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.060]   That's yellow.
[00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:58.700]   That's yellow.
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.100]   It's hard to tell those lines.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.620]   OK.
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:03.340]   Here's a special puzzle, a jigsaw puzzle.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:03.780]   What is that puzzle?
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.700]   That's what Windows desktop--
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.180]   A puzzle is work.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.780]   No, this is what they call an activity.
[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:09.940]   But this has to do with you.
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:11.100]   You've all seen the video.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:11.940]   You've seen the video.
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:12.940]   You think I was joking?
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.140]   Nine Windows 7 napkins.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:15.980]   Can you put those on?
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:16.260]   Can you put those on?
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.020]   Hot tail napkins.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:17.740]   Just nine.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.940]   Don't have 10.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.180]   And don't have messengers.
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.820]   Can you sell those on eBay?
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.980]   People are selling these on eBay.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.780]   This party packet.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.220]   Wow.
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.740]   A Windows 7 card.
[00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.500]   Deck of cards.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.300]   Pro gambling.
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.300]   I could play solitaire if nobody shows up.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   It's not happening.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.180]   The cards have pictures of various Microsoft executives
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.100]   who are the government's most to kill.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:36.780]   That would be kind of funny if they were naked.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.740]   But no poker.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:41.540]   I'm afraid it's just a Windows desktop thing.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.460]   It looks like a Peter Max illustration.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:45.620]   Are they undifferentiated balloons?
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.020]   They don't say windows are nothing.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.660]   They just balloons.
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.940]   So you can get some for your child's party.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.540]   So this is just a birthday party pack.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.660]   This is a plastic bag you put over your head after.
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:56.260]   Nobody shows up at your party.
[00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.260]   OK.
[00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.900]   I can't believe I just sold it.
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:00.900]   I can't believe I just sold it.
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:01.900]   Can I ask the world a question?
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.180]   John, what wine do you think goes with a Windows party?
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.380]   I'll give you the wine.
[00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:08.380]   A wine and a buy.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.380]   A wine and a buy.
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.380]   I shouldn't have upgraded.
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.380]   No, it's a win.
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.380]   It's a win.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.380]   It's a very evil wine.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.380]   That's very evil.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.380]   Man.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.380]   And then this is--
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.380]   There's the material for you for tonight.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.380]   Yeah, really.
[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:19.380]   I'm thinking Windows 7 parties on this place.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.380]   No, they look like play-smats.
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.980]   But these are actually-- they're nine of them.
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.220]   Lovely Windows 7 gift bags.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.980]   But there's no gifts in them.
[00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.620]   You just supposed to-- I guess I have to, as the party host--
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:30.620]   Make your own gift.
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:31.620]   Make my own gift.
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.620]   Because you're supposed to buy Windows 7 for all the guests.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.620]   Can you make a copy of Windows 7?
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:35.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.620]   Oh, good idea.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.780]   I'll just copy this DVD.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.260]   And I'll put it in there.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.740]   Just copy them and disk.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.180]   Here's nine coupons for Kaspersky antivirus.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.980]   You think Microsoft really wouldn't-- well, given that they just released their own three
[00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.900]   antivirus programs, what's the point?
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.140]   I just-- you know, it's like-- oh, and as long as you can use Windows 7, you might
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.140]   want these.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.060]   Well, that's because they got Kaspersky to pony up big bucks to be in the box.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.580]   Free license to Kaspersky.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.260]   Oh, as if that weren't enough, Free License for Norton's 2012.
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.220]   So they're already saying this product doesn't work.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.220]   Yeah, that's the interest in the product.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:13.540]   They're always saying, as long as you're going to use Windows, you might want some protection.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.540]   There might as well be condoms in here.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.540]   You might as well have a little-- here's Neerom.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.540]   That'd be a better party.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.540]   This is actually so you can burn the DVD, right?
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.340]   Yeah, you can make copies.
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.140]   Windows 7 exclusive offer for Corel.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:26.140]   Corel?
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:27.140]   Wow.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.140]   They're still in business.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.140]   Corel draw that.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:30.140]   Corel, isn't that a competitor with Microsoft?
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.140]   Look at-- this is cute.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:34.140]   I'm going to give these to each-- each of you for coming to my party.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:36.020]   Okay, this is a thank you card.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.440]   Thank you for attending our Windows 7 launch party.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.100]   We don't want you to leave empty-handed.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.500]   We were too cheap to give you a copy of Windows 7.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.540]   But now you can get offers for Windows 7 at--
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:50.140]   I'm wondering if I'm a little bit of a writer's embellishment there.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.140]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.140]   I didn't actually say that.
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.140]   So a Zoom pass for two weeks.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.140]   For 14 days.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.340]   Yeah, I mean, we're not done.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.140]   There's more crap in this box.
[00:50:58.140 --> 00:50:59.940]   There's more crap in the box.
[00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.540]   Here's this interesting packaging.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.740]   This is a Ziploc bag.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:06.340]   I believe this harkens back to Bill Gates' early days as a software distributor.
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.340]   Oh, right.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.340]   The whole brew computer club.
[00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.340]   And some sort of--
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.340]   More paper.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.340]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.340]   It's a set card.
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.340]   It's a centerpiece.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.340]   That goes right in the center of the table.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.340]   Don't get flowers.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:19.340]   This is getting a lamer by the minute.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:20.340]   I mean, it started.
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:21.340]   You're getting lamer?
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.340]   They're more?
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.340]   This is the best part.
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:26.340]   This is the signature edition of Windows 7.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.340]   Ooh.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.340]   Does it scream at you?
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.340]   Malipers, Malipers.
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.340]   You found a little mess.
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:33.340]   I'm so sorry.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.340]   Malipers, Malipers.
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:39.340]   No, but there is-- I believe there's a little vial of Steve Sweatt inside.
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:40.340]   That's disgusting.
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.340]   Maybe disgusting, but I've got his DNA and I'm going to close it.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.940]   I see it be fun here for Dan O'Foond and his voice started screaming.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:46.940]   I love this company.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.940]   I love this.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:48.940]   So there it is.
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:49.940]   That's the Windows 7 party pack.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.940]   Come on, come on.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:51.940]   I'm going to get my card back because-- Oh yeah.
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:52.940]   And he's one sorely dis-appointed.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:55.940]   They don't get their thank you card.
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:58.940]   The eighth and ninth person come and get-- feel get screwed over.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.940]   Is there any way for them to verify that you're throwing a Windows 7 party?
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.940]   Like, what if you just have a party?
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.940]   So can anyone actually define for me if that video that they put out that Windows 7 video?
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.940]   That video was a joke.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:10.940]   No, it was real.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:11.940]   It was real.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.940]   It was real?
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:13.940]   Oh, totally.
[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.940]   That's--
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.940]   What?
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:16.940]   So you've seen it, John.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.940]   Haven't you?
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   Have you seen the censored one?
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:19.940]   Yeah, that's the puking girl.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.340]   No, no, no, no, it's not the puking girl.
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.060]   Was it-- is that Falcon the Balloon Boy?
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.340]   Are we back to the Balloon Boy?
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.580]   Didn't he throw up on two different TV shows?
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:28.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:33.020]   The other thing they're doing is they're taking over an episode of Seth MacFarlane.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   That is the most--
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.020]   That is so cool.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.020]   --finally guy who believes this.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.020]   --stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.020]   That hurts my soul.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   It is sad.
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:40.020]   30 minutes.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:46.420]   Seth MacFarlane's own brand of his show, he's got to be doing something that is going to be
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.260]   trashing Windows or Microsoft.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.260]   No.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.260]   No, for it.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.940]   But there's some question whether it's Seth or Fox.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:53.940]   No, it's Seth.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.940]   No, it's live with Seth MacFarlane.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.940]   It's not the name.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.340]   But who gets the money?
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.540]   Seth and his production company.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.540]   I'm sure Fox gets some of it.
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.540]   It's a Fox.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:05.300]   All of the things I've seen say, Fox, Fox, Fox.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.300]   Really?
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.940]   I'm sure Seth's not doing it for free.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.940]   He wouldn't have got it if he wasn't.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:09.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.300]   Me and you saw the Cavalcade of Comedy stuff they did online with Google and they have Burger
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.980]   King as their sponsor.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.700]   Burger King is Crispin and Porter.
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.540]   They're ad agency and Crispin and Porter are also the guys who are doing this thing with
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:19.540]   family guys.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.700]   So I sense a connection to Miami agency.
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:25.660]   I have to say, in Microsoft's defense, I don't know if there's any defense for Seth, but in
[00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.060]   Microsoft's defense, this is pretty good marketing.
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.460]   Well, of course, from Microsoft, it's great.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:37.060]   Is it as good as the, remember the Bill Gates ads when they wanted to do a shoe store and
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.380]   they had Jerry Seinfeld?
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:39.860]   There's no churros in there.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:40.860]   Is it as good as that?
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:41.860]   Do they pull all those?
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:44.300]   Yes, they ran one and pulled it.
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.060]   No, they ran a whole series.
[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.060]   No, they ran a whole series.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.220]   There was two.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:52.740]   There was one where Bill shakes his butt to show the future of Windows.
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:54.300]   That's the shoe store one.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.980]   And then there's one where they creepily invade a family and the, like they hang out and they
[00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.980]   live with the family.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.980]   It's very, it's very good.
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.740]   Microsoft and humor are just a weird match.
[00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.580]   No, but don't let Microsoft and software.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:09.340]   Every time he does a keynote and he shows a video, those are usually pretty funny when
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.380]   he, you know, he gets a lot of it.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.380]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.740]   Those are usually fun, but anytime he's actually creating videos for marketing purposes, they
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:15.740]   fail miserably.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.740]   They were one of the pacer where they went da, da, da, da.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.380]   They're driving around.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.580]   Hey, Stewie, what are you doing with my laptop?
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.900]   I'm putting Windows 7 through its paces.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.260]   Oh, you recording your favorite programs on the DVR?
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:35.020]   You organizing your photos in the media center, personalizing the gadgets on your desktop,
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:39.300]   using the arrow shaker, easily switching between programs with the user-friendly interface?
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.900]   Yeah, the new works when I do it.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:41.900]   Okay, I just twitted.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.780]   Look, look, see, I said, I am twitting.
[00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:45.780]   Take it out.
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.780]   That is not even funny.
[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.780]   It really hurts.
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:50.780]   And here's the thing real.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.780]   Yeah, that's a part of the preview.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:53.780]   That's part of the preview.
[00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:54.780]   There's gonna be more of that.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.780]   Wow.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:56.780]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   30 more minutes or 22.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.780]   But you don't have no commercial rutions.
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.780]   That's my CTV.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:00.780]   That's the commercial.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   You gotta watch it, though, right?
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:02.780]   Because it's like a car wreck.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.780]   Yeah, I mean, I have to watch a lot of bad things, but I'm not gonna enjoy it.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.780]   I'm not gonna enjoy it.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.300]   Because you're just like, artists need to be supportive.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.300]   We've always had advertising.
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.300]   But that's going too far.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   This is not need to be supported.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.300]   It's the worst product placement.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.300]   You guys got more money than Leo.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.300]   No.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:25.300]   I loved it that the Twitter trending topic was Leo LePort makes $1.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:30.300]   Apparently, Twitter couldn't handle all the zeros, I guess.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.300]   Yeah, really.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:36.300]   So, yeah, I'm a little conflicted about this because I love the family guy.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.300]   It's bad, isn't it?
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.300]   It's just awful.
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.300]   It's just really awful.
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.300]   It's all a spade of spade that's gonna stop us.
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.300]   Okay, well, wait a minute.
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.300]   Okay, wait a minute.
[00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:48.300]   If it had been a hip product, is the problem that it's Microsoft?
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.300]   Wouldn't it have been good with Apple, either?
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.300]   No, because it's just too much.
[00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:58.300]   It's just we are being invaded constantly through multiple dimensions and apps and spaces.
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.300]   I guess you're right.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.300]   You can't think of a product that would be okay.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:05.300]   And this is, I mean, you're co-writing the whole episode, not just a scene.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.300]   Yeah, but it's also an apocana coke.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:10.300]   It's also made of a lot of the family guy, too.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.300]   The whole point of the family guy is to be, you know, corporate, anti-FC establishment.
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.300]   Yes, comedy, especially in that show, especially in the show.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   Did you notice that his notebook is "Davorak Orange" as well?
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.300]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.300]   Davorak does not own the orange on this laptop.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   Every chucho-davorak orange to me?
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.300]   Maybe he looks like my laptop.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.300]   This is the orange.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.300]   Ooh, who's zooming in.
[00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.300]   That's a zooming hoe.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.300]   Yes, I just said, who's zooming in.
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.300]   I believe I just did.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:39.300]   Well, well, well.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.300]   I guess you're a little older than you look.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:47.300]   I'm young at heart.
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   Any thoughts about Windows 7, Mr. Jim Liderback?
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:58.300]   Well, I wrote recently, and you were nice enough to point to it, that I did a lot of testing on machines who are a couple of years old because now that I'm not a reviewer, I'm not getting free equipment, even for a couple of days.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.300]   And so you put it on your own computer.
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:08.300]   I put it on a bunch of computers that I built, a bunch of notebooks that I had, and only on two out of seven, these were upgrades I did with the release candidate.
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.300]   Was it actually good?
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.300]   I mean, it crashed.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.300]   I couldn't find drivers for a number of them.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:17.300]   A critical piece that I wanted this EVDO card to work, and I couldn't find drivers for it.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.300]   So I actually downgraded a bunch of them.
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:32.300]   And my take is that if you're running Vista Service Pack 2, and it works okay for you, do not upgrade because that $120 bucks buy more memory, buy flowers for your wife.
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:39.300]   By the way, this happened to me when I upgraded from XP to Vista, the number of things that didn't work, like drivers didn't work.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:45.300]   I spent about $4 or $500 upgrading the hardware and software just to get back to normal again.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.300]   Yeah, so there are a lot of things that they say everything works.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.300]   Not everything works.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:57.300]   You know, your take is exactly the same as my take was on Snow Leopard, and I was like you, the one guy who said, "Oh, God, whatever you do, don't upgrade to this."
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.300]   I said that, yeah.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.300]   Did you?
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:00.300]   But I was mistaken.
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:03.300]   I was like, "Oh, you got the check?"
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.300]   I, um, check.
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.300]   Direct deposit.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:07.300]   Just kidding.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:10.300]   No, but I thought it was Snow Leopard causing a conflict.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.300]   No, it was.
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.300]   It was actually an app, and I had to go into console and real...
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:24.300]   You did see that Apple admitted that for, they said it's a very rare case, but that for some people, when you go to a guest account on Snow Leopard, log in and then log back to your account.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.300]   All your data's gone.
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.300]   It's a little...
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:29.300]   You get side-kicked, I think it's what's called now.
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.300]   Hey, oh!
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:31.300]   Hey, oh, we're back.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.300]   You've been side-kicked.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.300]   By the way, why didn't anyone see that one coming?
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.300]   The name of the company is Danger.
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.300]   Okay.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.300]   I love this game.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:41.300]   We got two jokes now.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.300]   Yeah, we can have a whole routine here.
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.300]   And what about airplane peanuts?
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.300]   Oh, no.
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:51.300]   Smells they just make the plane out of the black box.
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.300]   That's good.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:54.300]   Okay.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.300]   Danger-psychic.
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:57.300]   Let's mention it.
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:02.300]   By the way, whoever wrote the initial memo that said, "Oh, we've lost all your data.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   We're sorry."
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.300]   I certainly hope they got fired because, in fact, Microsoft's got all the data back.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:07.300]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:08.300]   And everyone can do that.
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:09.300]   You got it.
[00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.300]   All of it are just most of it.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.300]   They, well, they claim they've affected a very minor number of users.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:19.300]   That's when they say, but again, the data actually technically hasn't come back, so we don't know yet.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.300]   If I'm that user, I'm not minor.
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:23.300]   Right.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:24.300]   I'm major.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.300]   Do you think, as some said, this is a blow to cloud computing, Jim?
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.300]   No.
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.300]   It's not a blow to cloud computing.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:33.300]   It's a blow to Microsoft's designs to be a cloud computing leader, but has sound even
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.300]   the blame.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:35.300]   I don't even blame Microsoft on this one, do you?
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.300]   I don't know.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.300]   No, I don't know who I blame.
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.300]   I don't even think people know that danger.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.300]   John, you got your speakers up or something because we're getting-
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.300]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:44.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:45.300]   There we go.
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:46.300]   Thank you.
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.300]   John, you're the anti-cloud computing guy.
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   I'm sorry, Brittany.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.300]   I'm not really.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:52.300]   No, no, I believe Brittany Spears, because remember she got her sidekick stolen.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.300]   That's right.
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.300]   They had to put all the security in and that's why I went with it.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:59.300]   All right, Para, so I can keep them stressing.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.220]   Go ahead, John.
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:06.420]   I just question the people who put all their trust in cloud computing.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:11.740]   I mean, this device has- you save all your contact information in the cloud and apparently
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:17.620]   it's not saved locally like it is on most smartphones and it's not backed up locally.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:22.300]   I don't have a problem with stuff happening where it's more convenient in the cloud.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.940]   Then, by the way, right after that episode happened where they lost all this data and
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:32.180]   then of course now they say they recovered it, the Bay Area had a little rainstorm and
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.900]   most of us lost our Comcast connection for close, a lot of people in the Bay Area for
[01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.300]   close to 24 hours solid.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.800]   Ouch.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.940]   And that's like a cloud issue because now I can't even get to the damn cloud.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:45.940]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:51.300]   I did find out who all my neighbors are though with- that have open Wi-Fi.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:57.260]   And DSL do a little interesting thing to note.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:01.700]   The number of open Wi-Fi connections, especially in the Bay Area and I think throughout the
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.660]   country, has dwindled to very, very few.
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:05.660]   Yes, that's true.
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.660]   It's very, very hard.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.660]   It's sad.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.660]   You're right.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.660]   It's sad.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.660]   It's sad.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   It was a community.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.660]   It was a community.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:14.660]   I mean, they're physically there, not a community.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:15.660]   Well, no.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.500]   It was more of a parasitic community than anything else.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.500]   There are parasites have communities too.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:26.340]   They need love and Wi-Fi and internet.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.900]   There are programs out there that allow you to easily hack in.
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.300]   So, John, you just needed to do a little preparation.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.700]   Only if they're using WPA.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.020]   If they're using WPA too, it takes a while, but you can get that.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:39.580]   It's besides I don't want to go through that.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.620]   The point is it used to be where everybody, because the routers came with the default
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.860]   of wide open and now they come with the default that you have to go through an insulation
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.860]   process and give yourself a pass.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:50.860]   Thank goodness.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.100]   So, is that a noise you that people are keeping information secure?
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.100]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.100]   That's because exactly.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.100]   I'm with you, David.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.140]   I mean, what's wrong with security?
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.260]   What if you don't want it?
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.540]   What if you're like a free spirit?
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.540]   I was.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:06.540]   I used to be a free spirit.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.540]   John, is your name?
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:08.540]   Is your name?
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.540]   Where's the spirit?
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.020]   That's what John used to say that the college girls do.
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.020]   Come on.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.020]   Come on.
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.020]   I mean, you're router.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.020]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.900]   I want to know, John, is your network open?
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.900]   No.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.900]   Okay.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:23.900]   There you go.
[01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.740]   Next, I would like to point out I have three gentlemen in this room and maybe four using
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.460]   open Wi-Fi.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.460]   We share.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.980]   I am totally going to drive into the front of your place, Leo, park in the front and
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.980]   will you go online and download porn?
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.980]   Absolutely.
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:39.980]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:44.940]   Or share your music library, because the RIAA will understand when I explain that it's
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.420]   not me, it was must have been.
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:50.820]   See, that's the advantage of having the open port, because when the guys come knocking
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:52.820]   on the door, you say, "Hey, I don't know."
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.980]   It's probably some drive-by downloader.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.980]   Do you think that works, John?
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:01.300]   I think it might work in a court of law where somebody has could.
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   Somebody had some brains.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.140]   If you have a good lawyer.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:09.220]   Well, plus, you get a jury of your peers and you know that jury, you pick them so they
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.500]   have no clue of anything technology-oriented.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   Anybody can snow them.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.300]   You have to have a jury of your peer to peer.
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.300]   Oh, no.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.300]   Oh, man.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.780]   Baratunde, we're putting your act together for tonight.
[01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:25.740]   You want to do a little geek set, if you want to just, you know, just beep.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.740]   Beep, bitch.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.740]   Your silence tonight.
[01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:29.740]   You'll take all the material from tonight's show.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:30.740]   Thank you, guys.
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.740]   You're so generous.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.260]   That's the beauty of doing this on the internet.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.500]   You can't hear people scream.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.500]   It's great.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.100]   It's stepped on the chat, right?
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.660]   All right, we're going to take a little break, come back with more.
[01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.660]   If we could find more.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.900]   If not, we won't come back with more.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.100]   So if you're not, well, just, you know, look on your iPod.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.980]   If you see, like, another 20 minutes, keep listening.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.180]   Otherwise, you might as well just turn out now.
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.940]   I'm never going to get this sponsor back.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.940]   Audible.com.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.940]   We love Audible.com.
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940]   Yes.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:57.940]   Are you an Audible listener?
[01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.940]   I'm big.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.340]   I've been with Audible from the beginning, before Amazon, before, like, 2001.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.900]   Before there was one-
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.900]   When did you show the audience?
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900]   I was there.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:06.900]   Before 2001?
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.900]   The beginning.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.900]   Oh, man.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.900]   I'm like the genesis of Audible.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.900]   Really?
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:11.900]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:12.900]   I did.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.900]   I did.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.900]   I used to clean bathrooms in college, and that's how I passed the time.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.580]   It was the best paying job on campus.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.580]   Did you work in Dubai?
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:20.580]   Was that a three-year deal?
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.580]   Well done.
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.820]   No, but so I would want to keep my mind occupied while I'm scrubbing other people's toilets,
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.260]   and I look at you in so many books, so many books, big fans.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.980]   But you got an education, didn't you?
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:30.980]   From the books.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.980]   And from school.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:32.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:33.980]   You know.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.820]   I wish I had all these books with toilets.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.300]   Well, a lot of them, you know, do you notice that when you drive?
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:43.340]   And you listen to an Audible book, and then you maybe if you rewind and you go, "Oh, I
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:44.340]   was at that corner."
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.540]   I'm geolocating your spine.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:47.540]   The book is definitely something.
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.540]   Is that weird?
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.540]   Yeah, I just said geolocating your spine.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.540]   I saw you twinge at that.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.540]   I thought it was good.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.540]   Some of my favorite experiences together really well.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.540]   I said, "Listen, you do that all night."
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.540]   Again, not on the phone.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.540]   Please.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.540]   Anything on the phone.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.540]   Please.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:06.540]   Audible.com/twit is the place to go if you would like to take advantage of our special
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.540]   offer.
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.260]   Don't use the Revision 3 code, whatever you do.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:10.260]   I don't know.
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:11.260]   Do you have a Revision 3 code?
[01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:12.260]   I don't think so.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.260]   Don't say so if you do, please.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.260]   That was so rude.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:18.860]   It was so rude when Kevin Rose was in here and we're doing an ad and he gives out the
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860]   dignity code.
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:22.300]   Believe me, inappropriate.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.940]   You know, shocking.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.340]   You should go on to his show and use the Twit code.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.340]   Actually we're working that ad.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.340]   Jim and I are working that out.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.340]   I want to be a dignity.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.340]   It'll be a code fest.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:32.340]   The code fest.
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.340]   No, use my code.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   No, use my code.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.340]   We'll come up with joint code.
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:39.220]   I actually interviewed the guys at Salon who also have Audible as a sponsor.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:44.700]   The shows were having competitions who would use their code more.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.700]   Isn't that funny?
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.540]   Ultimately, you should use the Twit code.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.380]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.980]   We get the money anyway because it's not a, you know, we don't get paid per click.
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.220]   We just, you know, we get paid.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.300]   So use any darn code you want.
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.500]   But this proves that they're actually paying attention.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.500]   That's why they do it.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.980]   They want to see does anybody listen to Twit?
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.980]   Well, the effectiveness of it.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980]   Measure effectiveness.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:05.980]   It's hard to measure out effectiveness.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.980]   You know what they do?
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.980]   They pit me.
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.820]   They're not going to eat each other because each show has its own code.
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:12.820]   Right.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.500]   And it's like, you know, they're pitting me against my children.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.500]   Divide and conquer.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.700]   Well, now you can know which child to love more.
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.140]   You can quantify that love.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.220]   I get to add dollars.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:23.220]   It's the future, man.
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.740]   Are you listening to any books right now, Berrit?
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:25.740]   Actually, I'm not right now.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.300]   I'm in my podcast phase.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.300]   But my favorite one.
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.300]   We like that, by the way.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.300]   It's okay.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300]   I love podcasts.
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.300]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.300]   But it depends on my mood.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.980]   I have book moods and I have like podcast notes and I'll go months at a time skipping
[01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:37.980]   both.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.260]   I'm listening to a book that Andy and I co you're what is it?
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.260]   Your high school roommate?
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:42.260]   Junior known.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.260]   Not.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.260]   We went to junior high together.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.260]   Andy and I co and I.
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.260]   That's so wild.
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.260]   Wow.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.940]   That's just as the kids say, how random is that?
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:50.940]   It is very random.
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.980]   He just to throw at a completely random fact.
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:59.420]   I created something when we're junior high together called the AI spy club for no apparent
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   reason.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.420]   No, I was just there.
[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.420]   The learner.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.420]   It was just that.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.420]   I have a.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.420]   No, but it was a pure joke.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:06.420]   It was a joke.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:07.420]   It was a club or anything.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.980]   Just to be in my club.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.940]   I kind of lonely and I've got a club.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.020]   You could be in it.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.140]   The AI spy club.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.420]   You're spying on him.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.740]   No, it was a whole series of joke things that I was creating.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.740]   I'm sure it was great.
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:22.740]   Andy would you?
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.740]   It was adorable.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.740]   It was a joke, right?
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.740]   Andy did.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.740]   Okay.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.580]   Well, that's what was important.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:31.220]   I'm trying to find the book that I that Andy recommended.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.660]   It's a history of Hollywood in the 70s.
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.940]   I am so loving it.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:36.940]   There's a what?
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.940]   What?
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.500]   Oh, it's on there's a great book about comedy from the 70s called I think Comedy at the
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.500]   Edge.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   Oh, I have to read that.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.500]   Have you read that?
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.500]   I have not, but I will check it out when you have a place in New York and for it.
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500]   Great.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   The time.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.500]   I bet you've read this, apparently the time.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.180]   Shales book on Saturday Night Live is such a good.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.180]   Not yet.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.740]   Oh, you got to read the history of Saturday Night Live.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.380]   It is so excellent.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.220]   My favorite audibles, the company, a history of the CIA.
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.220]   I read that.
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:01.220]   Love it.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.220]   Incredible.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.220]   Love it.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.220]   The entire dark tower series by Stephen King.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.220]   You know, amazing.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.420]   And that was the one he didn't put his name on originally.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.420]   Right.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.420]   He did.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.900]   The gun slinger was the first one by Stephen King.
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.740]   I thought he used his pseudonym for those because no.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:14.740]   Okay.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:15.740]   All right.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:16.740]   Those are very good.
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.740]   John has put up.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.740]   We've put John to sleep.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:20.580]   He's put up with stuffed animal now.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.580]   Why?
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.300]   He's flipping his burger or something.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.540]   He's easy to talk to though.
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:26.180]   Yeah, it's kind of cute.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.540]   Was he in the A1 AI spike one?
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:30.740]   Do you think John will have a new outfit?
[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:31.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:32.740]   John should have got another.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:33.740]   I know.
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:34.740]   It's great.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.740]   Come on, John.
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:38.140]   The book is by Peter Biskind.
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:44.980]   It is called Easy Riders Raging Bulls How the Sex Drugs and Rock and Roll Generation
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:45.980]   Saved Hollywood.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.140]   And it's about Nicholson and, you know, Robert Altman.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.860]   And it is such a cool book.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.860]   I'm really enjoying it.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.700]   What's been great is I've been going to Netflix and renting the movies as they talk
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:06.100]   so as Bonnie and Clyde and McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Nash and Nashville.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.100]   Really a fascinating book.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.900]   Easy Rider, of course, Godfather, Chinatown.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.140]   Talks about the stories behind the directors.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:16.540]   Did you know that George Lucas worked for Francis Ford?
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:19.780]   A couple of really kind of made him his protege.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:23.540]   There was actually, I don't know if it's based on that book, but there's a series talking
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:28.020]   about the same thing that the independent film channel made on this very famous book.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.020]   Just a great subject.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.020]   Probably based on this.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.900]   Biskind interviewed everybody to get this book.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:36.060]   And it is a wonderful audio.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.540]   Listen.
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.780]   And I highly encourage you 23 minutes.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:43.220]   I mean, sorry, 23 hours and 41 minutes.
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.420]   And thanks to Andy and Aco for this recommendation.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.740]   I immediately downloaded it.
[01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:49.100]   I'm listening to it now and loving every minute of it.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:53.260]   Easy Riders Raging Bulls How the Sex Drugs Rock and Roll Generation Saved Hollywood.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.260]   Now you can get this for free.
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.380]   In fact, you can get two books for free.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:02.540]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you get the platinum account.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.540]   That's a two book a month account.
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:06.580]   And of course, your first month's free, your first two books are free.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.260]   And even if you decide not to stick around, you get to keep those books.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.820]   So I think you're going to really enjoy this one.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:16.060]   But there are 60,000 other titles you get to choose from in every category.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:20.620]   Science, fiction, romance, erotica.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.260]   Nothing like an audio book in erotica.
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.620]   Well, it all depends on who's reading it.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.460]   How to Baster Meat by John C. Delora.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:32.660]   It's powerful story of a man and his brush.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.380]   Oil-soaked brush.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.780]   Leo, when do you have time to listen to audiobooks?
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:37.780]   You don't commute anywhere.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.780]   That's the people.
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.740]   Oh, I'm so glad you asked Jim Latterback because it's true.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:43.540]   I got into audible when I did commute.
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.540]   Yeah, you had the whole way.
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:45.540]   I mean, I just drove it up.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.540]   It was awful.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.540]   It was a beautiful commute every day.
[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:48.540]   I can't believe you did.
[01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:49.540]   In traffic, you did it in Sunday.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.340]   Well, I remember you went to Cupertino for a while.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:52.340]   You remember that?
[01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:53.340]   Yes.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.340]   Like, how did you do that?
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:55.340]   Well, audible.
[01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.420]   Literally, it was audio books that saved my life.
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:02.500]   But even now, because I got hooked on audiobooks, I listen at the gym.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.980]   There's an hour a day, right?
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.540]   I listen when I'm doing the dishes.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.140]   There's about five minutes a week.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.340]   They have machines that you do.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.300]   Well, I like my books.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.820]   It's time for my stories.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:16.580]   Let me watch the dishes.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:20.340]   When you're gardening, housework, anytime, you know, I actually, I'm believing it or not,
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:23.940]   volunteer for carpools, volunteer to drive the kids places because I want to listen to
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.180]   audiobooks.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:28.300]   You get hooked on these things and it's really, and that's the point of audio, is it just
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:32.900]   makes it easier for you to get those things done that you have to do and still learn something,
[01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.000]   still enjoy.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.940]   Audible.com/twit2tryitoday.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:37.940]   You're going to love it.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:41.020]   Baratunde says, "They're great."
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.020]   Is that good?
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:50.020]   It's so good.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.420]   Oh man, you and me, baby.
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:53.420]   We got a team thing going on here.
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:55.420]   It's like we've done this before.
[01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:56.740]   It's like a frosted flakes.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.220]   Have you ever met this man?
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.220]   It was.
[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.620]   They're great.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.300]   Let's see what the costume change has to offer from John C.
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.020]   Oh, it's much better.
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.380]   It's still a weird color.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.220]   No, because now he's sort of saturated.
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.220]   Yeah, it's so saturated.
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.060]   He puts them up or it's like it's so good.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.100]   It's eating the other colors in the frame.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.100]   It is.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.740]   It's Richmond Blue.
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.980]   Who is Richmond?
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.500]   This is the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia.
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:25.020]   Yeah, they were the 1-AA champs last year in the football season.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.100]   And by the way, people know I like to collect these things.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.100]   We're going to find out.
[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.260]   They're going to go into a bar.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.300]   But he's making millions of dollars on movies.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.300]   John Dury.
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.300]   Richmond Spiders.
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.260]   They should have one with a big giant spider.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.260]   Are you kidding?
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.620]   Their mascot is a spider?
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.620]   The spiders, yeah.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.620]   It's terrible.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.300]   Did you buy that or did they give it to you?
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.300]   Disclosure.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.140]   And they did not give it to me.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.300]   A fan of mine sent it to me.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.300]   Mm-hmm.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:53.260]   So you have to disclose that you have fans?
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.380]   I have a fan and he sent me this.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.180]   And by the way, this team is one of the best coaches.
[01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:01.660]   Coach teams that you've ever seen play, they're really amazing.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:02.980]   Hey, John, Bill Cosby just called.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:04.780]   He wants his shirt back.
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.780]   Ah.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.580]   Some of the two of you, the oldest and worst jokes have been told on today's show.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:12.180]   Some of the best ones too.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.020]   It's a very volatile.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:15.020]   You never know.
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.180]   You never know what you're going to get.
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.180]   It could be a chestnut.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.100]   I'd say that's what it could be something fresh.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.860]   Leo, look, even the chat rooms, even the chat rooms heckling me.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.660]   Leo, the show fails.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:26.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.340]   God, you guys are cold.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:29.340]   How quickly they turn.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.340]   Oh, man.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.340]   John, are you still there?
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.340]   We just lost the image.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.340]   Are you working on your camera?
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:34.340]   Is that what's going on?
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.340]   It's doing--
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:39.580]   Yeah, I was just fixing it so it doesn't have the problems you guys are complaining about.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.020]   But you just overexposed.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.380]   I like that look.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.540]   That's his new hairdo.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.060]   You get anything back there?
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:48.860]   I think you might have to restart.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860]   We're coming.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.500]   Ken from Chicago says, this is Leo's comic cottage cavalcade of computer comedy.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500]   Coming right at you.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.460]   Spots are thankfully not.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460]   It's all Bob Heil's fault.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:00.460]   If he hadn't given me a gold mine--
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.300]   I think you might get a call this week from Spots.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.780]   I love the answer saying, you could just stop telling jokes.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:05.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.780]   Oh, I get to call every week.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.780]   You're talking about--
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:11.500]   There's nothing new.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:12.500]   Any other stories?
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.180]   There seems like there's so much to talk about.
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.180]   I thought it was interesting.
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:18.140]   I thought the month-- the week was terrible.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.140]   It was boring.
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.940]   No, but there's something broke this weekend that I thought was kind of interesting.
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:29.220]   This woman wrote this quote, "harrowing tale of having her son taken away by TSA agents."
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.220]   Whoa.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.020]   And it's bogus though.
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.020]   It's very-- yes.
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:37.660]   Well, what happened was literally within hours, the TSA posted the video of the actual
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:43.020]   security video to show that, lo and behold, her child wasn't taken away.
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:47.660]   And they all-- there was a whole slew of sort of competing comments.
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:52.100]   But in general, it was a good response by the TSA, a quick and swift one.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:57.840]   She responded, people posted all these URL liar comments to her blog, of which she removed
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.460]   all the comments on her blog post.
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:06.980]   But there is one thing that the video was edited at one point in the TSA video.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.980]   The part where they kidnapped the kid.
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:10.980]   No, well, no, not where they kidnapped the kid.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:11.980]   Yeah, they cut that part right out.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.500]   No, but the part where she claims her child was taken away is actually shown and it wasn't
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.500]   taken away.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:21.620]   So we're not clear on that one edit point.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:22.620]   So what was her motivation?
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.220]   Do we know her story at all?
[01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:29.620]   She's literally an incredibly passionate blogger who writes incredibly melodramatic
[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.780]   mommy blog stories.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:32.780]   And it's--
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.780]   Who is it, you know?
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.780]   Remember, in fact, I wrote about it.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.780]   It's the top post on my blog, Spark.com.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.780]   I saw my blog.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.780]   What are the mommy bloggers?
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:39.780]   The blog.org/blog.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:40.780]   Oh, now we get--
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.780]   I put it on my blog, too.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.780]   If that's what you're doing.
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.780]   If you're feeding blogs, that's not all my blog.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.780]   It is.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.780]   It is.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:52.580]   The name of her blog is called MyBodlesUp.com.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:58.220]   And where she talks about where there's an image of her holding a bottle of milk and
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.220]   a glass of wine.
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:04.300]   And she admits in her bio that, well, she's not an alcoholic, but she likes to drink
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.300]   wine to relax or something.
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.300]   Well, that's a bottle.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.300]   So you're just fine.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.540]   Which is fine, which is totally fine.
[01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.300]   But this is kind of the image that she's portraying on her blog.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:18.300]   So are you saying that-- are you alluding to the fact that you think that she's like a
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.580]   crazed alcoholic, and that's why she wrote this?
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:25.140]   Well, she also keeps an emergency Xanax with her at all times.
[01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:26.140]   I just do you know what?
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:27.140]   Let me tell you.
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.140]   Have you ever been a mommy?
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:29.140]   I have not been a mother.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.140]   I've never had a blog.
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:31.900]   And I don't think I'm ever going to be a mother.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.780]   Let me tell you something, nothing unusual about any of that.
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:35.780]   That's just mommy life.
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:36.780]   I understand.
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.500]   But it's a very, very melodramatic story.
[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.540]   And maybe part of it did happen, you know?
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.860]   But again, it was her viewpoint of it.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:46.860]   And it had--
[01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:49.300]   Oh my God, she's got tattoos too, David.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.300]   That's fun.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   A mom with tattoos.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.300]   Oh my God.
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:56.460]   Can I try to bring up a new-- a possible news and like tech angle on this?
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.460]   Yes.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.140]   Which is-- you went to the real-time web summit, right?
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.140]   And I was supposed to be there.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.140]   Right.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:05.900]   So we're entering this age of like really high velocity real-time information without
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:09.900]   a competing high velocity real-time analysis to go along with it.
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.900]   No, in fact, it's the opposite.
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:11.900]   So we're changing the information.
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:12.900]   And a thousand directions.
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:13.900]   And a thousand directions.
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:14.900]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.180]   And we process them real-time without full info to begin with.
[01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:20.260]   Like as events unfold and we've already judged how it's going to be concluded.
[01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:23.300]   But what it is is actually a channel of programming.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.980]   As I see now, you have your IRC channel, which is actually--
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.980]   Real-time?
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:27.980]   Real-time.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.460]   But it's actually kind of a channel of programming.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:33.780]   Information is happening alongside this program as well.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:38.260]   But what's happening with the real-time web, with the fact that people are using keywords
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.900]   to be able to track a story wherever they are, they don't need to physically be in one
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:46.780]   chat room, that you can all of a sudden see a story build over time.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:49.020]   And this is what a lot of web 2.0 is doing.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:50.940]   In fact, you know what the Intellipede is?
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.540]   You know the thing that the intelligence community uses?
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:59.660]   They use it purposefully as sort of big breaking events are happening that information that's
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:05.780]   being gathered from multiple points at the same time can be collected in one space being
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:08.300]   a wiki in the Intellipede's case.
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.340]   I think there's a role for both.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:16.020]   The thing that's-- I like in all of this to the internet nervous system.
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:22.700]   We now have kind of a sensorium that is much larger than our own personal sensorium.
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:28.820]   It's kind of a global sensorium and things like Twitter give us, you know, feelers everywhere.
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:33.300]   But just as you know you have to think about what you get through your sensorium before
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:39.740]   you leap to a conclusion, we have to learn just because it's in print doesn't mean it's
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:43.900]   somehow valid or magically true.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.220]   So we're just learning.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.220]   But it is ultimately beneficial.
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.220]   That's right.
[01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.220]   Leo, you're exactly right.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:55.020]   And what we've already had in print is examples, many examples of bogus information that way.
[01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:57.780]   So we're just getting a new kind of bogus information.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.420]   Having time doesn't necessarily make it more accurate.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:04.700]   But I am with you that this is exactly what we're seeing is these attention swarms moving
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.620]   so fast.
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:09.380]   But I think we just have to judge it in a little bit different way than we're used to
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:15.100]   judging it and understand that this is the buzz of the initial reception of the information.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:20.900]   This is the sensorium going zzzzzz.
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:24.060]   It's fun, it's great for comedy, it's great for business, it's great for all the aspects
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:27.180]   of humanity that we've had with tools and without.
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.420]   But it's different.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:29.420]   It's very different.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:32.660]   Imagine if all of a sudden it's almost like a comic book.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:33.940]   You know, you're like a comic book hero.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.420]   All of a sudden your senses were suddenly extended globally and you're suddenly hearing
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.220]   everything and seeing everything all at once initially.
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.020]   We had that initial reaction a few years ago.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.300]   It's all too much.
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.860]   Now we're getting better at filtering it.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.740]   We're using intermediaries on Twitter, curating.
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.220]   So we're starting to, we still are seeing much more and much more instantaneously.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.940]   I think we're dealing with it pretty well in fact.
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.420]   It just comes down to common sense.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.780]   I mean, where is the common sense in all of this?
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:03.060]   You hear about this stuff like there's some kid riding around a frickin' balloon.
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.060]   I mean, come on.
[01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:08.220]   Well, anybody with some sense would look at the balloon and say that's impossible.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.340]   But it's a human behavior being accelerated.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:14.180]   People all been reacting like this, you know, the Jessica and the Well story.
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:19.100]   Had the Jessica and the Well story happened with this, it would have been even more accelerated.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.100]   Much, much more.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.100]   You'd seem even more insane at it.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:23.660]   But eventually we're going to get dampered down is what I'm saying is eventually we're
[01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:28.500]   going to understand it better and it's going to happen in a way that we deal with it better.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:32.260]   And in the long run, I think this expanded sense, sorry I'm this nervous system is to
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.260]   our benefit.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:37.100]   I think good, it's one of the ways that good quality content will get surfaced faster and
[01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.100]   better.
[01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:40.700]   I think, you know, I think the other ways we'll learn more will be able to communicate this
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.180]   whole issue I was talking about learning about the Arab world, unmediated.
[01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.780]   That's what this sense of room is going to do with it.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.780]   It does it.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.780]   It does it.
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:51.940]   It's going to result in a Hitler.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:53.740]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:54.740]   We did it.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:55.740]   We reached the good one.
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.740]   Yeah, it's the good one.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:57.740]   It's law right there.
[01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:58.740]   We got to Hitler.
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:20:59.740]   Wow, that was good.
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:00.740]   That was a, I'm going to mark that.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:01.740]   That was it one minute.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:02.740]   1635 and 13 seconds.
[01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:05.700]   One hour, 36 minutes into the Twitch show.
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:10.580]   It's just successful when the good wins out over the base, then we will know more about
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:13.020]   what's happening in Iran or what's happening in Burma or what's happening in Vietnam.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:14.020]   Well, we're human.
[01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:15.180]   So we were a mix of good and bad.
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:18.740]   But we'll also learn more about the junk that we like the taste of.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.140]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.140]   It's a good point.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.140]   Celebrity meat.
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:26.460]   No, that's a good point because when we've been given the infinite feast of food, what
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.140]   is our body choose sugar and fat and it's killing us, right?
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:31.460]   So maybe they, maybe we're going to kill ourselves with information.
[01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:32.460]   You know what, there's a continuum.
[01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:35.300]   Look, there always, there are going to be a group of people and I don't know what
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:37.900]   percentage it is who are going to spend all their time going, oh my God, see what happens
[01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:38.900]   to you.
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:39.900]   I mean, these are the people who read the star.
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:40.900]   The Chris Perotet.
[01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:41.900]   Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.500]   And you just did a very good Chris Perotet meditation.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500]   He's vibrating.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.700]   And I say that with love.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.700]   There always going to be those types of information.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.900]   But they'll be, you know, and it'll filter out.
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:55.100]   There'll be those people who do that, you know, you know, five of the six things that
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.300]   you forwarded to me ended up not being true.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.300]   I don't trust you anymore.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:01.860]   And so we're going to have these trust systems on the people that are in our social graph,
[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.180]   as well as we do the journalists.
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.780]   So, you know, I trust if we're actually going to be interesting and controversial.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:08.420]   I trust this person's going to be accurate.
[01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.220]   I trust this person's always going to be wrong.
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.700]   We're going to do the same thing.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.700]   Right now we do that with journalists.
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.700]   We'll do the same thing with people that with with our social graph.
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.700]   Yeah, that's the curation that you were talking about.
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:23.700]   But here's the major problem with with the real time web is most of what's being moderated
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:28.900]   or indexed is what is the explicit real time with what we choose to publish, you know,
[01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.700]   via, you know, Twitter and whatnot.
[01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:35.060]   There is the implicit, which is what we're all clicking on, but not necessarily publishing
[01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:38.380]   or searching on which we're not, you know, publishing publicly.
[01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:43.100]   And that once you get that into the system and there's actually one ride is one of the
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:48.340]   search engines that's doing this, you will have a better, clearer idea of what people
[01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:49.340]   are interested in.
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.180]   It's like watch what I say, not what I do.
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.740]   Well, no, nobody.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.380]   The problem is not what I say.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.780]   What I'm saying is there's only a small percentage of people that are publishing.
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:02.100]   So it's not a clear view of what the entire public thinks what's going on.
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:05.820]   If only 10% of the public is publishing, which is one of the estimates, then you're
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.380]   only getting a view of 10% of the public.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:12.820]   That's more than you got when mainstream media ruled the roost and you got one tenth
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:13.820]   and one percent.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:14.820]   Yeah.
[01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:15.820]   Right.
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:16.820]   You just have to figure out who to trust.
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:17.820]   And you know what?
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.460]   Yeah, 10% of the people are out there, but there are still people that you can trust and
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.460]   people you can't.
[01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:22.100]   But what it is, it's different kinds of filters.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:27.100]   For example, you are a filter yourself, Jim, as is John, is everyone in this room?
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.100]   I like the reason people to trust you.
[01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:31.100]   It's like an accusation.
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.100]   You Jim.
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.100]   You ignorant slut.
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:34.100]   Like Jim is a pejorative.
[01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:38.860]   Jim is also ignorant slut, but that's besides.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:39.860]   But he is...
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:40.860]   But I make a great filter.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.900]   But this is another kind of a filter.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.900]   It is a real time web filter there out there as well.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:46.900]   So people will use both.
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.580]   They won't just rely on one of the other.
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:52.500]   Maybe it's, you know, John is the, you know, native pessimist.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.700]   I'm the native optimist.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.900]   That's why we've always made a good team where, you know, we're the opposite sides of the...
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.080]   And I'm the optimist about this.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.420]   I think that this is in the long run.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:03.060]   This is almost an evolutionary step.
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.820]   I mean, I think this is very powerful.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:06.020]   It's like evolution in a...
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:08.020]   Concentration camps.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.020]   Filter.
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:10.020]   Filter.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:11.020]   Perfect time for a filter.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:13.020]   Oh, actually, he just...
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:17.700]   When he's going back to the muppets, he's the muppet up in the sky box.
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.700]   But they're amazing.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:19.700]   What do they mean?
[01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:20.700]   Whatever we're saying.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.700]   What do they mean?
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:22.700]   Those guys are...
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.500]   The old guys up in the balcony.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.500]   He kind of...
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.500]   He almost is in the balcony too.
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.500]   I'm headed.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.220]   Yeah, I am the old man.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.220]   I hate this stuff.
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.540]   It's all bad.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.540]   How's the Tech Grouch doing?
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.820]   Is it a huge, huge hit John C. de Vorek?
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:39.460]   The Tech Grouch has got a bunch of followers and we're just kind of producing shows on and
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:40.460]   off again.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:44.220]   It's really basically a 30 second commercial.
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:48.100]   But it seems to have a lot of people that think it's hilarious for some reason.
[01:24:48.100 --> 01:24:49.100]   But I got some new character.
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:52.420]   I'm going to bring in a new character, the Tech Grouch's wife.
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:54.900]   Is that me or is it going to be you too?
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:55.900]   Oh no, no.
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:56.900]   I think with...
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.380]   Cross-dressing John, it's the secret.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:01.860]   It's going to be extremely, extremely offensive.
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:02.860]   Let's put it down.
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.860]   Yeah, yeah baby.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:04.860]   I love that.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.860]   Walder and Statler.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.860]   Walder and Statler.
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.860]   Thank you very much.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.860]   Statler.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   I'm super high-end.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:10.860]   Go chat.
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:11.860]   Go chat.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.180]   F-T-W as they say.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.180]   As the kids say today.
[01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:16.900]   Yeah, I can't keep up with the kids.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:19.340]   Those acronyms, they're just flying fast and furious.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:24.860]   You know, we've got the TV on and Fox News was showing a Brazilian helicopter crash.
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:30.420]   And Joy and Cynthia just immediately grabbed it and we lost our audience.
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:31.420]   Oh no.
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:32.420]   With two people.
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.420]   Yeah, two people.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.860]   Our audience of two, they're watching a helicopter crash, which just shows that there are things
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:39.740]   that grab you and you cannot turn away.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:45.060]   And this is where the risk of this hive mind is, is that we get fixated on kids in wells
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.860]   or boys in balloons or that kind of thing.
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:50.900]   They have to be either up in the air or down in the ground.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:51.900]   One or the other.
[01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:53.740]   The kid at his desk doing his homework.
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.580]   Oh my God, look at that, it's amazing.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:59.020]   In my house that would be an amazing.
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.980]   Guys, it's been so much fun.
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.340]   Barretunde is performing tonight at the punchline now.
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:05.340]   That means Sunday night.
[01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.860]   Yeah, and tomorrow we're doing a watch party for the Future of TV show at Gillian's at
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   the Metreon.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:10.860]   Oh, that's great.
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:11.860]   7-11 p.m.
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:12.860]   It's going to be great.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:13.860]   It's a fun show.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.740]   It's about Future of Adventure, Popular Science's Future of.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.740]   Had to plug that.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.380]   So if you're in San Francisco.
[01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:19.900]   Or if you're not, planes can get there.
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:20.900]   So everybody fly.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:21.900]   You have time.
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:22.900]   San Francisco, 24 hours.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.820]   It's a great pool hall to play pool.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.820]   We've had meet and names.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   We love children.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.380]   Some of the largest screens I've ever seen in a single bar.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:31.380]   I love that.
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:34.700]   You know, that, by the way, is going to be the next Twit Studio.
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.580]   That's what I'm doing is a giant, you know, 40-foot screen behind me.
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:40.260]   And it's only going to be playing basketball.
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.820]   Yeah, it's all the time.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   Basketball, all the time.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.580]   Somebody going to donate that?
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:45.980]   No, I'll buy it.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.460]   Because I'm made of money.
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.460]   You're going to go to San Francisco.
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:50.700]   It'll walk out the door with you.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.700]   You're going to get a lot of vaccines.
[01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:54.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:59.700]   Beritunday is at B-A-R-A-T-U-N-D-E.com or @beritunday on Twitter.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:00.700]   That is correct.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:06.500]   And you can catch him also comedy every Thursday night in New York City at Sages.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.500]   The Sage Theater.
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.500]   Sage Theater.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.500]   It's really nice to have you.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.500]   Look for him in the end.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500]   Thank you so much.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:12.500]   It was actually, it's been a life dream.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.500]   I'm not even kidding.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500]   I love this show.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.140]   And I just kissed him here a little bit.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.500]   But not just, you do a great show.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.500]   Good guess.
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:20.500]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:21.500]   Thank you.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.500]   Thank you.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.500]   Thank you.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.500]   I'm going to be on the show.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.500]   All right.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.500]   I'll be back in an hour.
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:27.500]   Can you wait until next week?
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:32.300]   Jim Lauderback, of course, is the CEO of Revision3 and an old friend from Tech TV.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.900]   It's really great to have you.
[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.840]   You've never been here.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   I've never been here.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   It's so awesome.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.900]   I had to go up and I peeked into Colleen's chamber of doom up there.
[01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:41.900]   Oh, did you go into the lab?
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:42.900]   It looks great.
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:43.900]   It's scary, isn't it?
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:44.900]   No, it's cool.
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:45.900]   She's an inventor.
[01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:46.900]   That's really what she is.
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:47.900]   Absolutely.
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:48.900]   It's cool.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.900]   She's just done a great job inventing.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.300]   That's stream of sources are Skype.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.140]   I'm sorry, Skype of sources are Skype machines, stream of sources are stream machine.
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.140]   And this is Switchzilla.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:58.140]   Switchzilla.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:59.140]   That's what you call it.
[01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.140]   That's what you call it.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.380]   And our VT5, our new switcher.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:02.380]   It's probably amazing.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.860]   She's building great stuff.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.860]   Thank you, Jim.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.860]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:06.860]   What's going on?
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:07.860]   Ladies thing from Revision3.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:13.060]   We got a new sitcom called Web Zeros that is three guys in Houston who want to be web
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.060]   celebrities.
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.700]   Do a show, a sitcom about trying to be web celebrities.
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.780]   First episode, they try to do a podcast much like this one.
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.780]   I've been waiting.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:26.660]   I'm so glad you're doing this for somebody to do episodic fiction in a podcast form.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:27.660]   So that's very exciting.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:28.660]   I think that's breakthrough.
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:31.420]   And it's very meta about trying to be what you are.
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.620]   I guess, I mean, Felicia Day's kind of done that.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.340]   Yeah, a little bit with the guilt.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:36.340]   I wish I love.
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:38.660]   But I think that this is what I want to see more of.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:39.660]   That's exciting.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:41.140]   And you guys have the resources to do.
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.140]   Check it out.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:43.140]   Web zeros.
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.140]   Web zeros.
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.140]   David Spark is not a PR flex.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.580]   Don't say is, or he'll have to be on your show too.
[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:49.580]   God forbid.
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:50.580]   God forbid.
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.380]   sparkmedia solutions.com.
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:53.380]   Correct.
[01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.380]   And where will you be appearing tonight?
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:59.020]   The chocolate hot tonight I'm speaking in front of the National Association of Counties
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.180]   actually a further up north in Sonoma.
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.180]   So sexy.
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.180]   Not too long.
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:04.180]   And speaking in a event in Palo Alto.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:05.860]   They've got a great acronym though.
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860]   Mac.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:07.860]   Maco.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.980]   Oh, I just got to quote one thing.
[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:15.260]   I got the they did a survey to see how savvy they were in social media.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:18.980]   And one of the people said, well, we're very technically advanced.
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:24.220]   I'm proud to say that every one of our offices has a fax machine that they keep on 24 hours
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.220]   of doing.
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:26.220]   Oh my goodness.
[01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:27.220]   No, dear.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.300]   No, and that's a crowd I'm going to be working.
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:33.620]   Okay, I'd leave out the Twitter jokes just to thought.
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:39.580]   John C. DeVorak, the man of a thousand disguises is at channel deVorak.com.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.580]   He is the tech crowd.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:41.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:42.580]   No, he's not.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.660]   It's some other guy with a beard that sounds just like him.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:47.700]   It looks but looks a little like me, but it's not me.
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:51.260]   If John Wrenz is easy top, he didn't change his hat though.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.900]   No, always a Yankees fan.
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:55.340]   They're going to go for you can win in four.
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.340]   Probably.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:30:00.220]   You know, isn't it isn't it like Fox's dream come true a Yankees Dodgers world series?
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.220]   I mean Yankees.
[01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:02.220]   The Dodgers aren't going to make it.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:03.220]   They're not going to make it.
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:05.580]   No, I don't think so.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:06.580]   They haven't got the chops.
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:07.980]   I think Philadelphia is going to beat them.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:09.980]   They're going to be breaking Rupert Murdoch's heart right now.
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   But you're right.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:11.980]   It would have been the dream come true.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:14.580]   That's what everyone wants to see, but I don't think it's going to happen.
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:16.540]   Hey, I'd love to see Philly.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.100]   That'd be awesome.
[01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:19.100]   Thank you, John.
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.260]   As always, have I plugged everyone?
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:25.660]   Well, you got the deVorak.org/blog left out, but that's okay.
[01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:26.660]   It's in channel deVorak.com.
[01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:28.660]   I said I wanted to tell you.
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.940]   This guy is really good at winning this.
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.660]   Did I tell you he was media savvy?
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.660]   Yes.
[01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.660]   Yes.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.660]   Mr. Media savvy.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:38.180]   No, we'd have to say that because it's a drinking game.
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.700]   If he doesn't say that, then people go home sober.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.700]   So where's my whiskey?
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.900]   I got it right here.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.060]   I want to thank you for joining us.
[01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:48.140]   As we mentioned, maybe I didn't.
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:52.620]   I gave a speech at Blog World on Friday to announce that we are going to start doing video.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:55.220]   Jim, please don't hate me.
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:56.820]   But we are going to start doing video of all the--
[01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:57.820]   Why would I hate you?
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.180]   Well, because at one point-- people are always trying to stir up trouble.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:04.540]   At one point, Kevin-- I think Kevin and I said, you do video.
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:05.540]   I'll do audio.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:07.420]   And sure, that was good enough.
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:12.500]   But now my reach needs to expand.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.660]   And so we'll demand it.
[01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.700]   The people demand it.
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.940]   It's all about getting more people to watch and listen to what we're doing.
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:18.940]   It is really.
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:19.940]   It's not as zero.
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.540]   It's not like when I was at PC Week and there was InfoWorld and we were battling for the
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:23.540]   same audience.
[01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:24.540]   You're right.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:25.540]   We need to grow the audience.
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:26.540]   Everything we can do helps.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:28.860]   Yeah, at this point, we're such a nascent industry.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:31.140]   There's no competition, my God.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.780]   But we are going to start doing a video download of the show.
[01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:34.780]   Keep watching for that.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:38.100]   We have a partner with a company called MediaFly that is going to put all of--
[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.500]   Now, we do every show and video.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:42.900]   You can watch this show, for instance, live every Sunday afternoon at 6 p.m.
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:43.900]   Eastern, 3 p.m.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:48.060]   Pacific, 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:51.500]   But then it just kind of ends there with a live stream.
[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.260]   And what we are doing now is we're recording these.
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:54.260]   We're going to edit them.
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:57.420]   We're going to put them up on the iTunes, of course, as a normal podcast.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:59.500]   But I think point of access is really important.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:02.140]   So for that reason, we've done this deal with MediaFly.
[01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.820]   And they're going to put these shows.
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:07.260]   A, you're going to be able to eventually, in a couple of weeks, watch live streams on
[01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:08.260]   all these platforms.
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:12.700]   But they will also put downloadable versions of the shows on the Roku box, on the popcorn
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:17.540]   player, Yahoo TV, the Palm Pre, the iPhone, and many other platforms to come.
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:21.100]   So the idea is anywhere you are, you'll have an icon.
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.060]   You could push that button and you'll see the Twitter icon.
[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.060]   You can see our shows.
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.220]   And by the way, I know revision 3 is doing that with Roku.
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:28.700]   And MediaFly is agnostic.
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.620]   So it's not just-- we're going to be the launch partner.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:36.740]   But every video podcast in the world will be available soon on almost all TVs.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:37.740]   That's awesome.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:39.860]   This is the breakthrough I think we've been--
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:44.380]   Anywhere, anytime, any device, any service, put it on the big screen and people will watch.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.300]   And we call that the future.
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:47.140]   The future.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.740]   I said this in vlog world.
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.500]   I said, we are no longer the new media.
[01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:51.780]   We're just the media.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.420]   And we're coming to get you.
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:54.460]   We know where you live.
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:55.460]   I'm here, don't we?
[01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:55.980]   We do.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.180]   IP addresses are pretty specific.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:58.420]   As a matter of fact, we do.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:00.420]   There used to be a time that salesmen will call.
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:03.380]   Online banner ads were considered new media advertising.
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:04.820]   And now that's considered traditional ads.
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:05.340]   It is, isn't it?
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:06.100]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.500]   So we're very excited about that.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:13.140]   We hope you will continue to subscribe in any form because we love having somebody listen
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:14.780]   to us natter on endlessly.
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:15.500]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:16.780]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:17.380]   Another tweet.
[01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:18.940]   This is amazing.
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:19.940]   Is it in the can?
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:22.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:29.940]   Round the morning.
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:36.940]   Round the morning.
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:41.940]   Round the morning.
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:44.520]   (upbeat music)
