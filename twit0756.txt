[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.760]   What is going on over your left shoulder?
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   Is that an idea?
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   It's just like that is my pile of review gadgets and I just like I've given up.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.280]   And there's also that's the cat tower that has fallen in.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.960]   It's a collapsing cat tower.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   I knew it.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   I thought it looked familiar.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.720]   How's the baby?
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   She is great.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   You'll probably hear her crying amidst this episode too.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720]   She's doing well.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.960]   Just starting to walk and getting more confident with that.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   So it's very exciting.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   Awesome.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   What's great to have you.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.240]   I like to catch up with our friends when they join us.

[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.840]   Got a new job down there in Austin.

[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   Nice.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.280]   Hello, Howdy.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.400]   That's a Mongo's a no SQL.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   Am I right?
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.200]   Yes, it's a document base database as opposed to relational.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.800]   I'm a fan.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.640]   I love the Mongo.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.000]   And it's good to have you.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.640]   Welcome back.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.280]   Also here, Brian McCulloch from the Tech meme, right home podcast.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   Hello, bro.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   Hello.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280]   It is a historian.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.720]   A little bit.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.320]   Mostly podcaster now.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:54.480]   It is a palindrome day as Twitter never stopped reminding me all day long.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:04.400]   0202020 internationally, the first palindromic day internationally in 900 years.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   Woo.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.640]   Also, you say internationally because no matter what format you do it.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   That's right.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.200]   Month day, day, month, the matter.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.520]   It is palindromic, backward and forward.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.040]   It also punks a Tawny fill, predicted a quick spring this year.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.840]   And the San Francisco 49ers trounced the Kansas City Chiefs 100 to nothing.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.200]   One of these things is not, is not yet true.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.880]   Apple made a lot of money.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.480]   That's true in Q4.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.760]   The color charts are up from Jason Snell's fabulous six colors.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.240]   He's become famous now for these charts.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.320]   I asked Jason, how many hours does it take to make these?
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.320]   He says it's all automatic.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.680]   I don't know.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.440]   61% revenue from phone, wearables, 11 services going up, 14% Mac and iPad are kind of the
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:08.200]   laggards there, but it was, yeah, record to Apple quarter that first quarter, first fiscal
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   quarter of the year, which is the fourth calendar quarter is the big selling.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.720]   So 22.2 billion dollars in profit in three months.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   Wow.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   Wow.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.560]   That's, yeah, money, money, money, money.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.400]   Apple also announced one and a half billion active devices in the marketplace.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.680]   More than Microsoft.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.600]   More than anybody.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.400]   Are there that many people in the world?
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.720]   It's an amazing number.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   Yes, there are obviously, but there are only seven billion.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.040]   So one and a half billion is pretty good penetration.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.240]   Yeah, the only number 80% are on us 13.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.440]   Yeah, that was surprising.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.360]   80% on the latest iOS.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   Go ahead to vendor.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.040]   Sorry, total Facebook users too is, well, I think like an interesting number because that's
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.640]   what upwards of two billion now or close to three billion.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.120]   Yeah, they announced we're reaching crazy points.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.280]   Facebook also had great results.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.640]   And there it was the monthly active users was over two billion.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.160]   But even the daily active users was like a billion and a half.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.920]   It was like, I can't remember the numbers exactly.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.800]   Maybe you guys do, but it was like, wow.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.800]   Not Stephen King though.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   He is a Facebook recuser.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.320]   Hold on, I got it right here.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.880]   Daily active users, 1.66 billion monthly active users, 2.5 billion.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.280]   But then, you know what, to vendor, what I think you're thinking about is if you count
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.440]   across the entire family of apps.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.440]   Yes.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   Where's that number?
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.840]   That's the one that's 2.89 billion.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.240]   Once that Instagram and Facebook together, 2.89 billion.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.320]   That's almost half the world.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.880]   I mean, it is almost certainly everybody on the internet, right?
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.880]   Yes.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.840]   We estimate about three billion on the internet.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   We're like over the age of 12 because I think Benedict Evans has a thing up about that
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   today.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.400]   So if you count adults, we're getting to half.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.760]   It's insane.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.960]   It's just crazy that we're talking about billions when it comes to devices and users
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.640]   at this point from single companies.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.360]   Not just like everybody on the internet, but one company has this huge slice of the pie.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.360]   It's insane.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.080]   Is Big Tech too big?
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.040]   Certainly that's the current thought among all the Democratic candidates anyway.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.600]   The vendor is Big Tech too big.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   I think so.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.640]   I think we've gotten way, way too big.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.520]   You know, we've talked about this the last few times I've been on.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:37.880]   It does feel like the tech industry has come from the mentality of being the outsiders,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.440]   the ones who have been fighting against the man.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.360]   And now they are the man and they are so big that countries don't know how to deal with
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   them.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.920]   Facebook is bigger than most countries and the power and influence these things wield.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.760]   There's nobody to keep them at check except for their CEOs who all seem to be either clueless
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.360]   or out of the loop or just have no clue how to handle this power.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   Children.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   We need something.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.680]   They're young people.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.640]   Yeah, I don't know what the, I mean, if you stipulate as I think everybody does that
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.640]   Big Tech is maybe too big.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.360]   I don't know what you do about it.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.120]   I don't know if there's anything to do about it.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.600]   Can I push back and say it depends on what you mean by too big?
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.760]   Because I think I might have even said this on this show before.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.360]   The only previous to this, the only company that you could think of that's like, okay,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.640]   my addressable market is every human being on the planet is maybe like Coca Cola, but
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.000]   no one is like Coca Cola shouldn't sell to every human being.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.960]   It just depends on what you do with what you have.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.280]   But that's kind of the point because Coca Cola doesn't have influence over how people
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.640]   think what they wear, who they vote for.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.760]   But they have huge cultural influences, the thing.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.520]   Like I've been to my families from Guyana, South America.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.200]   So I've been to remote villages in South America, you know, far from civilization.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.720]   And the one thing you can count on getting is a nice cold, you know, Coke.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.600]   But that's a good thing.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   That's a good thing.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.280]   But what's wrong with that?
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.240]   We look at the rising of BCD levels across the world.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.200]   Like all these companies are kind of involved.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.360]   There is that, but they can't leverage sugar water to do other things like, you know, destroy
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.040]   markets or, you know, mess with democracies, things like that.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.600]   I think, but nobody really, and I apologize.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   You're right.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   We always talk about this.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   So I'll stop.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   But a final thought.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.600]   No, let's keep talking about it, please.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:37.800]   I think nobody really thought about what it would mean if a handful of companies dominated
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.120]   the discourse in society, not just US society, but global society.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.240]   No, like, at least in terms of the tech people, there aren't as many people maybe even thinking
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.960]   like the way Steve Jobs used to like thinking in a broader mindset and about what they're
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.480]   stuff means and what it means for the world.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.160]   And yeah, I feel like the philosophy, the striving a lot of tech these days is very
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.640]   much like let's get as many users as possible to hell with what it means for democracy or
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.840]   anybody for that matter.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.720]   Well, and Apple's a good case in point.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:17.280]   You were a participant in the six colors annual report card, Devindra, along with others,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.040]   well known.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.520]   And one of the number one complaints people seem to have.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.080]   I don't remember what your thoughts were on this was that it was unseemly that Apple
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:35.240]   provided essentially a campaign photo op for the president in Austin at the plant down
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   there.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   That was of all the things people were most unhappy about.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.040]   It was Apple's political behavior.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.040]   Almost definitely.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.440]   And Tim Cook was right there like within the first few months, Trump was in office, you
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.520]   know, sitting at the table along with other major CEOs and just suffering through those
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   meetings.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.360]   I would have said that's his job as a CEO.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.560]   It's regardless of who's president or what policies he enforces.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.520]   You know, your job is as in as and this is the problem with tech being too big is that
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:11.200]   really it's a business and your job is to make more money.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:18.360]   And that's Tim Cook's doing his responsible being a responsible CEO, which means that
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.640]   and I've said this before, companies are a moral.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.320]   They don't have a sense of good or bad.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.240]   They're there to make money.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:32.800]   How important is Apple's massive flex plant in Austin where they're cranking out dozens
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.520]   if not hundreds of Mac pros, Wesley?
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.960]   It's not that big.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.080]   So I mean, it's big for a piece of real estate.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   But if you look at like Tesla's factory or something like that, it's nowhere compared
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:56.160]   and to that size, which is it's also once again, it's not factory.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:03.320]   It's it's it's it's been there for a while and it's it just blends into the landscape.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.880]   It's not anything very significant.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.480]   It's a factory in the same way a Plato fun factory is a factory.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.520]   It's the same way that my son's Lego table is a factory.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.120]   It's it assembles products.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.920]   From all around the world, they don't actually make anything.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.680]   No raw material comes in and products come out.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:30.600]   And if I could talk about like what you're saying, is tech too big, I think the issue
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:38.640]   is that the dependence on other companies that that build upon these technologies that
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.480]   is where their power comes from.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.040]   No one's building their business on just selling Coke.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:51.880]   So but people are building an ad business, a consultancy, a photo editing, copywriting,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.400]   all of that based on Facebook.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.400]   It's enabling so much.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.640]   That's why so many more people are coming to depend on it.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.720]   But that's important, right?
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.920]   That's what a platform does.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.280]   That's what Windows did in the 90s, right?
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.040]   It provided a stable platform for people to create businesses on.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   Sure.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   I would say we have.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.880]   But the thing is it's controlled by Facebook in terms like even Windows, if they say,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.320]   hey, we do not allow third party applications, you just don't upgrade, right?
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.480]   You don't choose to move on to the next thing.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.840]   You can in some ways have the ability to opt into those rules.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.160]   But with Facebook, if they change something, everyone has to adopt that platform in that
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   stance.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.720]   It's good to remind people that we have the internet.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.880]   This is the platform.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.800]   This is the Wild West where we could create anything.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.280]   I am a bit sad seeing companies like Facebook and all basically consolidate how communication
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.480]   happens, how we think of the internet and the possibilities of the internet.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.560]   To me, that's really disappointing and very sad.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.760]   So on a broader level, what can we do?
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.280]   We talk about this all the time.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   Regulation would be nice.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.320]   People actually understand the technology in government and in leadership who can actually
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.800]   keep these companies in check too.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.880]   I'm sure you guys talked about that Clearview AI story.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   But that stuff is insane.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.560]   The only reason Google and others haven't done it yet is because even they thought to
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   themselves, this is crazy technology.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   We can't do that.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360]   We can't do this.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   We can't go this far.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:24.040]   But that's also not preventing a small company backed by Peter Thiel to invest in facial recognition
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.040]   tech.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.280]   Because nothing is stopping them.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.880]   I feel like it's almost closing the bar and door after the horse is gone.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   It's out there now.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.880]   There's nothing we can do about it.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.440]   Your face is everywhere and everybody's got it and law enforcement has it.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.920]   I admire companies like Apple for at least trying to keep some lid on privacy.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.320]   Of course, Apple, one could say only does that because their iAds product failed and
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.360]   so they don't have any ad revenue.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.400]   So they can afford to say, "Oh, privacy is a good thing."
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.760]   Yeah, but did you see even that most recent acquisition they did?
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.040]   First of all, I'm trying to remember the name of it.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.040]   It's something.ai.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   Xnor.ai.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   Xnor.ai.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:17.560]   So number one, the whole point is that in theory you could do any sort of machine learning
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.360]   and AI stuff on the device so it doesn't have to go back to the cloud.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360]   So that's great.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   That's great.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.360]   Isn't that great?
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.600]   Privacy, privacy.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.360]   But then also they backed out of that Pentagon thing that Google had to back out of too.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:39.680]   So Xnor had a contract with the Pentagon to do face recognition for drones.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.160]   And this is the one Google was going to get involved in and Google's engineers petitioned
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.040]   them and they pulled out.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:52.360]   Google probably has nothing to do with politics, it probably has more to do with appearance,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.400]   canceled that Maven contract once they bought Xnor.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.240]   They said, "Yeah, we're not going to do that."
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.600]   It's an interesting thing that you were just talking about, like, well, this independent
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.720]   company doing this facial recognition stuff, like this is a rare case of one of the big
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.880]   platforms buying technology that maybe could be used for nefarious things and being like,
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:18.040]   "No, we only want to use this for stuff that maybe would be consumer friendly and user-friendly
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   and privacy friendly."
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:27.160]   Well, Xnor, if I remember correctly, also did the AI for WISE and WISE cameras.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.160]   Oh, that's right.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.160]   And they pulled out that contract.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.160]   That's right.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.200]   So I'm guessing there's a possibility they just canceled all contracts across the board.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.600]   So everyone was available to work on their project.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.240]   But it looked like they left with their pants down because the face recognition on the
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.480]   WISE cameras stopped working when Xnor got purchased.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.840]   That's exactly right.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.920]   But it looks good for Apple to say, "Well, we're not going to do the DoD thing."
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.360]   I think it's more complicated than that.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.040]   Remember Jeff Bezos saying, "Look, it's patriotic.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.680]   Companies in America have always done their best work for the defense of this country.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   That's patriotic.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.320]   What's wrong with that?"
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.640]   I think people confuse abiding by the law and helping the government with right and
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.640]   wrong.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.080]   Turning in Nazis and Nazi Germany was what the government wanted and it was what was...
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.080]   Constrating Jews.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.880]   You want to quote a good citizen.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.720]   And so you can't put what's good and bad with what's the law and what's not the law.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   Those aren't the same thing.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.760]   Oh, you sound like a hippie.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   You sound like a hippie.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:41.560]   I was going to say there's a distinction between helping your country remain strong with its
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   national defense.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.880]   I get what you're saying in terms of the division line between morally right and not.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.560]   Ford built tanks and airplanes for the American War effort in World War II.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560]   Everybody did.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.680]   And maybe they made a little money on it, but at the same time it's the right thing to
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.680]   do.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   It's patriotic.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   If you're bombing Dresden, you can make all sorts of arguments as morally reprehensible
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.720]   and a war crime and things like that.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   But the point is...
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.320]   And Dow made napalm during Vietnam.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.280]   If all of this technology stuff is to get an edge and I'm not making...
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:24.480]   I also applaud Apple for not getting involved with this particular program, but if all
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.720]   of these technologies now like AI are what keep you ahead in military stuff, in defense
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:36.400]   then at what point are you hobbling your own country if you don't participate?
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.080]   It's complicated, isn't it?
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:45.320]   Speaking of complicated, Apple's going to come up against a problem in Russia soon.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.480]   In November, the parliament, as we've talked about before, passed what Fast Company calls
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.600]   the law against Apple.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:19:00.200]   The law requires all smartphone devices in Russia to preload Russian apps ostensibly
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.360]   to support the Russian economy, but I think it's also feared that those Russian apps might
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.600]   provide information to the government about its citizens.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.840]   Apple always prohibits this.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.980]   The law goes into effect in July and some say, Fast Company says, "This is going to force
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:24.480]   Apple to decide, do we allow Russia to put spyware on our phones or do we pull out of
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.320]   the market?"
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.800]   What would you do to Vendra?
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.520]   It would be nice to see Apple resist this somewhat, but every town company is fine doing business
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.520]   in China.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.360]   That also involves quite a few privacy-related issues there too, except they're not preloading
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.480]   things in China, but it also seems like it's only a matter of time until that's something
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   that's going to happen.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   Well, and Apple had to move the iCloud servers to China for Chinese customers, presumably
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:02.120]   to companies that the Chinese government could then get into the servers.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.560]   It's tough.
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.920]   We are now in a much more global environment than ever before.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.360]   Markets are global, and yet every country has its own laws.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.640]   Every state has its own laws.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.800]   Look at California with our New Privacy Act.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.760]   All of a sudden companies have to do something separate for California than they might do
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.320]   in the rest of the country.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.520]   Yeah, but for Apple especially, this is so different from their whole philosophy of we
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.160]   own the device.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   It's pure.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.600]   We do software and hardware.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.000]   They still sell to China, but it's the same essential phone.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.600]   That's not a privacy thing.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.600]   It's an aesthetic.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:48.560]   No, but what I'm saying is that beyond the questions of cow-towing to various regimes
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.600]   requests and things like that, I can see that it's also a little different because Apple
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.800]   would essentially have to give up what it has said its entire life.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.560]   The product we deliver to you is exactly the way we want it to be.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:09.680]   As opposed to, well, in Russia, you're going to get some sort of chintzy mail or maps app
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   or whatever.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.160]   But it seems that they removed the news app for the China market too.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.120]   I mean, they have made concessions.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.720]   They took the Chinese flag.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.560]   They took the Taiwanese flag off the emoji.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.800]   They've done that kind of thing all along, right?
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   Around the edges.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   But again, what I'm saying is...
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   Around the edges, yeah.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:37.360]   Like if it's a Russian photo app alongside photos, if it's a...
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.240]   Yeah, big deal.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.920]   But all down the line, if it's email, if it's the browser, I'm assuming, is the prime thing
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.080]   that the government wants to load up there as well.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.360]   Well, it would be very interesting.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.360]   Come July.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.920]   I can't wait to see.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920]   You've got to...
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.000]   This is one situation where it seems like the business value, if it's $3 billion or something
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.240]   close to that, it's not that big to Apple.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.600]   A company with such a huge war chest, they can take that hit and have the goodwill of
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.400]   being the company that said "No to Vladimir Putin" basically.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.800]   I think they would love that.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.040]   Except then China comes along.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.160]   And now you've got a problem.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.040]   So as soon as you make a concession to Russia, the next...
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.320]   You've got to play the chess game a couple moves ahead.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.680]   Now China's going to come and say, "Yeah, we'd like to do the same thing.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.680]   Now what do you do?"
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.080]   Because you can't leave China.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   Exactly.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.160]   How's their black market?
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:38.480]   I mean, if they pull out of Russia, will most of the people who can afford iPhones just
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.000]   import them anyway?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.200]   And that's just a little bit of a Russia tax that the people don't like that.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   They used to be a problem in China.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.400]   I remember a few years ago, we'd go to the Apple store getting lined up by an iPhone
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.880]   and there'd be a ton of people waiting in line who were planning to...
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.160]   Who were on a mission to buy phones to send to China.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   And that's how they got the supply chain going.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.440]   I know Apple didn't like that.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   I don't know.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   So very...
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.000]   I'm just glad I'm not Tim Cook.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.360]   Although he's got the wallet to maybe make up for any emotional trauma.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.520]   They had a record quarter.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.960]   They're doing quite well.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.560]   They did mention coronavirus.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.600]   They've closed stores in China.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.400]   They're worried that coronavirus could slow down production.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   China...
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.400]   Davin, or you're probably an expert on this given your job.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.680]   China shuts down anyway for the new year, right?
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.840]   They've been shut down all week.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.920]   They decided to extend that shutdown for the lunar new year a little longer because of
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.240]   coronavirus.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.160]   The markets open on Monday.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.320]   I don't know if factories are going to start reopening, but there is some concern that production
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:54.200]   might be slowed, that Apple might even have to move production out of China.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.920]   Yeah, I'm definitely not an expert on this.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   Oh, come on.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   Just say you are.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   You don't actually make...
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.360]   It makes a lot of sense and especially continuing on from the years holiday.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.920]   That's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.800]   It's going to be interesting to see how all the companies deal with the coronavirus outbreak
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:18.520]   and honestly, I'm a little worried too because it seems like China is not equipped for this.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.600]   Most countries aren't equipped for potential global pandemics.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.520]   Actually, it's more than just Apple.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.880]   China is so much better equipped than we are.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.440]   I was just going to say.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:33.200]   Well, they have dismantled our entire pandemic team.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   That's true.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:42.360]   Obama, when Ebola outbreak happened a few years ago, created a cross agency team to respond
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.520]   better to all of this.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.480]   That's been dismantled.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.400]   Not only that, have you seen the video of that hospital that they put together?
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   Two weeks.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.720]   China built a 1000, several 1000 bed hospitals for coronavirus victims in two weeks.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.560]   But that's after time of them delaying it and ignoring the problem and pretending it
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.560]   didn't exist.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.680]   The best way to stop a pandemic is to acknowledge it and not try to hide it.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.240]   They tried for a very long time to stop this basically or to make people not aware they
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   existed.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.800]   Well, it's embarrassing when people get sick.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.480]   But only, compared to the flu, it'll be more than 50,000 flu deaths in the US this year.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.240]   There's only been 260, I think.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.800]   Get your flu shots, people.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   Get the flu shot.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.640]   Don't worry about coronavirus just yet.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   And you're right.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   Certainly quick action.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.600]   I just watched contagion last night just to update myself.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.800]   I'm on practices and best practices in case of flu.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.680]   Stay away from Jude Linus Paltrow apparently.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.160]   Yeah, first of all, don't have drinks with the Kenneth Paltrow.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.520]   Not the greatest movie, but I know here's why I watched it.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   I'm looking at iTunes.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520]   This movie came out in 2011.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.160]   All of a sudden it's in the top five movies on iTunes.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.680]   I think I'm not alone.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.160]   People go, what do you do?
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.160]   It's funny.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.040]   We process our anxiety by watching movies basically these days.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.640]   Nowadays, the worst horror movies are those.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.880]   In fact, I have to now that I'm thinking about it, there's a reason.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.160]   There was a guy at Cal who was an expert in sick joke cycles.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.160]   He was great.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.560]   Dundas, Alan J. Dundas, something like that.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.920]   He was great because he said they're always tied to our psyches.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.800]   And we joke about the stuff that makes us most uncomfortable.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.640]   And he would tie the various dead baby jokes had to do with changes in abortion rights
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   in America.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.800]   He would tie this in.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.720]   And I bet you Dundas has some thoughts about why all the zombie movies became bigger over
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   the last 20 years.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.320]   And I have to think it's related to our concerns about global pandemics and epidemics.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.280]   Like this is like our psyche processing, you know, and boy, you watch contagion.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.160]   It's a horror movie.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.280]   Can I make you feel a little bit better?
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.640]   I did on my long read segment this week.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.760]   I did the New York Times piece about coming up with vaccines.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:10.240]   And according to the piece in 2003 when SARS broke out, it took researchers about 20 months
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:16.960]   to get come up with a vaccine after the genome was sequenced by the time of the Zika virus
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.200]   in 2015.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.480]   That was brought down to six months.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.120]   And they think they can do it in three months this time.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120]   Nice.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.320]   Because the whole whole world is working together.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.840]   Now the question is it comes back to this idea of like if you, you know, once it's out
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.480]   of the door, like even if you come up with a vaccine within three months, well, it'll
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.040]   be already all the way all the way around the world at that point.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:42.960]   So even even is three months too slow to actually stop it dead in its tracks.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:48.000]   Forget 1917, Academy Award nominated film about World War One.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.880]   We should make one called 1918 about the flu pandemic of 1918.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.520]   That killed what it was a huge millions.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.480]   I'm surprised that's not like, yeah, that needs to be like a Netflix series or HBO series
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   at this point.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.560]   There's several great documentaries on it.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.640]   I think one of them's from PBS actually.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:13.320]   Did you hear that they're saying like one of the articles about how Apple's products
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   are actually causing or not causing but not helping to prevent this?
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:24.600]   Because, you know, the coronavirus, which is a lot worse than the Doseki's virus, it's
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.600]   transmitted.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   It's been tried by Spittel.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   Spittel.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   Oh, Spittel.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.880]   Apple's Face ID doesn't work with the face mask off on.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   Oh.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:38.040]   So in order to unlock your phone, which people say you do like, you know, dozens of times
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.600]   a day, you take your face mask off in order to unlock your phone.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.800]   Well, and that's what happened to me.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.200]   It's aging to help transmit.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.400]   Gwen and Paltrow did a selfie with some poor guy and he died.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   So.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.200]   Well, Wesley, I actually thought about this this week.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.400]   Like, could we get?
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   I'm not.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.200]   I'm so glad we're hungry.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.400]   Could we ever get a contagion that it's like all of a sudden people find out like a month
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   or two months into it?
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:09.560]   It's because we all have our phones and we're touching them 70, 80, 120 times a day.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:15.360]   And so then because we never back in 1918, we didn't have one thing that we all touched
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.040]   so many times and so that all of a sudden the cure is is we all have to stop using our
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.040]   smart.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.120]   Leo, that's your, that's Hollywood script.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.000]   There's a movie right there.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Let's go pitch it right now.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   What we need.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.680]   They're, they already make smartphone like sanitizers basically.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.400]   So like I'm, I'm sure like everybody will just start using those things like crazy.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.320]   Who can forget Douglas Adams and hitchhikers guided the galaxy.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.760]   They decided to ship all the useless people off.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.600]   They told them the earth, the planet is going to be destroyed.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.280]   So we're going to make this giant spaceship and all the phone sanitizers, which apparently
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.360]   I didn't know until I read this book is a business in the UK.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.760]   All the phone sanitizers got on the ship and were shipped off.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.720]   There was no, obviously everybody else went on with their lives until a massive epidemic
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:02.880]   caused by a dirty phone killed off everybody.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.280]   What we need is something that will purify our air.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.000]   Wow, you are good.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.640]   That's Carson Bondi, our producer.
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.920]   And he's apparently giving me the signal that it's time to mention our first sponsor of the
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.160]   show, Molecule.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.200]   I do have my Molecule running.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.960]   In the Molecule, the Molecule will kill viruses.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.920]   It's actually better than a HEPA filter.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:32.200]   HEPA's were invented during World War II, widely used in hospitals, but they're filters.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:39.280]   They trap particles of a certain size, but the truth is indoor air pollutants can be
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:48.040]   much, much smaller than those trapped by HEPA filters, including bacteria, mold, viruses,
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:52.720]   allergens, things that can make you sick, volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde from your
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:31:00.080]   carpet, paint from your walls, Molecule traps it all using something called PICO, photoelectrochemical
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:00.920]   oxidation.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.840]   And actually, I have to say, we bought a Molecule, I think it's now been a couple of years,
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.520]   because Lisa would wake up every morning with a headache, because when we moved to the country,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.280]   there were a lot of pollens and allergens, and she would just, we got the Molecule, it
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.400]   fixed it.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   It fixed it.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.920]   Her headache was gone, which was amazing.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.480]   That's why we bought another one from Michael's room.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.840]   We have one in the studio now.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.480]   We love these things.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.080]   They not only get all the allergens, all the toxic chemicals, all the viruses and the bacteria,
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.560]   they destroy them.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.640]   That's what PICO does.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.560]   It actually oxidizes them.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.600]   There's a blue light that goes, and it just destroys them.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.320]   It also has a filter, so it gets everything.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.760]   It's been great for us and our family.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.600]   It's been verified by labs all over the country.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.640]   It is an amazing technology to help you sleep better.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.360]   It'll help you breathe better.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.880]   It'll help clean the air in your house.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.360]   If you're in an office where you can't open the window, you absolutely need a Molecule.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:02.600]   Indoor air can be up to five times worse than outdoor air, according to the APA.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.240]   You got to stop breathing that horrible air in your office and get a Molecule.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.520]   They've got the Molecule air.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.520]   That's the one we have here in the studio for large rooms.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.720]   There's now an air mini for smaller rooms, choose a Molecule that fits your space the
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   best.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.440]   You can also pair it to your phone and automatically send you filters when you need new ones.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.240]   You don't have to think about it.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.280]   You can look on the phone and see the state of your Molecule, but it'll also just order
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   filters for you.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   If you want, you don't have to.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.520]   I just think the Molecule is a great technology.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.160]   For 10% off your first Molecule, look at that too.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.840]   It's beautiful cast aluminum.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.240]   There's the Mini on the coffee table there.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:45.360]   For 10% off your first air purifier, Molecule is spelled with a K M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E dot com.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.240]   Use the offer code TWIT10 to get 10% off.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   We love our Molecules, you will too.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:58.520]   Molecule, it's been tested at the University of Minnesota Particle Calibration Laboratory.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.600]   And others, other universities, Molecule dot com, offer code is TWIT10.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.840]   That's the only air purifier I use and recommend.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840]   We love it.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   Yeah, I didn't even think of that.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.040]   We are defended against the coronavirus.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.560]   So come on in, everybody.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.400]   Come on in.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.760]   Google's shutting down, it's a China offices too.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.160]   Let's see here.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:34.880]   The EU has patented, I'm sorry, passed the measure requiring a common charger standard.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.320]   I'm a little confused because I've read stories that said this is the death knell for the
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.920]   lightning port and I've read stories saying it doesn't have anything to do with the lightning
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.920]   port.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.040]   Brian, which is it?
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.280]   I'm confused too and I also don't know, is this one of those recommendations?
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.880]   But it's not coming into force as a law yet.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.440]   Yeah, it's a resolution.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.480]   So it might be one of those things where we're still so far ahead of the game.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.480]   They didn't pass a law that says, you know, beginning at 2021, all phones must be USB
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.760]   C or something like that.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.760]   So I wish they would.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.040]   Apple says that would stifle innovation would also stifle profits because they make
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.720]   a lot of money in the lightning port.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.320]   The laws only really talks about the adapter saying universal adapter.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.880]   I've read it several several times.
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.640]   It's the brick, the charging brick, right?
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   It's the brick.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640]   But it doesn't talk about the port on the phone.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.080]   That's why I show you this.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.880]   This is USB C on one side and lightning on the other.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.880]   There you go.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:38.800]   They could add another dongle, drop that into the box.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.400]   Didn't Apple do that when it was a micro USB was required for charging?
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.080]   For a while they put a dongle in the box and they stopped them that sure way.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.840]   So I mean, it can convert all power bricks to USB C, but then they'll just ship this
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:56.640]   and still be able to use lightning for all of their products and they would get around
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   the law.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   I'm surprised Apple.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:03.240]   It doesn't like this because they use USB C on their laptops and their iPad Pros.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   Yep.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.680]   Why wouldn't Apple's very confusing?
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.600]   Very confusing.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.840]   And it doesn't corner the market in terms of innovation, in terms of like their own power
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:21.160]   standards because they could say, yeah, we'll use Qi on all of our stuff, but it'll max
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:27.640]   out at five watts, but you have to use the Apple branded one to use 35 watts or 45 watts
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.720]   or whatever, the higher wattage because they want to make sure that your phone is safe.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:38.800]   So it could be encryption or authorization or handshake to make sure it's an authorized
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.880]   Apple charger.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.840]   So they can, in terms of accessories, they still can lock it down even though it's a
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840]   common standard.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.480]   So in terms of innovation, I think they're just fighting it.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.520]   Wesley, if you've actually read the law, because I saw that too that like they're suggesting
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:00.960]   that we move all towards wireless charging so in a way the EU is pushing Apple to eliminate
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   more ports.
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   Forget about headphone jack.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   Right.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.560]   Was there a rumor that they were going to eliminate the port on the iPhone next year?
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.560]   Maybe this year.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.560]   I don't know.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.560]   Good God.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.560]   That's right.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.120]   We'll do an end run around the E.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.800]   But do we really need a connector on our phone?
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.640]   You got rid of the headphone port.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.840]   Well, it's just do everything wirelessly.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.400]   I think until we have like true over the air wireless charging, wireless charging as it
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.520]   is now is just like, it's a nice secondary thing.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.520]   It's a nice thing that your phone could do once in a while if you have a, you know, wireless
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.440]   charging stand or something about your desk.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.360]   But we like to use our phones while they're charging and you can't do that easily with
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.520]   wireless wireless.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.680]   Wireless is slower.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:42.680]   It's more finicky.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.920]   You don't know if like, I know a lot of people who have wireless charging stands by their,
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.760]   you know, nightstands and half the time they misjudge like where exactly they put their
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.320]   phone or it shifts overnight and you stop charging.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.120]   It's two different phones.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   Like I, you know, I use the same one and like the last pixel phone didn't work.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.960]   It works fine with the Apple, the iPhone like, yeah, it's, it's not the same thing as like,
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.840]   this is a jack that was designed for this device.
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840]   Samsung does that too.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.600]   If you want fast charging, you have to buy their little brick.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.080]   I think a lot of companies do that.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.840]   Qualcomm has its own standard for quick charge.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.880]   There's, but it would be nice if we all could, can't we all just agree?
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.720]   On the other hand, you don't want governments to say, no, look, you can't use quick charge
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   three.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.720]   You can't use Samsung's charge.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.120]   You have to use this technology.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.640]   You don't want a government to tell tech companies, no, no, we're going to do this standard.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.840]   That seems like a recipe for disaster too.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.840]   I think this goes back to what I was saying before.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.920]   Like it would be nice to have people in government and leadership who understand the
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.080]   stuff enough not to just be like, oh, yeah, we just need, you know, a very dumb way to
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.680]   achieve universal charging standards.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.080]   We could do this in a smarter way that actually could make Apple, you know, want to use USB
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   C in their phones.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.400]   But I also honor their desire to reduce e-waste.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.000]   Huge problem with all these chargers.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.360]   A lot of e-waste.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.800]   And it's good for consumers if you can, you know, get a couple of chargers and use it
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.960]   on all your devices.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.960]   That's good.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.800]   So ever since we've moved to USB C charging for laptops, my life has been so much easier.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   So much easier.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   Yes.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   People forget so many laptops.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.640]   Their phone used to have a different charger.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.520]   They do remember every laptop used to have a different charger.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.200]   Now it's a much more unified place.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   The only exception is Apple stuff.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.000]   Apple stuff and gaming.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.720]   This is actually going to cause more e-waste because everyone's have to dump their lightning
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.040]   cables too.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.200]   So all the lightning, all the 1.5 billion was the last thing we talked about of Apple
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   devices.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.160]   All of those cables are going to go into the dump.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.840]   And so that's their argument of saying how this law hurts e-waste.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:52.840]   Apple, I'm sorry, Amazon was at great pains during its quarterly results call to tell
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:56.240]   you they pay a lot of taxes.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.360]   This zero taxes BS.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:07.040]   Apple actually keeps saying Apple Amazon actually had a blog post about how much they spend on
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.040]   taxes.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.520]   All the jobs they created.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:17.120]   A billion dollars in federal income tax of 2019, 2.4 billion in other federal taxes, including
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.800]   payroll taxes and customs duties, 1.6 billion dollars in state and local taxes.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.560]   And last year alone, Amazon collected and remitted 9 billion dollars in sales and use
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.040]   taxes to states and localities.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.840]   So, there.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.680]   Okay.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.960]   You can only pay taxes when you report profits, right?
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   It's really up to Amazon.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.480]   I swear to God, they got a little dial.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.640]   Jeff Bezos' office, how much should we pay this year?
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.160]   How much should we make this year?
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.560]   They made a lot of money.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:56.160]   Amazon, $87.4 billion in quarterly revenue, up 21% year over year.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.640]   Net income, 3.3, they're not nearly as profitable as Apple is.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.440]   Net income of $3.3 billion, that's up from three.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.480]   But as you're saying, they never want to be.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480]   That's right.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.440]   That's exactly right.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.120]   It could be anything you want, Jeff.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.800]   How much money do you want to make this year?
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.520]   Just turn that knob because they just reinvest it, right?
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.360]   He did say, for the first time, I don't remember Bezos ever saying how many Amazon prime subscribers
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.360]   there are.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:31.480]   He did tell us there are 150 million paid prime subscribers globally.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.680]   He must have said it at some other time because that's up from the 100 million 21 months ago.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.960]   Which was, I think, a guess 21 months ago.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:40.960]   Okay.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.520]   I think people were projecting that number as I remember.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:46.520]   I don't know.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.280]   You and I do a lot of news.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.120]   It all blurs after a while.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:54.880]   I literally cannot remember when I get home at 6 p.m.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.720]   And my wife will say, "What did you talk about today?"
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   I don't think I know.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:58.720]   No idea.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.720]   Yeah, Lisa does that.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.160]   She says, "Is there anything I should know about?"
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:08.040]   I was like, "Yeah, I'm sure there is.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.360]   Listen to the podcast.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.560]   It's gone from my mind completely."
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.880]   Let's see.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   What else?
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.680]   It's gone from my mind.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   We did Apple.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   We did Amazon.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.600]   Facebook had a good quarter.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   We mentioned there.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.960]   Oh, I know.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.520]   So this last week was the 10th anniversary of the iPad.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.080]   I thought the iPad was a pretty good thing.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.320]   I like my iPad.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.640]   Apparently, I'm a loser.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.640]   Everybody agrees.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.000]   The iPad.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.160]   Ben Thompson.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:42.080]   The headline on Stratecary, the tragic iPad.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   John Gruber.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.520]   It's a disappointment.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.680]   Even in this thing, the vendor that you and everybody else got to do, but I wasn't invited
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.880]   to, that Jason Stell does the Apple report card.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.840]   You would have gave him the iPad the D+ or something.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.320]   I thought the iPad was pretty good.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.760]   What's wrong with the iPad?
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.760]   What'd you give it?
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   That's a good question.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   What'd you give it to, Vindra?
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   I forget.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.760]   You don't remember it.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.680]   In the report card.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:15.160]   It does seem like we should give the iPad credit for being the tablet that survived.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.280]   It was the thing that inspired everybody to make tablets.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:25.000]   There are certainly very few Android tablets I think are worth buying.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.240]   Microsoft took the strategy of trying to turn Windows into the tablet thing.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.680]   Convertible PCs technically are tablet-like, but I still don't like the way Windows handles
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680]   tablet stuff.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.960]   The iPad is the only successful tablet.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.400]   It's been doing good business for them.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.040]   I think where Apple Folters is in terms of supporting multitasking, they were slow to
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   that.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.880]   They were slow to turning the iPad into a usable computing platform.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:56.680]   As a tablet, I think they deserve credit for at least being successful and trying to push
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.680]   things forward.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.920]   I will tell you what you said.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.960]   I have the transcript you actually said.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   Every gadget geek should own one.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.920]   Actually, I overstated its bad grade.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.880]   It got a B+.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880]   B+ sounds about right.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:15.120]   That's not really like as of last year or two years ago when the base iPad was like 230
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   bucks.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   It's like, "Yeah, you should have one.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.120]   I have one."
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.120]   Yeah, everybody should have one.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.880]   That was the first iPad I bought myself too.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.680]   I bought it specifically so my parents can FaceTime my baby daughter.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.200]   It's been perfect for that.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.360]   Every night at dinner time, hit a button, go straight to my mom's phone or my dad's
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.960]   phone and they get to see Sophia every single night.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.600]   That is far easier than most other solutions out there.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:44.760]   One thing a lot of people agreed on, including Ben Thompson and John Gruber, is the multitasking.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:51.320]   The split screen and the slide over, they seem to agree that that's very poorly implemented.
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:56.320]   I think everybody on Macbreak Weekly said, "Yeah, they should just dump the multitasking
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.120]   because it doesn't work very well."
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:02.320]   They blame this not on Steve Jobs, whose original conception they think was right
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.280]   on, I would agree.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:11.160]   But on subsequent software developers over the years, we can blame...
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   Sorry.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.400]   Who's the scapegoat?
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.120]   Everybody at Apple blames for everything wrong with Apple.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   He was fired.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.120]   I can't remember his name.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.200]   It's like, "Oh, we got rid of him."
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.200]   Johnny Ive?
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.200]   No.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.200]   Maybe he could blame Johnny now.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.880]   But we blame Johnny Ive for a lot.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   Rubenstein or somebody like that.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880]   No, it was...
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.600]   Oh, I can't remember his name.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   The guy that did the map stuff.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.040]   Leo, how much of this is...
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.480]   I think about this a lot.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:43.280]   There's certain people out there who maybe we can blame Steve Jobs because he made the
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   trucks versus cars thing.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:54.440]   There's a certain segment of people that believed that tablets would replace the computer.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.960]   The fact that 10 years...
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.880]   That's what this is about.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   There are certain people that are disappointed that you still need something with a keyboard
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.880]   and a mouse.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:11.440]   If it's just that it's not doing everything yet, that doesn't mean that it's a failure
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.040]   as a product, right?
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:19.880]   No, I think a lot of the complaints are more that it should be better.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.480]   It should be more.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.480]   Like stagnant.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.280]   That it's a little stagnant.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.120]   And I think with iPadOS, they've been making some progress, but I guess people wanted more
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.120]   from the iPad.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.120]   I see.
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   I do feel like...
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.120]   Yeah, the iPad Pro, right?
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   Was there next step for Hearthstone?
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   Scott for Hearthstone.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.120]   Thank you, Jairum.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   Scott for Hearthstone.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:39.120]   It's all Scott's fault.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.120]   It's all Scott's fault.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.880]   iPad Pro though, great hardware.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.880]   We've loved the hardware.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.760]   It's been well reviewed since they launched that thing.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.800]   And certainly in the most recent years, it's beautiful.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.120]   But the software has always been slow to catch up to that hardware.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.240]   So Apple, they've been lagging on Mac OS software and iOS too.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.120]   They have a lot of software innovation they really need to focus on.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.520]   But the iPad has a computer replacement.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.760]   I think a lot of people I talk to even texture analysts, some people use that for all they
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.040]   do, for image editing, for reporting.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.600]   I personally couldn't live that way, but it certainly would be great for a weekend way
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.720]   to go and just write a long thing and not have to worry too much about...
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.160]   But that's kind of my point, is that it's all these people that are like, "Well, I'll
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.880]   never need a computer again.
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.640]   I'll have this tablet."
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.480]   And so it's just the disappointment of those people that imagine that that's what they
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.080]   were going to have by now.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:31.960]   And what if the answer is that, again, you have a car for something, you have a truck
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.880]   for something, you got a semi for something.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.600]   Like so, all right, a tablet is great for, like you were saying.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.960]   I did FaceTiming with the grandparents this afternoon.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.840]   So, what that the tablet didn't kill the laptop?
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.240]   Like who cares?
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.640]   I think the problem is that it's all of this stuff so expensive.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:47:02.200]   If like all of us, somebody's buying you this stuff, you can have an iPhone, an Apple,
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.800]   MacBook, a Windows machine, an iPad, and then it kind of all is a continuum of stuff
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.280]   and you use the right thing for the right time.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.400]   But if you had only choose one, it probably wouldn't be the iPad.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.400]   Right.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.720]   And normal people have to choose one.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.800]   They're so expensive.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.160]   From my friends, I don't use a Mac, but the value prop that they have seen the most out
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.240]   of iOS 13 is Sidecar.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:33.800]   And so, they've given up on using the iPad for everything, but as a companion to their
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:39.320]   laptop, that feature makes it far more usable for them.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:45.680]   And so, if Apple was choosing not to focus on being standalone, but actually part of
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:53.640]   a workflow where it's easy to work with it, their applications or other hardware, I think
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.040]   that is the true nature and the true purpose of iPad where it could really shine.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.440]   Let me take a break.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.840]   I want to pick this conversation up because I've been working on a theory and you can
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:08.040]   help me develop this about where computing is going, going forward.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.040]   And the iPad works into this, but we need to take a break because the Super Bowl is
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.360]   going to start any minute now and I want to get out of here in five minutes.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:19.080]   Our show today, bro, no, I know, we have another hour.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.200]   Our show today brought to you by Kaptara.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.520]   If you're in business, you need software, right?
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.800]   But so much business software is, can I be blunt crap?
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.840]   Mostly because you use an old stuff.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:36.960]   That's why so many people are still running Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 95, Internet
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:42.520]   Explorer 8, because they have an old program that the bosses nephew Joey wrote when he
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   was in school.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.160]   Now he's moved to Borneo and he's not updating it, but that's the only thing.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:53.120]   Kaptara is a directory of all the best enterprise software, the big categories like CRM, the
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.040]   little stuff too, like individual line of business software like Yoga Studio Management.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.600]   There are 700 categories, thousands of programs in here.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.840]   No longer, it doesn't make sense to Google it.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.240]   It doesn't make sense to ask people.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.760]   Just go to kaptara.com/twit.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.360]   You could find the right software.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.000]   It's really easy to say, here's the category, here's what I'm looking for.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.280]   They then have customized filters that are applied to that specific program, you know,
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:25.960]   how many seats, if it's on the web or if it's on premises, if it's, you know, just if
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.240]   it's a Yoga Studio, whether you can make appointments, you know, all the stuff that
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:34.760]   you need, you click those boxes and you narrow it down, you can do a side-by-side comparison,
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:37.400]   just like the magazine, see all the features together.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:43.360]   Again, the best part about kaptara kicks in because kaptara has more than a million real
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   world reviews from real users.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.160]   So you can, before you decide to buy, you can see what people are actually using the
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.440]   software say about it.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.440]   This is amazing.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:58.800]   I think one of the reasons there are so many reviews is because kaptara is free.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.680]   There's no charge ever for this.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.960]   It is a free directory.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.480]   And I think people feel like, "Well, I want to pay it forward.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.680]   I mean, this is great."
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.680]   And you're more than welcome.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   Leave a review.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.840]   It really helps make kaptara the leading free online resource for software solutions.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.200]   Kaptara believes every business can thrive with the right software.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   You deserve it.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.400]   There's lots of other information there, helpful articles, guidebooks, step-by-step, ebooks.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.360]   It's all free.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.880]   Kaptara, C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A.com/twit.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.840]   It helped us find a perfect sales system.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   Kaptara is the solution.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.200]   Kaptara.com/twit.

[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.080]   Did I say it's free?
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.080]   It's free.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   Kaptara.
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:45.040]   Software selection simplified.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.840]   Thank you, Kaptara, for supporting our shows.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:52.920]   And thank you for supporting us by going to that special address, kaptara.com/twit.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.800]   We got a brand new show coming to the network.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.720]   Actually, we're launching a bunch of shows this year.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:02.760]   I thought we'd show you a little bit of the new show that Michael Sargent's putting together
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.320]   watch.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   So you got an Apple TV or an iPhone or an iPad or any number of iOS, iPad OS, TV OS,
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.960]   watch OS devices.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.280]   And now you want to get the best out of them.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.720]   Well, that's what I'm here to help you with.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   You've got questions.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.200]   You've got apps you want to try out.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.760]   You want to learn some secrets, some tips and tricks.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.000]   That's what this show is all about.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.400]   It's hands on iOS.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:36.440]   And I'm so pumped to guide you through getting the most out of your iOS devices.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.840]   So if you want to check out the show, go ahead and click subscribe.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:45.640]   You can do so in Apple podcasts, pocket casts or whatever podcast application you use.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:51.200]   And if you want to check it out, just head to twit.tv/hoy to learn more.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.880]   One of the whole slate of HO shows we're going to do hands on shows.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.680]   I'm going to be doing a Mac show.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.120]   They've promised they will let me do a Linux show.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:05.560]   I begged them, please let me do a Linux show.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.120]   So I think these are going to be great.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.240]   Nice short bits that help you with little tips and tricks.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.200]   I'm watching it.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   Twit.tv/hoy.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.920]   So here's my theory.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.280]   And this has to do a little bit with the iPad.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:22.000]   It's clear that what's happening with computing is it's going from a big powerful computer
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.040]   in the middle.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.920]   In the earliest days, it was a mainframe with dumb terminals at the end.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.440]   But then it's slowly spreading out to the edge.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:33.640]   Then you had a desktop PC.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.560]   Now that's the big dumb computer in the middle.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:40.480]   And it's moving out to the edge again with your phone, with IoT devices.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:46.080]   Computing power has chips, memory, software's gotten so cheap that you can put a computer
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.080]   in your light bulb now.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:53.160]   And so this is what Sacha Nadella is calling computing at the edge.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.440]   And it strikes me that that's what we're seeing.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:01.400]   The reason the iPad is maybe a little frustrating for some people is it's more of an edge device
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.960]   than a central device.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.000]   But it's not quite as edge device as the iPhone.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.680]   It's kind of stuck in the middle.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:09.840]   Does that make sense, Devendra?
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.720]   I think it's kind of a transitionary device.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.040]   And I can understand that frustration.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.440]   Like I said, I've talked to a lot of people who use this, their primary computing device.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   I could never do that.
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:25.060]   And if I tried to do that, I feel like I would be very frustrated because the CMS we use at
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.520]   Engadges nearly 20 years old at this point.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.320]   Using stuff like that, like ugly old web tech.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.000]   See, you're stuck with that old stuff.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Like what we're just talking about.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.640]   But we need, I think we still need people doing productivity work.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.560]   Still need traditional computers or something wrong, I think, with a traditional computer.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.840]   And you look at laptops over the past couple of years.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:48.240]   Over the last year, honestly, like laptops look incredible now.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   They're so sleek.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   They can do a lot more.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.960]   Sure, you're still using a keyboard and mouse and dealing with older interfaces.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:57.640]   But I think what you can actually do with those machines is a lot more than you could
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   in the past.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.280]   And yeah, that means the iPad being more of a consumption device, maybe not as much of
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.520]   a creativity device.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.880]   I think that's still useful.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.800]   But Microsoft, like their dual screen stuff, I'm really intrigued by that.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   The duo and the Neo.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.800]   Yes.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.400]   I can't wait to see those end of the year.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.720]   I think we're going to see more and more of this.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.480]   And of course, Sacha Nadella talks about it because they, eventually their business model
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.720]   is Azure, the centralized data and services that they want to offer.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.920]   And that's why they don't care so much about Windows anymore.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   Sure.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.200]   I mean, game consoles are computing now.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   If you're playing games in your living room, but now you can also stream your game and what
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.960]   you're playing and broadcast from that to mixer or a twitch or something.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:41.600]   So what you could do with your computer is a lot different now.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.960]   You could do computing related stuff pretty much anywhere all across your home.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.960]   And I don't know.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.520]   Like to me, I would love to see a dual screen device.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:55.080]   Like I've tested out a couple of those laptops with two separate screens, like the Asus ZenBook
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.480]   Pro Duo.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.640]   And that thing works really well.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.720]   Like it's a big 12 inch screen right below the main screen.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.280]   And there's a lot you can do with that.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.320]   They just showed off a new one, the ZenBook Duo, I think it's CES.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.800]   That one's like three pounds, a lot sleeker.
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.120]   That sort of stuff, I think will really extend the functionality of what you can expect from
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   a PC too.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.560]   Like things are transforming all around us.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:20.120]   I do see though, a lot of, I mean, I'm more interested in the Duo with two screens and
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.120]   a hinge.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.120]   It's beautiful.
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:27.480]   And maybe the ZenBook Duo, which is kind of an interesting idea, that I am in a Bendy
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.480]   screen.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.800]   And Samsung, of course, are the fold.
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.040]   And we've seen other companies, CES.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   We saw a number of folding screens.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.840]   And of course, in nine days, Samsung has reportedly going to announce a competitor to the Nokia
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.760]   folding phone, a flip phone with a Bendy screen.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.440]   I thought it was, have you tried the new Nokia?
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:52.840]   I haven't tried the Nokia, but I've definitely seen enough of the Bendy screen phones, especially
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.400]   like the Galaxy Fold.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.000]   I wrote a thing about this, I think last year after the Microsoft stuff debuted.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.960]   Like I think that split screen design is going to be a lot more functional and a lot more
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.840]   sturdy and useful for actual daily use than a folding screen.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.000]   I feel like we'll get there eventually, but folding screens today are so precarious.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.400]   It is insane what these companies are expecting these phones to do.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.880]   And they're all going to have bumps, sprinkles, creases.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.880]   And they're going to break.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.760]   They're going to break so easily.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   It's insane.
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.160]   I don't think we should be going down that road right now.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.080]   Did you guys, Leo or whoever, when you were at CES, did you see the Huawei ones?
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   Yeah, they're beautiful.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.880]   And I know given the environment, I was in.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.960]   You better not buy it because you know it's Chinese spyware.
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:44.600]   Yeah, but by the way, that was like, oh my God, this is really sexy.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:45.840]   I think they got it done right.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:49.200]   Yeah, that's the tri-fold.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.840]   One of the problems with the Fold is it folds up into a phone you don't want.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.600]   It's too small.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.120]   It's dopey.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:58.280]   And then it unfolds.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.080]   And then the creases are a problem.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:05.800]   I'm interested in the duo because the idea of a duo is, so the duo is Android and the
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   Neo is Windows, right?
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.000]   Am I getting those two right?
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   I believe so.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Or vice versa.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Vice versa.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   One of them.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.600]   Anyway, the idea is that you might have controls on one side and something else on the other.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.520]   Do people work that way?
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.840]   Is that sensible?
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:27.000]   Or is it just a bigger screen?
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.560]   It's just a bigger screen.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:32.560]   But Microsoft is saying, well, you divide your functionality up among two screens.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.280]   The way a lot of us work in Windows and on PCs is you may have apps side by side or at
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.800]   least apps like maybe part of one window over here that you can keep an eye on the live
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.400]   stream or something while you work on your email over there.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.240]   And that sort of functionality we have never really had in a mobile device.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.440]   So that's what I'm really interested in, is seeing how what we can do with that sort
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:55.800]   of functionality or have one app take up both screens but have like your email folders
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.080]   and categories on one side and all your messages on the other.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.960]   It opens up the way we work.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.560]   I think in really new ways.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:04.560]   So I'm excited.
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.960]   I'm not sure if they're going to pull this off and I've learned not to get too excited
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.640]   about some Microsoft hardware.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:11.640]   So we'll see.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.960]   Or even 100% Twitter.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:21.200]   If I could have Twitter on some device scrolling like they have the stock ticker on CNBC or
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.200]   whatever.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.160]   I know that we're different kind of users but just something like that or anything that
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.040]   you can think of where it's like I need this as a feed.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:36.400]   So you too would prefer multiple screens to a single folding screen.
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.520]   I mean, I'm looking at this.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:40.040]   This made is very, this is the Huawei Mate X.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.760]   This is very attractive.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.120]   But I worry about the durability of that.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:49.560]   Leo, can you find the most recent leaked videos of the Galaxy Z Flip?
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.480]   This is kind of like the, I think you'll find it for you.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:58.680]   This is kind of like the Nokia, right?
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.120]   Except for the fact that this.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.760]   So what supposedly announced in nine days on the 11th.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   Right.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.760]   Exactly.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.360]   So it folds up into a small square device.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:16.080]   And then if you look at the video, it unfolds, it unfolds really, really tall.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.600]   I know that I'm.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.520]   The idea is it's like a pocket square when it's folded up.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.400]   It's smaller than a phone.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.240]   It opens up into a phone size, not a big screen.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.440]   It opens up to a phone size.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.240]   You like this idea?
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:32.720]   Well no, actually I know we're jumping around here.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:35.200]   But I thought that this is too tall.
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.160]   So one of the things that I like about the concept and we've jumped from laptops to smart
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.960]   phones, so forgive me.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.760]   The thing that I like about the concept.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.040]   No, but this is all of a piece because this is all about computing on the edge.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:54.240]   This is all about smaller, different computing devices that might in the long run replace
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.720]   regular computers.
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:01.400]   So one of the things that I like about the concept of photables on phones is that the
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.800]   real estate in my pocket can be reduced, right?
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:13.040]   So my ideal phone would be a phone that could get back to, you know, there is a foldable
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.200]   razor coming out, but get back to the, you fold it up and it's smaller size like the
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.160]   old razors used to be.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.120]   You unfold it and you can have a fablet.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.840]   I would love a fablet.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.680]   It's just that I don't want to have to carry around a fablet.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.680]   So like that's the sweet spot that I'm hoping at.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:34.640]   I don't know that I'm sold on foldables for phones, but if someone could give me a fablet
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:41.040]   when I want it and a smaller phone in my pocket, that's what I want.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.000]   Here's the leaked Twitter video.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.400]   Is this shaky the way it's supposed to be?
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.520]   It's very shaky.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.200]   So you see that the phone itself is a tiny little phone.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:57.440]   There's only a little screen that's kind of notification screen and then it opens up.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.320]   You know, notice how he opened it with his fingers all over it.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.360]   It just seems to me that we're going to have a big problem about two months with these
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   phones just breaking.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.160]   I don't know if I trust these flexible screens very much.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.680]   I think what's happening by the way is that you look at a folding phone.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.320]   It's like, oh man, that's so cool.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   That's the future.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.320]   That's the future I want.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   I want to see the screen that can do this.
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.000]   This is what I've seen in sci-fi.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.120]   I think realistically in terms of what we can build now, these dual separate screen, you
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.320]   know, idea just makes a lot more sense.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.120]   And we don't talk about hinges as much, you know, because it's not as sexy as a folding
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.600]   screen, but laptop companies, Microsoft, Lenovo, a lot of folks have been building these convertible
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.480]   laptops over the past decade, basically, and really perfecting their hinge tech.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.360]   And I think that is really reliable.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.600]   It's really sturdy and it can take a lot more abuse than a folding screen can.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.600]   So that's my big thing for these dual screen devices.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.800]   Like the Dio and the Neo, just a really intriguing from that respect.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800]   Expensive, right?
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.480]   Well, yeah, we don't know anything yet.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.280]   The razors, 1500 bucks.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.840]   And it even said in the apparently, I didn't see it, because I didn't buy it, but it says
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:14.960]   in the instructions, it's to be expected that you'll have some bumps and ripples on the
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:15.960]   screen.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.360]   It's like, I don't want that.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.960]   They're going to have to sell phone irons for these things.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.800]   Yeah, that's not what I want.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.760]   But if they could perfect the folding screen, I guess I would be okay with it.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:31.960]   So that's one approach, which is to make it a smaller phone that turns into a normal
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.800]   size phone.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.800]   There's Jeffrey Fowler from the Washington Post talking about it.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.480]   Or what, and Samsung's doing both.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.600]   So Samsung is going to have a small phone that unfolds, apparently the Z Flip, and they're
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:52.320]   going to have a Galaxy Fold style eight inch screen that unfolds.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.960]   Which would you prefer?
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.520]   Or would you want both?
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.720]   I think this is all about, I think this is why, to me, the edge is interesting.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.760]   It's choice.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.240]   And the problem is if you can only choose one, that makes it hard, because one doesn't do
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240]   everything.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:15.160]   But if you could afford to have, so like a lot of computing is going to be going through
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:21.400]   my Amazon Echo, or my Google Home Max, or maybe my folding phone, or maybe my folding tablet,
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.040]   or maybe my laptop.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.200]   The computing is going to be environmental ambient, and it's going to be with whatever
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.680]   device is appropriate.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:35.520]   Leo, just for, again, coming back to smartphones, you said choice.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:41.120]   We've only had one choice for 10 years now, which is a slab of glass out of 2001, a space
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.400]   odyssey, right?
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.000]   So I don't care.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.960]   What if, again, cars and trucks and things, you have a choice.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:55.520]   I would love 10 years from now for there to be three to five different form factors for
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.800]   devices.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.160]   And it's not even for use cases, it's also for personal preference and taste and things
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   like that.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.520]   That's more interesting to me than everybody has a thing that looks exactly the same.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.880]   So even though I get pushback on this, no one's buying those foldable phones or whatever,
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.040]   I'm like, but I like the fact that people are trying to find something else.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.160]   But isn't that what we learned from Apple's results and Facebook's results?
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.360]   We're in a mass, mass, mass, mass market where everybody's just using iPhones and AirPod
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.600]   pros and Facebook.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.400]   And I would love to see a thousand flowers bloom.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.400]   For sure.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400]   For sure.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.840]   Everybody has two news still.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840]   Is that it?
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.040]   It's just not perfect.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.400]   Just like 3D and TV, I think people aren't ready for it.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.080]   It's going to be imperfect.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:48.040]   And I think it's going to cast a stain on the whole foldables for years to come because
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.680]   some people got sick from 3D.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.520]   It's the same thing with these foldables.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.200]   Someone says, "Oh, I bought one of those.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.400]   Cost me more money than any other phone."
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.400]   And then it broke after eight months because the screen had a crease in it.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.880]   Well, and the TV thing is interesting because they just died.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:10.880]   The 3D trend died because the TV makers had 4K and HDR ended up being the better upsell.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.920]   A few people rather than where these ugly glasses and maybe you'll get 3D that looks
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.120]   as good as the theater, it never did.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.840]   And that was the big problem.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:25.680]   Sci-Fi ruins everything by having people's expectations set so high that when it finally
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.200]   comes, it's like, "Oh, this is not my flying car."
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.200]   Damn you.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:39.920]   Samsung spent years and millions, maybe billions of dollars developing flexible screens.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.560]   They had it to themselves, but apparently it leaked out and all of a sudden a bunch of
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.720]   other companies had the technology.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.200]   Is that what happened?
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.120]   Because LG also, they're the main OLED company too.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:59.720]   So the LG Day-splay side of things is always showing off these new innovations.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:04.480]   Like in CES this year, they had the TV that was rolling down from the ceiling, which is
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.640]   not something they're going to be selling anytime soon, but next year it could be in
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.640]   a TV.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.800]   So they had the TV rolling up from the floor.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:12.800]   And they never sold it.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:17.920]   And now they have it rolling big improvement down from the ceiling.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920]   From the ceiling.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.880]   Which honestly is a much more useful way of installing that stuff, but yeah, the box,
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.800]   the folding up TV, they didn't actually get to sell last year, so that'll sell this year.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.640]   They're not selling the dropdown one.
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.640]   That's just like a prototype right now.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.640]   Really expensive too.
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.640]   It's so expensive.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.640]   But it's ridiculous.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:38.160]   I think a lot of companies have been pursuing foldable, rollable tech and display.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:45.880]   It's like a completely different thinking, which is I don't have a TV.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.360]   There's look at my living room.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   There's no TV.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.680]   I'm not a TV watcher.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.880]   And then as soon as you leave it rolls up and you watch a TV.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   That's totally...
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:07:00.200]   You're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to pretend you don't watch TV.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.200]   Projectors are so much easier.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   Just get the projector.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   Just come on.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.200]   Hide the projector.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.840]   I am proud that I watch a lot of TV.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.840]   Apple...
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.960]   I didn't mention this in the Apple results, but Apple is talking about Apple TV Plus.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.720]   And I think it was Luca Maestry.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:19.680]   Their CFO said, "Yeah, the results from Apple TV Plus are immaterial."
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.520]   In other words, we didn't...
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520]   It doesn't.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:24.520]   We didn't.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.760]   It'll be material if they buy James Bond, I think.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:28.760]   Is there...
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.080]   Rumor is that they might be buying MGM.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080]   I can't...
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   Wow.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.080]   I don't think Apple will buy MGM.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.680]   We won't know until next year basically what all this means.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.680]   Did you...
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.760]   I mean, Devindra does a wonderful podcast/film.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.760]   Thank you.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.760]   And a great blog.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.720]   And I presume you've talked about the Apple TV Plus shows.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.720]   Oh, we have.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.800]   Do they have any hits?
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.320]   I mean, people really like the Morning Show.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.640]   I didn't, to me, it felt like an Aaron Sorkin' light, like an imitation of an Aaron...
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.480]   They couldn't get Aaron's, so that's what they did.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.480]   They couldn't.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.920]   I really like Dickinson.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.560]   The Emily, like really interesting, vibrant Emily Dickinson.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.800]   I have to watch that.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800]   Biopic show.
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.200]   It's a lot of fun because it's like the kids talk like kids today.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:15.120]   There's a lot of modern music in it, but it's also set in the social norms of her day.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.600]   So that's all kind of fascinating.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.640]   I feel like they missed a little bit.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.400]   They didn't get what they needed, which was a Game of Thrones or a Stranger Things.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.040]   They didn't get the breakout.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.680]   They tried basically to copy every sort of...
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.960]   With like popular TV style.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.160]   So the Morning Show is their Aaron Sorkin.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.160]   The Servant.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.160]   The Servant.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.600]   The Servant is like a thriller.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   I actually really like Servant because it's pretty fun.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.920]   I liked it to the last episode and I was kind of pissed off.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   I need more.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.920]   I need more.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.160]   But they have a Game of Thrones kind of rip off show.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.560]   They have kids shows.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.120]   They have Oprah involved.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.520]   They're really like trying to hit the popular trends.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   It's kind of frustrating at EQ though, that they put a billion dollars into this.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:03.240]   And then Netflix kind of comes up with this crappy show called The Witcher.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.120]   And everybody's talking about it.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.600]   Oh, wow.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.560]   I bet you Apple passed on The Witcher.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.560]   I don't know.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.680]   No, that's one of those things where like I'm sure Netflix, they know first of all that
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:19.160]   Henry Cavill is a much more bankable star than you know, the Game of Thrones guy.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160]   He's Superman.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.360]   He's Superman and also Witcher's a popular series and like it is...
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.800]   That's a deeper discussion I'd say.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.600]   But I don't think Apple, a billion dollars first of all, weird to say is not that much
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600]   money compared to what Netflix spends.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600]   Seventeen.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.560]   What Disney spent on Disney Plus.
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:41.480]   Apple will spend 17 billion dollars this year on content.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480]   One billion's nothing.
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480]   You're punters.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.480]   You're amateurs.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.680]   So, you know, they're getting started.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.200]   Henry Cavill alone got three of those 17 billion dollars.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.720]   No, I don't think so.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.720]   Him and his pecs.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.120]   People love that show.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.560]   I mean, it's okay.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.720]   No, I think...
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.560]   Well, people love it because it's sort of like it has taken over the conversation.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.480]   And that is very specific thing.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.000]   That's something HBO shows can do.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   Game of Thrones did that.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.640]   Watchmen, I think did that to a degree.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.640]   Although not everybody did that.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   I liked to watch.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.640]   Watchmen is a perfect show, but it's amazing.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.640]   Boy, I liked Watchmen.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640]   I actually...
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.640]   So...
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   You know, I actually...
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.960]   Because I hadn't read the comic originally and I hadn't seen the movie.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.760]   I went out and got the comic and I really spent time with it.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.680]   A lot of people I respect, people I thought were too smart to read comic books, said it's
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.760]   like one of the best novels of all time.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.560]   It's great, yeah.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.800]   It's like the Ulysses of comics.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.800]   Comic books.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.280]   Yeah, well, maybe.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   Keep in mind for Apple subscriptions, a lot of them were given away for free with new iPhones.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280]   Almost all of them.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   It's going to be at least...
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.400]   I'm excited to see how, if it's actually catching on when people get a bill and they said, "Hey,
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.280]   do you want to pay this for another year?"
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.000]   And choose to opt into that.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.680]   Do you think that there's anything to be read into the fact that they could literally
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.200]   report nothing?
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.400]   You know that if they could say anything.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.000]   They would say something at all.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   They won a Golden Globe.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.920]   Actually, the reviewers seem to think Little America is the actual...
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.760]   It's not going to be a breakout hit, but...
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   It's really good.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.760]   It's really good.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.480]   It's the success of the bunch.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.200]   I haven't watched that yet either.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.280]   This is the one that was created by...
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.280]   The big sick folks.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.280]   Yeah, the big sick folks.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.280]   You're male-noun-jian, you know.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.280]   That's sick.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   That's Emily Gordon.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.440]   It's about immigration, so it's timely.
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440]   Top of it.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.680]   Immigrants in America, that is something near and dear to my heart.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680]   It's such a beautiful show.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:41.680]   I wish it were longer.
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.680]   I think that's my only complaint about these things because they're telling epic stories
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.440]   in like half an hour and I need more.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.480]   They're going to make a podcast too.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.280]   So I think that might be the surprise hit of the group.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.760]   Let's take a little break.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.760]   Break panel here.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.360]   Davidre Hardowar from Engadget.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.760]   I'm sorry, Brian, did I cut you off?
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.760]   It wasn't me.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.000]   I was going to say it'd be nice if Apple TV did the thing that they did with Picard and
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.600]   put like each of the shows for free every once in a while and rotate that.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.960]   There were some of them are free on iTunes.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.960]   You can watch the first episode.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.960]   I'm not an Apple person, so like...
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   Yeah, yeah, first episode.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   For iTunes.
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.080]   I needed to be on YouTube for someone outside of their target.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.800]   That was a good move with Picard, right?
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:22.600]   Give away the first one on YouTube.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:27.440]   And then I think if you will get Pluto TV, does Pluto have the whole thing?
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:28.600]   Maybe just the first episode.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.600]   I'm not a fool.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600]   I'm not a fool.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.600]   I'm not a fool.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.600]   Fylo.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.600]   Fylo.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.600]   Not Pluto.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.120]   I could fuse Fubo, Fylo, and Pluto.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.600]   I wonder why?
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.600]   Fubar.
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.600]   Fubar.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600]   Are you sure?
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.200]   Davidre Hardowar is your senior editor of Engadget Wesley Faulkner, brand new developer
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.280]   relations guy at MongoDB.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:52.200]   Always a pleasure to see you, Wesley.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.680]   I hope we go to South by this year.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.680]   I'd like to get together, have another bar because you see it.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.680]   Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.680]   I'd love to see you.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:08.800]   And from the Tech meme ride home, Brian McCullough, Internet historian, a daily tech news show.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.160]   Ooh, that's crazy talk, Brian.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.920]   Listen, every time you say that, I have not gone to school for history.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:16.920]   I am not a PhD.
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.920]   That's a mat.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.320]   Well, no one's a PhD in Internet history.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.320]   Right.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:26.280]   I'm just the guy that has been in the Internet for 20 years and I wrote about stuff I remember.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.880]   I'm a professional podcaster now.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:30.880]   You keep saying that.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.680]   You think that there's more status being a professional podcast than an amateur.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.080]   No, no, but you know, the book did well.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.880]   We turned back, advanced, all that stuff.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.280]   I make my living.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.480]   I pay my podcast.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   Podcasting.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480]   That's right.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.480]   And he's proud of it.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:51.680]   You and me both, buddy.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.000]   Our show today brought to you by Wasabi.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.840]   I was just talking to Chris Mark court, our photo guy about his backup strategy.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840]   He surprised me.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.760]   He uses Wasabi as his cloud storage.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.200]   You know, you might be surprised by the people who use Wasabi.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.160]   Wasabi is hot cloud storage.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:15.840]   Maybe you've not heard of the name, but you might want to think about Wasabi for yourself
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:23.320]   because it is faster, better, less expensive, more reliable than the big guys.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.320]   It blows away Google and Microsoft wasabi.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.320]   I'll give you an example.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.840]   Wasabi uses the Amazon S3 API, but never charges for API requests.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.080]   They don't even charge for egress wasabi because they came up with a revolutionary process
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:44.520]   that lays data on disks sequentially as opposed to in blocks is 80% cheaper than S3 and six
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.800]   times faster.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.440]   And man talk about security.
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.800]   There's my buddy David friend.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.440]   Hey, David, we love David friend.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:57.120]   He created Wasabi with his partner, Jeff Flowers.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.760]   You get 11 nines of durability, 11 nines.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.680]   I would, I would willing to bet that it's more secure than your on premises storage.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:12.360]   If you're like many of us looking at cloud for your business, you got to look at Wasabi.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.960]   You can make some storage immutable.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.720]   That means it cannot be changed by ransomware.
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.240]   That's huge these days.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.320]   Data set of redundancy means your data is always safe.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.520]   They even do active integrity checking on every single file to make sure you lose not
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.560]   one bit.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.520]   That's how you get 11 nines of durability.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:37.000]   HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.160]   Talk about savings.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160]   Just take a look.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.080]   Go to Wasabi.com, W-A-S-A-B-I.com.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:48.760]   I think if you're presenting to the boss a cloud storage strategy, yeah, I know you're
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.080]   going to do Azure and you're going to do Google Cloud and you're going to do AWS, but
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.680]   I really think you ought to look at Wasabi.
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:56.360]   Add a fourth name to that.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360]   Wasabi.
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.120]   In fact, if you want to try it for yourself, we've got an unlimited month.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.680]   Just bang on it.

[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.840]   Join the movement.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.280]   Migrate your data to the cloud, but do it with confidence with Wasabi.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.560]   W-A-S-A-B-I.com.

[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.520]   Everybody needs storage.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.880]   Everybody needs Wasabi.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.880]   Wasabi.com.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   Offer code.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.880]   TWIT.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:35.640]   Thank you, Wasabi, for supporting the show.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:39.880]   Good old Agit Pie.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   Good old Agit Pie.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.280]   F-C-C's been busy.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.640]   They finally admitted one year after motherboard and the New York Times revealed that certain
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:55.120]   carriers, certain mobile phone companies were selling your data to people like bounty
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.960]   hunters.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:03.800]   One year, the F-C-C finally says, "Oh, you know what?
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.800]   They're selling your data."
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.080]   Agit Pie says, "We've concluded."
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:12.640]   I got to read you the quote because it's hysterical.
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:19.280]   We concluded that one or more carriers, one or more, we can not say how many, broke the
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.960]   law selling location data.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:29.840]   He wrote a letter to Frank Polona's member of the house, "I wish to inform you," says
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.840]   Agit Pie.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.520]   The F-C-C's enforcement bureau has completed its extensive investigation and has concluded
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:42.960]   that one or more wireless carriers apparently violated federal law.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.960]   Apparently.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.680]   We'll see.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.360]   In the coming days, Pie writes, "I intend to circulate to my fellow commissioners for
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.680]   their consideration."
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:56.600]   One or more notices of apparent liability for forfeiture and connection with the apparent
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600]   violations.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.440]   That's three of parents in one letter.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:09.680]   That's good, as Vice Motherboard, which discovered this a year ago, points out, "Pies been foot
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.760]   dragging and stonewalling through much of the last year."
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.840]   Other commissioners like Democrat Jessica Rosenwarsall, who was often in opposition
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:24.880]   to the Republican chairman, Agit Pie, said that for more than a year, the F-C-C was silent.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.760]   This is an F-C-C commissioner speaking.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.040]   The news reports alerted us that for just a few hundred dollars shady middlemen could
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:35.360]   sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.040]   It's chilling to consider what the black market could do with this data.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.840]   It puts the safety and privacy of every American with a wireless phone at risk.
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:47.480]   Commissioner Jeffrey Starks wrote an editorial for the New York Times criticizing lack of
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.480]   follow-through.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.440]   "I'm glad," he wrote, "we may finally act on these egregious allegations.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.520]   My question is what took so long."
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.280]   Of course, this doesn't say they're going to enforce it.
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.560]   It just says, "we're looking into it," and it doesn't say what the fines will be.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.720]   It says, "we're looking into it."
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.720]   It's apparently...
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.480]   Yeah, "finally acted in quotes."
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.920]   Yeah, quote.
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.120]   And what'll happen?
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.800]   They'll do a slap on the wrist.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:16.880]   These companies, which make tons of money on this stuff, will pay a small pittance for
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.200]   the right to keep on doing it effectively, or to have done it for the past year.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.440]   Anyway, I guess we should mention they're going to do something about it, maybe.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.440]   Apparently.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.440]   Apparently.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.440]   That's fine.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.440]   Go ahead, D. Go ahead.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:32.440]   Go ahead.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.720]   You Wesley, and then we'll give it a...
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:41.280]   In terms of telecoms and fines, there might be a fine, but there's very little enforcement
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.520]   to make sure those fines are paid.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.080]   So even if they were told, "Hey, you need to pay X amount of dollars," they could say,
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:53.040]   "Sure," and then never pay the fine, and it never gets enforced that they're not going
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   to pay it.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.040]   I'm sorry if I'm skeptical.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.040]   I apologize.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:03.120]   I think, yeah, the FCC has historically never been one to press these companies too hard.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.680]   And I don't think Agiipai is also the guy to do it.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:10.000]   Like I'm really interested to see which consulting firm or lobby group he joins.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.360]   What's a revolving door?
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.360]   He was a little...
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.360]   He was a Verizon.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.360]   He was a Verizon lobby, right?
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   It's always been a revolving door for this job.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.600]   It's too bad.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.480]   Into and out of private, the private sector.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:31.000]   Facebook this week put out a, as Gizmodo called it, confusing off Facebook activity privacy
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   tool.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.120]   They also says it doesn't do poop.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:39.480]   Doesn't clear it's nothing.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.960]   Have any of you played with the activity tool?
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.880]   I mean, the one thing it does do, I am not a Facebook user, so I can't look at it.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:46.880]   But what per...
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.560]   Sorry, I did too because I kind of had to walk it back.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.560]   Like the day it came out, I talked about it.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.560]   I used it.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:54.560]   I talked about it.
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.840]   I was like, "Oh, wow, this is actually...
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.840]   This is refreshing.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:05.280]   I can see all these things and I can, case by case, say not you, not you, not you."
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.280]   And I was like, "Wow.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.480]   All right.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.760]   This is actually...
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.720]   It's late because remember this was supposed to happen a long time ago and what...
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:18.040]   But it was of all the things where it's like, "Well, we're giving you granular control
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.040]   over how your data..."
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.760]   I was like, "Wow, it's very intuitive."
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:24.600]   And then I learned subsequently that it's basically bump-kissing.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.920]   I think it doesn't do anything.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.840]   So I guess the value is you see what the connections are.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.960]   There's lots of them, I take it.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:38.600]   Well, but the point is, is that all it does is sever the connection.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.960]   So that the third parties have the data on you.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.520]   Book has the data on you.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.720]   And when you say, "I don't want you to share this anymore, it just sever the connection,"
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.200]   but it's not deleting.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.200]   Either side.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.200]   Either side.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   Right.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.200]   But everybody still has the data.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.200]   So then it's...
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:22:00.600]   Does it stop it from doing it and going forward or will as inevitably happens?
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:04.240]   With Twitter, Facebook, and these others, I would typically every year or so go, "Oh,
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.640]   yeah, I should probably delete my application connections and all that.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.680]   Go through them, Google."
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.680]   Is it like that?
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.400]   Then you'll start making more of them.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   We'll see that.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.240]   Actually, I haven't followed up on that.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.240]   So I don't know.
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.680]   But the point being that in theory, the way that I remember using it is that...
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.040]   So then if I go back to another website and make the connection again, that...
[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.040]   It starts up.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.040]   Right.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.040]   So it maybe puts the onus on me to always go in.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.920]   So then if you think about it that way, it's useless because then it's requiring me to go
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.920]   in.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.960]   Now, they're going to sell it as, "Well, we're giving you this control, but my control is
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.560]   that every time I have to think about, "Okay, it's the first of the month.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.960]   I got to go into my Facebook and see if I can sever."
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.760]   And by the way, all I'm doing is severing for a certain amount of time, but it's not
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   deleting any.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:04.120]   Shashana Woodinsky is writing it, 'Gizmodo' and says it doesn't do poop.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:11.200]   It's... "Zucks use of the phrases, control your off Facebook activity and clear this information
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:12.640]   from your cat is misleading.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.880]   You're not really controlling or clearing much of anything.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:19.680]   You're just telling Facebook to put the data it has on you in two separate buckets that
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.840]   are otherwise mixed together.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.880]   So you're clearing the connection Facebook made between its data and the data it gets
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.120]   from third parties, but the data...
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:33.560]   So the data is still stored at Facebook.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.360]   They didn't delete anything.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.400]   I don't even know if this is compliant with GDPR or the new California Privacy Act, because
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.360]   in both cases, you're supposed to be able to find out what data company keeps on you
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.440]   and you're supposed to be able to delete it, having them delete it, right?
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:52.880]   Well, that's what I'm going to say is that, again, I walked it back, but I was very impressed
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:56.480]   with the transparency now, and I'm going to also walk back the fact that you had to go
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:00.080]   through this layer and this layer and this layer of settings and settings to find it.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:05.000]   So I got there, I was like, "Wow, this was really easy to figure out.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:12.400]   This site that I remember visiting once six months ago, there's the amount of connections
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.400]   they have on me."
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.760]   And I was like, "Alright, stop."
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.800]   So it's not useless.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.240]   If you're willing to be very vigilant, I guess.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.440]   This is why I'm not on Facebook.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.560]   I don't feel like Facebook is completely transparent about what they're up to, what they're doing
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.560]   and what they're giving you.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.560]   Anybody disagree?
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.560]   Nothing is right.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.560]   Nothing is right.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.040]   Because you are on Facebook, you just don't have a profile.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.400]   That's the real problem, isn't it?
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.600]   And now I can't see it.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.280]   I can't log into my Facebook account.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.280]   So now I've got a, what do they call them, a shadow dossier, but I have no idea what's
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.920]   in it because I don't have a Facebook account.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.080]   Hey, Leo, we have things like this.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:00.840]   Can you delete, are you able to say, "I want you to erase everything," when you cancel
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:01.840]   the account?
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.840]   Yes.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.600]   It's a theory that's what's happened, but I don't have absolute confidence that Facebook
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.120]   no longer knows who I am.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.840]   But they're telling you that that's what happens.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.920]   I believe that's the case.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.640]   I believe that's the case.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.800]   There's nobody holding them accountable, but I feel like Facebook tends to throw as bread.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.200]   They throw breadcrumbs at things like this and they hope it's enough to satisfy us.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:28.040]   And to me, it's like, then they also announced that this summer there was going to be their
[01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.840]   governing board or the- Oh, yeah, the Facebook oversight board.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.400]   The oversight, yeah, they're going to start hearing cases about content issues.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.720]   And we don't know what that means because they're entirely in charge of it.
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:43.640]   And yeah, it's one of those things where it sounds like Facebook is trying to do the
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.240]   right thing, but they don't ever want to let anyone else kind of come in to really check
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.400]   out what's going on.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.160]   We need some independent oversight at some point.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:26:02.560]   So Facebook's independent content oversight board, according to CNBC, leaves the company
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.560]   firmly in control.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:13.480]   So the board will have the ability to review content moderation cases as long as they don't
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:20.720]   involve content posted on Facebook's marketplace fund raisers, Facebook dating, WhatsApp, messenger,
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:23.840]   Instagram direct or Oculus services.
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:29.960]   And Facebook said the board's decisions will not set precedent.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.160]   So maybe Facebook can pick the judges and maybe get-
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.160]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.040]   No, they picked the first round and then those judges picked the rest.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.600]   I don't even know who's on the board at this point.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.640]   I don't know if they've picked them yet.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.880]   They're going to do it for six years.
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.680]   It will review the annual reports prepared by the trust to determine the operational and
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.880]   procedural effectiveness of the board.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.960]   Of course, after six years, they could say, "It didn't work.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.280]   I bet they will."
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.920]   Facebook will implement board decisions to allow or remove the content properly brought
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:03.240]   to it for review within seven days of the release of the board's decision on how to action
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.240]   the content.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.240]   You know what?
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.640]   This is to me a way to pass the buck.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.840]   So we don't have to decide.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:18.240]   And obviously this board won't have the bandwidth to deal with all of the myriad content problems
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.240]   on Facebook.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:25.440]   Well, it's also you set up this regime in place to say that you have a regime in place.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:30.200]   But then number one, it's probably set up to not be functional for things that actually
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.200]   matter.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.880]   And then number two, if some outlier happens, you can always say that it's not, well, this
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.840]   isn't a part of the regime, right?
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.840]   So it's not applicable.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.200]   Facebook decides which case is the oversight board would be used.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.200]   Exactly.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.200]   Exactly.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.200]   So they could just say, "Well, this one's not for you."
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   Well, right.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.200]   Like, this is not judiciable or whatever.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.200]   Right.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:52.200]   I don't know.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:28:01.480]   It reminds me of when I was in middle school and we had a Star Trek RPG on Prodigy and
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.800]   we came up.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.280]   You were scrolling down and I'm looking at the bylaws.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:10.240]   And like we wrote that sort of thing up where it's like, "Well, you can't do this against
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.400]   someone else on your ship and you can't."
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.920]   And like, that's literally what they're doing.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.920]   It's just pretend RPGs.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:18.600]   It's like biowaws.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.680]   They're not even doing that, I wish.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.120]   What they're doing is they making a body and saying, "You will make the decisions, but
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:27.600]   you won't have to spell out what the laws are."
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:32.640]   It's like saying, "We want you to be ethical, but not defying what ethics is."
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.640]   Because it's kind of like creating a supreme core.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:37.640]   Philosophy.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.320]   And then instead of letting the court decide what cases to take, you tell them what cases
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.000]   to take.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.280]   And also there's a trolley car problem.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:52.000]   If you could choose to hit the people or hit the one, whoever, and either choice is actually
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.640]   an ethical choice.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.800]   But with you don't define what your ethics are, you can't predict how things will be
[01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:01.000]   treated on a case going forward.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000]   Just flip them.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.560]   Then treating it from a case by case basis means that they never have to write down,
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:09.760]   they never have to define what is truly right and what is truly wrong, what is ethical,
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.760]   what is not ethical.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.760]   Or there's another term for it which is banana republic.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:18.920]   Where you're not talking about the place I could get my jeans.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.280]   You're talking about the countries in South America that are secretly run by the Dole
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.120]   Pineapple Company.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.680]   Or that the judges are your best friends.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.520]   They did announce the first member of the board.
[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:36.400]   It'll be Thomas Hughes, former executive director of a human rights organization called
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.400]   Article 19.
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.000]   He'll be the director.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.680]   Facebook says it plans to announce board members and trustees in the coming months.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.000]   That would be a horrible job.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.240]   But I'll do it if you really need me, Mark.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.240]   I'm here.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:55.160]   I think I saw that a bunch of people that they were proposing for the board were like,
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.160]   yeah, not me.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.160]   No, he's right.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.160]   That's exactly right.
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:04.800]   I think we already have heard from some people.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.200]   Let's see.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.360]   How about a vast?
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.360]   How about that?
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.320]   A vast which for years people preferred as an antivirus because they didn't have to pay
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.320]   any money.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:17.240]   Turns out they were doing more than paying money.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:27.440]   A vast bought a marketing company that they sent all the information that they collected.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:33.480]   And they collected a lot from people using a vast to jump shot which then sold it to marketers,
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.000]   brands and so forth.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.280]   So much heat now that a vast is actually shutting down jump shot.
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:47.240]   We probably should have been queued off by the name of vast, which is a pirate.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   It's like a vast.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.240]   It's a pirate.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.240]   Come on.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.240]   A vast mermaidies.
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:57.240]   I want to know where you've been and what you're doing.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:02.440]   They're going to terminate it and wind it down.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:06.200]   By the way, jump shot described itself in marketing materials as the only company that
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:12.240]   unlocks walled garden data to provide marketers with unparalleled visibility and political
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:17.360]   insights and more comprehensive understanding of the online customer journey that delivers
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.560]   a highly competitive advantage.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.560]   Mmm.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:21.560]   Wink, wink, nudge.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:28.600]   No, the key quote there was the one where they said that it was like almost like an Apache
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:34.040]   log for the entire internet for every device in the panel.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:40.000]   Every site you go to, your geographic locations and on and on and on.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.600]   And again, you guys know this better than me.
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.640]   It's because it's an antivirus thing.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.480]   So it has access to way deeper layers of your computer than a lot of apps.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.000]   They had a browser plug in, but that was the least of it.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.600]   It wasn't just watching your browsing.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.600]   It was.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:57.040]   They also, they got in trouble for the browser plug and because that was also taking in
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.040]   too much data.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.040]   Right.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:05.360]   By the way, lessons from this, don't trust free software that is claiming to do, you
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.440]   know, a ton of great stuff.
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.720]   And also maybe I'm going to say it.
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.160]   I don't, I don't think many people need antivirus software these days.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.080]   No, I tell people that all the time.
[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:15.080]   The last thing you want.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:16.640]   Hey, let me ask you about this.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.640]   I have never heard of this.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.960]   Somebody was talking in the chat room about me.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:27.880]   We, me we.com, a Facebook alternative that says no ads, no spyware, no BS.
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:31.400]   Has anybody ever heard of this?
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:38.080]   Because the reason I ask is, well, if they don't have ads or spyware and it's free,
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.320]   who's paying for this?
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:45.600]   Shouldn't this always be the question when you see something that's free?
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.600]   Well, okay.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.160]   So you're the product.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.160]   Why?
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.160]   Why?
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:56.920]   How can they give this away and not have any ads?
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.320]   Free forever, it says free forever.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.440]   No ads, no spyware free forever.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:05.080]   Is this just some billionaire that's given it away?
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.800]   Because that's the only way I could see this would work.
[01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:12.600]   Or like a Craigslist type thing where it's just like, hey, somebody running it basically
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.240]   without the goal of making a ton of profit.
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:19.200]   I haven't heard anything about this company, but it is this to me seems like if you're
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.080]   going to do a social network like this, right?
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:25.360]   Like maybe you'd expect people to pay something a little like the way WhatsApp we had like
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.360]   a nominal fee.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.360]   It's just an extensive year.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.360]   I mean, I was trying to say running this.
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.360]   Well, maybe, maybe there is.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.360]   I don't know.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.880]   It's been around for a few years.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.600]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.040]   I'm not blasting them.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.360]   I think it would be great to have a Facebook alternative.
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.320]   No, you, because I heard that when I came in this afternoon and it was just someone randomly
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:51.960]   on the, they were saying they were going to leave that Facebook for that or whatever.
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:56.320]   Look, I mean, number one, it's like the whole Google thing.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.080]   Like, well, what if you just did a search engine that only had two ads or something like that?
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:05.760]   Like in theory, you could always do a social network that didn't sell your data or whatever
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:07.720]   and just ran banner ads or everything.
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:13.120]   You could probably still make a billion dollars a year if you could get traction, but I've
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.200]   never heard of it.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.880]   So I don't know.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.440]   That's often a question that comes up is does tracking make advertising more effective
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:22.440]   at all anyway?
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:25.840]   I mean, there's so much debate about that right now.
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.240]   I understand why advertisers think it does.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.840]   No, but that's the, this is, we could do an hour on this.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.640]   Like, because there's been a lot of smart pieces about this recently about even, you
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:42.200]   know, we've said for years that Google is the greatest advertising engine ever created
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.440]   because they're at the point of intention.
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:49.640]   If you search for a hotel in Marietta, Georgia, it's likely that you're going to want to go
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.600]   to Marietta, Georgia in the near future.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:58.400]   And so like, but at the same time, like, there's been all these studies that say that like,
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:04.720]   you know, eBay and even all of the, in fact, like the last decade of unicorns and stuff
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:10.440]   like that, they throw these, they throw their money at these targeted ads, targeted.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:15.200]   And, and, and the idea is is, well, when those have been searches anyway, when those have
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:23.640]   been like, so that if, if it's almost like the banner ad, which used to be like this shotgun
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:30.920]   approach, like, or even there's that famous quote, like, I don't know, I spend all this
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.920]   money on advertising and half of it is wasted.
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.680]   I just don't know what, what half.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680]   Right.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.760]   A lot of people are now thinking that maybe 30% is wasted.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.040]   We just don't know what 30%.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.920]   So like, that's the, that's the progress we've made.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:51.800]   I worry because ad tech kind of ruined the internet.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.560]   And I, I worry that if advertisers are demanding this, I worry it's going to ruin podcasting.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:36:03.560]   It's the next frontier in podcasting is figuring out how to track our audience.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:08.360]   And already, I mentioned this before, but already Spotify has announced, yeah, we're
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:11.880]   going to have, we're going to, we're going to have all sorts of metrics about our, our
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:12.880]   listeners.
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.600]   So come, come by ads on the Spotify podcast.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:21.040]   Yeah, but pod, Spotify can do that because they own an app that, they, they, they, they
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:27.760]   use Spotify and then Spotify spies on you and they sell that information, the advertiser.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:31.440]   And theoretically they're using an RSS feed, but they're kind of not like, that's a whole
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.800]   other inside baseball podcasting thing.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.320]   But, um, I don't know, like, wonder, I mean, are you not getting pressure on you from advertisers
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:40.320]   to?
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.800]   Yeah, you'd like to know more about your tech meme ride home audience.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.440]   There is, there, there is the ability to put like, um, what's the term?
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.720]   I can't think of it right now.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:50.720]   Right.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:51.720]   Right.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.720]   Exactly.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:59.400]   Um, uh, again, I can't remember the term, but, um, however, in theory, like that's still,
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:04.440]   there's several degrees removed as opposed to Spotify where Spotify, like when I look
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:10.280]   on my stats at Spotify, not only can I see age, the demo, everything, I can see, I
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.560]   see the top five artists of the people that listen to my podcast.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560]   Right.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:21.320]   So that's a completely different thing than say overcast or even, um, Apple podcasts or
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.400]   Google podcasts or anything is like, like, where it's just basically an RSS feed and
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:32.240]   unless I put a pixel thing on there, like all I know is this episode got downloaded and
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:36.040]   maybe from this IP address so that you can figure out it's in this geographic region and
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.040]   that sort of thing.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:46.720]   Uh, Elon Musk dancing at the announcement of the model Y thumbs up, thumbs down.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.720]   Have you seen it?
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   No.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:49.720]   Yes.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:53.520]   It's awkward as awkward as his, uh, music that he released.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.520]   His music is very awkward.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.720]   Um, so it's on brand.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:02.920]   Here is Elon Musk dancing.
[01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:09.400]   Uh, at the, uh, actually this is the model three delivery ceremony, but I thought it
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:14.280]   was the model Y ceremony on the other hand.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:17.640]   Let's check it out.
[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.000]   I just like, I enjoy it.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.520]   If you haven't seen the video, this is something else.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.920]   I don't know what it is.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:26.920]   I read a good article.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920]   Poor woman next to him is like, I don't know how to.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.920]   She's like, uh, sir, uh, please stop.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.920]   Please stop.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.480]   It's not, this is an RV.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.360]   He doesn't, he won't stop.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.360]   In fact, at some point he takes off his jacket and doubles down, uh, on it.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:50.800]   Um, any, any way, I don't, I, uh, as a former Tesla owner, I like Elon Musk.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:53.920]   He's, he seems like, oh, now he's really, wait a minute.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.000]   Now he's, oh my God, he's getting, he's given the woman his microphone.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.200]   He's taking off his jacket.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.200]   He's throwing it in.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.760]   Oh God.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:06.920]   This is, this is, I once danced with Bill Gates.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.800]   It was better than this, better than this.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.640]   Are you aware of the fact that theoretically he released a song on SoundCloud early Friday
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   morning?
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:19.640]   Do you want to hear it?
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:20.640]   Okay.
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:21.640]   All right.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.320]   Not only am I aware of it, I, I have, I have the song.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:28.120]   Elon Musk says the register shows the world.
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:31.280]   He's truly awful at something.
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:39.160]   Uh, he's followed up his feel good hit of 2019 RIP, Harenbe, with don't doubt your vibe.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.520]   You ready everybody?
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.800]   Don't doubt your vibe.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:54.000]   Elon, uh, wrote the lyrics and performed the vocals.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.920]   Grimes left him in the studio for way too long and he got bored.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:00.920]   Apparently Grimes is pregnant.
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.560]   Is that with Elon's baby?
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560]   Supposedly.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.560]   Oh my God.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.800]   So I was about to praise.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:13.360]   I came not to bury Elon, but to praise him.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:19.080]   Because I like a very, one of the only's who's very excited about Starlink.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.000]   We were talking about, there he is making the song.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000]   He's doing the dance.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000]   It's the same dance.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:31.920]   I think Starlink is the greatest thing ever because we were talking about computing at
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.920]   the edge.
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:33.920]   What do you need?
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.640]   If you're going to compute the edge, you need internet everywhere, every single place
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:37.640]   you go.
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.360]   That's going to ruin life for a lot of astronomers.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.760]   Amateur astronomers, big freaking deal.
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.760]   Sorry, dudes.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.440]   Deal with it.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.560]   Buy a telescope in space.
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.920]   From from Elon Musk in a couple of years.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.560]   Elon will have that too.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:41:00.200]   This is a great piece from Jeffrey Paul, who is a hacker and security researcher in Berlin,
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.960]   talking about, nice transition by the way.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.480]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.280]   He's talking about what Starlink is going to do.
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:10.920]   Imagine adding internet access to the rest of the other half of the world.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.960]   Only half the world has internet now.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:16.440]   Imagine putting those other 3 billion people online.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:21.640]   But the effect of that will be.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.440]   That's what to me is fascinating.
[01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.600]   We're going to start seeing Starlink this year.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.120]   We're going to start and we'll get better every year as he launches more and more and
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.480]   more up to 12,000 lower.
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:37.080]   More space junk.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.440]   Who wants to argue against?
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.880]   Elon, dance music, Starlink.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:46.880]   There's a smart guy.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:47.880]   He's an interesting guy.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:53.000]   I feel like I've lost a lot of respect for him after the whole "Diver" story.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.400]   Yeah, that wasn't cool.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:00.480]   He's an interesting figure, but he has so unchecked in his madness and nobody can tell
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.720]   him no anymore.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.080]   So yeah, let him make his bad techno music and let him dance.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.240]   Elon, maybe you should doubt your vibe.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:08.240]   Maybe you should.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240]   Maybe you should.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:11.080]   Well, also he has a...
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.480]   Go ahead, Wesley.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:13.480]   And then...
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.480]   Go ahead, Wesley.
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:15.480]   Wesley.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:21.960]   Starlink is going to have super, super fast access faster than you can get from a hard
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:24.120]   cable from London to New York.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.120]   Yep.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:30.400]   So a lot of the initial customers for Starlink are probably going to be for financial trades
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.760]   to major financial hubs, which means that it's going to be super expensive for the very,
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.960]   very late-seats sensitive applications.
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.000]   That being said, that means it's going to be high-end initially.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:46.000]   That's funny.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   He's got to make that money back.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.600]   It's expensive to launch 12,000 satellites.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:56.800]   And when you think about that being like it's a high-end form of internet so people
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:06.480]   can go wherever they want and not be disconnected, one concern is that SpaceX, also Starlink,
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.280]   is a US company.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:14.480]   And what is it going to be like for the US government to be able to tap into some of
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:23.560]   the most important riches, transactions, communications around the world with a subpoena?
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:30.240]   So as more people and more high-value targets move on to this platform, it's going to be
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.040]   really curious as to how many people will trust it, knowing that the US government can
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.040]   just tap into it.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:43.240]   I don't know if you can find a way of incorporating it into a place where he doesn't have to
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:47.960]   submit to these types of law authorities, whether it's Russia, whether it's China,
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:54.160]   whether it's the US government, to try to move away from that kind of oversight.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.080]   No one's really talking about this.
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.960]   Generally speaking, as an American, I guess we are not, but other countries.
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:00.960]   Makes sense.
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:05.080]   When you talk about a global internet access, that might be a concern that might come up.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:10.600]   I was looking forward to see studying with it, but I guess that's not going to happen.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.760]   You just harsh my vibe, man.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:14.840]   Sorry, I'm doubting my vibe now.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.200]   No, I'm looking forward to it because I want to be able to do these shows anywhere in the
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.200]   world.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.200]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.760]   But I didn't even think about flash mobs.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.160]   I didn't even think about that.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.160]   Not flash mobs.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:37.040]   Flashboys, the idea that high-speed transactions, computerized, flash trades.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:39.880]   I was thinking about that book, Flashboys.
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.480]   Go ahead, I'm sorry, we interrupted what we got cross signals because of late.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.280]   See, that's another thing it had fixed.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.280]   No more late.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:54.480]   All I was going to say was this was a big tech earnings week.
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.880]   You can argue if Tesla is a tech company, but of all the companies that had a great earnings
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:06.440]   this week was Tesla for sure.
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:13.040]   The thing that made me want to say that is that Elon Musk hasn't done anything controversial
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.640]   lately, so that's part of the thing contributing to the wind at their back, for sure.
[01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.240]   They did lose money, though.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.360]   They had a good quarter.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:27.040]   I'm confused because I saw both that they lost money and had a good quarter.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:32.280]   It's because essentially they're going to be able to deliver half a million vehicles.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:39.120]   The wind is at their back in the sense that maybe they can have all of their competitors
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.640]   on the high end are more expensive.
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:45.920]   They're coming in right in the middle than the cheaper ones.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.640]   I'm rooting for them.
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.840]   Please don't get me wrong.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.840]   I am rooting for them.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:54.800]   I'm all in on electric vehicles.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:00.800]   It's thanks to Elon that we even have these, I think.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.000]   Let's take a break and we'll get some final thoughts and stories in here.
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.920]   First, a word from Zip Recruiter.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.800]   Zip Recruiter is the way to hire.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.800]   I could tell you from our own experience.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:15.960]   It's amazing.
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:20.440]   Of course, it's a great place to go if you're looking for a job, but if you're hiring,
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:26.280]   Zip Recruiter makes it so much faster, so much easier, so much more effective.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:32.800]   You probably saw the ads with Calphail Turas, which is a coffee shop.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.040]   Their COO, Dylan Miskovitz, was looking for a director of coffee, having a hard time finding
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:42.880]   qualified applicants, switched to Zip Recruiter.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.320]   We've used this too, and it really helps.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:52.480]   Besides the fact that Zip Recruiter puts your posting on more than 100 other job boards,
[01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:58.640]   it takes all the incoming applications, puts them in the Zip Recruiter interface, formatting
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.560]   the resume so they're easy to read.
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.240]   They have screening questions so you can eliminate people that aren't right for you.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:06.680]   It makes it very, very simple.
[01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:08.080]   They don't jam your inbox.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.240]   All of the benefits of Zip Recruiter.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:14.520]   One thing they do that's really cool is Zip Recruiter's technology will look at your posting
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.480]   and find people who have the right experience and then tell them about you.
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:20.840]   They promote your posting.
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.040]   They'll invite them to apply for your job, and that's what Dylan discovered.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.080]   He had qualified candidates apply within hours.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.600]   In just a few days, he found his director of coffee.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:34.040]   We had the same experience, literally, within a few hours.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.440]   Qualified candidates started rolling in.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.440]   It's a great feeling, especially because if you're the person who's hiring at your company,
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.440]   it's so hard.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.760]   A small company like ours, somebody leaves, we've got two weeks notice, we've got to
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.640]   fill that job.
[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:49.640]   We're going to be slammed.
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:52.840]   We're going to be hard, and the fact that we can get great applicants and we get them
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.960]   fast makes such a difference for us.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.320]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate within the
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:01.200]   first day.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.600]   That is a technology that really works.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.360]   You got to try Zip Recruiter.
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:08.200]   It's effective no matter what size business.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.080]   You can try it for free at our web address.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.080]   It's a special address.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.440]   Let's them know you heard it here.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:23.960]   Zip Recruiter.com/twit, zip, recruiter, R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R, ziprecruiter.com/twit, T-W-I-T.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.240]   It's the smartest way to hire.
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:26.240]   We use it.
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:29.680]   We use it now for every opening, and it makes such a big difference.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:30.840]   Highly recommend it.
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.760]   Ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:36.720]   Thank you, Zip Recruiter, for doing such a great job for us.
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.240]   Caltech, big payday for Caltech.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:45.560]   If the decision's upheld, I imagine Apple and Broadcom will appeal.
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:51.360]   Apple is ordered to pay $837.8 million to Caltech.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:58.800]   Broadcom, $270 million, more than $1.1 billion for patent infringement.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:05.920]   Caltech filed suit in federal court in 2016 saying that those Broadcom chips and Apple
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:11.200]   phones infringed the Wi-Fi chips and fringed on Caltech's patents.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.400]   The jury said, "You're right.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.160]   It's the sixth largest patent-related verdict ever."
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.640]   Of course, Apple and Broadcom will appeal.
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:27.400]   A lot of times when appeal, these numbers get shrunk, but still a big victory for Caltech.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:35.880]   Do you know during the podcast lawsuit where I forget the name of the company was saying
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.600]   that all podcasts infringed on our patents?
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:43.840]   One of the discussions was, "Do we challenge a patent or do we not?"
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:50.400]   In this specific, Apple challenged the patents, Apple and Broadcom.
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:53.040]   Most of them were rejected except for four.
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.440]   They chose to go ahead and investigate.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:01.680]   They found in favor of the plaintiff, not to defend it, which means that Apple actually
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:08.520]   lost four of those challenges to those patents were upheld.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:11.080]   This makes their case even weaker.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:15.760]   They probably are going to lose even if they appeal because the patents have been seen as
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:16.760]   valid.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:22.200]   You can, if you have a patent dispute, and this was the conversation with the podcast
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.040]   patent, you can go back to the US Patent and Trademark Office and do something called
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.320]   an inter-partase appeal where you say, "Hey, can you look at these patents?"
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.880]   See if they're legit.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.200]   Short circuits, the process of the patent and trademark office looks at you.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.960]   By the way, you offer documents saying, "Look, here's prior art, blah, blah, blah."
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:43.880]   If they agree with you, a short circuit is the whole thing.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:45.480]   You don't have to go to court.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.520]   As you point out, Wesley, there's a huge risk.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:55.320]   In fact, our attorneys suggested we not do this because if the USPTO agrees with the patent,
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:59.320]   then when they go to a jury, they say, "Look, they appealed in the patent and trademark office
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.880]   even said this is a good patent."
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:07.000]   Apparently, that was important in this trial.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.080]   To Adam Corolla's credit, I want to give an eternal thanks.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.080]   He raised money.
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:17.160]   He had a crowdfunded it and did, in fact, fight against the patent troll.
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:22.560]   The Electronic Frontier Foundation went to the USPTO for an inter-partase.
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.800]   They decided to do it, even though our attorneys said, "Oh, don't do that."
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:27.520]   They won.
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:28.800]   That short circuit did it.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:35.600]   Thank you, EFF and Adam Corolla, because that patent lawsuit could have killed podcasting.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.960]   Could have been a bad, bad thing.
[01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:40.080]   Instead, it went away.
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:49.800]   Speaking of going away, Sonos, and gadget, great piece from you, Devindra.
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:55.200]   Every smart device you love will die starting with Sonos.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:57.840]   A little dramatic.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.320]   It's an important point, though.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.320]   Make the point.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:03.120]   Tell us why you say this.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:10.440]   Last week, we heard about Sonos' plan to retire some of their 10-year-old products.
[01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:15.800]   The first Play Five, some of the first bridges, I believe, that they released.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.280]   Basically, they said that they were going to end support.
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:23.740]   Also, if you were using those devices and had modern Sonos hardware, none of your hardware
[01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:25.000]   would be updated.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000]   It's all a dated network, and they're all mesh connected, so you couldn't have old stuff
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.200]   and new stuff running together.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:37.520]   I think it just made it clear that this wondrous bounty of connected gadgets we're living in,
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:44.440]   this is the cost, is that they will die, and much faster than similar gadgets of the past.
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:50.560]   I know people running high-fi speakers that are decades old, speakers from the '70s.
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:57.080]   They can still run today because they're all running over a nice standard wired connection,
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.960]   and that's been consistent for the last several decades.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.680]   We just don't have that anymore.
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:07.560]   Smart devices, because they're basically tiny computers, they won't be able to run newer
[01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:08.920]   software and newer updates.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:11.840]   They'll just have to be retired eventually.
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:15.000]   Your only choice as a consumer is to upgrade.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.240]   I think for Sonos in particular, that was a big hit to Sonos fans, because you could
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.360]   easily spend thousands of dollars equipping your house with smart Sonos speakers.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.960]   Now, it looks like the company is going to be killing support and also giving you a
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:32.880]   really bad way to upgrade.
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:38.200]   They have this thing called recycle mode that'll fundamentally kill an old device completely,
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:42.480]   rev it cobbly, like you can't even restore it.
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:46.800]   They'll give you 30% off new hardware, and you'll do this all again in 10 years maybe.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:51.200]   To me, it's kind of a mess, and it just shows this stuff won't last forever.
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:56.440]   Smart devices may make our lives easier, but they will die far sooner than older gadgets
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:57.440]   to the past.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:01.480]   I went to my Sonos account and said, "You have 11 legacy products that do not receive
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:05.360]   software updates and new features as of May 2021."
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:11.160]   The sad thing is, as you can see, I also have a lot of modern stuff, and I can't share
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:14.800]   the network with all this old stuff.
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:17.480]   I'm scrolling down Leo, because that's what I have.
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.640]   This is my entire house.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:19.640]   Oh, man.
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.800]   This is my way is what I was telling people about.
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.720]   It's like, 10 years ago, I was telling people, "Yeah, this is how much stuff sure looks great.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.280]   I don't know what they're going to do with this stuff software-wise.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.880]   I don't know if you should invest in this ecosystem."
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:35.160]   And now, the chickens are coming home to roost, I guess.
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:36.880]   Lessened and learned.
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:38.360]   Lessened learned.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:45.680]   There is durable goods like speakers, and there is software hardware products like computers,
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:50.800]   and you shouldn't put them together into one thing, because one's going to superannuate
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:53.480]   and the other one's going to go on forever.
[01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:54.480]   But guess what?
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480]   When the software dies, so...
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:04.200]   Leo, my father is an obsessive eBay guy that goes on to get 70s era speakers and...
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:05.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:07.680]   Those great old clipshorns, they're great.
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.640]   The eBay's thousands of dollars for these things that still work.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.680]   It's like four or five owners later.
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:17.680]   And sound fantastic.
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:23.280]   So, I mean, the lesson, and I presume you talked about this in your article, the lesson
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:25.800]   is decouple, right?
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:29.400]   Don't get a smart TV, get a TV plus a smart bus.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.400]   Those don't exist anymore.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.400]   Every TV is a smart device.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.400]   I know, but you shouldn't.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.400]   You can't get a dumb TV anymore.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.960]   So, here's the thing, right?
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:35.960]   We're on a path.
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:36.960]   It's a slippery slope.
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.960]   I think we're going to stop this.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:42.160]   But I think a lot of people complaining, like the upper over this four Sonos, to be like,
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:46.200]   "Okay, we're going to figure out some way to make your own devices and new stuff work."
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.600]   Eventually, we don't know how.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.240]   What they basically says, "Okay, you'll now have two networks, the new devices and the
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.240]   old devices."
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:54.400]   We don't know specifically yet.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:57.400]   They haven't announced the update, so it's something.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:58.800]   It's better than nothing.
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:05.200]   But yeah, I think when you're thinking about this stuff, certainly you want to have another
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.080]   way to use your devices if the app dies, if the company goes bankrupt.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.340]   The problem with the Sonos stuff is a lot of the early hardware didn't even have 3.5
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.340]   millimeter jacks.
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:19.880]   I know the Play 5 did, but when they kill the Play 1 and the Play 3, those don't have
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:20.880]   other jacks.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:24.520]   So, you can't do anything with them if you can't use the Sonos app anymore.
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:30.720]   Well, even the line in jack, you need in software to tell it, use it.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.720]   Oh, boy.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:33.720]   So, I think you still need the software.
[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:36.320]   You can't just plug something in and have a play through that speaker.
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:39.400]   The software has to say, "Oh, yeah, take the aux jack."
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.400]   Don't.
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.400]   This is the price of convenience, basically.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:52.040]   The price of extreme convenience is extreme heartbreak once things start to fall apart.
[01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:55.360]   I'm telling you, they've harched my vibe again.
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:56.360]   Again.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:57.360]   Again.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.360]   I've been trying.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:03.240]   I'm trying and I don't want to doubt my vibe, but I can't help doubt my vibe.
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:07.880]   By the way, pro tip for listeners, if you want really good sounding speakers, you could
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:10.120]   get a Sambar, you could get a Sonos or something.
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:11.880]   Buy a receiver.
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.080]   Buy some nice speakers and just live with a couple of wides.
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.080]   Like a stereo.
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:17.080]   Like the old days.
[01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:18.080]   Like the old days.
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.080]   From eBay from the 1970s of France.
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:22.080]   You could do that too.
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:23.080]   You could do that too.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:24.080]   Brian's dad.
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:27.400]   He's got about 12 of them in his house.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:28.920]   He'll sell them too.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:31.160]   No, I have a stereo.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.160]   That's what I have.
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.600]   All those Sonos connect connected into the stereo.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.720]   So at least the stereo lives on, right?
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.280]   The receivers and the speakers all are fine.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:40.840]   You can totally do that.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:42.800]   You can decouple the smarts like you were saying.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.800]   Decouple.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.960]   Like have the receiver be the thing that you upgrade every couple of years with new standards
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:47.960]   and new tech.
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.200]   Have the speakers be these devices on the ends that you can just plug anything.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:55.640]   And by the way, you'll get better speakers.
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:58.800]   I mean, I mean, Sonos is fine, but you'll get much better speakers for the price.
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.800]   Go look at the E-LAC debuts.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:01.800]   I made it.
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.800]   E-LACs.
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:03.800]   Those are so good.
[01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:06.040]   I made it a big home theater upgrade a couple of years ago.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.200]   I spent $2,000 or so on like nice pioneer at most speakers.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.200]   And they sound incredible.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:13.080]   Like it's life changing.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:18.280]   And smart speakers are all the rage right now, but you can have smart, you know, stuff.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:20.120]   You can have connectivity connected to all the speakers.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.440]   Yeah, most A/V receivers are now smart.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.960]   They do radio and all that stuff.
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:26.280]   They've got Sonos connect.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.280]   They've got Chromecast.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:28.640]   They've got a lot of things.
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.640]   They've got AirPlay now.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:30.640]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.720]   Bluetooth, like, yeah, you could do anything with it.
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.280]   This is E-LAC.
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:35.280]   They are really, really nice.
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:37.960]   And relatively expensive speakers are phenomenal.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:42.720]   Very, very nice.
[01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:47.400]   You got your revenge, by the way, Wesley Faulkner, Gina Rometti.
[01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:48.400]   They finally retired.
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:49.480]   Oh, no.
[01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:53.120]   You got your revenge, buddy.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.920]   Was Virginia River when knew she was leaving?
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.920]   When you turned 60, you're out.
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.920]   That's just.
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.080]   It's everyone knew that this day would come.
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.240]   CEO of IBM, she's retiring.
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:05.160]   60, really?
[01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:06.160]   That's when you retire?
[01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:07.840]   Yeah, once you hit 60, you have to retire.
[01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:09.840]   Man.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:10.840]   Mm.
[01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:11.840]   60 or 65?
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.840]   60?
[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:13.840]   Maybe 65.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:14.840]   I forget.
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:15.840]   But like--
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:17.280]   In the old days, you get a gold watch.
[01:59:17.280 --> 01:59:18.280]   You hit it.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:19.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.280]   65.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:22.920]   You get to keep your pocket protector, and it's out the door.
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:27.560]   Arvind Krishna will take over as CEO in April.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.600]   IBM, does IBM even make computers anymore?
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.600]   Absolutely.
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:33.600]   Really?
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.600]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.640]   Well, not personal computers.
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:37.640]   They make--
[01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:38.640]   Mainframe.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.640]   Servers, their power series, power nine.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.640]   All right.
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.640]   They make mainframe still, which is actually where they get a bulk of their money still
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:46.640]   to this day.
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:51.360]   Not consulting is in their-- and mainframe is the bulk of their money where they make
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:52.960]   the big chunk of it.
[01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:00.720]   Because people in the highly regulated industry, like insurance or government work, there's
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:02.880]   a whole of certifications you needed.
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:07.260]   Need and mainframes are still one of the only that consolidate all of those certifications
[02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:12.200]   for transactions and able to manage all of that.
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:17.840]   In terms of redundancy and uptime, they're expensive, but you can literally shoot it with
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.440]   a shotgun and it still runs.
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:21.440]   Wow.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.280]   Yeah, they still make servers.
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:26.120]   They still make server arrays.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:27.800]   Just most of the high-end stuff.
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:33.840]   They are moving to services and the cloud, which also signifies why the change in leadership
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.600]   is people with a lot of deep cloud knowledge.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.520]   Yeah, Krishna is a cloud guy.
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:41.440]   I should mention Wesley used to work for them.
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:42.920]   That's how he knows all this.
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:50.280]   Yeah, a little something to do with the-- he still bleeds blue apparently.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:57.880]   Good news, the California attorney general is delaying the sale of the .org domain.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.800]   This was kind of shocking.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:11.280]   I can sold it to a for-profit company shortly after they eliminated price caps on .org domains.
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:19.360]   And Ethos Capital bought it, but that is now going to be held up by the state of California.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:24.280]   So that's, I think that's good news because that was a little bit not such good news,
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.680]   I thought.
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:30.480]   You're ready for the 62 brand new emoji?
[02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:35.960]   Can you believe there are 3,304 emoji?
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:37.600]   These are the new ones.
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.240]   I could never find the one I need.
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:40.240]   Never.
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:41.240]   It's going to get worse.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:42.240]   The list is way too long.
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.400]   There's too many of them.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.720]   There's a bride with a mustache.
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:48.400]   Thank God.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:53.640]   They finally, Santa Claus can be any color you want these days.
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:56.280]   They also have, I don't know, what flag is that?
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:57.280]   I don't know.
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:59.280]   There's something they have a--
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:00.640]   That flander is a trans flag.
[02:02:00.640 --> 02:02:04.040]   That flander is feeding a baby with a bob.
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.520]   Yeah, that flander is now feeding a baby.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:09.000]   That's good.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:12.000]   They have green peppers.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.520]   They have fondue with a Swiss cross on it.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.240]   And Olive, what is this?
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.240]   What is that?
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:20.240]   What is that?
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.240]   Is that a crumpet?
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:22.240]   What is that?
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:23.240]   Pancakes?
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:24.240]   Is that a roti?
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:25.240]   What is that?
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:26.240]   Pancake?
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:27.240]   Blueberries.
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:31.000]   They've got boba, the boba drink, the little tapioca things.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.760]   Is this tamale?
[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:33.760]   Is that a burrito?
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.200]   No one knows.
[02:02:35.200 --> 02:02:36.800]   No one knows.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.200]   There's a seal, a dodo.
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:41.680]   We don't need extinct.
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:44.000]   Look, you start doing extinct.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.600]   It never stops.
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:46.520]   We don't need extinct.
[02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:48.520]   You got a dum--
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:49.840]   There's like a mastodon on there.
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:50.840]   Oh, you're right.
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:52.240]   So we got extinct.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:53.240]   We got army helmet.
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:54.240]   We got saw.
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:55.800]   We got a hook.
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:56.800]   That'll be useful.
[02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:57.800]   A ladder.
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.480]   This is great anti-seapro-bull counter programming.
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:03.720]   This is why people tune in to it when they could be watching.
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:04.720]   Going down the emojis.
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:06.920]   The big game.
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.080]   Lungs?
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:11.160]   They got lungs now.
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:13.240]   We've needed lungs.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:16.560]   Let's think how you'll be able to use this to make conversation.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.400]   I'm glad the Groucho marks mustache and eyebrows.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:20.640]   There was a great article.
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.520]   I forget who did it about how you can propose emojis.
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:25.000]   It's a pretty simple process.
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000]   We can't accept it.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000]   The letter for him.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000]   Jeremy Bruej has been on our shows many times.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.400]   There he is.
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:34.440]   He is on the Unicode emoji committee.
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.200]   It's a very important job.
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:43.200]   There he is actually on a Technus Weekly this week talking about the new emojis.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.080]   He runs emojipedia.
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:48.280]   Are you going to buy a Hummer truck?
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:50.720]   We're going to watch tonight the Super Bowl.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:54.000]   It's actually probably right now.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.440]   Second quarter add for the new Hummer Electric Super Truck.
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:01.440]   1,000 horsepower.
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:03.560]   They're not going to show it till May.
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:04.760]   So don't get your hopes up.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:05.760]   That's all we get.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:06.760]   The bumper.
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:07.760]   That's all.
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:13.080]   I'm glad just more people are getting into this arena of electric vehicles.
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:14.080]   Especially in the truck.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:17.880]   We need a lot of competition in order for each one to push them forward.
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:20.480]   I agree 100% Wesley.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:22.520]   This one will be a full-on triangle.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:23.520]   Just like.
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:30.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time to go watch a football game.
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:31.920]   I thank you so much for being here.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:35.560]   Brian McCullough, the Tech meme right home.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:37.520]   Everybody must listen every single day.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.640]   If you go to Techmeme.com as I do every morning, I just press play.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:41.640]   That's it.
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.880]   Well, or at 5 p.m. Eastern every day.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:49.440]   Well, once you're done with the entire Twit catalog.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:51.360]   Then I can hear what happened.
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.440]   At 5 p.m. every day Eastern.
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:56.760]   That's when it's published.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.760]   Thank you, Brian.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.760]   Always great to see you.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:03.880]   Former Internet historian now officially a professional podcast.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:04.880]   Just a podcaster.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:07.640]   Just a lowly podcaster.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:09.440]   Don't say that.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:12.240]   It's a prestigious position.
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:14.400]   Wesley Faulkner, he's at MongoDB.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.960]   Does developer relations there?
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:16.960]   It's always great to see you.
[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:17.960]   Wesley, what's your t-shirt say?
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:19.720]   I didn't ask.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.960]   It says, are you AI ready?
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:23.960]   Oh.
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:24.960]   Are you?
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.400]   It is an old IBM shirt.
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:28.400]   That's why I was showing you.
[02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:29.760]   That was a little blue.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:30.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:31.760]   Nice.
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:36.560]   And if I could, I would like to plug something.
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:43.520]   A personal hero of mine is releasing a book later on this month on February 18th.
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.040]   Her name is Susan Fowler.
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:47.200]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with her work.
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:48.200]   I am.
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:49.200]   I love her.
[02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:53.200]   But her book is called Whistleblower, my journey to Silicon Valley, a fight for justice at
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:54.200]   Uber.
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:58.840]   So she's detailing a lot of personal stuff that wasn't public during that whole fiasco
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:03.520]   after her blog post outing the sexual harassment and.
[02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:06.520]   It was her memo that everything that she was doing.
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:08.280]   They're telling it down.
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:09.280]   Yes.
[02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:11.080]   And good, I can't wait to.
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:13.800]   I don't know her, but I look forward to reading this.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:15.280]   Whistleblower.
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:21.760]   And for those who love audiobooks, the audiobook is actually cheaper right now than the printed
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:22.760]   book.
[02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:31.480]   And so it comes out on the 18th, like I said, and she has paid the way for a lot of people,
[02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:33.840]   made things a lot easier for us.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:39.400]   And though the fight is really early in its industry, it's early.
[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:43.440]   I won't try to say that word again.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:47.160]   The things that she went through and the things that she continues to go through because of
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:53.520]   this allows us to keep having this conversation and making things better at our respective
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:58.480]   companies using her as a template to try to change things.
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:01.200]   In a way, she started and I can't wait for this to help.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.280]   It wasn't just the fall of Travis Kalanick.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:07.800]   She really was the first, the beginning of the Me Too movement, wasn't it?
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:10.080]   Yeah, in terms of the four watch team.
[02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.080]   Yeah, definitely.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:18.280]   I mean, there was, was it Ellen Powell, who tried, went to court for some discrimination.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:23.480]   She was suffering at her VC Forum, and that did not go well, didn't go in her favor.
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:30.120]   But in terms of real change, you can't help but see Susan Fowler as an agent of change
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.920]   in a lot of tech cultures.
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:32.920]   Very nice.
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:37.800]   So, I'm going to explore my journey to Silicon Valley and fight for justice at Uber.
[02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:39.320]   Be out next month.
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.360]   Actually, no, it'd be out soon.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.360]   Two weeks.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:44.360]   Thank you, Wesley.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:45.360]   Great to see you again.
[02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:46.720]   Thank you to the vendor of Harder War.
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:52.640]   He is not only senior editor and gadget, but he does a must listen to podcast for anybody
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:55.640]   who loves media slash film.
[02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:57.440]   Where can we get that?
[02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:58.600]   It's the slash film cast.
[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:01.800]   You can find it at slash film.com or just search iTunes.
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:03.640]   And yeah, we chat about movies every week.
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:08.240]   I also do, I co-host the gadget podcast, which we've just started revving back up and that's
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.480]   me and Sherlin Blow.
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:10.880]   Yeah, it's great.
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:11.880]   Oh, nice.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:12.880]   And Sherlin's awesome.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:16.080]   Like, so it is basically the two of us yelling at each other every week.
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:18.320]   But I think it's a good dynamic.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:22.760]   Last week we just broke down the Clearview AI story and kind of what it means for the,
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:25.360]   you know, the impact of facial recognition technology.
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:31.000]   And also we talked about, you know, Billie Eilish's Grammy win and kind of what she was
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.280]   able to do in a spare bedroom in her home and the kind of home tech that can now win
