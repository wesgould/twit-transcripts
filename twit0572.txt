[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.840]   We've got Steve Kovac, a great, a great panel.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.400]   We'll talk about the end of Yahoo.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.680]   It's going bye-bye.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.560]   And internet star who says, give me your Twitter password,
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.200]   and I'll give you something special.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.360]   Would you do it?

[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.720]   Think so.

[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.880]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.800]   where we cover the weeks.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.320]   Tech news.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.000]   And then there's a lot of it.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.360]   But at least that's what Nate Oliveris Giles says.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.400]   He's from the Wall Street Journal joining us today.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.120]   Giles, right?
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.600]   Yeah, you can ask you this every time.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.360]   It's all good.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.440]   Hard G, soft G. I'm confused by the whole GIF debate.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.120]   I don't know.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.680]   I always say GIF.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.960]   But then--
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.880]   But you say Giles?
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.560]   Exactly.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.280]   Yeah, I guess I'm a hypocrite.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.240]   I don't really know how to slice them.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.160]   You're one of the few people in the world
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.960]   who can say you're a hypocrite when you say GIF.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.320]   Because of my name and GIF.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.360]   Your name, yeah.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.880]   That's lame.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   Great to have you.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.200]   Also from Mark Million is here from Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.120]   Are you still doing global or are you now just tech in general?
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.640]   Yeah, we do plenty of global.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.840]   All sorts of tech.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.200]   Your boss is going to endorse Hillary Clinton.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.760]   My boss is his boss's boss.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.600]   Michael Bloomberg is--
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.000]   The big guy.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.760]   Does he come around much anymore?
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.440]   Yeah, he goes--
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   Former Mayor of New York.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.800]   He's frequently in the east head of the company.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.600]   Was he a large shareholder?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.480]   When he was mayor, he probably had to put the company
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.200]   into a whole receivership or something, right?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.800]   Some sort of--
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.400]   He stepped aside, hired Dan Doctor of as CEO.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.000]   And then once he was done with the mayor,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.800]   shit became back.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.160]   Nice.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.680]   Good to have you as always.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.240]   Likewise.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.480]   And joining us via Skype from New York City is Steve Kovac.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.680]   He is with techinsider.io.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.760]   And he's @SteveKovac on the Twitter.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.480]   Hello, Steve.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   Hello.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.000]   Hot day today in the big city.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.760]   It's ridiculous.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.600]   I barely left my apartment this weekend.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.240]   I love the album.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.720]   That was a beach.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.760]   I love the album covered.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.360]   I've never noticed it.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.520]   Those are my dad's old albums, a few of them.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.240]   And he sent me a whole bunch of them.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.400]   And I framed a few.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.720]   You know, it's funny I recognize a lot of them.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.960]   They're from my era, you know?
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.880]   He listened to those when he was in college and in the army.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.380]   Yeah.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.640]   He'd have to hold his ears.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.560]   That's so fun.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.320]   Yeah, he's-- my dad's 61.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.320]   Yeah, I'm 59.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.200]   So yeah.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.400]   Those are the same albums.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.760]   He's probably my roommate.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.800]   Anyway.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.040]   Great to have you.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.800]   I guess the big story, which just broke today,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.760]   Verizon is confirming that indeed they
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.200]   are buying Yahoo, $4.8 billion.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   Steve Ballmer's going, yes.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.040]   He bid $41 billion for Yahoo not so long ago
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.640]   when he was the CEO of Microsoft.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   That bid failed.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   And Steve dodged there by a huge bullet.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.920]   $4.8 billion doesn't seem like a lot of effect,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.160]   even when they first started putting Yahoo in the block.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.720]   They were speculating $8 billion.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.220]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.320]   Two Los Angeles Clippers, basically.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.140]   Well, this deal-- it's for the core company,
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.220]   which is Search and Media and all that stuff.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.380]   But it doesn't include some of the intellectual property.
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.520]   They sold off the Alibaba stake in the spinoff.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.020]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.660]   I mean, that was the most valuable part,
[00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.420]   Resident was right.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.420]   And that would have been included in the Microsoft deal
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.340]   seven years ago, eight years ago.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.860]   Yeah, in fact, it says the stake in Alibaba and Yahoo
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.580]   Japan are worth $40 billion.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.820]   So in fact, that might have been a good deal
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.220]   had they been able to get that.
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.260]   $4.8 billion, that's things like Flickr.
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.620]   It's things like Yahoo Mail.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.500]   Is that the Yahoo Mail the most valuable thing?
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.980]   Or is it the ad agents?
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.820]   Ad business.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.140]   Definitely the ad.
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.660]   Still the ad.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.220]   And search and just like they're kind of a lot of users
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.580]   that have stuck with them and just kind of go to them
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.500]   by default for a lot of web services.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.180]   Personally, the fantasy football, I think,
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.100]   is the most valuable part of Yahoo.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.620]   They have a pretty good fantasy football, right?
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.740]   Yeah, it's very good.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.500]   They have properties that are very highly visited.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.980]   OMG.com is a very high traffic site, TV.com.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.500]   But it does feel a little--
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.260]   Yahoo News.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.580]   It does feel a little bit like Verizon's collecting antique
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.500]   internet properties.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.820]   They bought AOL.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.180]   Now they have Yahoo.
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.980]   I'm sure they're looking at Altavist to think, and is this--
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.060]   Can we add this to our collection?
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.180]   Yeah, where's SGZ at?
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.500]   I mean, what if we--
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.580]   They mastered this sort of rapid deterioration
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.620]   of internet businesses?
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.740]   They picked up Tumblr, and then it instantly
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.260]   became one.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.380]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.460]   But what has Verizon done with AOL?
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.780]   It's really made AOL more exciting, more modern, more
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.780]   innovative.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.460]   And that just makes me think, what are they
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.860]   going to do with Yahoo?
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.620]   I understand that they're trying to build themselves
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.780]   into a media company, into a fully fledged tech company,
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.060]   not just dumb pipes per se as a telecom provider.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.700]   But I just don't really know what Verizon's vision is with Yahoo
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.500]   based on what they've done or not done with AOL.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.100]   I guess AT&T is doing similar acquisitions.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.340]   Is it that the business being a cell company
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.020]   is not a long-term good prospect that you need to find
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.180]   some other things?
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.100]   You don't want to be pipes.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.140]   You want to be content.
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.100]   I think it comes down to that, showing growth.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.220]   You're always going to have growth as far as people
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.500]   wanting to get web access in new places, whether it's cellular
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.620]   or that's delivering internet to a home or to a business.
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.860]   But this then gives them something
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.940]   to do with those pipes and to leverage that ability
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.580]   to reach people, give them something to offer.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.140]   And you're already seeing that.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.780]   I think Verizon has an app--
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.340]   what's it called?
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.580]   Go 90 or something like that?
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.180]   Go 90.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.540]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.100]   And they're already delivering video content.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.620]   And I guess if you're controlling the pipes, Comcast
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.380]   and VC's trying to do the same thing.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.380]   I don't know.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.020]   Bloomberg technology quotes Craig Moffatt, who's
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.460]   an analyst-- well-known analyst at Moffatt, Nathan said,
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.300]   "This deal speaks to a clear strategy shift at Verizon.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.100]   They're trying to monetize wireless in an entirely new way.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.220]   Instead of charging customers for traffic,
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.900]   they're turning to charging advertisers for eyeballs.
[00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.300]   They're seeing-- and that's certainly
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.700]   what publishers in other sectors are doing.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.300]   They're saying, well, our business
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.940]   always has been for newspapers, delivering ads.
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.140]   You got it.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.020]   And--
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.140]   But see, that is a business model that's existed for more
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.180]   than 100 years.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.100]   And OK, maybe it's new for Verizon per se,
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.780]   but it's not new for the world.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.420]   And I just don't know.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.060]   I'm just not sure if I really see something very new there.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:28.580]   I agree.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.140]   I think you nailed it when you said
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.260]   what have they done with AOL?
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.500]   It makes it more interesting property.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.420]   I mean, they've kept in gadget going.
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.260]   It hasn't changed.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.260]   They've kept tech--
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.460]   tech crunch going.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.140]   Huff po.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.140]   Huff po.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.860]   But there's been no changes there.
[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.180]   Those properties are exactly as they were before AOL was sold.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.780]   And that's the thing I'm the most interested in
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.740]   is the new media play that they're making.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.300]   I mean, Yahoo News is massive.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.340]   I don't know what they're--
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.340]   Is it really?
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.540]   Oh my god, it's huge.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.660]   And it's-- like, I think it was just saying,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.420]   it's like the home page for so many people.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.860]   If I just know anecdotally if business insider, tech insider
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.620]   gets a link out from Yahoo News, it's like a fire hose.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620]   Interesting.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.180]   I think Yahoo News is still the most visited news property
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:11.860]   on the web.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.860]   Wow, more than--
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.660]   Wow, that surprises me.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.820]   Is that a default?
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.420]   Is that why?
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.500]   Is it a home page kind of thing?
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.420]   Or I think it's old--
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.460]   And they take it--
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.660]   Yeah, and they take in content from--
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.100]   they don't just write their own content.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.620]   They have AP, partners like BI and CNET.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.660]   And I mean, just gobs of other syndication partners.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.820]   So I mean, they get all this free content coming in.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.620]   It's just a massive, massive news site for a lot of people.
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.020]   I used my Yahoo for years in my home page.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.940]   I see it's still around.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.660]   I thought they killed it.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.100]   But this has to drive some traffic, right?
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.460]   I mean, it's got to--
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:47.980]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.980]   That's the news in the middle here.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.340]   You got it?
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.740]   And of course, the big story today,
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.500]   Courtney Kardashian shows off her chiseled bod in a way
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.540]   not bikini.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.060]   And then number two, Selena Gomez bikini
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.340]   grams proves she's definitely a 10.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.340]   And then careful, these 10 cars look nice,
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.740]   but they're made cheap.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.420]   It is.
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.340]   These news results are personalized based on your activity.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.140]   It's my honest.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.260]   It's my--
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:15.980]   Yahoo.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.260]   I don't know where they got the idea.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.180]   I'll never forget it.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.100]   I was at a podcast expo some years ago.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.180]   A guy came up to me.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.300]   He said, three words, the next big thing in podcasting.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.220]   Bikini rich content.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.260]   He seriously--
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.020]   That's amazing.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.860]   That's basically what Instagram is.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.180]   Well, that depends.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.100]   Again, that's what you put in your feed.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.300]   So I'm looking at news.yahoo.com, which
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.540]   is the kind of uncustomized normal.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.660]   And it's a politics.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.900]   It's like a news page.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.260]   And Yahoo Finance is great.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.900]   I use Yahoo Finance for years.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.940]   Google has competitors in all these categories, don't they?
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.460]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:52.780]   Yes.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.620]   They're smaller.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.780]   Google Finance is smaller.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.180]   Google News is smaller.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.820]   Yahoo still leads them in a number of places.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.540]   You nailed it.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.940]   Old habits die hard.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.380]   You got it.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.020]   I mean, AOL still has a substantial amount of people
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.460]   who are paying for dial-up and all that kind of crazy stuff.
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.620]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.540]   There are a lot of folks who like what they have
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.980]   and are used to things being delivered a certain way.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.700]   Maybe Verizon is to be praised for not going
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.260]   for the sexy new thing, but instead focusing on solid--
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.660]   They're going to where the people are.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.780]   I mean, if you have the largest collection of readers
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.580]   on the internet, that's worth something,
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.540]   especially when you combine that with another giant property,
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.500]   which is AOL.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.140]   You start to put this massive buying power
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.460]   in front of advertisers.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.340]   They really have a lot of leverage in selling ads.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.340]   I mean, you can sell ads for higher prices
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.500]   when you have a large collection of people that
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.940]   can't be reached elsewhere.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.060]   But what is Verizon going to do that Marissa Mayer couldn't do,
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.140]   that she didn't do?
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.860]   I mean, she was one of the sharpest minds in Silicon Valley,
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.580]   supposedly, and has been running for like the last four
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:59.580]   years.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.740]   And it's one thing to just sell ads against these sorts of things.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.740]   But I just don't feel like I'm seeing any genuinely new ideas.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.300]   Maybe it's more valuable to Verizon
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.940]   because of the business that they're in than it would be
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.700]   as a standalone property.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.180]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.700]   And you combine it with AOL, which
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.980]   is another huge online media company.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.180]   You put those two together.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.420]   You can conceivably sell ads for higher prices.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.660]   Marissa, by the way, will probably not go along with the deal.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.220]   She's--
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.420]   She's out.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.740]   And gets a $55 million golden parachute.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.140]   That has to--
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.020]   I mean, I know there might be some bruised egos here.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.060]   She wasn't able to pull off the turn that she wanted.
[00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.540]   But--
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.580]   That takes some of the sting out.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.900]   That's got to feel good.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.140]   That's got to feel good.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.220]   Well, she probably negotiated that when they tried to get her
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.220]   from when they got her from Google, I would guess.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.820]   $3 million severance.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:57.340]   $26 million cash, $26,000 for health benefits
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.020]   $15,000 for out placement.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.700]   And then $52 million worth of accelerated and restricted stock.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.300]   Wait, she needs out placement?
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.540]   That's probably just the standard thing, right?
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.860]   We're going to help you get a job there, Marissa.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.700]   We got a little questionnaire for you.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.780]   Just feel this out here.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.100]   Your skills and your interests.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.260]   Because it may be that you got--
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.580]   Like you got it on her shoes.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.580]   Who are you, exactly?
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.140]   Wow.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.700]   She got $36 million last year as pay.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.660]   So she's not hurting.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.780]   What will happen to Marissa Meyer?
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.860]   I feel like she could sit back for a little bit, maybe
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.140]   advise some startups that she really believes in,
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.340]   kind of have some sort of quite influential role,
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.540]   let things blow over, and then maybe come out
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.100]   with a really great idea of her own in a few years,
[00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.820]   or join as like a second tier executive at some big company.
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.380]   The least interesting thing for her to do
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.580]   would be what most people in her position do, which
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.100]   has become a VC.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.100]   Yep.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.260]   That was my gut reaction to what she'd do.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.900]   That's kind of the fallback.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.860]   All right, well, I'll be a VC.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.780]   And I think if you're looking for investment,
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.860]   normally when you become a partnership at a venture capital
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.900]   fund, you take some of your money, you put it in.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.260]   And then they use you as a way to attract startups,
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.180]   because Marissa Meyer will be your advisor,
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.460]   she'll help you make connections.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.660]   I think that a lot of VC firms are probably already
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.980]   knocking at her door, if they haven't been on it before.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.540]   Yeah, who wouldn't want her on their team?
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.180]   But again, one of the least interesting things
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:19.740]   she could do.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.100]   I like the idea of her saying, I have an idea.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.700]   Let me start a company.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.700]   Yeah, she's not done that before.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.700]   She's young, she's smart.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.700]   She's got-- I think she had it-- was put in a position of really
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.700]   something that was impossible to succeed at.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.700]   Yeah, but I think you got to almost give her some props
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.700]   just for taking a company that was in such a terrible, really
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.700]   kind of spot, and just owning it and trying to turn it around.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.700]   It clearly didn't work out.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.700]   But it was terrible.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.700]   It was a terrible quarter, by the way.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.700]   But if you're one of the top folks at Google,
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.700]   a growing, innovative, cutting-edge company,
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.700]   and you leave for Yahoo, that says a lot about how much you
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.700]   believe in yourself.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   Yeah, confidence.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.700]   Yeah, some would say hubris, but we'll say confidence.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.700]   We'll say confidence.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.700]   And she did everything she could.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.700]   It's impossible.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.700]   I don't think we can do a post mortem on how well she did.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.700]   It's very hard to understand what her options were,
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.700]   what she might have done differently, unless you guys feel
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.700]   confident that you could have saved Yahoo.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.700]   Nah, I can't say--
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.700]   You can turn around.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.700]   What would you have done?
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.700]   You're confident, guys.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.700]   Katie Kurtz.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.700]   Last maybe.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.700]   Oh, hey, what happens to Katie now?
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.700]   Does anyone-- does anyone-- I mean, you know,
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.700]   they have this massive audience for their home page,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.700]   but do we know what their audience looks like for their actual
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.700]   shows, which seem to be inconsistent at best?
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   Well, one of the things they did some months ago is they killed
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.700]   many of the verticals.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.700]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   Right?
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.700]   They had verticals, and they just kind of merged them in.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.700]   There was Yahoo!
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.700]   Car and Yahoo!
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.700]   Tech.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.700]   They kept David Pogue, but they-- I think they kind of took
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.700]   tech and merged in into the mainstream.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.700]   They certainly did it with many of the other verticals.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   Yep.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.700]   Katie Kurtz is still there.
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.700]   She's got a Yahoo!
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.700]   News exclusive.
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.700]   Exclusive.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.700]   Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.700]   She's at-- yeah, she's there.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.700]   Global anchor.
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.700]   And there you go.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.700]   She's in a studio, looks just like a traditional studio,
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.700]   but it's Yahoo!
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.700]   News Studio.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.700]   I wonder if that-- I wonder if this will continue.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.700]   I--
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700]   I said--
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.700]   Would you-- I mean, would you-- if there's a Verizon
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.700]   News Studio, is that the same?
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.700]   Verizon didn't rebrand the stuff they got from AOL though.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.700]   No.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.700]   Yeah, they kept the brands.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.700]   I think they will keep the brands separate from Verizon.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.700]   If the point is to retain that audience, which is maybe
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.700]   something around based on familiarity and comfort,
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.700]   you know, changing the brand seems like it would be a good way
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   to ruin that, right?
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.700]   I'm probably looking at Comcast, similar situation.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.700]   They don't want to be a dumb pipe.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.700]   They went out, they buy NBC Universal.
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.700]   Now they're making movies.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.700]   Now they've got a television network.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.700]   It does say Comcast.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.700]   When you go to Universal Pictures, it says Universal.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.700]   A Comcast company.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.700]   And they say NBC Universal, and then Comcast kind of gets mixed in there.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   When you go to 30 Rock, right, Steve?
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.700]   When you go to the Rockefeller Center, there's Comcast branding.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.700]   It's everywhere.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.700]   So they're not hiding the fact that they own it, but they have left those properties to
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.700]   be NBC.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   It's not called Comcast.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.700]   It's probably a very similar idea.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   All right.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   There we go.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.700]   Yahoo.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.700]   That's the big, that's the breaking story for the day.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.700]   Yahoo.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.700]   We're going to get, this week is going to be a busy week.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.700]   We're going to get Apple quarterly results on Tuesday.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.700]   Any predictions there?
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.700]   You think?
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.700]   I think it's going to be expected.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.700]   It's just slow iPhone growth again.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:53.380]   Continue a decline of the big fruit company.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.260]   Sales of iPhone, continue to decline.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.900]   iPad, continue to decline.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.700]   But they're waiting for next quarter.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.020]   They're waiting for the new iPhone in September, right?
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.020]   Yeah.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.300]   They are kind of waiting for the new hotness for the iPhone 7 and all of those things.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.500]   But, you know, I think a little bit of context, like they are declining, but they are still
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.740]   selling more phones than any other single company in the world.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.740]   And still making a ton of profit.
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.140]   You can't keep that toward growth up.
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.140]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.380]   It's just the pace of growth is slowing, right?
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.380]   But you watch, because the stock market is going to stay.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.500]   Oh, it's all over for, I mean, the headlines will come out on Tuesday.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.740]   You know, it's the end of the Apple.
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.660]   It's all over for Apple.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.220]   What's next?
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:34.220]   It's a different company.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.740]   I have to say, I don't feel like, used to be, you could say, oh, they'll innovate their
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.740]   way out of this.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.940]   I don't know if you could say that this time.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.260]   Well, I think what we're seeing is something a lot of us have written about is a bit of
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.780]   a commodisation of smartphones, right?
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.820]   So, yeah, look it.
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.020]   Can you tell the difference between these and then Apple?
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.820]   They're all slabs of glass, right?
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.820]   Exactly.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.700]   But, you know, Apple was the one to define that.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.700]   And they're still selling more of their iPhones than...
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.860]   We should play a new game.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.860]   Anything else?
[00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.700]   Which one is the iPhone?
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.700]   Right?
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   They're all kind of this.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.060]   The iPhone's starting to look a little bit behind as Android manufacturers continue to
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.060]   innovate.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.700]   You look at what the Moto X is kind of an interesting...
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.340]   A Z, I should say, the interesting device.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.820]   It's super thin, but you add capabilities by snapping on magnetic backs.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:27.180]   I mean, you know, and the LG's doing the same kind of idea with the modules.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.980]   And Samsung's really gotten it together.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:35.820]   I've reviewed Android phones for years and I really hated a lot of the early Galaxy
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.820]   phones.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.820]   They're fantastic.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:38.820]   Yes, 7 is fantastic.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:39.820]   The cameras are great.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.820]   The operating system...
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.820]   And we're going to see...
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.820]   And we're going to see...
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.540]   Wait a minute, start starting to not suck, finally.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.540]   A note?
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.380]   We're going to see a note 7, August 2nd.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.180]   They're going to be pretty soon.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.180]   Will it be waterproof?
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.020]   Yeah, it should be.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.020]   Why not?
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.820]   Now, is the 7 actually waterproof?
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.820]   Or is it like...
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.820]   Yes, 7 is supposed to be.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.820]   I mean, you can put it under...
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.820]   In our testing, we put it under a...
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.460]   Didn't you see Lil Wayne pouring champagne on it?
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.460]   Dude, I missed that.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.460]   Where have you been?
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.620]   It was a Super Bowl commercial.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:12.420]   Yeah, and then his buddy pour champagne on his iPhone and they go, "Oh, dude, you can't
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.420]   do that."
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.620]   It's actually a pretty funny ad.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:20.780]   But I did talk to somebody who's very disappointed that his S6 was not waterproof, lost it.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.220]   Yeah, they had it with the 5, they took it away with the 6, they brought it back with
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.220]   the 7.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.220]   And was it consumer reports?
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:29.260]   I think it was consumer reports that dunked the S7 and said, "Well, that's not that waterproof."
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.620]   That was the active, which is the other variation of it.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.580]   And then apparently they fixed some kind of process in the manufacturing process and
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   now that's okay.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.740]   But no one should buy the active anyway, it's ugly.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.740]   So the...
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.740]   Get the edge.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.740]   Get the regular S7.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.060]   You want the edge, which is the most beautiful phone you can buy right now.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.260]   Totally impractical, but boy, it sure looks nice.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.180]   It's the infinity pool of smartphone.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.180]   I don't see it.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.340]   I'm not into the edge.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.340]   Like the screen curves.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.340]   Really?
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.340]   Yeah, I mean...
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.340]   I love it.
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.900]   The screen curves and I guess it feels nice in your hand or whatever, but...
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.900]   Promise, right.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.900]   Does it make anything look better?
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.380]   I touch it by accident all the time.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.380]   It's a perfect Pokemon Go phone.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.340]   And you know, apps are built for flat screens and then you have that slight taper, I guess.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.340]   It's a little weird.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   It just kind of bothers me on the...
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.340]   Apple Apple.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.660]   Apple Apple, there's no doubt at this point.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.460]   And I've been playing with iOS 10 that Apple is playing catch up in almost every respect.
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.340]   In some cases, it's way behind.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.580]   But I think what it's going to come down to for a lot of these companies, and this is
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:33.620]   where it's really going to be about Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and maybe Facebook,
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.500]   maybe is how they tie all of these things together, right?
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.420]   So, you know, if smartphones are growing to a point where it's something that everyone
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.700]   wants to have, and for a lot of people out there, it is maybe their first computer or
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:51.220]   their only computer, then it's going to be about leveraging that and tying those things
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   together.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.980]   So the voice control is going to be important.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.460]   The search sort of prediction that you're seeing with Siri and Google Now and Amazon
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.260]   Alexa is going to be important.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.700]   And I think that's that next layer where things are going to go.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.860]   It's all about software going forward.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.860]   Exactly.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.500]   And Samsung isn't even at play in that regard.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   Because they're Android.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   What are they going to do?
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500]   Exactly.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.500]   Exactly.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.100]   They're just making the device have some software.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.100]   But that's a good point.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.620]   Apple, where Apple could have its edge is making better, better software.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.620]   That's where it's going.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.620]   You know, and...
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.620]   They've done that with the camera.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.460]   I mean, the camera is all about the software, not about the lens.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.460]   You got it.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.460]   You got it.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.100]   So Google is in that position where they can tie all those services together on other
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.420]   people's hardware and maybe some of their own a little bit here and there, tying it in
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.980]   with the home and all of these things.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   Apple can do that.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.420]   Microsoft with Cortana, you know, it's going to be interesting.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.020]   Maybe that's why Google, it's rumored, will do new Nexus phones where they're going to
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.580]   take control of it.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.580]   They're going to make themselves more like an Apple where they make the phone beginning
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.380]   to end, control it totally.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.380]   Maybe that's what's going on with Google, is they say, well...
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.820]   Apparently what's going on, there's no question about it.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.620]   That's the only way they see they can really push Android forward is to make their own
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.940]   hardware in a very Apple.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.940]   I mean, they hired Rick Osterlo to run this new hardware division.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.740]   It was at the Motor Roll before.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.740]   It was a great...
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   It was at Motor Roll before.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.340]   And this is a major, major part of that is his team.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.460]   It starts with the phone and branches out to things like home, maybe some tablets and
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.780]   Chromebooks and VR headsets if you want to get wacky.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.060]   But I mean, it starts with the phone.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:28.940]   I mean, as we know, they have this major update problem in Samsung and HTC and the carrier
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.220]   partners can't get it together.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.940]   So they're going to take matters in their own hands now.
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.700]   And it's going to be really interesting next year to see what kind of phone they build
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.780]   first and then build out from there.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.780]   Pause for a second.
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.380]   Is that rumbling coming from Steve Carson?
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.380]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.380]   Rumbling.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   It sounds like maybe...
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.380]   Is it...
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.380]   Are you breathing?
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.380]   Maybe move the mic up a little higher.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.380]   Maybe you're breathing into it, I don't know.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.380]   How's that?
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.380]   No.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.380]   Oh, you know what it is?
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.380]   It's my AC.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.540]   Oh, it's blowing on you.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.540]   That's what it is.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.540]   That's New York.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.540]   You want to flip...
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.540]   Hold on.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.540]   Maybe if you flip the headphone around and put the mic on the other side, I don't know
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.540]   if it'd be bad.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.300]   Where is it blowing from?
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   My window.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   No, I'm being...
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.300]   Which point to the direction?
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.300]   On my mic side.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.660]   Flip the mic around to the...
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.860]   Usually you can flip it to the...
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.260]   Oh, you can on that one?
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.260]   It has to be the one.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   You can on that one.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.900]   Can you hear me now?
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.900]   That's a lot better.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.900]   Okay.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.900]   Can you wear it like that?
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.460]   You're going to get your bath to record a hip-hop video.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.140]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.220]   DJ, Steve Kovac is here.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.220]   There we go.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.220]   Yeah, that's what it was.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.220]   It was blowing on.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.220]   It was still doing a little bit, yeah.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:47.060]   Let me turn the fan down a little bit.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.060]   There we go.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.060]   Sorry, but...
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:50.060]   Did that help?
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.060]   You can...
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.060]   Where on the other side?
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.060]   Let's see what it...
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.060]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.060]   There we go.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.060]   Yeah, much better.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.060]   All right.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.060]   I think we're good at it.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.060]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   It was the wind hitting it.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.260]   Yeah, the AC is a few feet away from me, so the air is coming in.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.780]   That's why you need those luxury seats with the fan underneath.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.500]   Blows up.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.580]   Not down.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.100]   No one knows.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.940]   As long as you stay in cool.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   You're getting it.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:15.940]   Took us AC.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.940]   What were we talking about?
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.940]   I have no idea.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.940]   Oh, Apple.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.940]   Yes.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.940]   And Android and the new phones from Google.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:33.380]   Actually in one respect, Apple is achieving parity with Android.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:39.100]   Android has its stage fright exploit, an exploit that would allow you to send a malformed
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:45.300]   MMS message to an Android device and the media player would give you full access and
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.900]   you could pwn the machine.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:54.220]   It looks like OS X, iOS, even watch, OS and TV, OS had the same vulnerability.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.180]   Cisco discovered it.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.180]   Did the right thing.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:05.780]   They told Apple before they told the world and Apple has pushed fixes for OS X, El Capitan,
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.340]   iOS, watch, OS and TV, OS.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:15.460]   So update folks because what would happen is somebody sends you an iMessage, malformed
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:21.300]   iMessage and he could, he or she could actually take over your phone, remote court execution,
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.060]   get everything.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.820]   There is no update yet for Yosemite or Mavericks.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.420]   So if you're on a Macintosh with Yosemite or Mavericks, maybe don't use iMessage.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.420]   Or get to El Capitan.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.780]   Or get to it's free and do it now.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.100]   Or computers going back as far as about 2007.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.100]   It's funny.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.580]   I don't know if it's a coincidence that it's in the media player.
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.380]   It's in very much the same place as it happened in Android.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.700]   Or just that these are kind of vulnerable parts and pieces of Windows has had problems
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:59.980]   in the past with the WMF play at the LL because you could send it an image and it would allow
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:04.940]   buffer overflow and then you could use it to execute code remotely.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:11.220]   Well both Android and iOS are Linux based and this exploit for iOS isn't Linux based.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.220]   It's BSD.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:19.460]   And so what this was doing is it was using the API that iOS uses to render images.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.460]   Right.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.460]   And taking advantage of that.
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.460]   Very similar to that.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.620]   So you get something in, you think it's a TIFF, you render it as a TIFF and then it changes
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.180]   into malware.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:32.780]   So all the software updates went out on Monday.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:37.140]   So if you have any kind of Apple device like it's not advice, it is instruction, update
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.140]   it to the latest operating system you have.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.300]   It's free.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.420]   Just take the time to do it.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.020]   The fix is already there.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:52.100]   But this was a serious enough thing that it pushed Android to issue monthly OS updates,
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.740]   Google to push monthly OS updates to Android last year.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.940]   So it's not a joke.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.980]   It's definitely something people could take advantage of.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.020]   And especially with Cisco the way they explained it, they kind of detailed how the exploit
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:08.620]   works and really now that it's publicly known, it seems like folks would actually take advantage
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.620]   of it.
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.620]   It's really updated.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:11.620]   Yeah, just do it.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:12.620]   It's free.
[00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:13.620]   It's easy.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.620]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.540]   When we come back, I want to talk a little bit about Windows.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:22.460]   We're only a few days away now from the end of the Windows 10 free upgrade in Microsoft's
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:29.540]   in one last annoying push getting even a little bit more, a little bit more aggressive
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.820]   getting you to a Windows 10.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.820]   Lots to talk about.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.540]   I got a great panel for you.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:44.260]   Mark Million from Bloomberg Business Week Bloomberg.com/tech from the Wall Street Journal, Nathan Lavera's
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.700]   Giles, and from Tech Insider at Techinsider.io, Steve Kofak.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.100]   We got a new sponsor to tell you about.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.740]   You know, actually I want to show you framing.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.140]   Have you ever done framing?
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.140]   Like framing a picture?
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.700]   Yeah, like you got a poster.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.700]   No.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.580]   No, you don't because you just put it on the wall with thumb text because you're a young
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.580]   guy.
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.580]   You're expensive.
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.580]   Oh, you're right.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.580]   They're horribly expensive.
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.940]   Unless I got a new sponsor.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.180]   My walls are just empty.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.180]   No.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.260]   But because you should put some stuff up.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.140]   I'll tell you about Frame Bridge.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:21.740]   This was actually founded by somebody who did a frame.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.740]   I think what did she have?
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.740]   She had a drawing.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.740]   What was it?
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.740]   We heard the story.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.540]   She had a poster and the frame cost more than the poster.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.580]   She said, "Well, this is gookie."
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.140]   So she started Frame Bridge, which is the easy way to do custom framing online.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.300]   And, you know, I've been doing framing of crazy things.
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.740]   Like this is, look at this.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.940]   This is a two FX motherboard framed.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.940]   That's cool.
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.940]   Right?
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.940]   That's cool.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.940]   It's not just pictures.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:47.940]   You can frame.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940]   This one I got to get reframmed.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.060]   I'm going to send this to Frame Bridge.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.060]   Look at this.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.740]   This is core memory.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.300]   Remember the old, you don't remember it, but in the old days, memory was wires around
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.140]   magnetic cores.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.140]   So motherboards make a great thing.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.140]   You got pictures.
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.060]   You can get your Instagram pictures.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.620]   They have many frames for Instagram pictures.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:12.300]   We have, I thought, since they're a new sponsor, I'm going to show you what it looks like.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.540]   Pricing starts at $39 for an Instagram.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.060]   If you've got a giant movie poster, $139.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.900]   Now, if you check the frame store, two or three times more.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.860]   So this is very affordable.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.260]   They have a happiness guarantee.
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:30.180]   They guarantee that they will give each piece personal care and attention.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.220]   If you're not happy, full refund.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.980]   So you're never at risk.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.540]   So what did I forgot what we framed now?
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.300]   I sent this away and I forgot what we framed here.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   They pulled one screenshot.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:45.180]   By the way, they package it because it's your precious thing, right?
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180]   Very well.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:51.380]   So you'll have to forgive me here as I tear into this packaging.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.980]   You know, bubble wrap and everything.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:53.980]   Oh, look at this.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.980]   This is nice.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.660]   This is a family photo that we got.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.820]   I think Lisa took this picture.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.060]   And how much did this cost, Lisa?
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.820]   It was under 100 bucks at that, right?
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.300]   It was a small frame.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.780]   So it's a small frame.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.860]   Instead of spending hundreds of dollars at a framing store, let frame bridge, take care
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.860]   of you.
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:19.180]   You call them, you can walk through it or you can do it fully online for diplomas.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.420]   I have now, I'm going to send this off next, a map.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.180]   I love it of all the undersea cables.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.660]   It's huge.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.660]   And we looked at getting it framed at our frame store.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.660]   It was so expensive.
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.380]   I said, I'm not doing that.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.660]   So we've got frame bridge now.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.940]   Whether you're looking for eclectic frames for the photos on your phone, you need help
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.060]   planning a gallery wall frame bridge as you covered.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.740]   And we've got a deal for you.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.340]   Let's get this out.
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.820]   Look at that.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.820]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.820]   Look at that.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:47.820]   It's a nice shot.
[00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.820]   Beautifully framed.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.380]   I think Lisa took that of Michael, our son and his friend Tanner, right?
[00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.860]   That's beautiful.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.540]   That was in Newport Beach.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.180]   And it's all framed.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.180]   They send you in with the kit everything you need to hang it on the wall.
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.860]   Look at even put little felt stops.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   So this is a quality framing job.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.020]   This is not a budget framing job, but it is a budget price.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.140]   They use premium real wood moldings, acid free matte.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.300]   That's important so that it won't decay the thing you're framing as the, as the matte
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.540]   decays, foam board, shatterproof acrylic glazing.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.180]   So it looks as good as glass, but less glare and it protects you from UV.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.500]   So it really protects your artwork.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.180]   Their delivery timeline is incredible.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:36.820]   They get it to you fast and you're going to get 15% off when you go to framebridge.com
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.740]   and use the promo code TWIT, 15% off your first order.

[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:51.060]   I can tell you having framed art, whether it's yours or framed photos is awesome.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.700]   And what a fun thing to do to take your Instagram photo and get a frame instantly.

[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.020]   Framebridge.com.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.700]   We welcome them to this weekend tech.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.860]   Nice to have you.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.900]   It's been a long talking about more tech news.
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.340]   Elon Musk's master plan.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.020]   He shouldn't call it a master plan.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.020]   I'm just saying.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   Why not?
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.020]   It sounds great.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.020]   It sounds a diabolical.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.980]   It sounds like he's playing up the evil genius thing.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:44.860]   He should be doing it from a, and then the blog post is master plan part duh for unknown
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.860]   reasons.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.460]   Well, he did the first one.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.460]   He was part.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.540]   Well, no, it was part one.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.540]   It wasn't part one.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.540]   It was just master plan.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.540]   Master plan.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.660]   So he did this 10 years ago, and actually I give him a lot of credit because he's always
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.860]   been very upfront about what are we trying to do here.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:04.860]   And it's not, I don't, it's not, I want to build a rocket company with SpaceX or I want
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.060]   to build a car company with Tesla or I want to build a solar panel company.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.340]   It's all about kind of looking at the future.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.020]   I really admire this guy.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:20.340]   Looking at a sustainable future for our planet, getting us off fossil fuels, getting us on
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.660]   renewable.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.140]   And in order to do that, he says we got to own all the pieces of the puzzle.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.780]   We need to move to electric vehicles.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:32.500]   We need to make solar panels everywhere.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.620]   The power wall is interesting.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:38.260]   Tesla makes a giant home battery that allows you to completely get off the grid.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.500]   You charge the battery during the day with your solar panels.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:45.220]   Which keeps your house running at night.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.500]   I think it's pretty impressive.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.820]   Now the plan also includes, and this is the most interesting thing, now we're starting
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:35:01.940]   to look forward with part D, making semi tractor trailer trucks, electric trucks, buses,
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.620]   people movers.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:08.420]   He also has in the plan the idea that you might not use your car all the time, that
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.140]   you might let others use it, kind of rent it out.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:16.660]   And for a more, like an Uber, a better some point down the line.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.220]   What do you think at all of this?
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.660]   I like it that he dreams big.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.900]   I think it, he did actually fulfill quite a bit from the original mass.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:31.140]   The original plan was we'll build a very expensive small volume car, sell that to bootstrap
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.180]   a medium expensive luxury sedan.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.180]   Luxury sedan.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.460]   That's the Model S. I don't know about the crossover, the Model X SUV.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.460]   I think that was in there.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.460]   Is that in there too?
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.460]   That's expensive, yeah.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.380]   And then the idea being to use all of that to bootstrap it, affordable Model 3.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:52.940]   Model 3, although he's in the second master plan, he did sort of acknowledge that he's
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.180]   abandoned it, because the original goal was to build a Model 3, and then keep pouring
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:04.140]   all of the inflows of cash into creating cheaper and cheaper vehicles, which he's now, in
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.180]   the new plan, he said, I think the 3 is cheap enough.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.180]   We're going to do some of that stuff.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.540]   But he's also talking about doing a pickup truck, so he's definitely looking at broadening
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.740]   the range making a real car company.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.140]   Yeah, everything he has to be electric or doesn't, and ultimately everything has to
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.940]   be autonomous.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.580]   He also, 10 years ago, said solar power.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:28.220]   I mean, that was not, now Solar City is not his, although he's trying to now buy it.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.940]   It was started by his cousins and he's on the wall.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:30.940]   He's chairman, yeah.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.900]   He's a big shareholder anyway, right?
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.140]   So it kind of is his, right?
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.820]   So yeah, I would say success in part one, it's time to start thinking about part two.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:44.100]   Yeah, there was quite a bit of trying to sell the Solar City deal that he proposed that
[00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.500]   the shareholders hate.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.140]   Why did the shareholders hate it?
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.860]   Because they feel like it's risky.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.500]   And then it's largely disconnected from building a car company.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:59.260]   Well, I think that's part of why he released part due of his master plan.
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.740]   Now, is to show like, hey, I have vision.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.820]   This is how these things tie together.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.260]   This is where it's all going.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:12.100]   And I think he's making his public argument, and especially with him coming out recently,
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.820]   saying he thinks this is going to pass by two thirds vote to approve this.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.620]   He believes that the stockholders will go for this.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:24.820]   Well, he believes that, yes, it seems, he also believes in a simulation and it's not
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.820]   real.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.820]   Right, yeah.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.820]   But he's trying to sell people on that.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.260]   This is his pitch and he's saying it's going to be two thirds.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.180]   And even if he doesn't believe it, he's trying to make it a reality.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.180]   He's trying to swing people around.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.180]   I got bless him.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:40.180]   And I should disclose I bought into this because I put a deposit down in October for a Model
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.700]   X and picked it up yesterday or Friday.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.700]   Took the factory tour.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.580]   They're already remodeling the factory.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:47.580]   They're already making.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.580]   It's a big factory.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:54.580]   They bought the old General Motors Numi plant, which has 10 times the capacity that it's
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:55.580]   using right now.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.740]   And so a lot of it's just storage warehouse.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.300]   It's empty.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.580]   But they were starting construction for the Model 3 part of it.
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.660]   It's kind of a cool plant.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:11.620]   It's all a lot of robots, a lot of big giant German and Japanese robot arms doing arc welding,
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.140]   moving the car on and off conveyor belts.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.460]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:19.820]   So I may be a little bit of a Kool-Aid drinker or what is it?
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.420]   Epinema pomegranate drinker when it comes to a Tesla.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.580]   But I love the idea.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.460]   And I have to say, you know, we have solar city panels.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.500]   I've ordered a power wall.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.140]   The idea of when I drive down the street, it's being not just zero emissions from the car,
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.300]   but zero footprint because I made the energy with the help of the sun.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.540]   I made the energy myself.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.900]   It's kind of a nice feeling.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:49.140]   And I think that this is a reasonable place to push the world, right?
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.300]   If we're going to save it.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300]   I'd like to see a little bit more accessibility.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.100]   I'd like to see them not necessarily.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.260]   Of course, ridiculously expensive.
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.260]   So I think that's a really good thing to start.
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.780]   And even though he did, like Mark said, pull back a little bit on that plan for cheaper
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:08.060]   electric vehicles, it still seems to be part of what the overall vision is.
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.140]   But I mean, I think that's super important.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:14.540]   If it's going to catch on, there needs to be no barriers based on your income level
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:19.020]   to take part in this sort of thing, which those are real and those exist today.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:25.860]   But I think the semi-trucks running on electric power is actually pretty huge because that's
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:29.460]   kind of an economic backbone.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.540]   It's something that's not going to get replaced anytime soon as far as like shuffling things
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.900]   around the country and internationally.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:42.220]   And if you can sell an entire industry on that to support electric vehicles, maybe that
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.780]   can help subsidize some of the consumer-facing business.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:52.020]   He's also really still all in on autonomy, even though there have been some negative
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.900]   headlines.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.060]   And he points out, we're terrible drivers.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:05.220]   The automotive fatalities are up 8% in 2015 to one death in every 89 million miles.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:10.380]   He pointed out very quickly that Tesla's autopilot has been death free for 100, was death free
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.380]   for 110 million miles.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.300]   So even by that measure, it's safer.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:20.820]   He says autopilot miles will soon exceed twice that number and the system gets better
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.260]   every day.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.820]   He says, consumer reports said you should disable it or at least relabel it.
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.740]   Autopilot is giving people confidence in something they shouldn't have confidence in.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.820]   He says it would make no more sense to disable autopilot as some have called for than it would
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:40.420]   to disable autopilot in aircraft after which our system is named.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.340]   And he points out it's beta.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:47.660]   And he said, we're going to keep it beta till autopilot is 10 times safer than the US
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.660]   vehicle average.
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.660]   At that point, we'll remove the beta label.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.700]   And when self-driving is approved, true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean you'll
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.780]   be able to summon your Tesla from anywhere.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.780]   Once it picks you up, you'll be able to sleep, read or do anything else en route to your
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.280]   destination.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.340]   This is by the way, people read this and they think they can do it now.
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:08.340]   And that's why--
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.340]   That's the tricky part.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.340]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.540]   Maybe shouldn't be pushing this so hard because there are people doing that.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.700]   Don't do that.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.500]   You're not-- you'll also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet by tapping
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.660]   a button on the phone app and have a generate income for you while you're at work on vacation,
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.380]   significantly offsetting at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan at least cost.
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.620]   There's a real problem right now.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.820]   We're building a lot of cars and most cars are not utilized more than 10%.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.220]   So that's a huge waste of natural resources.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.140]   The idea of sharing can make a massive difference as well.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.140]   You know what?
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.340]   Isn't it great that you have people who dream big?
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:49.540]   Well, it's not just-- to put a little reality check, it's not just Elon Musk who's thinking
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.540]   about this.
[00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.940]   I mean, he put up this cool master plan, Elon Musk.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.740]   So we kind of glorified it a little bit.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.660]   But Ford and GM and all the traditional car companies are thinking exactly the same way,
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:05.220]   especially when it comes to those services and car sharing and leasing out your own car.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.820]   So it's not just an Elon Musk thing.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.820]   I think we're a little too--
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.820]   I give him--
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.820]   Just because it's him.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.740]   I give him a little credit for stimulating this though.
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.220]   I think Ford--
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.220]   And I have some--
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.940]   He's been talking about it for a year now.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   A year.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.660]   Gee, Elon's been talking about it for 10 years.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.300]   GM bought Sidecar.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   They--
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.940]   Yeah, they once Uber took off.
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.940]   They realized, OK, car sharing is going to make you Uber.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   It was Uber.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.940]   Or the new lot Musk.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   Right.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.820]   But I think Elon-- it makes sense what Elon's saying, which is Uber is just a first step.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.540]   What you really need is autonomy.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.540]   Then--
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.540]   Which just starts to make sense.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:39.540]   --has talked about this too.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.540]   Oh, I know.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.740]   And I've talked to Brad-- oh, I can't remember his name.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.540]   --Templeton, who is an autonomous car expert.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.820]   He was one of the creators of Usenet.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.260]   He's been around a long time.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.940]   And I talked to him five years ago.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.660]   He said, none of this really lives up to its potential until you can have a car come
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:58.780]   to you when you need it and then take off when you don't need it.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.860]   That's the ultimate hope for autonomous vehicles.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:06.180]   It's not about us not driving as much as it is about a much more even distribution of
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.180]   transportation.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.780]   I think you have to give Musk a ton of credit for, like you said, stimulating, driving this
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   conversation.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.100]   It would probably be taking place whether he was there or not.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:22.500]   But a good example is that that newbie plant that was a Nissan Toyota plant.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.900]   Toyota/GM, right?
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.340]   Yeah, that he bought-- they were making some electric cars there.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.500]   And they shut it down.
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:29.500]   They pull that off.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   Very famously, right?
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.500]   Very famously.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.500]   General Motors has made--
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.980]   --seem the movie who killed the electric car.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:34.980]   Exactly.
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.420]   I mean, there are a lot of reasons why automotive companies don't want us to leave fossil fuels
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.420]   behind them.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.740]   There are a lot of reasons why energy companies, like the oil companies, don't want us to
[00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:45.060]   leave these things behind.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.540]   They're dipping their toes in the water.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.580]   They're saying this is the future of everything and they're going that direction.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:57.060]   But no one is doing just this the way that Elon Musk's companies are, which, whether
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:01.860]   or not that makes a good business sense at this point, remains to be seen.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.100]   But it's something you have to acknowledge.
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.740]   This is clearly an idea whose time has come.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.820]   And of course, many people have been talking about this.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.060]   I don't think he's sole-handedly created this.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.060]   Certainly not.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.180]   But he's one of the people who's really pushing it forward faster than anybody.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.020]   You can't say that he's not well ahead of all the other oil reactors in the air.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:27.940]   The master plan is, in short, he says, creates stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.340]   battery storage that's SolarCity+ Powerwall.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:35.580]   Expand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments, trucks, people
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:41.140]   over, develop a self-driving capability that's 10 times safer than manual by a massive fleet
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.140]   learning.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.620]   All of this, by the way, has to be bootstrapped.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.940]   Somebody has to say, "We're going to take the first steps."
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.940]   You don't get the massive fleet learning until you have a massive fleet.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:54.420]   You don't get a massive fleet until you get a few early adopters to buy this stuff.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:59.780]   It all takes somebody to bootstrap and finally enable your car to make money for you when
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.260]   you aren't using it.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.940]   The only thing that kind of scares me about all this is if we have cars that are driving
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.740]   themselves and we can sleep and all those things, no one's actually going to sleep, our bosses
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.220]   are just going to be bothering us on our phones.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.220]   That's just more work.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.220]   And making us work.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.220]   And that's the thing that's keeps me the most.
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.540]   It's right now when you're driving, you can say, "I'm driving.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.700]   Don't mess with me.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.700]   Leave me alone."
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.220]   And when this happens, it's just one more area where we're just going to, like, it's
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.380]   less time to not have to work.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.380]   So that kind of scares me.
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:28.380]   I love it.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.380]   That's true.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.780]   That's like when Wi-Fi became ubiquitous on airplanes.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.780]   It's like, "Oh, no."
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.780]   It's so horrible.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:38.740]   And to be clear, Microsoft has come out and said that they are working on some of these
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:39.740]   things.
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:40.740]   Good.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.900]   I think with four and others to make you be really productive in the car and to make
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.540]   your car more like an office.
[00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.540]   This is like real stuff.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.540]   Others, people are talking.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.540]   Make your car more like a living room.
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.540]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.980]   And Microsoft is talking about making it more like cars there.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.940]   I mean, but they're the office company.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.940]   They're the workaholics.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.540]   And they hate that future.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.180]   I hate that version of the future.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.180]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.940]   But you know that that's, to some degree, that's exactly what's going to happen.
[00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:07.940]   Exactly.
[00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:10.780]   But I think if we are safer, I think that's good.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.020]   I used to commute.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.420]   I used to have a very long commute.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:19.060]   I'd come home from tech TV, be exhausted after the screensavers have to drive an hour
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.740]   or two back to Petaluma from San Francisco.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.220]   And I was getting scared towards the end.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.780]   I was because I was getting very sleepy.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.700]   And I knew I was going to nod off someday and just plow into something.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.700]   It's not a good way to feel.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.700]   It's scary.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.340]   I had to get home. I had kids and I had to get there.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.660]   But I didn't feel good about it.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:40.300]   In fact, I was very relieved when I got fired because I thought, "Yeah, man, I just saved
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.420]   my life there because I'm not going to be making that commute anymore."
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:48.300]   If I were driving at that time, if I were driving my Model X, that thing, you don't want
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.020]   to let it drive, but it seems like it would help you an awful lot.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:59.380]   Then, you know, in stop and go traffic, particularly on the highway, I let it drive for 80 miles,
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.580]   almost 80 miles.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.900]   And it really did have performed very well.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.900]   There were a few incidents where I was glad I was paying attention.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.860]   A bag of cement had fallen into the highway.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.340]   That happens a lot here in the Bay Area.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.700]   I don't know about where you live.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.340]   There's always crap.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   Gardeners.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.180]   I've run into rakes, lawnmowers, bags of cement, sofas.
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:22.460]   There's always, for some reason, on the Bay Area highways.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.500]   So I saw the cement.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.860]   The car was driving and maybe it would have gone around it, but I wasn't going to take
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   the chance.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.220]   But enough, you have your hands on the wheel.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.460]   You steered around it.
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.380]   Then I tapped the stem twice and put it back into auto mode.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.460]   A couple of times I did that, where I didn't have the confidence it was going to do it.
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:39.460]   Probably doing the right thing.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.020]   I don't think you should necessarily assume it's going to do it.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.700]   Well, that's what they say it's at right now, is you're supposed to let the vehicle
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.340]   take over, but be ready to jump in if you feel the need to, right?
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:55.140]   But how do you maintain that level of engagement of being ready without getting complacent?
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:56.140]   Maybe falling asleep.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.140]   Well, that's what Google says.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.780]   Because if you aren't fully paying attention, it takes you a few seconds to say, "Okay,
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:01.780]   what's going on?
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:02.780]   Where am I?"
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.180]   So I don't know how I'll be.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.220]   This is the first time I used it.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.380]   In the 100th time I used it.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.380]   On a long, long drive.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.380]   On a long drive.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.260]   But I kept my hand on the wheel.
[00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:15.980]   It's kind of scary.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.700]   You don't really want to let the car do it all.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.580]   You kind of want to be there to supervise it.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.580]   I was supervising.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.500]   I imagine that's what an airline pilot's doing.
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.540]   An autopilot is landing the plane.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.620]   Not when you're flying cross country.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.380]   But when it's landing, sometimes they let autopilot land, you probably, I would hope,
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.340]   have your hand on the yoke and you're kind of paying attention, making sure.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.980]   But it's also probably scary to you because you're used to driving, right?
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:41.980]   To try.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.580]   So for those behind us, those generations behind us who aren't used to gaming, the way
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.060]   we are, they probably won't care, right?
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.060]   Right.
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.060]   They'll get used to it.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.060]   And they'll fly away to things.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.700]   Unless, I think the key is if everybody's autonomous.
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.940]   But they're still going to be cement bags in the highway, at least here in the Bay area.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.340]   There's going to be lawnmowers.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.580]   There is a lot to talk about with these autopilot crashes.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:10.700]   There's, you know, at this point, it's almost a PR war back and forth.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:18.540]   Vehicle logs, confirmed Tesla autopilot, prevented possible pedestrian death.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.780]   Their Montana accident, people are going back and forth.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.780]   Was autopilot on?
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.580]   Was autopilot not on?
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.740]   We were in the early days of this.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.060]   It's not perfect, far from it.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.260]   And I would, I for one, I bought autopilot because I wanted to see what it was like, but
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.460]   I wouldn't trust my life or my family's life to it yet.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.500]   It's going to be the default legal defense in every auto-collision.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   Cargent.
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.500]   I didn't do it.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.500]   I didn't do it.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.500]   Autopilot was on.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.500]   Autopilot.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.500]   Didn't do it.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.500]   I didn't do it.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.500]   I didn't do it.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:49.500]   I didn't do it.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.780]   I don't want to wreck my car.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.260]   I just want to.
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.740]   That's why I'm not driving it anymore.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.340]   I'm just going to leave it in the garage.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.020]   I'll be safer there.
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.940]   I'm a terrible driver.
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:06.140]   Let's take a break, talk about the blue screen of Windows 10.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.220]   Has anybody gotten that yet?
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.020]   I've upgraded all my machines, so I'm all--
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.020]   Updated.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.020]   --is 10.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:17.180]   So I think most people have updated, but there is a new-- this is the last few days
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:23.720]   of the free upgrade for Windows 10, and Microsoft wants to make sure you know they don't
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:28.900]   want to be-- they don't want to get any calls from people, and you know they will, saying,
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:32.100]   "Hey, where's my free upgrade?"
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.260]   August 1, I still want my upgrade.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   Where's my free upgrade?
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.420]   Meanwhile, before we do that, let's talk about-- well, you're pretty well dressed.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.420]   I like this shirt.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.420]   Thanks.
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:44.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.420]   It's stylish.
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.420]   It's not bad.
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.420]   It's good.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   Do you like the shop?
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.420]   Occasionally.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.420]   See, he looks like a guy who likes to shop.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.420]   Mark Millian in the other hand.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:53.420]   Not a guy who likes to shop.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.160]   I'm more like Mark than I am like Nate.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:02.480]   I don't like to shop, but I have found a way to kind of up my style a little bit when
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.320]   trunk club does the shopping for me.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.320]   Wouldn't you like to have a personal stylist who chooses-- like, I sure like that.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   In fact, I'm going to take a picture of that and send it to my stylist and say, "I like
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.320]   this."
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.640]   Summers here, maybe spruce up your wardrobe.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:21.120]   They got those fun parties, short sleeve button downs, lightweight blazers, swimwear,
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.320]   whether you're looking for beach formal attire, grown up graphic tees.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.120]   Yes, they have those too.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.880]   Trunk Club is a shopping game changer, not just for men anymore.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.280]   It's now for women too.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.040]   It's from Nordstrom.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.280]   So you know you're going to get great service, great quality clothing.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   And I love this.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.680]   It's free.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.440]   With Trunk Club, you'll never have to step foot inside a store.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.680]   You get your very own personal stylist.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.240]   You talk to her.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.840]   You give her your measurements.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840]   You tell her what you like.
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.800]   What your preferences are.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.280]   She hears she.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.040]   My kiss is she.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.400]   We'll select items from over 80 top brands.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.400]   Put it up on a website.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   You can go, "Yes, no.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.400]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.400]   No, no more of that."
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.400]   You really guide her.
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.440]   And I notice as I've gotten more trunks from her, she's really honed in.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.720]   So now the trunks, I get everything in there, something I really like.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.800]   This is the trunk.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.560]   It comes with all this great stuff.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.880]   Now I still have paid nothing.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.680]   I paid nothing for the shipping, nothing for the stylist.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.960]   In this case, I like bow ties.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   She knows that.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   She sent me some great looking.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.160]   Look at the bow tie with a mustache.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.720]   I'm definitely keeping the mustache bow tie.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.000]   That is a different pattern on the other side.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   That is awesome.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.480]   Yeah, it does double duty.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.040]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.040]   And there's some shirts.
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.400]   There's some Nate Oliveras Giles type.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.080]   You know, styling shirts in here.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.680]   I bet you'd like these shoes.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.680]   Look at these.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   They do shoes too.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   Look at these shoes, Nate.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.440]   I think this is your style.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   Actually, yeah.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.440]   You see?
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   See?
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   I've been here.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.360]   And all of this, I still have paid nothing.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   I have 10 days.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.280]   Try it on to a fashion show for your honey or whatever.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.760]   And then keep what you want.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.960]   Send the box back.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.520]   You pay only for what you keep period.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.520]   It's not a subscription.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.480]   You're not going to get another box in a month.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.840]   Only when you ask your stylist for it.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:14.240]   It's no pain, no fuss, no must.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.320]   If you live in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, or D.C., you can stop by their actual
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.600]   physical trunk clubs and meet your stylist and work with them.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.720]   That's also free.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.800]   The service, the shipping, always free both ways.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:37.640]   So to recap, premium clothes, expert advice, no shopping, no work, and no cost to you.
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.040]   I don't know why they're showing you.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.200]   No shopping, Nate.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   No work.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.840]   And you only pay for the clothes you keep.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.840]   They're great clothes.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:49.280]   You can go to club.com/twit if you want to try it.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.040]   Do go to that site that way.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.280]   You'll get a little bit of credit.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   trunkclub.com/twit.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.480]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   We loved it.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:07.240]   And for keeping me kind of snazzy, I'll be wearing that mustache bow tie soon.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:12.320]   Let me see if I can find the screen that the windows is now sending out.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:16.360]   I've actually seen it all over.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.360]   It's not it.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.360]   Let's see.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.600]   It says sorry to interrupt you.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.240]   And it's so not sorry.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.240]   There's so not sorry.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:29.400]   And it takes over the whole screen.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.720]   So there's no menu anymore.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.360]   There's no here it is.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.360]   This is the screen.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.840]   Sorry to interrupt, but this is important.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   Whatever you were doing, not important.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.040]   This is important.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:44.400]   The windows 10 free upgrade offer ends July 29th.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.320]   And there's two buttons upgrade now or remind me later a little bit over on the left.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:55.200]   There's some text that says notify me three more times, which is the masochist button,
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.200]   right?
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.400]   No, do it again.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.440]   I like that.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:05.720]   Or the one you probably want do not notify me again.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:09.880]   Now this is only going to last a few days because July 29th is the end of the line on
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:10.880]   this.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.200]   They bumbled this like every step of the way.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:15.200]   Unbelievable.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.080]   I kind of feel bad for them because there's no way they can win because they're really
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.720]   just annoying people.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:23.280]   But but they've had they've had they had the little pop up box in the right hand corner
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.880]   where if you if you check the wrong button, it would just automatically do it and people
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.080]   were like, why is my machine different?
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:34.440]   There's the other they made the change so that it would just like automatically reschedule
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   itself.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   Now there's this.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   It's all so obnoxious.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.920]   Somebody's people are still going to be mad when they can't get their free update after
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:41.920]   the 29th.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.400]   Somebody sent me on Twitter.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.120]   It's a kiosk, right?
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:50.080]   Running obviously Windows seven and the whole kiosk is non functional because it's got that
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   big blue screen.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.920]   It's that sorry to interrupt.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:00.400]   That's I mean, but people are still I mean people are going to be mad them.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.400]   And yes, exactly.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.840]   You're going to get calls on July 30th.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   What do you mean?
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.760]   Don't get the upgrade anymore.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.160]   What do you mean?
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.880]   Did you not see the 18 annoying notices?
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.120]   Did you not see it?
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   It's a mess.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.360]   It's a real mess.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.440]   It'll be it's a long national nightmare.
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.440]   It's almost.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.080]   Oh my God.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   They do say by the way that if you're using assistive technologies on Windows seven or
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:31.480]   eight point one, you will be able you will the deadline is extended, which is a good thing.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.480]   Okay.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.280]   So if you're using a screen reader or something like that, you have a little more time to
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.880]   go to Windows 10.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:43.520]   I fully believe them when they say that they are going to start charging on July 30th.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.920]   Do not like assume.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.440]   Oh, no, they just joking.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.440]   No, I think they are going to start charging.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   I think you're right.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.520]   I think, you know, for shareholders and quarterly earnings reports on stuff, they have to start
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.720]   they have to 119 dollars from July 30th onward.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:04.360]   And here's why you should do it.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:08.600]   I fully respect anybody's decision to stay with Windows seven.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:13.040]   Maybe not so much Windows eight, but I understand your decision to stay with Windows seven.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.680]   And it's your right.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:15.680]   Absolutely.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:16.680]   It's your computer.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   Maybe you have software that doesn't work.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.200]   Maybe you just like it better.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.200]   Maybe hardware that doesn't work.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.840]   But you are going to want to acquire the license, I think.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:30.160]   So that in a year or two, you at least you you're not stuck forever or you don't have
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.000]   to pay 119 bucks.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.920]   You can if you want, you could back up your machine because you don't want to take a chance,
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.760]   make a good backup of everything.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.760]   Accept the invitation.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.480]   Do the upgrade.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.280]   You in theory have 30 days to roll it back.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   If it doesn't work, well, you got the that's why you made the backup.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.320]   If as soon as you've activated Windows 10, as soon as you go to, you know, my computer
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:58:00.800]   and it says Windows 10 activated, you can now go back because you can go to Windows 10
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.280]   anytime from then on.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.520]   And I think the other reason you want to do this is I also believe, and I'm curious
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.520]   what you guys think.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:11.920]   I also believe Microsoft when they say this is the last version of Windows ever.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:12.920]   I don't.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:16.240]   You think they'll be a Windows 11?
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.560]   I mean, for the simple fact that like, you know, people are going to get tired of the
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.080]   brand and someone in marketing is like, we need to refresh things and makes things exciting.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:28.160]   And even if it's based on the same exact thing, they'll give it a new name.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.600]   I mean, that's kind of what they've been doing.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:37.400]   I mean, to be honest, Windows 7 wasn't so different from XP or NT or even Vista.
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:40.480]   It just had a different UI, but it was the same under the hood pretty much.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.160]   Yeah, we've been on OS 10 forever on the Apple side.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.880]   Now it's going to be called Mac OS.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:49.520]   It's the same operating system with iterative updates about every year or two.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.880]   And it keeps things fresh and exciting.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.680]   And, you know, they skipped Windows 9.
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.680]   They called it Windows 10.
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.320]   And they say it's the last version of Windows.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.320]   It's ever going to come out.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.920]   They're going to be updating it regularly.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:00.920]   There's going to be new features.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:01.920]   There's no guarantee.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:05.480]   Here's why I believe them when they say this is the last version.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.640]   What they say they're going to do is two or three times a year they'll update it.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.960]   So you're going to get a new version of Windows yearly or maybe even more often than that.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.680]   Just as you're getting the anniversary update is coming out roughly the same time frame
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   August 2nd, I'd say.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.960]   That's going to continue.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   I think they'll still be selling Windows licenses to business, which is the big part of the
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   profit center.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   You got it.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   It wasn't.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:36.800]   They'll still be selling it through OEMs because if you buy a new computer it will have Windows
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.200]   10 on it and they'll get whatever they get.
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.520]   We don't know $15, $25.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.680]   That's not going to change.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.560]   How many people upgraded Windows?
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.360]   I mean paid, went and upgraded Windows.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:47.880]   That's a small portion.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:52.520]   That's the only money they're losing on this if they don't make you pay.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.960]   Yeah, but there is an argument and when you look at PC sales and analysts and stuff they
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:03.640]   say that a new operating system is for some a reason to buy a new computer.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:09.440]   And with the PC market sales kind of sagging a good point however many years they're going
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.840]   to have to do something to give people a reason to buy a new computer.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:17.040]   So it might not be the name of the operating system but it might be like, "Okay, well
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.720]   this laptop is going to be able to scan your eyeballs and this one wasn't able to do so.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:25.520]   You got to get Windows 10, you know, Super Vista or whatever the hell it's going to be called
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520]   in and you know.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   Super Vista.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.760]   There are going to be reasons for you to upgrade, right?
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.760]   Or this one is the HoloLens compatible version of Windows 10 where Cortana will actually talk
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.960]   back to you instead of just listening or whatever, right?
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.400]   So yeah, I mean actually you might be right.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.000]   Here's the, here's the, this is from NetMarketShare.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.440]   This is operating system market share.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.600]   So much Windows 7.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.240]   Look at it's almost half, 49% Windows 7.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.160]   Yeah, but a lot of 10.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.520]   When 19% 10 which finally is eclipsed 8 and XP.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.560]   And XP still hang in there though.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.080]   How old is XP like 16 years old?
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:10.320]   Yeah and I think there's a lot of XP is like the Yahoo and AOL of Windows.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.800]   I think there are a lot of people with older computers that can't or won't upgrade.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.240]   There's also a lot of unintended computers and closets and running servers and things
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.680]   that people aren't going to mess with.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.320]   But of course they're huge security risks.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.480]   They're not up to XP anymore.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:33.040]   So although we haven't heard of a lot of XP exploits, not in a while.
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.920]   So maybe it is safe to run XP.
[01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.080]   I don't know.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.120]   I could see Microsoft just saying this isn't our business anymore.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.320]   Our business is not selling shrink wrapped software of any kind.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.320]   Windows not Office that used to be our business.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.760]   Our business is software as a service is subscriptions to Office 365.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.480]   It's cloud services.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.840]   We want everybody on Windows 10 so that we can make money on all that stuff.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.080]   And it's more in our interest to get everybody on Windows 10.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.000]   And if it means giving away, I don't know what percentage it is of people who upgraded
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   themselves.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.640]   But it's got to be less than 10%.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.520]   Well they had that goal to get to a billion Windows 10 devices by 2018.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.080]   Now they're saying they're not going to make it after all.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.240]   But I think that's what it is.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.560]   It's rather than you spending money on Windows or Office once a year, once every couple years,
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.080]   once every three years.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.080]   Give us a little bit of money every month.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.560]   And it makes sense.
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.960]   If you're trying to build a, if you have a publicly traded company and you want to
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.600]   show some sort of a consistent user revenue coming in, having the same amount every month
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   from a lot of people seems like a healthy business to build.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   So that's the same.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600]   Does that make sense?
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.080]   I think we've always wanted to do that.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:51.760]   You raised the really, I think, the sole issue, which is PC manufacturers.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.440]   But it's not Microsoft's job to get their OEMs.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.440]   It's not.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440]   Business is healthy.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   It's not.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:02.800]   But you know what I think is interesting and just this is just me, you know, wandering
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.560]   and thinking out loud.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.520]   And I'd be curious to see what you guys think is, you know, when you buy a laptop
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.960]   traditionally you hold on to it for four or five years, right?
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.440]   And when you buy a PC it's the same thing, whether it's a desktop, laptop, whatever.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.520]   You buy a phone, you replace it about every two years, even if it doesn't have that many
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.200]   new features, in part because the thing slows down and it doesn't work as well, right?
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.880]   So if we're moving to kind of a mobile centric world anyways, and if you're going to rob
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:35.680]   the PC manufacturers essentially of operating systems as an excuse to buy a new PC, I wonder
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.680]   if if there's going to be some more engineered obsolescence happening on the PC side for
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:40.680]   those who still buy them.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.360]   I wonder if PCs aren't going to last as long.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.000]   How do you do you just have them wear out?
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.160]   Yeah, I think they're just going to make them lousy or nobody will buy that company's
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160]   computers.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:56.920]   I think there's the same phenomenon in PCs like 15, 20 years ago, you would upgrade every
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.080]   two to three years because the new Pentium 3 was out of the neck.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.400]   But now people are holding on to them longer.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:06.600]   Well, part of the problem is that hardware is caught up with software.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.880]   You don't need a more powerful processor to run that big sluggish GUI.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.560]   Our processors are so fast now.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560]   They do everything.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560]   But that's not your own phones.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.120]   You need a new category is what you need.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.560]   Yeah, phones are catching up, right?
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:19.920]   Well, but you need a new category.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.760]   You need VR, you need speech recognition.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.080]   It needs something that's going to drive that hardware harder.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.520]   And I don't know if we've, I don't know if that's on the horizon.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.200]   Maybe augmented reality would be the one thing.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.320]   But look at the left, like look at your MacBook, which has a mobile processor and no fan in
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   it.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.280]   I'm kind of a step closer to this, this iPad Pro I have, which is a tablet.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:42.200]   And I don't think there's any expectation that I have that this iPad Pro is going to
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:46.560]   last as long as my MacBook Pro, which will last me maybe six or seven years if I really
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560]   push it.
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.640]   I mean, we're already, I think we're already kind of kind of going in that direction.
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:55.240]   And I just bought my last PC.
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:00.840]   It's going to run free PSD because I just, it's, I don't think you need a commercial
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.280]   operating system anymore because most of what you do, unless you're doing this, you
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.440]   use a few things, it's Lightroom, Photoshop.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.920]   And I think that there's good analogs in the free space for that.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:18.400]   Music maybe, but for what I do, I can do it all on a Chromebook, right?
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400]   All in these are crowds.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   That's so interesting.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   Right.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400]   And so I want 250 bucks.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:30.200]   So I've got a beast of a computer with 32 gigs of RAM with four terabytes of storage.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:34.240]   I'm going to use ZFS, so it's going to be very reliable storage.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.200]   It's a Xeon processor.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.280]   Not the latest and greatest, but it's 3.6 gigahertz with massive cache, four cores.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.680]   I can't imagine it's going to have to be a new platform.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.920]   It's not going to be that for a desktop computer.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   That's it.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.200]   It's done.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.200]   If for a visor that I walk around, yeah, a portable phone, yeah, you're still going to
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.920]   want something new.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.680]   But that's kind of the end of it.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.840]   We have reached peak PC for sure, right?
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:08.280]   Except for like animators and like those create like a very small community of creatives,
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:14.920]   you know, yeah, gamers are editors are using Windows 8 because they don't need to upgrade.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:19.520]   In fact, it would just destabilize this Adobe Premiere and Windows 8.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.080]   A lot of people are doing animation.
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.160]   They're almost using dedicated machines.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.160]   Right.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   Right.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.040]   Apple has really pretty much, you know, just abandoned that market.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040]   Haven't they?
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.080]   Well, yeah, the Mac Pro hasn't been updated in what?
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.080]   No, four years.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.080]   No.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.080]   I mean, I think the garbage can.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.080]   Yeah, let's say the Mac Pro.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.080]   Right.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.320]   It screams and it's still four years ago.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.000]   The garbage can screams in pain.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.720]   It doesn't scream.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.360]   I you want my Mac Pro.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.360]   You can have it.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.360]   I would love your Mac Pro.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.360]   Good.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.360]   I would love yours.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.920]   I'm retiring it because it's it's a sealed box.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:55.160]   It is exactly what you don't want in a desktop.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.080]   But see, I'm one of those few people who still occasionally like will open up Final Cut
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.000]   and do some video at a day.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.720]   It works very well for us in like Photoshop and Lightroom and most people don't do that.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.200]   But you can't I can't upgrade.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.880]   The only thing I upgrade on that is RAM.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   Yep.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.320]   I can't even upgrade the video cards.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.120]   And it's as sealed as an iPhone.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.720]   And the promise was that with with with Thunderbolt, you'd be able to daisy chain all these accessories.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.920]   But now everyone's moving to USB C. So that's never going to come to fruition.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.720]   You know what I'm doing with my garbage can Mac?
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.880]   I'm sir I have three Minecraft servers right now.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.200]   You should totally give that to me.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.760]   I'm giving it to Nate because I'm replacing it with a small Linux NUC.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.600]   You know, one of those little small computers, it'll do a better job is more upgradable.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.920]   And it's more reliable than running it's silly to run out as 10 as a server.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.080]   Although that's how I'm using it.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.080]   That is kind of silly.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.080]   So it's yours.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.080]   Yes.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.080]   Yes.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.080]   You should get rid of that model X to all your.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.120]   Can you talk about how useless that thing is?
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:55.120]   Oh man.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:02.080]   Actually, there is one negative and I and Elon if you're listening or anybody at Tesla,
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.840]   they block our website.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.480]   Can you mean that's all it does?
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.880]   Oh, so you can't look at it in the car.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.280]   I can go to YouTube.com.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.960]   I can go to Twitch.tv.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.400]   So it's not that they think, oh, there's video on there.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.440]   They have podcasts anyway on it.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.800]   You can't watch video on the screen, not for obvious reasons.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   You can't 17 screen, but you go to Twitter.tv says the site does not exist.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   Ouch.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.840]   And I know, I know Elon called downstairs to the fact he's like, well, you might put
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.320]   those two little little X's out there.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.000]   Make sure nobody's going to Twitter.tv.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.040]   That guy's a dick or something.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.760]   I don't know what it's blocking my website.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.200]   Is that weird?
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200]   It's super weird.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.200]   I don't know.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:53.040]   If anybody's listening to Tesla, can you please unblock?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.280]   Did you bring this up when you went on the factory tour?
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:57.040]   No, there's just robots.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.040]   This is a bunch of robots.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.440]   What are they going to do?
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:02.440]   That's all.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.960]   They had no response whatsoever.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.280]   Time to get rid of that at Model X now.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.880]   I think it's I think I'm going to give it to Nate.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   Thanks, Steve.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   What does Nate get everything?
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.720]   Because he's the best dressed.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720]   No.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:19.160]   If I could push a button and have it drive to New York, I would.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.160]   I can't.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.160]   There we go.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160]   10 years.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.720]   Do you think I wonder if the Model X will be upgraded to the point where it will have
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:31.560]   those capabilities or if I've basically bought an obsolete car?
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.500]   You can buy a car in an app and then it drives itself from North Carolina's manufacturing
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   plant here.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.680]   Yeah, that would be cool.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680]   Why not?
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.480]   Why not?
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.240]   It still won't get to tech TV, though.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.120]   I said one thing you can't do.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.000]   All right, moving right along.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.600]   Do you want to talk about Milo?
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.000]   Annapolis and Twitter.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.360]   Let's do it.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.440]   Really an interesting story.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.600]   So it goes back to Ghostbuster.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.680]   Does anybody see the new Ghostbusters yet?
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680]   Awesome.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.680]   It's good.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.680]   I loved it.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.120]   I was cracking up the entire time.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120]   I love it.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120]   So wait a minute.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.120]   You mean women can be funny?
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.840]   Believe it or not.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.600]   Why anybody, by the way, in this day and age thought women couldn't be funny is really
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.240]   beyond me, right?
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.040]   There are a lot of jerks out there.
[01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.560]   Melissa McCarthy is, she walks in the room and she's funny.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   And you know what?
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.360]   Hey, McKinnon and Kristen Wiig is funny.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.520]   Just you know, she looks funny.
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.520]   She's funny.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.520]   But Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, I think we're fine.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.320]   I hear Kate McKinnon is fabulous.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320]   She might be my favorite character.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320]   She might be my favorite character.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.800]   Oh, she's sold the movie.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:38.800]   Like it's--
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800]   And Leslie Jones is good.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.800]   She's good.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.800]   Not as good as McKinnon.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.800]   And I think that's a great thing.
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.800]   And I think that's a great thing.

[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.800]   That's a great thing.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.800]   That's a great thing.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.800]   That's a great thing.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.800]   That's a great thing.

[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:37.800]   That's a great thing.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:42.680]   I think they have a structural issue that it's very difficult to solve because unless
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.240]   they're willing to go to turn their back on anonymity, which would then break Twitter
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.240]   in some ways.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.440]   It's a unique problem.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.440]   It's a unique problem.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.400]   I don't know how-- do you guys have ideas?
[01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.400]   How would you solve it?
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.360]   Like I said, that's a great thing.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   I know.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   I know.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   Bye.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   All right.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360]   Sell to Google and see what they could do with it.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   You know.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360]   Use their machine learning or something.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:09.360]   Twitter owns Periscope, the live streaming video platform, a hate-saying platform, app
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   service, whatever.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.680]   They actually have a feature that they rolled out not long ago where they have essentially
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.440]   like a small jury.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.440]   Anytime that--
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.440]   That's an interesting approach.
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.080]   So let's say I'm hosting a video.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.160]   Mark leaves a hateful comment and you see it.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.720]   You can report it and then randomly selected.
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:30.840]   Randomly selected three other users will see it and then they can vote as to whether it's
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:31.840]   abusive or not.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:35.840]   And if it's decided as abusive, then that person, Mark, in this hypothetical situation
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.200]   would get kicked out for the rest of that session.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.160]   Or what it is is they would be banned from commenting for like 30 seconds, it's like
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.160]   they get a warning.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.840]   And then if it happened again, they get kicked out of that specific session.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.520]   They must be-- Twitter must be experimenting with this.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.000]   Do you think they're considering moving into it?
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.400]   Well, that's why I bring it up is I think they're-- you know, this is an issue on Periscope.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.960]   This is an issue on Twitter.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.040]   Twitter is their main core product and I think they might bring some of these ideas over
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.440]   across if it's successful.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.680]   But I think doing things like that, maybe banning people temporarily, you know, maybe
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:12.920]   putting them in a kind of situation where they can't interact with that other user.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:17.800]   And like you said, if you block someone, maybe not allowing them to even use your at handle.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.120]   You know, I mean, the whole point of Twitter is that it's kind of a conversation unfolding
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.280]   online in front of everybody, right?
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.200]   And when we have those conversations with people that follow us or with each other, everyone
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.880]   can see it essentially unless our accounts are private.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:35.480]   Well, if you block someone who's being hateful to you and if they have examples of an proof
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.560]   of that, you know, why not allow that person to not even be able to send you a message publicly
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.560]   using that at handle?
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.560]   You know, maybe there's--
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.440]   Well, I think it tells you-- that doesn't fix it, at least in my experience because they
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.800]   can still use other people's handles.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:48.800]   Exactly.
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:49.800]   And use your name.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:50.800]   Exactly.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.640]   And slime you to other people, which is what they want to do anyway.
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:59.840]   Yeah, but making this-- so why do trolls at this point really like Twitter a lot more
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.080]   than they like these other platforms as we brought up and we were talking about?
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.120]   You know, this stuff still happens on Facebook.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.120]   This stuff still happens on YouTube.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.880]   It seems we shut down a lot faster.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.320]   Well, YouTube's actually pretty bad.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.080]   But so why does it happen on Twitter more?
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.360]   Because it's a lot easier to do and go unchecked on Twitter than anywhere else.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360]   Right.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.120]   So if it's more of a pain in the butt to do and if it's more difficult to do on Twitter,
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.320]   they'll go somewhere else.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320]   You're going to go where it's easier to do.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.320]   You know, it's--
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:25.960]   So why do you make it harder to create new accounts?
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.240]   Maybe you have a waiting period.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.240]   You're right.
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.240]   They could make it--
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.240]   They never could get it all together.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.000]   But you can make it a lot harder for those who do that, though.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.500]   Do they?
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.480]   I like the idea of a jury of your presumably peers.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.560]   Maybe if it goes over Wall and Periscope, maybe they'll come over.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.560]   Who knows?
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:45.560]   I think that's very interesting.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:49.680]   But you know, whether they're putting enough resources into it or enough attention into
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.720]   it, I think all of us would probably say no.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.600]   But they are doing something and they are trying to figure something out.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.600]   Are they moving quick enough?
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600]   I don't think so.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   You know, it's not as if they're ignoring it altogether.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:06.200]   It's such an interesting question because on the one hand, Twitter is a pimple on the
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:07.320]   butt of the internet.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.080]   It's a boil.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.020]   And then the other-- but at the exact same time, it's also one of the best things that's
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.880]   ever happened on the internet.
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.920]   It's a really interesting-- I mean, we were-- we just heard a bad rumor that turned out
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.000]   not to be true that a celebrity had passed.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   What's the first thing you do?
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   I check Twitter.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.400]   Twitter.
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.320]   And you know, if somebody's passed, that's where you're going to see it.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.200]   And we were able to find out that that was a hoax.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.920]   Because it wasn't on Twitter.
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.920]   So that's hugely valuable.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.920]   Arab Spring brought down Mubarak in Egypt.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.680]   I mean, you can't be more valuable than that.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:43.880]   I mean, admittedly, other Facebook had a role in that in other ways.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.960]   The majority of the dialogue happening with the Black Lives Matter movement and Black Lives
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   Matter-- Black Lives Matter.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.440]   --is the hashtag on Twitter that makes it visible and viable.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:56.760]   And in a way that Facebook can't even emulate or hypotenulate.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:03.600]   I mean, the Republican candidate for president, Donald Trump, is to some degree the president's
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.560]   presidential candidate because his mastery of Twitter-- not because of his mastery of
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:08.560]   Facebook--
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.560]   He's not even running ads.
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.560]   He doesn't need to.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.440]   He doesn't have to run ads.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:17.200]   He has mastered social media.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.200]   Specifically Twitter.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.200]   More so than anything else.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.200]   More so than anything else.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.600]   Twitter has become a platform for him.
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.280]   He's on Facebook, but it's kind of minimal.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280]   Not to say.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:31.200]   You know, in fact, he's better in 140 characters than he is in 140 words.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.980]   I mean, there's just something about that medium.
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.120]   Some people are made for that medium.
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.680]   I find that fascinating.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:42.120]   So at the same time as Twitter is the worst thing on the internet, it's also the best thing
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:43.120]   on the internet.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.120]   I don't know what you do.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.120]   That's the internet as a whole.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.120]   That's the internet.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.120]   You know, that's anything.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120]   That's money.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.120]   That's guns.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.120]   That's politics.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.520]   That's-- you know, all these things are just tools that are reflections of ourselves and
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.880]   what we make of them, right?
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.840]   So let's take a break.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.080]   We're going to come back with more.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.440]   We have Microsoft quarterly results to report.
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:13.080]   Google has some numbers on government requests for user data and a victory for Google in
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.080]   France.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.040]   The last place you'd expect a victory for Google.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.720]   First a word from brain tree.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.440]   Brain tree is the place to go.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:26.800]   If you are a mobile app developer or a web developer and you want to add payments, do
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.960]   not try to write this yourself.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:31.480]   Use brain tree.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.320]   Brain tree payments makes it easy to accept any kind of payment period.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.920]   Credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Bitcoin, Apple Pay, Android Pay.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:47.560]   When the next big thing comes along, Zubat Pay or Pokemon Pay, that you can bet you go
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.840]   to your control panel on brain tree and there'll be a checkbox, you check it, and boom, it's
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.680]   part of your app and that's amazing.
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.200]   Easy to integrate.
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.040]   Just a few lines of code, iOS, Android, JavaScript.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:05.720]   It works in seven languages, SDKs and seven languages.net, Node.js, Java, Pearl, PHP,
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.480]   Python and Ruby.
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:10.280]   And of course before you use something like brain tree, what are you going to do?
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.440]   You're going to check their references.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.880]   Who uses brain tree?
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.560]   Have you seen the viable pins on Pinterest?
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.240]   That's brain trees contextual payment system.
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.240]   Amazing.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:23.840]   Have you ever used Uber?
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.160]   You take a ride, you get out.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.280]   That's it, you're done, you're paid.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.920]   That's brain tree.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.080]   And guess what?
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.480]   Lift uses brain tree too.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.640]   When you see two competitors using the same service, you know that's got to be the service.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.960]   Airbnb uses it.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.840]   Hotels tonight uses it.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.000]   For crying out loud, GitHub uses it.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   You use GitHub.
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.480]   GitHub uses brain tree.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.480]   Enough said.
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.480]   Go to braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.760]   Find out more.
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:49.760]   No late nights.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.000]   Complicated recoding.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   No stress about staying ahead of the curve.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000]   It reassures your customers too because of the great fraud protection.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   They feel better.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.120]   They've used brain tree too.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.160]   And they'll feel better.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.960]   Fewer abandoned carts.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.160]   You get fast payouts.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:08.160]   Brain tree.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:11.360]   It gives you an easy way to accept multiple payment types and easy integration into your
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.360]   app.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:19.720]   Just a few lines of code and your first $50,000 in payments fee free.
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.200]   Tell the boss.
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.680]   Tell your product manager.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.400]   Whoever makes a decision, maybe it's you.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.240]   Braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:31.640]   Do go to that URL because we want Brain Tree to know you came there because you were watching
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   Twit.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.080]   Braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:39.600]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.440]   We had a great week, fun week.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.040]   Lots to talk about.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:48.240]   And we've made a small motion picture for you to enjoy recapping the highlights.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.840]   Previously on Twit.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.280]   I wish I had a box to take this out of.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.280]   I don't.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]   This is the model X.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280]   This is the model X.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.280]   It's a double tap here.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.920]   I'll double tip this stir.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.480]   And they'll watch over here.
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:00.480]   Famous Falcon Wing.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:03.360]   I'm so excited about this.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.880]   I really am.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.440]   Twit Live Specials.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.520]   Here in the Silicon Valley, the Internet of Things and wearable technologies are two catch
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.520]   phrases.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.160]   Are we actually going to see a revolution in wearable technology and the Internet of
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.160]   Things?
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:22.000]   Here in San Jose for wearable tech conference 2016.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.320]   All about Android.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:28.200]   This week we have the flagship Moto Z's.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:31.400]   Here is the projector mod.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.320]   Snaps on perfectly on the back.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.880]   And Josh, if you want, we could try and see if we can get it with the overhead camera.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.880]   There we go.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:38.880]   Look at that.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.880]   A little cool.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.280]   The new screen sabers.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:48.160]   Michael along with others, reverse engineered the API to create a map that shows you where
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.360]   Pokemon are anywhere in the world.
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.640]   There's no public API.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:53.320]   You just figured out what they were doing.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.320]   Right.
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.320]   This is all reverse engineering boy.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   Are you a little worried?
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.080]   You're going to get a little knock on the door.
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:03.520]   We're going against the terms of service, but I don't think I'm trying to jail for that.
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.320]   And it's kind of fun, isn't it?
[01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.320]   Of course.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.320]   Twit.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.320]   Test Drive 1 today.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.600]   I mean, they'd have to redo.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.600]   Where's the microphone?
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600]   I can't out there.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:14.600]   It is.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.680]   Actually, I'm starting to come to the conclusion.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:22.200]   The VR is the 3D of 2016 like it was over hyped.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.200]   Do you think?
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:25.200]   I'm 2016.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.160]   Yeah, it's not going to take off this year, but it will take off.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.160]   Really?
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:29.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:32.640]   Well, PlayStation VR, it's not going to take over the world when it comes out, but give
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.640]   it a couple of years.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.200]   I'm starting to get the feeling that like we were all excited.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.720]   It was kind of like Pokemon Go.
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.640]   And now it's like, yeah, yeah, PlayStation VR, that'll be the test.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.840]   That's going to be the most accessible.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:50.040]   I mean, a lot, most people aren't going to buy PCs just for VR, but a lot of people
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.760]   who already have PlayStation's, millions of them.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:53.760]   My name is Tom.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:54.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:55.760]   I could be, you know.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:59.720]   We got the, we got the, you know, on the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive in the back room
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.680]   there, everybody was all excited.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.480]   It drew funny things with tilt brush and shot at aliens and do people still go back there
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.480]   and play that?
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.560]   I think it's got it.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.320]   Believe it or not.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.880]   God, this is such a depressing, but let's run this course.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:18.880]   It's over.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.880]   What's next?
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:21.880]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:27.240]   This Friday, July 29th is the last day you can download Windows 10 for free.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:31.640]   So get it or don't, but do not say that we didn't warn you.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.000]   Because who's releasing earnings this week?
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.280]   Everybody who's anybody?
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:42.200]   Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Verizon, Google, Nintendo, Match Group, Group
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.360]   on, and Samsung.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:48.280]   We will cover all of this and the rest of the tech news with Jason Howell on tech news
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:51.880]   today, every day at 4 p.m. Pacific.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.880]   That's what's next.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:53.880]   Thank you, Megan Maroney.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:56.880]   Tech news today, Monday through Friday.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.160]   We just got some really good news.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.240]   We are going to be.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.720]   You know how Amazon Echo has that update?
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.920]   You could say, "Give me my daily briefing."
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.120]   And the choice has been kind of limited.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.400]   I think Bloomberg might be on it.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.760]   Wall Street Journal's on it and PR is kind of limited.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.000]   But we just got invited to provide a tech news headline for the Amazon Echo.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   Wow.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000]   Nice.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.760]   So I think, I don't know, Megan and Jason, maybe I'll do some of them.
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.320]   I think it'll be kind of cool.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.680]   And so just be like, you talking for a minute or two?
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.480]   Here's the tech news headlines from twit.tv.
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:30.480]   That's awesome.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.480]   Close, Leo LePoyt.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.600]   Can I get you to wake me up in the morning?
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.600]   Is my alarm?
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.320]   You're reading headlines?
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.320]   You want that?
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.320]   Or you giving me a personal phone call?
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:41.320]   You need people to use me to go to sleep at night.
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.320]   Quite the opposite.
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.560]   Yeah, I thought that was pretty cool.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.880]   I guess we called Amazon and this is what it's invitation only.
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.320]   But yes, you're invited.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:58.000]   Take that test.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.320]   But you still can't get us on a Tesla.
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.600]   Google and Bing, good news.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.600]   The French court says, and after all, what we all do exactly what the French court says,
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:12.400]   the French court says Google and Bing, it's okay to have torrent searches.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.160]   This is actually kind of a big deal.
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:23.560]   Is a search engine responsible for providing you a link to what might be pirated content?
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:28.400]   The filter was requested by French, the French music industry.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:35.280]   The court High Court of Paris said that it's too broad, too ineffective.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:39.800]   And this is so, boy, I'm surprised to hear them say this, but would target legitimate
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.400]   content as well just because it's on torrent.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   Yep.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:49.000]   Because this bit torrent doesn't mean it's pirated music.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.400]   Who would have thought that France would be more progressive on the internet censorship
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   issue than the UK, for example, which still has the right to be forgotten?
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.560]   I hope that the US music industry pays attention to this.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.480]   Obviously, it doesn't carry any weight in the US, but it would be nice if they kind of
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:11.400]   there's always been this kind of thing like, well, shouldn't Google not allow searches
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:13.720]   for stuff we don't like?
[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:16.400]   I don't think you want to get Google in that position.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:22.840]   No, yeah, forcing them to censor or making them censor on behalf of, you know, anyone,
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.640]   much less major corporations isn't really like a good look.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.800]   So I'm kind of actually about this.
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:35.320]   French courts have used French's intellectual property code, their DMCA, to force Google
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.520]   and Bing to make pirate sites disappear.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.720]   But in this case, the court said, no, it's just not going to happen.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.640]   We're not going to block all torrents, just because you say so.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.480]   Do you guys think this is maybe a little bit of a recognition that BitTorrent itself?
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:55.200]   I mean, you know, torrenting is really a type of technology, but BitTorrent, the company
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.080]   behind all this attack, they're trying to go legit.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:02.760]   I mean, you know, they have they have their sync apps to share files.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:05.760]   They have their shoot app to share photos.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.040]   They have bleep their messaging app.
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.840]   I mean, they're trying to turn themselves into a legit company.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.360]   And I think that's an acknowledgement that not all the stuff that's on their service is
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.360]   bad.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:17.400]   I think they even have a music service now, which I forgot the name of.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.840]   I think this has been Bram Cohen's strategy to kind of re resurrect the name.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.440]   So, yes, BitTorrent news this week.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.960]   In fact, they streamed the Republican National Convention.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.280]   I think they're going to do the same next week with a Democratic National Convention.
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:36.200]   Did anybody watch BitTorrent live, watch the live stream?
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.520]   My friend was the host.
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:39.520]   You're kidding.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.800]   Oh, Justin Young, he was one of the hosts.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:45.040]   So they did their own commander the entire time.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:46.800]   They did their whole coverage, their own coverage.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.800]   It was really cool.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.800]   I mean, it was very offbeat.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:54.760]   My buddy was dressed up as Charmander walking the floor.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.080]   That was him.
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.040]   Really old college friend of mine.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.040]   That's funny.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.240]   He was having a blast and I can't wait to see him do the DNC.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.320]   You know, it's kind of offbeat and fun and definitely cajos to the kind of person who
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.960]   would be paying attention to BitTorrent's news network.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.760]   So yeah, it's great.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:14.840]   I'm really happy for them.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.320]   That was Justin Robert Young.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:19.320]   Of course, I know who he is.
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.320]   Wow.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320]   It's good for Jerry.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320]   Jerry is.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320]   It's good for him.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.240]   So he was my editor in chief at my college paper a million years ago.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.320]   Well, of course, he hosted a show on this network for a long time.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.320]   Yep.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.320]   NSFW.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.320]   Wow.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.320]   That's it.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.000]   I should have if I had known Jerry was going to be hosting, I wouldn't have watched.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.200]   That's offbeat.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:45.840]   So they, of course, you can get a pool feed of the convention going on, but it looks like
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.440]   they were doing a lot more than that.
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:53.720]   Yeah, they're doing man on the street stuff and just gags and all that kind of thing.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.360]   I was 12 hours of coverage a day during the convention.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.560]   Are they going to do it again next week?
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.560]   Because that's what I'm watching.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.560]   I think he's going to be there.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.800]   Fantastic.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.880]   So how do you watch it?
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:11.400]   So on the internet, you can watch it on the web.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.880]   Yeah, I think it's a YouTube channel.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.400]   But I think they also have, if I'm not wrong, I think they have an app for Apple TV, right?
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:20.000]   I'm not sure.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.240]   There is a bit torrent app for Apple TV.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.240]   I don't know if that.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:27.920]   I definitely know there's a YouTube channel and they have only a couple hundred followers
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.760]   at the time I looked earlier last week.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:30.760]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.600]   It's on iOS and Apple TV.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.360]   And their music service, BitTorrent now.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:35.360]   Right.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360]   So yeah, they really are reinventing themselves.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:39.360]   And on the...
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.680]   Is BitTorrent now just like Spotify or...
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.680]   No, what it is is independent artists can put...
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:43.680]   It's all indie.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:46.880]   You can put stuff up there and then you can get it from those specific artists.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:49.200]   You can make it free.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.200]   It's pretty neat.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:51.200]   We're...
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.000]   The BT Live were one of the networks on BT Live.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000]   Okay.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.120]   So you could watch Twitch streaming on that.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.560]   That's also on Apple TV.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:05.080]   So they have two apps now on Apple TV and Fire TV and there's a Mac version.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.120]   Live streaming video powered by people.
[01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120]   I love this.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:12.960]   I mean, we used BitTorrent in the very earliest days to distribute the shows because we didn't
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.800]   have bandwidth deals with cash fly.
[01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.800]   And we asked...
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.600]   We would ask people to watch the show where you want to seed.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.600]   Okay.
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:22.800]   We'd take a download a copy and you can seed and we would have seeders and that's how we
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.800]   got the show out.
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   It's awesome.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.040]   That's always our fallback strategy.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.800]   If we lose our bandwidth deals because it's expensive, bandwidth is very expensive.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:37.160]   I mean, it's good because it's actually useful technology that they have and making it more
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.800]   accessible and using it in different ways.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.080]   And it's good for them because it's not pirated content.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:42.080]   Exactly.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:46.280]   And it's just a lot of them shield that reputation of just people sharing things that are stolen.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:48.280]   So they don't...
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:50.080]   I think that they don't use bandwidth.
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.080]   It's all pirated content.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.080]   It's all pirated.
[01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.480]   So it costs them nothing in bandwidth.
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.920]   They just create the content.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.720]   It's interesting they're doing a YouTube live channel.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.120]   I mean, that's not exactly using BitTorrent technology, is it?
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.120]   But it's getting that name out there in a different way, right?
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.760]   It's good for Steve's buddy in the Charmander suit.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:09.920]   I didn't know that was Justin Robert Young.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:11.920]   You couldn't really tell.
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:12.920]   He saw a beard.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:15.840]   There are better shots of him.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.720]   He was kind of masked out there.
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:21.920]   The best one that he's walking the floor and just talking to, you know, RNC delegates.
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:22.920]   It's really funny.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.640]   I mean, you know what?
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:26.800]   Political convention is so wild.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:27.800]   They probably...
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800]   Are you trying to look normal?
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.800]   It's like, oh, yeah.
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.920]   You must be one of the dinosaur Trump supporters.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.160]   It's so funny.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.680]   Wow.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.280]   Why not bring Pokemon to the conveyor?
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:45.920]   Well, I can't wait to watch him do it tomorrow.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.520]   Let's see here.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:48.520]   Quarterly results.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.360]   Microsoft Q4 results.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.360]   It's really...
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.880]   We're watching the transition of this company.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.600]   It's very interesting.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:01.400]   Office 365 subscriptions, 23 million.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.160]   A very strong quarter thanks to cloud.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:13.000]   Your new HR, CRM platform dynamics, Azure products and services.
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.840]   They made money on the hardware division too, Surface.
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.520]   Not so much on the phone part.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.440]   Yeah, that's been in a nose dive.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.440]   Not so much there.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.080]   In fact, they didn't even report phone numbers, which tells me probably bad.
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:28.520]   They've been reporting it all along.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.840]   Yeah, now we're 4% now, we're 1.5%.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.080]   I think it's probably close to the software.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.320]   They also don't report Xbox sales.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.480]   They take that out, do they?
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.480]   They stopped after...
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:38.480]   Yeah, they used to.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.480]   They used to.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.480]   They used to.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:44.280]   They stopped because they were getting their butt kicked by PlayStation.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.680]   Rightly so?
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.680]   I think so.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:48.480]   I love my Xbox one.
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:49.480]   No.
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.680]   PS4 is where it's at.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:52.880]   You're both PS4 ors?
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.800]   I had it Xbox one, but I got rid of it because...
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.840]   Real gamers are PS4 users, aren't they?
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.080]   I don't want to get into real gamers and fake gamers.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.520]   There's just more games that I wanted to play on the PS4.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.760]   Outside of Sunset Overdrive.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:05.760]   Which is awesome.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.760]   Which is great.
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:07.760]   And then Halo.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:08.760]   Fun, Halo.
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.840]   I wasn't using my Xbox one, so I got rid of it.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:16.240]   And I mean, there's not a qualitative difference.
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:19.120]   Most of the games are on both now.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.120]   No man's sky though.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.120]   Will that be...
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120]   That's the one I want.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.120]   That's just PS4.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.440]   Yeah, no Xbox.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.920]   Come to the dark side, Leo.
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:27.920]   It's gonna be great.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.440]   So I can hold Xbox one?
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.440]   I'll take the Tesla.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.440]   Keep the Xbox one.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:34.360]   Alright, Chris, I'm gonna give it to him.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.640]   And the reason I am is because I ordered stupidly the new Xbox, which comes out August 2nd,
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.640]   the Xbox One S.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.720]   Can we talk about what a rip off this is?
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.960]   They have the one S coming out this year.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:48.520]   They have Project Scorpion, another new Xbox, supposedly Xbox One coming out next year,
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:51.000]   with even more graphical horsepower for VR.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.920]   They're trying to sell us a new Xbox every year.
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.920]   I don't like this.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920]   I do not like this.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.280]   You don't have to buy it?
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:57.280]   I'm not gonna.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.280]   I mean...
[01:43:58.280 --> 01:43:59.640]   Look if you have a player of games.
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:00.640]   350 bucks every year?
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:01.640]   Get the hell out of here.
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.080]   The S is the same.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.080]   I guess it can be 4K.
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:09.880]   It can do 4K streaming video, not 4K games, but it can do 4K Netflix.
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:12.960]   But I don't have a 4K TV, so that's a big deal.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   It looks way nicer.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.960]   It does look flimmer.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.640]   It's a lot smaller, it's like a third decide.
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:24.320]   The old Xbox One on my really terrible looking TV console looked like a big ass old VCR.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.320]   I hated that thing.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:28.160]   Alright, Chris, I'm gonna give you the old Xbox One when the new one comes.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:29.480]   You want it?
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.640]   Why don't you have an Xbox One?
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   You're a young person.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.640]   You have a PlayStation.
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:35.280]   Son of a...
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.200]   Do you want an Oculus Rift?
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.480]   Are you giving stuff out of this?
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:44.480]   We got them all.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.480]   We got them all.
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:46.720]   Well, I feel like you've been left out.
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:48.920]   I'm not giving you anything, Steve, 'cause you're in New York.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.600]   It's like Oprah Winfrey today.
[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.600]   This is great.
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.600]   But I...
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.640]   Well, so here's the problem.
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.960]   I got an Oculus Rift.
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:59.240]   I bought an Oculus Rift, and then they said, "Oh, and you're getting one for free 'cause
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.640]   you supported the Kickstarter."
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.640]   So it's in the...
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:04.640]   You have a computer that can run it, though.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:05.640]   That's the problem.
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.640]   See, nobody does.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.640]   No.
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.000]   You have to have this ridiculous machine.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000]   We reported a few months ago that there are more PS4s in the world than there are computers
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000]   that can run.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000]   Oh, easily.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000]   Oculus.
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.200]   It was something like only only one percent of all PCs.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.200]   Yes.
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.200]   Are you taking it out of the box?
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.200]   No, because...
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:26.480]   Oh, my God.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.480]   But I can't give it to you 'cause you can't use it.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.480]   I would love to have it.
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:30.480]   Yeah, I have a computer.
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.480]   Take it and sell it on eBay.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:32.480]   I'm a genuine, generous...
[01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.480]   You can run it.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.480]   Oh, my God.
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.040]   When's the new studio opening up?
[01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:39.040]   Not long.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:40.040]   Less than a month.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:44.360]   So actually, I should mention, this is the fifth anniversary of the day we moved in here.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.360]   Oh.
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:46.360]   Five years ago today.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.360]   Look at that.
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.920]   You may remember we were in the cottage down the street.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.920]   We had a parade.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:54.640]   Look, John's wearing a shirt that commemorates this date, 72411.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640]   Very cool.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.000]   We were way down the street.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.760]   We had a little parade marched up the street to the new studio.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:02.240]   Was everybody carrying a box?
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.360]   Yeah, everybody has to carry one box.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:06.880]   And then we moved to the new studio.
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.400]   We've been here five years.
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:11.040]   Unfortunately, we've been here so long.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.040]   Two restaurants have gone out of a business tech store.
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.800]   So there's that.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:20.640]   But the new restaurant next door decided they want this space for it to make a brewery.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.480]   So they want a big vats.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.440]   So they sold the building of these guys.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.440]   That's great.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.880]   And we thought, "Hey, here's an opportunity to..."
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:31.960]   You've got to redo the place every once in a while.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.960]   Things wear out.
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.680]   So we're moving across town to a smaller...
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.600]   But the studio wise would be the same, but it's a little bit smaller facility.
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.960]   We don't need all this room.
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:42.600]   We don't need a 10,000 square foot basement.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.920]   Because all that was was incentive for staff to sleep down there.
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:51.400]   I said, "We started to find secret..."
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.840]   Like, they called it the no-hole.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.520]   And then another Robert and Brian that created this secret plate room down there.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.840]   And then I think there was a bean bag down there.
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:06.000]   People were camping out on.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.880]   I think Burke was actually living there for a while.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.280]   So we didn't really...
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.760]   Allegedly, I might have.
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:15.680]   We didn't really need all the space down there.
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.680]   Sounds like a good move.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.680]   I think just to get the nests out downstairs, we're going to bring a flame thrower in after
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:22.680]   we move on.
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:23.680]   Napalm it.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.680]   Napalm it.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.680]   Scour it, clean.
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:27.680]   But the new place is nice.
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:36.080]   So what we're going to do for people watching, the last show here will be August 21st.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.240]   So we're going to do...
[01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.240]   It's going to be a...
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.240]   Obviously, the transition can't be instantaneous.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.520]   Well, it is going to be instantaneous, but it's going to be a little tricky because we
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.640]   have to move everything over there.
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.800]   So we're going to move it piecemeal.
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.520]   We'll have one last...
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.720]   My office will be the last to go.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.440]   I'll do a radio show in the office on Sunday.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:59.520]   The new screensaver Saturday will do a special version that will record at the new studio.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.680]   It won't even be done yet, but we'll record it over there.
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.120]   No audience for that, sorry.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:10.080]   You can come here to watch the tech guy on the 21st, but at that point, instead of doing
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.360]   Twit here on that Sunday, we have rented a cable car.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.880]   And I understand we're putting in tracks because...
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:20.280]   But we have a cable car and we're going to all get in the cable car carrying one...
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.280]   Everything carries...
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:22.800]   Everybody carries at least one box.
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:24.200]   We get in the cable car.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:28.240]   We drive over to the new place and we'll do Twit on August 21st from the new studio.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.160]   So that's why basically I'm giving everything away.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:36.280]   Because that's one less box we have to carry.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:39.760]   So that's the story, Morning Glory.
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.840]   I don't know why I got into that.
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.640]   I can give you a mug.
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.120]   Take a mug.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.800]   We give you a mug.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.880]   How many bobbleheads are left?
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:56.760]   We bought out the bobblehead market.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:00.320]   And I think maybe we have a few too many bobbleheads.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:03.600]   Good news for Microsoft, another legal case.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:12.920]   Remember Microsoft had email servers in Ireland and they went to court saying, "We don't
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:15.160]   want to turn that information over to the US government.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:17.480]   It's offshore."
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.080]   Court said, "You're right.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.920]   I thought they were going to lose this for sure."
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:24.120]   I thought they're just fighting it so they look...
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:29.800]   Microsoft looks like they care because they do obviously.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:30.800]   So the government...
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:32.520]   Well, this is another court.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.520]   I'm showing another story.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.760]   But the government said, "Yes, that Irish server is off limits."
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:42.280]   However, it's not all pie and skittles.
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:47.480]   The US says there's no legal basis for the government to be required to tell Microsoft
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:57.320]   customers when it does intercept email, which I very much personally do not like this at
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.320]   all.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.320]   This is a...
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.640]   You know, there's a kind of...
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.960]   Encoded in the Constitution is the right to face your accuser.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:04.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:05.960]   Right?
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:06.960]   I don't know which amendment that is.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:07.960]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:08.960]   Give him a bobblehead to come.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:13.320]   I didn't mean right now in the middle of the show, but okay, there's your parting gift.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:14.320]   Congratulations.
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:15.320]   You don't have to take the bobblehead.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.320]   That's why I don't have a car.
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.320]   You don't need a...
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:22.600]   It's not exactly a plastic Jesus, but...
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:23.600]   Anyway, uh...
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   What?
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:25.600]   It's terrible.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.600]   You can see my legal self.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.600]   Plastic Jesus.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.040]   No, I said it wasn't.
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:32.040]   It wasn't.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.040]   Okay, got it.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.600]   I didn't say it was.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:37.680]   I said it was not.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:38.680]   Anyway.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:39.680]   Throw it away.
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.680]   We don't want it.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.480]   Oh, I didn't mean to offend you.
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:46.480]   It's okay.
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:47.480]   I just have it.
[01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:49.480]   It's a lovely bobblehead.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.680]   No, you don't want it either, Nathan.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:52.680]   Trust me.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.680]   No one wants it.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.280]   That's why we have a surplus.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:58.520]   Seemed like a good idea at the time.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.160]   Uh, yeah.
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.160]   What is it?
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:02.760]   You have the right to face your accuser, right?
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.040]   So if the cops want to come search your place, they need to warrant...
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.320]   They need to tell you about it.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:13.200]   If you go, you know, to court, someone says you're committing a crime, you have the right
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.960]   to know what that crime is and who's accusing you of it.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.560]   If someone sues you, get to know who's suing you.
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.520]   Leake tells me in the chair, it was the Sixth Amendment, quote, "In all criminal prosecutions,
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:26.920]   the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him."
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:33.720]   Now, if the witness against you is your own email, but it does seem like you should all...
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:37.040]   It's not specifically laid out, but you should also have the right if somebody's going after
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:39.160]   you to know that they're going after you.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:42.480]   But in fact, the Patriot Act is very clear in this.
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:48.600]   Not only does Microsoft not have the requirement to notify you, they're not allowed to notify
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.600]   you in many cases.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:55.640]   If you get a national security letter, one of the stipulations is you can't tell anybody
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:59.040]   that you got this national security letter.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:05.280]   It'll be interesting to see how this plays with that other thing you're talking about
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:06.680]   with where the...
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:07.680]   Irish.
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:11.880]   Yeah, where the government basically found that.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.800]   If data is being held in servers overseas, in this case in Ireland for Microsoft, that
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:22.080]   Microsoft doesn't have to give the information on those servers pertaining to users to the
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:23.080]   government.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:27.640]   But as all this is happening, the Obama administration is negotiating with lots of other governments.
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:29.760]   They just get the Irish government to do it.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.760]   Exactly.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:33.400]   So they're all working on these issues.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:38.680]   It'll be interesting to see how these overlap because if someone else is government in Europe
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:45.240]   or Asia or Africa or something has to notify you and they're doing it through them, is that
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:46.240]   going to be a loophole?
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:50.160]   Are there going to be ways to get around these things?
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.160]   So the...
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.160]   Let's see.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:53.160]   Was it the ninth?
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:54.160]   No.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:53:02.480]   Second Circuit ruled that a warrant issued under a very specific section, Section 2703
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:07.800]   of the Stored Communications Act, cannot compel American companies to produce data stored
[01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.280]   in servers outside the United States.
[01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.200]   So they ruled that on July 14th.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.600]   I could go to the Supreme Court.
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:18.200]   This is not necessarily definitive.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.620]   But that's a...
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:25.160]   By the way, they'd lost all the way up to this point Microsoft continued appealing and
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:26.160]   won this.
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:27.160]   This is a...
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:32.120]   From a 2013 case where a New York District judge issued a warrant asking Microsoft to
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:37.800]   produce all emails associated with an account hosted by Microsoft, even though the emails
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:43.600]   were stored in Dublin, one of Microsoft's centers, data centers in Dublin.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.820]   Microsoft did provide the US-based account information but would refuse to turn the
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.720]   Irish emails over.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:52.960]   They lost in court in 2014.
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:59.680]   They appealed, lost again, and they appealed a third time to the Supreme...
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:03.160]   I'm sorry, the Circuit Court and won.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:04.360]   See what happens.
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:09.760]   It's worth noting that a lot of times things are intercepted as data is being transmitted
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:13.400]   so it's not just about what's on the servers, like all the Snowden NSA links and stuff
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.400]   like that.
[01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:18.400]   And in those cases, the United States government was working with foreign governments, especially
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.400]   in the UK, to share some of that data back and forth.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.760]   And so it's like, hey, you do some snooping for us.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:25.200]   We'll do some snooping for you.
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:26.200]   We'll show you...
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:30.480]   It provides all these battles to protect every vehicle they have to obtain information.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:31.960]   They're never going to give up on anything.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:34.200]   What they have 50 other ways to get this information.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.200]   Exactly.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.200]   Exactly.
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:41.560]   At least with this one, though, this is about what we get to know about as users.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.440]   I mean, the secret agencies are always going to be operating in secret, but this here is
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:50.680]   whether or not we have the right to be told by the companies when the government requests
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:54.680]   it from them, which is a little different when they're intercepting it along the way.
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:00.560]   And so to me, I view this one slightly different and not everyone would agree, but I think
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.240]   it's important to know just in the same way that if someone wants to search my apartment
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.240]   they need a warrant.
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.800]   I get to know who's about it.
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:11.800]   But yeah, we'll see how this all shifts out.
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.480]   Google's Transparency Report.
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.720]   This is one of the reasons many companies now are doing these transparency reports just
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:17.800]   to at least let you know.
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.360]   They can't tell you personally that you're being investigated, but at least that you know
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.480]   that there are these investigations going on.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:29.960]   The request for user data, according to Google, hit an all time high in the second half of
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.800]   2015.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.240]   These are governments, not just the US government, governments around the world.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:39.000]   40,677 requests for data.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.680]   Google, in many cases, fights them as much as they can.
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:48.360]   That's up 18% from the half year prior to that.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.240]   So you know, they're asking.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.200]   Most of the requests did come from the US, 12,523 requests.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:59.120]   And by the way, that impacts 27,000 users or accounts.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:05.040]   Because many of these requests have multiple users, multiple accounts.
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:07.240]   So we're going in that direction.
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:13.040]   You know, one of the ways I'm responding to that is more and more investigating ways
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:19.800]   of keeping my data off the public internet, but using my own private server.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:24.600]   I think for email, I think for-- I'm looking at replacing the entire Google Cloud.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:30.200]   I don't mistrust Google at all, but Google has no ability to fight the federal government
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:31.200]   anymore.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:34.800]   And like you said, a lot of times, a lot of times they're not even able to tell you,
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.760]   even if they wanted to, right?
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.920]   And if you guys want to be on my private server, you can.
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:44.800]   I'm using-- I'm going to use something called Sandstorm, which is highly encrypted.
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.400]   It'll be on my server in my house.
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:49.800]   And that's what we're going to use for.
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.840]   And Sandstorm allows you to use ad apps.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.480]   There are a lot of apps.
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:57.760]   I'm going to replace Evernote.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:04.160]   For instance, have an Evernote-like notebook app that is web accessible from any device,
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:08.720]   including my mobile phones, but encrypted traffic and encrypted storage.
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:11.880]   Where are you backing up?
[01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:12.880]   That's a good question.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:13.880]   I haven't decided about that.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:14.880]   Clearly, backup is going to be important.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.320]   You can do an encrypted backup.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:21.800]   So if you do an encrypted backup, I could store it somewhere like Dropbox that the government
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:25.600]   had access to it, but at least all they would have access to is--
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:26.600]   The encrypted files.
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:27.840]   --by encrypted files.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.280]   So I'm installing this later this week.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.440]   It's as much of an experiment as anything else.
[01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.840]   Can I replace commercial clouds with a private cloud?
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.840]   It looks like I can.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:41.200]   I mean, they have email servers.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:43.120]   It's all plug and play.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.160]   They have Dropbox-style file servers.
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:50.600]   It's really an interesting open source project called Sandstorm.
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:52.760]   You see the setup?
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:53.760]   Very easy.
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:55.280]   You need a Linux server.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:59.560]   They have a setup script and you're pretty much done.
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:05.720]   You can use them for dying DNS because most people don't have a static address in their
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:08.400]   house, so it may float around.
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.080]   I actually have Comcast Business Class Service, so I have a static address.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.920]   You can also use them and their certificates to do HTTPS, although I'm going to buy.
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:19.200]   By the way, not a small cost.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.560]   It's several hundred bucks a year.
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:31.880]   You need a wild card SSL cert for your site, but I think, again, it's an experiment, but
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.600]   it'll be, I think, an interesting experiment.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:34.600]   They have a lot of apps.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:39.280]   Apps are easily ported to it.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:43.320]   They're processing spreadsheets, drawing.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.320]   Like I said, Evernote.
[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:49.160]   They've got some games, CRM.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:50.320]   You can do a lot of stuff there.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:58.840]   You can have yourself hosted Git or Mercurial repositories, wikis, websites.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:58:59.840]   Quite a complete thing.
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:02.040]   I think it's very, very intriguing.
[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:04.480]   Looking forward to seeing what your thoughts are once you've actually tried it.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:06.240]   Yeah, I'll let you know.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:14.040]   I'm kind of a family server, so I invite my friends and family to participate.
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:15.040]   Let's see.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:16.040]   What else?
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:18.080]   I'm going to take a break and we'll come back.
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:26.760]   We'll have some of the final thoughts, including the case of the cute Internet star who wants
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:28.440]   your password.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.440]   This is a...
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.600]   Did you read about this?
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:32.080]   I haven't read the story yet.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:38.520]   It is a fascinating publicity stunt.
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:40.120]   And I'll tell you more about it in just a second.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.740]   But first, a word from our sponsor, audible.com.
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:46.160]   Audiobooks are my lifeblood.
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:51.320]   If I discovered Audible in 2000, I actually started listening to audiobooks even earlier.
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:55.800]   It used to be you'd get a box of cassettes, like 30 cassettes, and you'd have one month
[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:56.800]   to listen.
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:01.240]   And if a cassette jammed, oh, you'd have to send it back and wait.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.240]   And Audible came along.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:03.240]   Digital downloads?
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:04.240]   Wow.
[02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:05.240]   What an idea.
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.240]   This was before the iPod even.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:08.160]   They had their own audio player.
[02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:11.160]   And man, Audible has grown by leaps and bounds.
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:17.920]   More than a quarter of a million downloadable titles, books, but also performances, periodicals,
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:19.320]   all sorts of stuff.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:23.640]   Of course, all the best sellers now come out in audiobookformonaudible.com.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:26.600]   They offer foreign language instruction.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:29.200]   The Pimsler series, for instance, is normally very expensive.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.760]   You could be have that.
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.840]   Foreign language audiobooks as well, if you want to study a language.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:35.840]   They've got the great courses now, great.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:42.400]   The best college professors teaching everything from physics to game theory to history.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.680]   It is the ultimate resource for audio.
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:50.840]   And I want you to get two credits, which will give you two books for free right now.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:54.600]   You go to audible.com/twit2.
[02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:56.840]   The only challenge is picking two.
[02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:59.480]   But I think you'll be able to find something.
[02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:03.360]   Great science fiction, both classics and modern sci-fi.
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:06.520]   I'm listening right now to a really fun time travel.
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.520]   I like time travel.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:08.520]   I don't know why.
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:14.200]   Connie Willis' "Doomstay" book just finished the Elon Musk book by Ashley Vance.
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.640]   Fascinating story.
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.720]   The Steve Jobs biography.
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:22.280]   Several Steve Jobs biographies are on there.
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:26.040]   Dan Lyons' hysterical book about his life in a startup.
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:27.200]   Disruptive.
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:28.200]   He reads it.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:29.200]   I love Dan.
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.680]   It's all unaudible.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:32.320]   So pick two books.
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:34.040]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:35.640]   You'll be signing up for the Earth's Disruptive.
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:37.800]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum Plan.
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:38.800]   That's two books a month.
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:43.280]   You also get the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:47.760]   So you can listen to Nate's stories every day.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:51.640]   Now the key thing here is this is a 30-day free trial.
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:53.360]   So you have 30 days.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.360]   No cost to you.
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:55.600]   Cancel any time.
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:57.320]   In that first 30 days you'll pay nothing.
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:59.720]   You're going to get to keep those two books.
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:02.040]   So pick something fun.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.040]   Pick something you're going to enjoy.
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:04.040]   Oh, money ball.
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:05.280]   What a great book that was.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:06.280]   I love it.
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:07.280]   You know what?
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:10.760]   Annie Michael Lewis' book would be awesome.
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:13.120]   He's just one of my favorite authors.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:17.480]   He writes nonfiction, started writing about the stock market.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:20.880]   He just his book on robo trading and flash trading.
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:23.160]   It's called Flash Boys.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:24.760]   Real eye opener.
[02:02:24.760 --> 02:02:27.800]   John Hodgman's got his books on there too.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.080]   Audible.com/twit2.
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:33.280]   Two books free.
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.480]   Offer good in the US and Canada.
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:39.120]   And if you're not in the US or Canada, you should still try Audible.
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:40.680]   They're all over the world.
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:44.320]   Audible.com/twit2 we thank Audible.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:47.240]   They've been supporting this show for before we moved.
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:50.880]   I think almost a decade now.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:55.200]   This is a weird story about, and I don't know who he is, Jack Johnson.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:01.000]   He's a Vine star, I guess, and a performer.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.440]   Last week he told his 4 million Twitter followers, 4 million not bad.
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.720]   Send me your password to your Twitter account.
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:17.440]   Tens of thousands of fans did.
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:20.680]   By the way, hashtag hacked by Johnson.
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:26.840]   And then what he did is he would post a personal message on your Twitter feed as if you did
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.840]   it.
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:30.600]   Video, a song.
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:33.640]   This is brilliant.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.920]   This is like using Twitter in an amazing way.
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:43.680]   What amazes me is that these young people gave him their password, but they obviously
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:44.680]   trust him.
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:50.720]   The example of a video he sent one young fan, let me see if I can see.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:57.440]   He said, "This song is for you."
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:00.160]   Now how much would you pay?
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:04.640]   Would you give him your password to get a personal song played just for you?
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:06.160]   I don't know who this guy is.
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:08.200]   You've got to be one of his fans.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:10.000]   You must not be his target demographic.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000]   No.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.640]   The power of Vine is a may.
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:14.840]   I mean, these Vine stars are...
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:17.320]   So were people DMing him or were they doing this publicly?
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:20.120]   No, they'd say, "Oh, I hope they would DM him."
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:21.560]   He would send the password.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.560]   And then what he would do is he would go into your account and he'd read your tweets.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:31.600]   He'd learn something about you to do a personalized video.
[02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:35.840]   Like one fan, he said, "Our picture in your icon is cute as hell.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.400]   He changed her icon to him and her."
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:43.040]   Oh my God.
[02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:49.480]   This person sent her password to him at least 50 times until a mysterious new video popped
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:50.480]   up in her account.
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:52.760]   16 seconds of Mr. Johnson.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:55.680]   I love how the New York Times calls him, "Mr. Johnson.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:58.600]   Sitting at the keyboard," he said, "We just saw it.
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:04:59.760]   What's good, T?
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:02.200]   I just wrote this one for you."
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:06.760]   Now she knows that that actually is not an original song because she saw it on Instagram
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.600]   the night before, but she still got little something.
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.960]   Should I start doing this?
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.040]   He is awfully cute.
[02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.840]   You want to watch another one?
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:17.280]   You got to be 12.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.520]   You got to be 12.
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.040]   Brady, Brady, what's good baby?
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:22.040]   How you doing?
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:24.480]   Our picture in your icon is cute as hell.
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:25.480]   Oh my God.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:26.480]   Was that Cleveland?
[02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:27.480]   I don't know.
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:28.480]   But anyways, we look good.
[02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:30.480]   Damn, we could be a couple maybe.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:32.440]   But seriously, I hope your summer is going great.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:33.960]   I hope everything is going great in life.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:38.160]   Well, this is called retail fan cultivation, right?
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.200]   Yeah, he's reaching out to his fans.
[02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:41.960]   If his fans are...
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:43.360]   It's authentic, it's real?
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:44.360]   Yeah.
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:45.760]   I mean, that takes a lot of time.
[02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:51.200]   It's kind of surprising that he put the effort into doing that for people, but word of mouth.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.240]   I'm sure it's blowing things up.
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.240]   Amazing.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:56.480]   You know, reverberating across the interwebs.
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:00.920]   Softbank buys arm $32 billion.
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.880]   Should we talk about that last week, didn't we?
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:03.880]   I can't remember.
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:04.880]   It happened last Sunday.
[02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:05.880]   No?
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:07.320]   Yeah, I wonder how Intel feels about that.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.160]   Oh man, Intel's just got burned.
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:11.160]   Huge deal.
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:12.160]   Intel's just got to be scared.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.160]   I don't think Softbank...
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:15.920]   I think this is more of an investment than they say they're not going to move arm out
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:16.920]   of Britain.
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:18.400]   They're going to let the staff stay.
[02:06:18.400 --> 02:06:19.400]   Got a good thing going?
[02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:20.400]   That makes sense.
[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:21.400]   Yeah, why not?
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:22.400]   That's usually how Softbank operates.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:24.040]   They don't intervene too much.
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:25.040]   Right.
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:26.880]   Like with Alibaba, they mostly left them alone.
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:27.880]   They own Sprint.
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:28.880]   What they do is they give them cash.
[02:06:28.880 --> 02:06:30.840]   They say here, do what you're doing.
[02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:31.840]   You're going to...
[02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:32.840]   What?
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:37.760]   I admit, $32 billion is not a small amount of money, but you're buying the future.
[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:40.160]   You're buying every smartphone uses an arm.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:41.760]   And they're betting on the Internet of Things.
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.760]   It's a big part of it.
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:44.760]   IOT.
[02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:45.760]   Huge.
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.080]   So it's cash, by the way.
[02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.080]   Must be nice.
[02:06:51.080 --> 02:06:53.840]   You've been kind of wondering at this point, maybe Apple should have done this.
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.960]   They have the cash to do it.
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:58.880]   And it is, by the way, overseas money, which Apple, always looking at...
[02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:03.440]   Apple can't spend all that money it has in the US because most of it's offshore, but
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:05.240]   they could have bought an English company.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:09.440]   Yeah, they just made that $1 billion investment in D.D.
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:10.440]   Right.
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:12.040]   The Uber of China.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.040]   That's right.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:16.080]   So they're looking to put some of that money to work.
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:17.440]   Apple is going to make...
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.800]   Okay, we talked about Pokemon Go.
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:21.040]   I don't know if there's a new angle.
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:22.480]   This is a new angle.
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:24.920]   Apple, of course, is...
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:28.840]   Anytime you buy anything, any in-app purchase Pokemon Go, Apple gets a third of it.
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:33.040]   They stand according to a GSM arena or somebody.
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.880]   They stand to make as much as three.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:41.120]   Actually, it's a banking firm, Needham & Company analyst there says, "3 billion in revenue from
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:43.240]   Pokemon Go over the next year or two."
[02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:44.240]   Three.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:46.200]   I'm skeptical about that number.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:47.200]   Well...
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.200]   I mean...
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:49.200]   Do you think it's going to die out before then?
[02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:50.200]   Is that why Steve?
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:53.400]   I mean, they did confirm...
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:58.720]   Apple did confirm this week that it is the most popular or most downloaded app in its
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:01.200]   first week in the app's history.
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.360]   Keep in mind it was only available in two countries that first week.
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:05.360]   U.S.
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:06.360]   Three.
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.360]   U.S. New Zealand and Australia.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.080]   So, I mean, use that.
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:11.280]   But I don't know.
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:15.240]   I feel like this is going to die out before they can generate that much revenue.
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:17.360]   Clearly, it's not going to maintain this velocity.
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:19.440]   But this game has some staying power.
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.760]   People played Ingress.
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:23.000]   Many people continue to play Ingress.
[02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.920]   That was a much less accessible game with very similar mechanics.
[02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:29.720]   I could see this going for a while.
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.720]   I've never seen...
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:32.800]   Have you ever seen anything like this?
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:33.800]   No, not in...
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:36.160]   You know, there's the candy crushes in the...
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:37.160]   Yeah, the differences.
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.640]   People have to go out to play this.
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:39.640]   So, we don't know.
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:41.280]   You know, people are playing candy crushes inside.
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.880]   You don't see mobs.
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:43.880]   Yeah.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:46.920]   They just opened in Japan on Friday.
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:47.920]   Big deal.
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:51.080]   Big money deal too, because McDonald's made a deal.
[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:54.040]   This is where you're going to make the big money in Pokemon Go.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.920]   McDonald's outlets will be Pokey stops.
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:57.880]   Yeah.
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:00.760]   So, I mean, if you're a small business, you put a lure on a...
[02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:05.200]   You're starting to see that Starbucks and others put lures on Pokey stops nearby.
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:06.200]   Come on by.
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:08.680]   Have a cup of coffee and capture some Pokemon.
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:09.680]   You're seeing it everywhere.
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:11.480]   Yeah, we did a...
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:18.200]   We talked about small businesses, some of which did the same strategy of buying lures
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:19.600]   for Pokey stops.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:25.440]   One pizza shop in Brooklyn said they spent $10 on lures and sales increased 30% on one
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.440]   weekend.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:29.320]   It has to be something that people who are playing Pokemon would...
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:32.040]   Oh, hey, let's get a slice kind of thing, right?
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:35.560]   You're not going to sell refrigerators that way.
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:39.120]   But if you're out there wandering around catching Pokemon, you might get hungry.
[02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:40.120]   You might get thirsty.
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.120]   It makes sense.
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.120]   Yeah.
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:43.120]   I don't know.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:45.000]   I think there's a big upside to Pokemon Go.
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.080]   It made Pokemon, which by the way, Nintendo doesn't have anything to do with this, really.
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:51.880]   They just own the Pokemon...
[02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:53.240]   They own part of the Pokemon company.
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:54.240]   One third of the Pokemon company.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:55.720]   They own a third of the Pokemon company.
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:59.160]   They invested in Niantic when they spun off in Google.
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:00.160]   Did they?
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:01.160]   Yeah.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:03.600]   So Google's a shareholder, Nintendo and Pokey on.
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:07.840]   But a double Nintendo share price made them more valuable than Sony.
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.840]   Yeah.
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:09.840]   Holy cow.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:12.000]   Did Nintendo say this week that they're not going...
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.360]   I mean, they came out and admitted ahead of earnings that they're not going to make much
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:18.400]   money if anything off of this?
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:19.400]   You know why?
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:20.400]   I think that's true.
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:21.400]   Yeah.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:22.400]   And I think that's true.
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:25.560]   Hey, guys, just to clarify, you guys are getting geeked out over this for nothing.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:26.560]   I think there's like...
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:33.640]   I'm not sure that the investors are doing this wholly based on the expectation of this
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:37.240]   game generating a lot of money, but it's a very recent thing.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:41.800]   Like a year ago that Nintendo said we're going to finally do mobile and have smartphone
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:42.800]   games.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:49.440]   And I think this is like the first indication that Nintendo's intellectual property is extremely
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:52.000]   valuable and will translate to mobile.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.240]   So I think investors to some extent are betting on when they do this for Mario and Zelda and
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.720]   some of their other properties that it could have a similar effect.
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:07.160]   Hopefully they do that because right now the only games that are confirmed are Animal Crossing
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:09.280]   and Fire Emblem, which are pretty niche.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:12.480]   Oh, and then they have the me thing that you build your own me character.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:15.720]   But so they don't have the Mario's and Zelda's out there yet.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:18.480]   So hopefully that comes soon and we can see what it looks like.
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:24.520]   It validates that the intellectual property of Pokémon is valuable in that by itself.
[02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:28.760]   I mean, if they're not reaping the value today, that shows that at least Nintendo is not a
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:30.320]   shell or something there.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:32.680]   Yeah, well, there's a ton of nostalgia to tap into.
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:35.280]   There's cross-generational fans.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.560]   A lot of people grew up with Nintendo properties, Pokémon, Mario, all that good stuff.
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:43.520]   So it makes a ton of sense.
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:49.560]   And with the way Hollywood's going and everything, they want to tap into franchises.
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:50.560]   They want to make films.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:51.560]   They want to do TV shows.
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:54.640]   And they just sold the rights to Pokémon Movie to Legendary.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.640]   There you go.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:57.400]   There you go.
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:58.400]   It's not going to--
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:11:59.400]   A live action.
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:00.400]   It's a live action.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.400]   It's a live action.
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:02.400]   Yeah.
[02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:07.000]   Oh, maybe Justin Robert Young could star as Charmander.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.800]   Justin Robert Young is Charmander.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:14.640]   Oliver Stone was a Comic-Con to promote his new movie about Snowden, which will come out
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:15.640]   this fall.
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:21.800]   He says, "Pokimongo is a slippery slope to totalitarianism."
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:24.200]   I know some old farts who believe the same thing.
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:30.160]   He says it's surveillance capitalism.
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:31.960]   It's not funny.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:37.160]   He says, "It's the latest sign of an emerging phenomenon in which citizens willingly surrender
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.280]   their privacy to corporations which then profit off it."
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:45.680]   You'll see-- I should do this in some sort of curmudgeonly voice.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:51.920]   You'll see a new form of frankly, a robot society, Stone said.
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.440]   I call it totalitarianism.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.440]   All right.
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:02.360]   I mean, well, you know, corporations making money off of people's private data, well,
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:04.760]   that's what Google, Facebook, everybody does.
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.160]   That's kind of the entire thing.
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:14.600]   I mean, he might be on one bleeding edge with his viewpoint, but he's not entirely wrong,
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:15.600]   per se.
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:17.880]   You can have my Pokemon going.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:21.680]   You pride out of my cold dead fingers.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:25.680]   And you know, sure enough, when Pokemon Go first came out for iOS, they were asking for
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:29.520]   access to people's entire Google accounts, which they patched up about a week after.
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.040]   Yeah, they weren't too sure that.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:32.040]   It was a mistake.
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.240]   But it just shows how much people will give away, not even knowing, because they want
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:38.800]   to play the hot new thing.
[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:39.800]   You know?
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:41.080]   What are you giving away?
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:42.080]   Your location.
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:43.080]   Big deal.
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.000]   What are they going to do with that?
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000]   You worried?
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.840]   Sell you slices of pizza in this case.
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:52.120]   Sounds like a good deal for me.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:53.600]   I'll take it.
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.560]   No, I completely understand people's concern about that.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:58.560]   Well, if they had access--
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:04.320]   But most of the things that are interesting and new about the internet are going to involve
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:11.920]   some degree you giving up some information, whether it's the internet of things, Siri
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:19.640]   or Cortana or Google Now, you're going to have to give some company some information.
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:24.600]   That's why Apple is so challenged to figure out how they can compete with Google and Microsoft
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:28.440]   and other companies, because they say, "We're going to protect your privacy," but that means
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.520]   they can't do Google Now, right?
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:34.960]   Yeah, their services can do a lot less because they know less about you.
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.120]   And that is simply the trade off.
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:40.120]   I mean, part of the reason why Google is so useful at telling you when your package is
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.760]   coming or when your next flight is or making a prediction on where you want to go next
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:49.040]   in Google Maps is because they keep track on all of those things, like where you go and
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.280]   where you might want to go.
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.600]   I understand people's concern and really what the best thing you do would be a way to some
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:59.040]   sort of explicit way to say, "Well, I'll give you this if you give me that."
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.840]   But I think it is implicit.
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:04.480]   If you use Google Now, the implicit trade is I'm going to give you information for something
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:05.480]   useful.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.400]   It maybe should be made more explicit.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.320]   Maybe there's a dollar value to it.
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:15.160]   But for me, this goes back to when you give a company like Google or you give Facebook
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:17.720]   that information, you're getting a trade for that service.
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:23.520]   Some people fully understand what they're giving away, some don't, but that's the transaction.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:27.440]   And then we get into those issues of the government asking companies for all of that
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.280]   data and then using that in different ways that people don't necessarily think about.
[02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:35.360]   As soon as I can do my Pokemon Go home server, I'm going to do it.
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:36.360]   There you go.
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:37.760]   My encrypted Pokemon Go home server.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:39.440]   A couple of quick stories.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:41.040]   It's not the Dollar Shave Club anymore.
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:48.160]   It's the billion dollar shave club Unilever buying Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion.
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.040]   Nice work if you can get it.
[02:15:50.040 --> 02:15:51.840]   Does anyone think they overpaid?
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:54.360]   They're doing a couple hundred million revenue.
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:55.360]   They weigh them.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.360]   Some like 40 million subscribers.
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.480]   I love what Ben Thompson wrote about it.
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:00.480]   You probably read it Leo.
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:02.920]   Did you read his post on?
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:04.200]   No, tell me about it.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.200]   On Stratecary?
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:08.120]   Stratecary, I mean, he had a...
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:10.720]   Stratecary is H's new site.
[02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:11.720]   Stratecary?
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:12.720]   What did he say?
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:13.720]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:19.920]   Basically, they created this environment where people were buying Dollar Shave Club razors
[02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:25.080]   and not Unilever razors, so Unilever had to pay what they needed to pay to get it.
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.440]   To kind of get them out of the business, right?
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:28.440]   Yeah.
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:29.440]   Now Unilever...
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:31.280]   Procter and Gamble owns Gillette.
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.280]   What is...
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:33.280]   Does Unilever own Shave?
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.280]   They don't.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:35.280]   No, they don't have anybody.
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:41.120]   But they own like old Spice and Max and a bunch of like these cool, you know, young
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:42.120]   guy brands.
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:43.120]   Right.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.120]   Yeah.
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:45.120]   So now they're getting into the Shaver market.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:47.280]   Are you old enough to think Max smells like crap yet?
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:48.280]   No.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:49.280]   Just checking.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:51.720]   I think it's an age thing.
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:55.800]   I think you hit an age 25, 26 where you realize that stuff smells horrible.
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:57.360]   I mean, it smells like bug spray.
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.360]   Yeah.
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:16:59.360]   Okay.
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:00.360]   You're old enough, obviously, but Nate...
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:03.760]   Well, for the body wash, but for my cologne, I like Aquadigio.
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:04.760]   So...
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:05.760]   Oh, you smell good.
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:06.760]   Yeah.
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:07.760]   Yeah.
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:08.760]   So...
[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:09.760]   Aquadigio, what's that?
[02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:12.160]   It's something expensive at Nordstrom that I think smells really good.
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:13.160]   Okay.
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:14.160]   But...
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.160]   Not Axe.
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.160]   Not Axe.
[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:17.160]   Oh, you're saying it does look good.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.160]   I think I'm going to watch those pretty...
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.160]   It smells good.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:20.160]   Yeah.
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.160]   My son still wears Axe.
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.160]   I don't understand that.
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.160]   Just like a...
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:24.160]   What are you wearing?
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:25.160]   You know what?
[02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:29.400]   If you're in high school and you know, you got a $10 an hour job or maybe nothing at all,
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:30.400]   then...
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:31.400]   It's cheap.
[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:32.400]   You want to smell fresh?
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:34.400]   It keeps you insect-free.
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:35.400]   Win, win.
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:36.400]   Win, win.
[02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:39.400]   No bugs on you, my friend.
[02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:40.400]   No flies on you.
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:45.240]   Opera sold to a Chinese company for $600 million.
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:53.000]   And the last VCR was manufactured this week.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.760]   Goodbye VHS tapes wherever you are.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:56.760]   We still...
[02:17:56.760 --> 02:18:01.440]   Do we not still have a VHS rental store down the street here?
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:03.640]   Is it a silver screen video, right?
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:05.760]   They've gone to DVD.
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:07.840]   Even silver screen video went to DVD.
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:09.000]   All right.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.000]   For a while.
[02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000]   For a while.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.680]   Until recently, you could rent a VHS tape there.
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:17.440]   Do you guys think that VHS will overcome back the way that vinyl records and cassettes?
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.640]   No one's nostalgic for VHS.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.640]   You know what I think?
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:26.280]   Well, because there was a new video that I think...
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:29.080]   I can't remember who it was.
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:30.080]   But there's a new music video.
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:35.600]   It's done in a VHS style, so it's a box and it has the messed up colors.
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:39.520]   I mean, probably not, but there's some of it there.
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:41.520]   It's an Instagram filter.
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:43.240]   Yeah.
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:47.560]   By the way, I don't know if you saw Bernie Sanders tweeting during the Republican National
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:50.600]   Convention, but a number of people noted that not only...
[02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:51.600]   Oh, that was crazy.
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:54.600]   Bernie's got a VHS tape in it.
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:55.600]   Yeah, Bernie.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:56.600]   There you go.
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:02.040]   But come on, let's face it, Bernie's the kind of guy you'd expect to have it.
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:04.640]   VHS with a tape in it.
[02:19:04.640 --> 02:19:06.120]   It's good technology.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:07.120]   It still works.
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:09.000]   I'm not throwing it out.
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.520]   You know, I was just streaming an episode of Rick and Morty yesterday.
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:13.520]   There you go.
[02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:17.960]   And Hulu started buffering on it and it froze on me.
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.520]   And I was just sitting there thinking, it reminded me of when I had to rewind the VHS
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:23.240]   and I'm like, "Why can nothing work?"
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:25.680]   Like this is the same problem I had with VHS tapes.
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:28.960]   There's the same issue of like dis-skipping and like freezing on me.
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:32.720]   Now I'm sitting here and watching streaming, which is supposed to be the answer.
[02:19:32.720 --> 02:19:33.720]   It's not better.
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:35.080]   Hulu freezes on me.
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:36.080]   The same...
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:38.640]   We can't build anything that works.
[02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:39.640]   We're at a time.
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.880]   I'd love to talk about kick-ass torrents, a site shut down with help from a lot of companies
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.280]   you know and love like Apple.
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:49.240]   Federal government moved in.
[02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:50.240]   Actually they were...
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.240]   Where were they located?
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:53.640]   Where was kick-ass located in Europe, I think?
[02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:54.640]   Yeah.
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:20:00.280]   But of course it was the US rights holders that managed to shut down the largest bit
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:02.960]   torrent site in the world.
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:03.960]   But you know what?
[02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:04.960]   You could shut them down.
[02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:05.960]   They shut down Pirate Bay.
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:06.960]   Put them in jail.
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:07.960]   I think they...
[02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:08.960]   They wouldn't pop up.
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:17.520]   They'd just back within a day on some other server somewhere else.
[02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:18.800]   I think we're done.
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:20.280]   You guys have been very patient.
[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:22.400]   Was that all the weak in tech?
[02:20:22.400 --> 02:20:23.640]   No, we didn't use.
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:24.640]   No, my God.
[02:20:24.640 --> 02:20:25.640]   We have so much more.
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:28.520]   But I think we just run out of time.
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:32.560]   I mean I can't keep you more than two and a half hours.
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:33.560]   I think there's a rule.
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.560]   I think it violates a Geneva convention.
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.840]   I got nowhere to go, Leo.
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:39.840]   Didn't you say you have a cot downstairs?
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:43.120]   He's waiting for something better than an oculus rift.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:44.120]   Mark's moving into the basement.
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:45.120]   A bobblehead.
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:48.800]   I keep trying and tice him with blandishments.
[02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:49.800]   That's Mark Millian.
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:54.840]   You'll find him at Bloomberg Business Week, Bloomberg.com/tech, and he's on the Twitter
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:57.040]   at Mark Millian.
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:00.200]   I've known him since he was knee-high to a grasshopper.
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:04.720]   Actually, how old were you when you started on this show when you were 21, 22?
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:05.720]   Pretty young, right?
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:06.720]   Yeah.
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:07.720]   You're only at like 22.
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:08.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:09.720]   LA Times.
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:10.720]   The kid.
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:12.480]   Back at the cottage.
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:13.480]   That's right.
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:14.480]   The cottage.
[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.480]   My how you've grown, Mark.
[02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:18.240]   They grew up so fast.
[02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:21.040]   Nate Olivera's Giles, great to have you for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:22.680]   What are you covering these days?
[02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:23.680]   Consumer tech.
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:24.680]   Oh, nice.
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:29.160]   Yeah, so if there's any gadget and app news or reviews, I'm doing those, but also looking
[02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:32.560]   a lot of privacy issues and trying to help you avoid those pitfalls.
[02:21:32.560 --> 02:21:36.080]   So take a look at WSJD and you'll always see good stuff on there.
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.080]   Love it.
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:38.080]   Yeah.
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:40.800]   And your Nate OG, the old school Nate on the Twitter.
[02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:42.000]   That's Nate OG.
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000]   Yep.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.040]   Great to have Stephen Kovac as well.
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:48.760]   Steve, you're a fun, great guy, senior correspondent.
[02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:54.480]   Techinsider.io at Stephen Kovac, K-O-V-A-C-H.
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:56.720]   I Steve Kovac, I'm sorry, K-O-V-A-C-H.
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:59.160]   Either or you got a boss?
[02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:00.160]   You got a boss?
[02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:01.160]   You can call me whatever.
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:02.160]   You got a boss?
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:03.160]   Oh, no.
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:04.160]   You can call me Stephen.
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:05.160]   I mean, by--
[02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:07.160]   I'm just available now in case you want to.
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:08.160]   I just grabbed that.
[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:09.160]   Yeah.
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:10.160]   Grab it.
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:12.160]   It's the only reason I don't leave Twitter is I'm afraid somebody will take my handle
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:14.080]   and be nasty with it.
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:15.240]   So I'm just going to stay there.
[02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:17.280]   I don't care what you say.
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:18.280]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:24.720]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Sunday night if you're
[02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:28.680]   in Europe, 2,200 UTC.
[02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:29.680]   Please join us.
[02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:33.040]   We love it when you watch live or visit in the chatroom at irc.tv.
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.040]   But of course, we don't require that.
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:37.440]   We're on demand everywhere.
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:39.000]   Start at twitter.tv, our website.
[02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.880]   That's where all of our shows begin, unless you're driving a Tesla, in which case use
[02:22:43.880 --> 02:22:50.200]   iTunes or Stitcher or Slack or Google podcasts or we're everywhere.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:51.200]   And subscribe.
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.640]   Make sure you don't miss an episode.
[02:22:52.640 --> 02:22:55.840]   If you want to be in the studio, and as I said, it's going to be a little tricky on the
[02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:57.880]   weekend of August 20th and 21st.
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:01.720]   But if you want to be in the studio before then, come see your brick.
[02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:03.000]   That's at twitter.tv.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.440]   After then, come see the new studio.
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:06.440]   Same address.
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:07.440]   Tickets at twitter.tv.
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:08.440]   Thanks for being here.
[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:09.440]   We'll see you next time.
[02:23:09.440 --> 02:23:11.440]   Another tweet is in the can.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:12.440]   He's amazing.
[02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:13.440]   He's amazing.
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:14.440]   I'm on the Twitter.
[02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:15.440]   Do on the Twitter.
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:16.440]   Alright.
[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.440]   Do on the Twitter, baby.
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:18.440]   Do on the Twitter.
[02:23:18.440 --> 02:23:19.440]   Alright.
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:20.440]   Do on the Twitter.
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:21.440]   Alright.
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:22.440]   Do on the Twitter.
