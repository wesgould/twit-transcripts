[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 68 for September 10th, 2006.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Shabby!
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Visa.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Safer, better money.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Life takes Visa.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And by Dell, check out Leo's picks at twit.tv/dell.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   It's time to Twit, and that means time once again to join together in the holy matrimony,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   the highest level geeks in the industry, starting with Patrick Norton, who's back from
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   DLTV and places unknown.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Patrick, it's good to talk to you again.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   It's good to be back.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Things have changed, you know, we're officially a Twit podcast network.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Wow.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   That's official now.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   What does that mean?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It means we've got ads, we've got banner ads, we've got a new podcast coming this week.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   We've got a law podcast and we're going to get Paul Therott to do a Windows podcast.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So it's kind of now really a network.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I think my idea was until you have a dozen podcasts, you don't really have a network.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Now people can listen all day all day.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Also here from the Great Britain, the Great Britain, from the UK, from Oxford, it's Will Harris of bit-tech.net.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Great Will Harris from Great Britain.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Great Will Harris.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   AKA Nick.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, thanks, Dad, on that.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   People are mad because they don't call you Nick anymore.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Honestly, some people sent me emails saying, "Call him Nick."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Well, somebody asked me the other day why my name was Will with what I had to give my geeky answer.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Which is?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Well, when you're a kid and you're playing arcade games, there's only three letters for your high score, right?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That is a geeky answer.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Unfortunately, she wasn't very impressed with the answer.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   So I didn't give very far.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   My real name is Leah Paul.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And I just shortened it to three letters for the same very reason.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Corey Doctorow has the same problem.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   We'll call him Cor.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Corey Doctorow from Boing Boing, and he's now a fellow.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Hey, Corey, it's good to talk to you.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Hey, where again you see?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   USC.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm actually the Fulbright Chair at USC, the inaugural Canada US Fulbright Chair, Annenberg, Center for Public Diplomacy.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Damn.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And having an eight-letter surname, I had a built-in Unix login.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Oh, you did, didn't you?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I did.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Very easy.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   L-A-P-O-R-T-E.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I'm just a short, shy letter, unfortunately.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Corey's actually joining us on an emergency basis because WIPO is about to do something semi-evil
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and doing it, then they're doing it tomorrow.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So we thought we'd get them on today to talk about it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   How's this different from every other week with WIPO?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well, it's true.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   WIPO is really interesting because WIPO is attempting to regulate broadcasting on the internet or,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   you know, multimedia on the internet.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And they have meetings sort of every six months.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And that six-month interval is enough for the technology to be completely reinvented between each meeting.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so all the rules they've been planning for the last one become even more nonsensical in respect to the next one.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Nicely done.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So there's--
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So let's just--
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   A little background, WIPO is the World Intellectual Property Organization.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   UN chartered.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Originally, the idea was for the nations to get together and kind of make a--
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Which makes sense.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   A global policy for copyright and trademark and patent and all of that because, after all, it's a global economy.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Unfortunately--
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Actually, hang on.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Hang on.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   That's not why they were put together.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   No.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   They had been an industry association whose job it was to promote that.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And what happened was they went to the UN and they said, you know, knowledge goods, copyrights and patents
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and trademarks, they're really important to humanitarian efforts.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And what you need is a humanitarian agency to do humanitarian work in respect of knowledge goods.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Then, of course, they got a UN charter and threw out any kind of notion of being a humanitarian agency
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   and just worked on making more and more exclusive rights for the corporate members that had started it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It was really a Trojan horse to get them a UN charter.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Totally.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Absolutely.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Absolutely.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And who is-- now it's changed a little bit, I know, through your efforts and efforts of other NGOs.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And NGOs, but initially, who were the WIPO members?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So the WIPO members are the countries, of course.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And then there's a bunch of non-governmental organizations.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And in WIPO's context, that usually men organizations like the National Association of Broadcasters--
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   All right.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   --the RIAAA, the MPA, the British Photographic Industry, IFPI, and so on.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Basically, it was a bunch of groups that worked for organizations that made a lot of money by having monopolies
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   granted to the government who would get together and talk about whether or not more monopolies would be good.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And unsurprisingly, the answer was always yes.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Right.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   They have a really healthy emotional relationship with their regulatory monopolies.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So what's the latest in the WIPO dance?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So the latest in the WIPO dance is something called the Broadcasting Treaty.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And under the Broadcasting Treaty, we would get a new set of rights that would go to people who weren't creators,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   it would go to people who are disseminators of creation, so broadcasters.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So normally, if you found something on a broadcast program and you wanted to reuse it,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   you'd have to go to the copyright holder, or in the event that it was in the public domain,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   you would just reuse it.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Or if you had a fair use right to it, you could reuse it.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Or if it was Creative Commons license, you could just reuse it.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And under this regime, even if you have the copyright right to use the work,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   you still have to go to the broadcaster and get the broadcast right to do it.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   So the broadcaster gets a 50-year monopoly on what you do with the stuff the broadcaster sees.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So let's say some broadcaster in the sense essentially being a middleman
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   between the creator of the content and the auditor, the listener of the content.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Just by transmitting the broadcaster now is getting some rights to the original creation.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   That's right.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So say there was a public domain movie, right, an old 1920s movie, and Fox put it on the air, right?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Well, normally that just doesn't belong to anyone because it's in the public domain.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Or say they took some footage off of C-Span, which is in the public domain,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   because everything the government makes in the US is in the public domain.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And so theoretically you could just record it and do what you liked with it.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Right.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Under the broadcast right, actually Fox would get 50 years worth of monopoly over how you use that information.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Now what if I taped it from another source?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   They don't insert it right to that.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   That's right.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's only if I got it from Fox.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Only if you got it from Fox.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Would they have to prove that that's how I got it?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Yeah, although in the case of Fox, they're sitting on the 20th Century Fox vault.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   So in fact, they might have copies of the only public domain copies of works.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   But you know, there are other examples.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Fox is probably a good thing to stick with here because you know, there was just this movie, Outfox,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   this documentary about Fox.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And this guy using fair use, he made all these recordings off of Fox and put them together in a documentary
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   to show how Fox transmitted information.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Couldn't do that anymore.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Well, you might be able to, but it would have totally different fair use.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So you would have to go to a lawyer and say, "Well, okay, tell me first of all, is this a fair use under copyright?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And secondarily, does this also happen to fall into fair use under broadcast right?"
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So it's really complicated.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   But you know what?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   At the end of the day, it's TV.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And I'm not a TV guy.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And much as I think this would be dreadful for TV, it's not the thing I worry about.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   What I worry about is the internet.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   And that's where it gets really sticky because there's an attempt that's been put forward by Microsoft and Yahoo.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   They've got an industry association there to extend this to the web under something called the webcasting right.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And the idea here is that if you host audio visual material or audio material,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   that you would get a 50-year monopoly over what people who downloaded the material from you did.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So AOL hosts the content in Twit.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Twit might be Creative Commons licensed or copying a bit of Twit might be a fair use
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   or you might put some public domain stuff in Twit.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   That doesn't matter because AOL would get to tell people who received copies of the Twitcast
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   what they couldn't do with it.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And the internet is full of Creative Commons licensed podcasts and podcasts that take from each other and make new stuff.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So that's where it starts to get really dangerous.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Now these guys, they're trying to like make this only apply to simulcasts from TV and stuff.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They keep shaving the definition of what a webcast is to try and just fit it into the TV box.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   The problem is that, as I said, between every meeting, the whole world is reinvented.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Every six months, we get a whole new kind of podcasting.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Ben Hammersley came up with the word podcasting what, 20, 21 months ago?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   This was basically invented yesterday.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   These guys have been at the treaty for seven years.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   By the time it's ratified, it'll be five years down the road and they're going to freeze and amber tomorrow.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   What the definition is of a broadcast, what the definition is of a podcast, and podcasts will then get a ceiling.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   That'll be the podcast will have to be what they are today and could never evolve into something new tomorrow because these guys will have set the limit.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Well, it would behoove. I would imagine podcasters like us to make sure there are other ways to get our podcasts.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Well, you see, yeah.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   That would be one of them.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Having them downloaded through.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Well, I mean, if we get it through AOL, or we offer it through AOL, if we offer it through another channel, you could always say, well, I got it through the other channel.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Yeah, but you know, that's great until you want to design something like, you know, the guys who scrape podcasts and get a lot of stuff.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   They scrape podcasts and index them.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Right.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   At that point, you've got something analogous to Google, right? They scrape web pages and index them.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Except the difference is that Google doesn't have to send a lawyer letter to every website it wants to make a copy of before it makes an index.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, if we do that, we're using podzinger.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now is something we're launching also this week to index all of the audio on the whole network.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And so they would now, they would have to say, oh, Jesus, we have permission from, not just from me as the podcaster, but from AOL.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   From AOL.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And for everyone.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   For everyone, every podcast they grab.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So you can see that this wouldn't scale, right?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Like the rate at which podcasts are created is a lot faster than the rate at which, you know, free lawyer hours emerge in the universe, right?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's just not, there's just not enough lawyer hours remaining between now and the hepteth of the universe to make that enough feasible thing.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Is this just an error or is there actually kind of an nefarious goal here? Are they really just trying to protect television and accidentally impinging on the internet?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Well, what these guys are saying is that they are the legitimate content distributors on the internet and that's what legitimate content looks like on the internet.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And if you don't protect them, you don't protect content on the internet and they require this in order to go forward.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Now, I don't think they do require to go forward.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Mark Cuban, who actually founded broadcast.com, which is how Yahoo got into this stuff, says that they don't need it, right?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You know, lots of people say they don't need it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Basically, you've got these two companies that want to make sure that there is a third company that comes along and offers the same service that they do.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   They want to log out the competition.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And when it comes to podcasts, they just don't care is what it is.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   It's like all the other copyright fights where, for example, we say, well, we'll extend copyright by another 20 years or 70 years.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And there's this tiny little minority of stuff that anyone wants to buy 70 years after its creator dies.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And the rest of it just disappears down the memory hole because no archivists can make it available if we extend copyright.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So the Supreme Court found 98% of the works in copyright aren't available for sale.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   They don't have any commercial fortunes.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And to get at that 2% and preserve it, we clobber the other 98%.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And that's what's going on here.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   These guys make this infinitesimal fraction of the content on the internet, but they want the whole internet redesigned to make it safe for what they think they need to make their business run.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   So WIPO is deciding this tomorrow?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Well, no.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   So WIPO is continuing their negotiation about tomorrow.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Now, the good news about this webcasting stuff is everyone else in the world thinks it's a dumb idea.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   But the US has got a lot of pull at WIPO, and they've been arm-twisting people.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And basically, at every meeting, it gets knocked out of the treaty, and by the next meeting, it's back in again.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   They've found some way to get it back in.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And we've got them on the ropes now.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   So it started when we brought this letter signed by Mark Cuban and 20 other webcasters and other technology organizations opposed to it.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And that puts such a fear into them that we actually had copies of the letter stolen off the literature tables and show up later in the toilets and behind the planters and stuff.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Really, just, and it knocked it out.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Now we've got a triple barreled return volley for them.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   The first barreled is that Creative Commons International Organization, the I-Commons Organization, has adopted a resolution opposing this.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   So obviously, this makes Creative Commons licenses invalid, right?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   It doesn't matter that the copyright is cleared for you to reuse it, because Creative Commons doesn't cover the broadcast, right?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Right.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So Creative Commons is opposed to this.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   And so they've sent this letter on behalf of the people who created the 160 million Creative Commons licensed works that have emerged since 2003, saying we don't want this.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   We're rights holders, we don't want this.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   At the same time, last week, a group of some of the largest corporations, libraries, network providers, and public interest groups in America signed a joint letter.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It had like AT&T and EFF and Verizon and all the library associations and everyone to the USPTO saying, you guys keep showing up in Geneva and saying,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   "America wants this."
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   America doesn't want this.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   We don't want America.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I mean, EFF is presently suing AT&T for some of money greater than its entire cash on hand and net worth, right?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   You still are together in this.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And we're still together on this one.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   So, and then the third barrel here is podcasters.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   And there is an open letter for podcasters and podcasting organizations like the Twit Network to sign on to opposing this.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And, you know, the first volley is going to be tomorrow, but the letter will remain open until the next meeting in six months or so.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   So, you can send an email to Gwen Hins, who's the EFF attorney who's just gotten off a plane in Geneva a couple hours ago,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   at GwenGWEN@ef.org and send her your name, the name of your podcaster, podcasting organization, and what country you're in.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And she'll bring that because that's going to be a multinational effort.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   She'll bring that to Geneva.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   So, that's my call to action for today.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Send an email to Gwen, signing on to this letter, and we're going to drive three more nails into the coffin of this thing.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   We might have to, you know, cut its head off, fill its mouth with garlic and sew its lip shut, bury it at the crossroads of midnight fruit to stay dead.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   But we're going to knock it down for a while, you know?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Anybody got a wooden stake?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Silverwood.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   We'll, of course, Twit will sign that, and I encourage any podcasters listening to do the same.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So, it's Gwen@ef.org.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   G.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Correct.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And, you know, it's the kind of things that this would impinge on is what Google announced this week, which I think is kind of neat.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They're going to, their Google news search will go now back 200 years.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And that's the kind of thing he would lose, right?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Is the ability to kind of just scrape this ancient stuff.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Here you got stuff that's, I don't think that would qualify as an audio visual work, but no.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But it's the kind of, you know, it's the right thing.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I mean, basically it means Google's successor who says, well, we're going to go back through the history as a broadcast to the days of winter.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Or, you know, they could never do it.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   And, you know, the irony here is that no one's ever shown that there's a problem.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   No one's shown that there's like widespread piracy of broadcast signals when they're retransmitted over the internet in a way that discourages people for making broadcasts.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Right.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Right.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Right.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   The only example they can point to is this thing called iCraveTV.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Do you remember this Canadian outfit about five years ago?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Who, in Canada, you could watch American broadcast shows?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   And they said, well, you know, we were the broadcasters and we couldn't sue them except the broadcasters in this case were ABC.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   ABC does make a lot of copyrighted works like the news and they were able to, in fact, go and sue them over that.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Absolutely.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   With their copyright hat on, just not with their broadcast right hat on, you know, it's completely specious.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Anyway, I've talked to you often enough about this.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Do you want to stick around for the rest of the show?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I'm in.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I'm in for a penny and for a pound.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Great.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I appreciate it.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   So let's talk about the big story of the week, which is the Hewlett Packard board of directors basically self-destructing upon finding out that their chairman of the board, chairman of the board,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   chairman of the board was snooping on them.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   They was a leak.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   The press was talking about stuff that only the HP board would know.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   The chairwoman who, by the way, has said, I'll quit if they want me to, but they don't want me to quit.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It's done, isn't it?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Done.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Yeah, I missed done.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   It's done.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   She's not done apparently.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   No, she's not actually.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   She ain't got more said.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   It called for the resignation of the entire board.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Well, here's, so there's a leak.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   It turns out that the leak apparently is a board member, but in order to find this board member, Patricia Donne, who's the chairwoman of HP, hired HP investigators, and they use something called pre-texting.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   In fact, the California state attorney general is now investigating it and perhaps will file criminal charges.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Pre-texting involves an investigator pretending to be somebody to get their phone records.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   It's not an investigator. It's just basically me calling up and saying, "I'm a barbo from amalgamated technologies."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   We're trying to track down, you know, insert whatever it is.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   No, no, no, no. It's worse than that.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   No, no, it's worse than that.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   He said, "I am, you know..."
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Patrick Noten.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   No, this is Patrick.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I'm giving you my phone bill.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I had my phone bill and they said, "Well, we need your social."
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And they said, "Oh, yeah, fine."
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   And they said, "Okay, fine.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   We'll send you out your phone bill."
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   I mean, it's actually pretending to be the other person.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Okay.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   It's impersonating the other person.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   The inquiry convinced them that one of the members of the board, George Keyworth II, had, in fact, been leaking.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Keyworth, it was a friend and nominee of another board member, Tom Perkins of the Kleiner Perkins venture firm.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Perkins was one of the people investigated.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Perkins was so incensed.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   He's resigned from the board.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And so this, I mean, and the board is, of course, in turmoil, Dun says, "Well, maybe the, maybe I did something wrong, but unless the board of directors wants me to quit, I'm not going to quit."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And she says, "They believe in me and they're backing me all the way."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Although, Bill Lockyear, the attorney general, may may end up prosecuting.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   We'll see what happens.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Interestingly enough, nine journalists were also investigated using this pretexting, including John Markoff of the New York Times, a couple of reporters from Syria.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   A couple of reporters from CNET and a couple of reporters from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   It was crazy.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I mean, that's Watergate.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   It is.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   This is basically doing pen traces on your political opponents.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I mean, and the amazing, I mean, it is.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I mean, American citizen, I think Watergate's a little more serious than Ph.B.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   He's prying, he's snaking around trying to figure out which of its board members is private.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   It is private enterprise.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   But I can see if your Perkins, wow, I'd be or Markoff, I'd be furious.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Absolutely.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   The investigator called AT&T and impersonated Perkins, say, like a record of phone calls, and they had an email to a web-based email account, a free web-book account.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And of course, Dun has said that she was, quote, appalled to hear that the investigators she'd hired had lied to get the calls.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   But of course, she wasn't appalled enough to actually out it two years ago when the whole thing happened.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Right.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Yeah, I didn't fly with a gun.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I only loaded it and aimed at it and put my finger on the trigger and waited for a week ago.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And gave it to somebody else.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And so they're having a meeting of the board today.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I mean, I have to credit a value ag with this.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   The HP board will meet on Sunday.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   The company declined to say if this is an emergency meeting of directors to discuss the fallout of the probe.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's like, yeah, they're just meeting on Sunday for a very particular reason.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Which would love to be a fly on the wall in that one.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   We all wanted to catch up already.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   They've got a leak.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   They've got a leak.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Well, no, it's going to happen to them.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   They've got a leak.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   The meeting's already ended and they're actually reaching beating again on Monday because they haven't made a decision yet.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Oh, man.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   I just imagine the voices being raised in there.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And you've got to think.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I mean, there's a lot of corporations in the US.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I love capitalism.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   It's a great system.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   But with all due respect, whether or not HP got overzealous and broke.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And yeah, overzealous broke laws.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And the journalists involved, I think, have more of a right to be pissed off.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Oh, I'd be really fearfully.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   I'd be very fearfully involved.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   But compared to say the anaconda copper mine leaving a few acres of, you know, a few hundred acres and a few hundred thousand pounds of toxic substances to leak into the ground in Montana.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   It's a really interesting.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Yeah, but this is this week in tech.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   We've got to have something to get upset.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Chevron hiring death squads in Nigeria.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   No, I've been.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   It's not even on the same level as Watergate really.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I mean, come on.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   This isn't a public.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Well, no, but in the sense of you have the president who's hired some investigators to essentially wire tap her political opponents, right?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Or anyone she thinks might be a political opponent.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   No, it's like it in that respect.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It's not that she bugged them.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   There's a pen trace on them, which, you know, people who are into crypto and security know that signals and televigences is yet another important critical way that you can frustrate wrong food your opponents to predictions here.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   What's going to happen?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's done done.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   H.P. Gilmore noted that HP stock didn't budge.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   So apparently the market doesn't care.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   They don't care.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I think you've got to see you've got somebody's heads going to roll and it's got to be done.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   They'll be escaped somewhere.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   I don't think Perkins is coming back, obviously.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   I'm going to make a prediction that John Markoff will no longer cover HP for the New York Times.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's a good prediction.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And if I were Markoff, I would do it.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   We didn't invite John to be on the show.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   We couldn't get ahold of him, but maybe he'll come back and join us at some point.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Or you know, maybe he will.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Maybe he'll say, like, look, I can rise above this.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I'll report on the story.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   I'm part of the story.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   It's probably, you know, par for the course.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I imagine it's not the first time people have tried to investigate him.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Yeah, well, you know, New York Times, when they call you, their phone number shows up as
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   111 111 111.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   So we know why.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Well, they don't want, they totally don't want people calling up.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Apparently some of the reporters in the newsroom and the New York Times have private phones.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Private unlisted phones for calling sources and for sources to call them on.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Absolutely.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   That's pretty standard stuff.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   There's a lot of companies where your outbound phone number is basically the central law.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Well, no, but in the case of the New York Times, it's a number that doesn't ring anywhere.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Right.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So that if someone starts 69s like a whistleblower, they don't get to find out who that, who is
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   just calling.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Right.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   A total spoof.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   That's actually pretty interesting.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So that's, that's, that's, what if they had to have those alterations like custom done to
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   their, to their, uh, PBX?
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Their PBX system.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   I'm sure they did.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   I guess it was before, before Asterix.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Right.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Before that became trivial.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Now it's just a line of code.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Other stories, Amazon made a big announcement on Thursday unbox their new video store.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   It will sell videos.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   They say DVD quality, although I don't know who would want to download a DVD quality video.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I mean, that's going to be huge from over 30 movie and TV studios.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Everybody pretty much accept Disney and they will, uh, interesting because Disney of course,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   the number one shareholder, Steve Jobs, who is expected to make something similar, uh, sort
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   of announcement on Tuesday.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Uh, it's interesting.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Unbox uses, of course, and Corey will like this, the lovely Windows DRM copy, copy wrist
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   restriction, as Corey calls it.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Uh, when you download a movie or show, uh, unbox sends a second download file.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Uh, quote, optimized for window media compatible portable devices.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   So you'll get an effect to, to copies of it.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Uh, it keeps track of them.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And of course, before you can play them, you've got to check in and say, do I actually own
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   this won't play on iPods.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Uh, they're charging between 799 and 1499 for this and rentals for 399.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Uh, I, I, I know it's supposed to any of you have tried this.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Uh, I haven't tried this, but I've used similar services.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I mean, essentially this is, this is the same thing that cinema now and movie, but not for a while.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   I, I, I was not impressed with cinema now.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Well, what's the last time you looked at cinema?
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Well, if they added more movies, cause that, that's one of the problems was they had, you know, only awful movies.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I have you.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   I'd say probably in over a couple of years.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Uh, and then you get bad quality, right?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   I mean, the quality's not great.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Quality is actually pretty good.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   It's outstanding for NTSC and they actually started offering, uh, they actually off, uh, uh, movie link actually started offering, uh, uh, a while back actually, uh, uh, white screen versions.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Hey, HD is stretching it, but, uh, they're worse things.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I don't think you can say it's gonna be movie links, uh, movie link actually isn't pretty much put out of business by cinema now, but cinema now actually has some pretty good quality stuff.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   You can get the, uh, 79 episodes of the original Star Trek, which by the way celebrated its 40th anniversary on Friday. Happy anniversary Star Trek.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Uh, none of us were old enough probably to really pay much attention.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm the oldest and I was only nine when it came out.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   I think you were in our 40s.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I don't remember, you know, it's funny.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I do not remember watching Star Trek.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   It was only on for three years in prime time.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And I don't remember watching it till much later when it came back.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   I don't know who watched it.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Apparently nobody they canceled it.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Inside man, uh, the, uh, Spike Lee movie will be available failure launch walk the line V for Vendetta Ben Hur beside an adventure.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   There's a pretty good, I mean, office base is up there for 13 bucks.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   You know, it's, you know, don't lose it.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Don't lose the media.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   That's my big problem with it.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   I mean, it's just, you know, you're really limited to what you can, uh, can you burn it?
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   I don't think you can even burn it.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   Uh, the last, if memory serves that those rights are restricted to the copyright holder, uh,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   copyright holder to determine.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Ah, so you could, somebody could theoretically offer that.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I mean, they're like, you know, three King South Park Matrix firefly.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Right.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Pretty interesting selection.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   As long as we're talking about copyright, did you see that you go ahead?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Sorry.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Sorry.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I kind of feel like I'm, I'm about to channel, uh, uh, Dvorak here with gunner.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Ah, that's terrible.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   But it's terrible.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   You know, still like, I wouldn't want it, but I don't, I don't.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Well, it's, it's totally squeezed, right?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I mean, so you can, you can, you're sitting there in your living room and you're like,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   well, I want to do the honest thing.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   I don't want to, I don't want to download the torrent of this, which you can do in a couple
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   hours of almost all those, all those, a couple hours or a couple of days, depending on what
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   it is.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Okay.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It doesn't have to be a popular torrent that's hosted by a lot of people who have decent bandwidth.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   It can take days to take.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   But all the Star Wars, all the Star Trek rather.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I mean, that's pretty straightforward to get off of.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And, and you know what?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   You can certainly get it as fast as you can get a Netflix movie.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   So, you know, that's got to be, that should be like the, the floor, right?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.600]   The floor should be, this should be at least as useful to me as the thing I can get for
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.320]   free, dishonestly.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.920]   And then, and then it should go up from there, right?
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.840]   They should say, well, if we're going to charge you 13 bucks, we should give you more than
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.400]   the warm glow of, well, you're not, you're not breaking the law.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.960]   It should be like, we're giving you something that's better than the torrent.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.120]   So, everything you can do with the torrent, you should be able to do with the download
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.360]   file, like, put it on your PVR or stick it on your iPod or back it up to your hard drive.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.720]   I think torrents are the big threat.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.520]   I think the DVD is the big threat for this roughly the same price.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.920]   You get a higher quality movie with extras.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.920]   Well, there's that too.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.440]   And, you know, for the studios, this is what really freaks me out is that the studios are
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.640]   this dumb, because talk about cutting your own throw, right?
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.920]   In 10 or 20 years when, when you've got everyone who's a movie watcher, suddenly has to be
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.280]   a Microsoft customer in order to watch their movies, how are the studios going to negotiate
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   with Microsoft, right?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   What are they going to say to them?
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.160]   Like, well, you know, we've decided we want you to do the following things with your DRM
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   that open it up the way that the record industry is trying to do with Apple right now.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.120]   The movie studios are going to, well, Microsoft can laugh at them, right?
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.200]   It's like, well, what are you going to do?
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.520]   You're going to stop distributing it?
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   Do you think they'll send so on Tuesday?
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.120]   Do you think Apple will announce a similar deal and then giving the movie companies at
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   least two different DRM solutions?
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.840]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.520]   Every rumor that's in the it's game, it's rumor.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:25.280]   We're not going to know until Tuesday, but everything I've heard says that Steve was not
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.560]   able to get purchase rights, but was only able to get download rights.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.560]   What's the sounds I understand?
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   It's in rental, right?
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.680]   Well, basically there's like rent, basically rental versus, versus ownership rights.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:42.560]   So I download it and I can only watch it so many times, it's self-destruct.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.240]   Like, you know, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's purchasing and there's,
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   there's rental.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.040]   So, you know, you get a license to watch it for X number of days after you first, you
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.400]   know, start watching it or hours depending on what the title is.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   I hate that too.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.920]   I mean, that's, that's really a case where Corey, where people are just going to go to
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   the BitTorrent.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.200]   Well, yeah, but if it's, if it's, if it's, if you're sitting there, right?
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.120]   And you're, you've been, you've been terrified by the whole idea that, that, you know, if
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.720]   I download stuff and I, and I, I, Corey will probably identify the, the use of the filthy
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   nasty BitTorrents.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.160]   If I use the filthy nasty BitTorrents, name the comic book artists that was referring
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   to it as that.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.840]   Uh, lovingly I should say.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.240]   I think that's Warren Ellis now.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   Yes.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:26.280]   You know, I use the filthy nasty BitTorrents to download a movie.
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.600]   Um, there's a lot of people who are scared of that either because of the, you know, extraordinary
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   and almost comical number of lies in a lawsuit that have been filed by the RA and, you know,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.000]   the smaller number that have been filed by the MPAA.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.360]   It's also a small fraction of the overall users.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.680]   I mean, only the, the Uber geeks are, I mean, let's face it.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.480]   I mean, we can all do that, but really that's a narrow slim slice of the overall population
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   of the other ones.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.960]   I think that's exactly Torrance or I think you're grossly mistaken.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.800]   If they, I've seen panels where I've seen a half dozen teenagers basically flat out state.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.120]   They don't buy music anymore.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.040]   They don't really understand why they should buy music and, and, and had like a teenager
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.720]   basically saying, yeah, I get all my music off of insert name of peer to peer site here,
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.360]   but they're spending 200 bucks a month on ringtones and, and cell phones service.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.880]   I mean, I think that's true.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.080]   I think, um, but, but I think that these, these kind of services really cater to different
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.080]   kinds of people.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.760]   I mean, for example, you know, my girlfriend would never, you know, it doesn't even know
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:28.680]   what bit Torrance is, but she knows she wants like the latest episodes of like CSI Miami.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.000]   So she can just go to iTunes and get them.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.360]   And the fact that they're slightly lower quality, it doesn't really bother her.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.320]   The fact that she can't do anything with them doesn't really matter to her because she's
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.160]   not doing anything with them anyway, apart from just watching them on her computer.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.840]   And so, and so it's like, it's really easy for her to just go.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.520]   Percable bucks get those.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   That's all great.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.320]   Rather than having to like, I mean, it's like immediate gratification rather than having
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:54.560]   to go fish around a torrent site, install a torrent client, go and download it.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.160]   It might take a couple of hours as opposed to just having it there and having it really
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   simple.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.880]   Well, I think there's a fair point to that.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.240]   But you know, when, when you do get these things that are slightly milder, although,
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.560]   you know, still have restrictions downstream, that's actually in some ways more problematic
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.040]   because you get people who end up sinking a lot of money into a platform, not realizing
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.280]   how locked in they're getting.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.800]   So, you know, like iTunes, right?
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.000]   You know, maybe, maybe it costs you, maybe it costs you a hundred bucks to switch to a
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   creative device.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.720]   And who's to say that the iPod's going to be the best one forever?
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.680]   I mean, you know, anyone remember the quadras or the performers?
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.800]   You know, Apple like Apple has a spotty record here.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.840]   So you switch to a creative device in five years.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.560]   Maybe the device is a hundred bucks, but if you spent 200 bucks on music, you've tripled
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.120]   the cost, the device, because you can't take your Apple stuff with you.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.040]   You know, I was, I was foolish enough to buy a lot of audiobooks through the iTunes Music
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.360]   Store because I really love audiobooks and I'm fundamentally pretty honest guys.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.760]   But now that I'm in the middle of this migration to Ubuntu, I've dedicated a whole machine
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.320]   to just ripping my audiobooks using audio hijack.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.760]   It's going to take 40 days.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   Oh my.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   Oh my.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   Yeah, I'm in the same boat.
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.200]   I have a ton of audiobooks in the audible format.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.120]   They're copy protected dead books.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.560]   So you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, in some ways your girlfriend has it even worse,
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.560]   right?
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.000]   Because she's going to end up lying all this stuff and then, and then, you know, later
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.640]   on, she's not going to be able to get the best deal that's going.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   She's not going to be able to switch to technical.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.680]   I think what you mean, Corey, is that I've got the worst deal because I'm going to be
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   the mother of the house.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   It's no different than somebody who bought 108 track tapes and who now can't use the
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   eight track.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.440]   But you could tape your eight tracks.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.440]   Yes.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.880]   Assuming you could find an eight track player, but that's, that's a matter of the audio
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.880]   hijack.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   Your books.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.840]   I mean, is it that different?
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.080]   I think it is.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.960]   Arguably, I think it is because it's illegal to make devices that are specifically about
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   ripping iTunes.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   Right.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.160]   So, one of the phonograph player that has the cassette deck built into it or the dubbing
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.920]   deck is unlawful when you got DRM involved.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.080]   You can't, you can't start a business based on helping people get unlocked from a lock-in
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   anymore.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.560]   I think that's pretty different.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.840]   Actually, maybe, maybe it's closer to being a problem than, than we think according, you
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:07.960]   might have seen this article, Will in the, in the Guardian, the Sunday paper, or actually
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:14.400]   just the observer, the iPod may be on a, on the way out losing its cool iPod sales have
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   dropped pretty dramatically over the last three quarters.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.920]   Research study by the Zandy group in New York said that consumers are starting to think
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.920]   it's not cool.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   Everybody has an iPod.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.920]   It's not so cool anymore.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.320]   It's kind of mom and dad's MP3 player.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.200]   So, I think that's really a valid point, isn't it?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.520]   I mean, I remember when I first got an iPod like back when it was, you know, the first
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.880]   five gig ones, it was the coolest thing on the planet.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.160]   And everyone, you shouldn't do it like, oh my word, what the heck is that?
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.560]   But now you've got every, every, you know, everybody in the world has got an iPod.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.560]   So is there really any cache in it anymore?
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.560]   They are a bit.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   Probably not.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   They are a bit chavvy.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.560]   Chavvy.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   That's probably a good term for it.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560]   Chavvy.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:54.560]   What the hell is Chavvy?
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:01.680]   Chavvy is a, it's like a UK term for, sort of, it doesn't really have an equivalent in the
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.680]   states of the food.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.680]   There is no, there is no, there is no, there is no.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:07.800]   It's like trailer park, trailer park in the states is chav in England.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.360]   A little, yeah.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   Interesting.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.440]   We've, we've, we've got a new word and a very useful word, I think.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.560]   So now there's kind of money because I was just trying to keep it's a chav.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.560]   Yeah, it's on a panel.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.560]   How now?
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.080]   Oh, there's a word I haven't heard in a long time.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.160]   Say again, back to the bottom of the panel.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.920]   The boffins say that's naph.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   Oh, God, bad, bad.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.880]   How do you, first of all, how do you spell chavvy?
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   C-H-A-V-E-Y.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880]   V-V-Y.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:33.880]   C-H-A-V-V-Y.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.280]   All right, because it's going to be- Chav is a noun.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.280]   It's a person.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.360]   Burberry, stop making plaid baseball caps because they were too chabby.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.520]   Use this word in a sentence.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.160]   I mean, Corey just has.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   So that's-
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   That's pretty chabby.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:53.280]   I think plaid baseball hats will be back soon, right, right along with the plaid iPod.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.200]   So you were on a panel, Patrick?
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.560]   Listen, I was on a, like, a brief, like, pundit argument thing on a television show.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.440]   There were two people there who were, you know, about industry experts, you know, those
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.760]   kind of people who, like, apparently never meet each other face to face, but they, you
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   know, find out about each other's children every time they show up on another television
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.600]   show to argue things by a satellite feed.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.400]   And they were like, oh, preposterous.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.600]   The zerwin could never take market share away from Apple.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.360]   And I'm sitting there going, man, Microsoft's a 3.0 company, you know?
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   All it takes is the, you know, the right combinations of, you know, just cheap price, market change,
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.920]   you know, things becoming chabby.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.320]   Is that the right use of it?
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.120]   Yeah, but I mean, the zoon is chabby out of the box, isn't it?
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.080]   I mean, I don't think the zoon is cool or-
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.720]   First of all, don't use that word.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.160]   I think it's chabby.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.400]   Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.040]   And two, it's like, you know, the funny thing is, is, you know, Internet Explorer was a mess,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   right?
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.080]   But version 3.0 and people are like Netscape who?
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.280]   Oh, they're the ones that copied dick, right?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   Right, right.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.360]   And nobody even remembers that they were the browser, you know, for, you know, you know,
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   well, years.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.720]   I think there's a huge burden on Steve Jobs at this point on Tuesday, not only to counter
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.360]   what's going on with Amazon, but also to prove that the iPod isn't that word, but in fact
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   has a future.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.520]   And I think it'll be very interesting to see what he comes out with.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.000]   I want to see if they finally do subscriptions for iTunes.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.200]   I think it's the one thing that's, I think it's the one thing that, you know, the 14
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.680]   or 17 different WMV-based competitors that iTunes really have.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.400]   Do people do those music subscriptions?
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.800]   Do you know anybody who doesn't?
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.120]   I actually tried one out.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.960]   I tried one out and I was testing out urge when I was doing a review of that.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   You were going-
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.560]   And I got to say, you know, I still have the subscription, Leo, because you know, I've
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:55.560]   been doing this for 15 bucks a month.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.560]   I mean, I have somebody who owns what, 700 CDs.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.440]   So it's not like I'm afraid of going out and buying the stuff.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.800]   You know, I never really got into iTunes paid downloads because I thought being locked
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   into AAC was stupid.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.480]   So now you're locked in the Windows DRM.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.280]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.160]   If it's like it's two in the morning and I want to go screw around and listen to a bunch
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.360]   of music, I can do it without knowing the band and being able to sample it.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.600]   It's kind of a nice environment.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:27.560]   More importantly, I can do it legally, which is an issue given, you know, I just believe
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.520]   in artists being paid for their music.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.480]   And I can also sit down and I can just search around for 15 bucks a month.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.920]   You know, at one point I downloaded like, you know, something like 400 gigabytes of music
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.440]   off this, you know, than white, the hard drive started over.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.880]   Mr. Ubuntu, what do you do for your music?
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.440]   You know, I'm kind of at the limit of all the music I can absorb at this point.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:56.160]   You know, I ripped all my CDs and I had any music subscription for a while until they
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.040]   started capping downloads.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.880]   And every now and again, I'll buy CD or I'll, you know, someone will put me to a web page
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.240]   where there's a sample of something.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:08.840]   But I think that one of the amazing things about iTunes and MP3 and digital music is how
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.800]   deep it's let us get into our own collections.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.720]   Like, you know, at this point I got all my music rated and sorted out and I've got literally
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   if I listen to music for like five or six hours a day, I've got 40 or 50 days worth
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.560]   of music and having my playlist loop every 50 days, just not a big deal for me.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.240]   So I don't, I don't, I think that, you know, the RIAA spent a lot of time worrying about
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.120]   what would happen when people get pirate new releases and kind of miss that once we could
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.800]   just delve into our own collections and, you know, when our buddy gives us a song every
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.880]   now and again, that kind of thing that's always been within the scope of legality.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.560]   We just never lose any of that.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.720]   That that makes a whole new kind of problem for them that they've never really had to
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   consider before.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.400]   Kind of like the music or the newspaper people worrying about whether bloggers are, aren't
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.400]   journalists.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.200]   And missing the fact that like the really important thing is that Google does a better
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.480]   job with classified ads than the New York Times does.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.800]   And when all the classified ads go to Google, then they can't afford to sell a newspaper
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.040]   for 50 cents anymore.
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.040]   I mean Craigslist.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.880]   Craigslist, Google, and eBay, right?
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.120]   Between the three of them, who needs a newspaper?
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.000]   You know, and so people are going to stop buying music, period.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.360]   Will Harris, do you, you're a young bloke?
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.480]   How do you how do you how do you top off your music collection?
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.760]   It kind of varies.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:30.360]   I am big on sort of having my friends recommend stuff to me because mostly my friends are
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.400]   far more hip than me.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.480]   And so they can usually recommend stuff that that's that's pretty good.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.360]   And they'll lend me CDs and you rip those or whatever.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   I'm wondering why people.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.640]   People like you and maybe Corey and Patrick just don't listen to something like Pandora.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   And who needs me to?
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   Yeah, I do.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.680]   I don't mind Pandora, but I tend to find, I mean, I have like the specific bands that
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.320]   I follow.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.480]   And so as soon as like the new release for that comes out, I'm straight on to buy it
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.120]   and chances are I probably buy it on iTunes because you remember, I mean, there's an example
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.760]   a couple of weeks ago, there was a new album out by one of my favorite bands and I'd forgotten
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.400]   that it had come out and I was just about to go and take a trip.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.640]   It was like a four hour drive.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:13.840]   And so I was like, uh, rather than mess around, I'm just going to go and get it off iTunes.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.960]   I think that's one of the reasons online music's a way to grab dick.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.040]   I've got it straight away.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   It's point of access.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.320]   You get it when you want it right away.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.040]   You don't have to trip out.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.240]   Now Patrick, how did you get the new drop kick movie Murphy's CD?
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.280]   Did you go to the store?
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.200]   Uh, yes, actually.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.080]   There's an interesting question though for Will and for Patrick.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.400]   If there were no DRM, would you spend less money at these stores?
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   I'd call it two now.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   You're just 128 bit because Patrick was.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.440]   If you got exactly the same files except you could copy them more, I mean, DRM is supposed
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.800]   to stop people from stealing, but it really only affects people who buy stuff.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.560]   Well, that's one of the cool things about, uh, if you take a look at something I've been
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.640]   playing around with, I think it recently is e-music, which is something that was around
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.760]   when it first started up because it's reasonable quality.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.160]   It's copy protection free and they have the entire epitaph catalog.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.720]   So, you know, there's no albums I wanted that ducked in there.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:07.640]   So I think the answer is yes, Corey.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.720]   That's exactly how that's a sign.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:10.720]   Absolutely not.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.640]   But you know, the problem is the rights holders do not currently feel comfortable with signing
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.400]   over, you know, epitaph does it, but hey, they're, you know, they're punk rock, right?
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   Or they were.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.320]   Well, you know, they say that they're worried about people stealing from them when you say,
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.800]   but hold on a second DRM only affects the people who buy from you.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.320]   They go, well, you know, what we really want to be able to do is segment the market and
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.640]   all these, these new ways where we can say, you know, well, this is music you can only
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.440]   listen to on Wednesdays and it's 25% off.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.760]   You know, the best example I heard of this was this guy from the MPa once said, well,
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.560]   I want to design this television standard so that we can charge you a different amount
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.880]   of money for a show that you can receive in one room while you're sitting in another
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   room.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:51.160]   So like, you know, being able to like move it from your receiver to in your basement to
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   your bedroom.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.800]   And he said, you know, because that has value.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.400]   And if it has value, we should be able to charge for it.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.480]   And he called this the next generation business model.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.960]   My joke is I call that a urinary tract infection.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.960]   Right?
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.200]   Used to sit down in your living room and this stuff would all just flow free and easy.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.160]   And now every time you press the button, it's a little painful drip, you know, two cents
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.560]   to watch it in another room, 15 cents.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.760]   If you don't want it to be rent where I think to burn it.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.920]   Consumers do not want this.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.720]   This is completely upstream against what consumers want.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.120]   Yeah, I think consumers want that.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.560]   I mean, because I mean, obviously consumers don't want that.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.880]   They don't want to have a little control and they don't want to, they don't want micro
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.120]   payments every time they listen to free flow.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.640]   We use Corey's metaphor.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.560]   Well, sure, they basically want, you know, they want the freedom to move their content
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.600]   from their CDs to wherever they want to listen to them.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.000]   They don't want to have to pay additional for it, which I think would be wonderful.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.480]   But at what point do the, you know, does the recording industry, you know, what point
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.200]   does the recording industry is, is there suddenly the sound of angels and the heavenly light
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.800]   and the, you know, the Buddha's rays shine down and the executive goes, we have to give
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   the music away.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   I'm, I'm, I'm.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.360]   Well, you know, I actually, it's funny because a lot of the musicians are getting there,
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.640]   even if the recording companies aren't a lot of the musicians are saying a lot of the
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.160]   side contracts where they're not going to have these rights.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.240]   So it's just a matter of a few years and then you think, you think musicians will eventually
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.040]   just completely bypass the record companies or, or they're going to, or they're going
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.960]   to have the ones that have cloud, the ones that have cloud are going to make the record
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   companies do what they want.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.600]   You know, in Canada, they just had all of the record labels that aren't owned by American
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.840]   companies walk out of the Canadian Recording Industry, Canadian Recording Industry Association
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.960]   and found their own association that basically says, we don't sue fans, we don't do DRM,
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.760]   we don't think that the internet should be broken.
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.880]   And that's, that's kind of their three founding principles led by the guy from Bear Naked
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.840]   Ladies Steve Page.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:46.280]   Because Korea is really, is really just a client state of the RIA.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:48.520]   Yeah, although they claim to be Canadian, right?
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.520]   They show up in Parliament.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:55.400]   But we're here on behalf of Canadian companies like Universal and Time Warner and Sony, right?
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.920]   And all the Canadian companies are like, wait a second, those guys are Canadian.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.920]   No, we're getting at us.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   Very interesting.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.080]   But this has always been, this has always been the game.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.720]   I mean, you know, think about, I mean, you know, it's the pathetic thing about politics
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.800]   is, you know, we did something that bordered on the political on DLTV a few weeks ago
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.240]   and got some really fascinating, you should never talk about politics.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.240]   It's technology.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.240]   And it's like, hey, dude, you know, technology gets regulated.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.400]   By politicians, wake up.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.720]   You know, this is, you know, the DMCA is a pathetic document.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.600]   The fact that nothing's going to, you know, nothing's probably ever going to enter in
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.200]   a public domain, you know, in my lifetime or my children's lifetime, you know, thanks
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.880]   to some clever lawyers and some, you know, people who know, you know, who to back and
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.680]   what, you know, who to pay money to and who to take the dinner and who to make promises
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.680]   to.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.800]   And as the result, you know, as end users, we have fewer and fewer rights.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.800]   I mean, think about it.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.520]   At some point, it's going to be impossible to add modern, you know, more modern literature.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.840]   It's like the whole idea of like the n- anthology of literature basically stops at what point
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.840]   Corey, 1928.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.240]   Yeah, so, you know, here's a actually perfect example.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.360]   So two of my favorite albums of all times, there's Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.560]   Band and the Beach Boys Pet Sounds.
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.760]   And both of those albums are made out of like all this found sound and cut up music
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.680]   and they have lots of, what's, what we would think of today as like noise music or noise
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   rock built in.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.280]   You know, you think about the benefit of Mr. Kider, that huge crashing chord at the end
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.280]   of day in the life.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:24.640]   So these guys, they made an album called The Beechills, Sergeant Pet Sounds, which was just
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:28.400]   a noise rock remix of Sergeant Pepper's and Pet Sounds.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.600]   Is this the Clayton Counts?
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   The Clayton Counts.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.400]   And EMI is suing Clayton Counts, who's the producer.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.960]   He didn't even do it.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   Totally non-commercial.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.240]   This guy doesn't have any money.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.880]   He's, you know, just moved to Texas to take care of a sick relative.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.160]   I said like, when can I phone you?
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.000]   And he's like, I don't have a phone anymore.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.560]   And so they're suing him and they wanted to turn over the IP addresses of everyone who
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.600]   downloaded it so they can go after us.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   Isn't that right?
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.320]   As if he would have that, by the way.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.200]   Well, I mean, maybe his webmaster does.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.600]   Who knows, right?
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.280]   But you know, when you think about it, here you have these companies that got rich reselling
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.400]   the product of The Beatles and The Beach Boys who were able to make noise rock out of found
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.400]   sound.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.280]   Those words, they went out and recorded themselves, Corey.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.800]   It wasn't like they went out sick.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.960]   And with the larger issues, does it cost you any sales?
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.120]   I mean, they did the same thing with DJ Danger Mouse with the gray album.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   And with DJBC with the Beatles, but it doesn't cost you any sales?
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.480]   Actually, you know, The Beatles took music.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.920]   They took tape and they cut it up and cut it back together again for George and Mark
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   Kite.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   That's right.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.240]   You know, they were, they were like, and you can't tell me that if they didn't have
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.920]   samplers and sequencers, that they wouldn't have been doing exactly what Danger Mouse and
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.040]   the rest of those guys you're doing now.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.880]   Or the entire rap industry, but you know, what's interesting is, is again, you know,
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.480]   what happens to the Beatles take the Beatles taken from 1968 looking at, you know, four
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.960]   track recorders as being this, you know, the Ampex four track recorders, right?
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.680]   They pushed them harder than anybody else on the planet, right?
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:01.680]   And basically it was like Brian Wilson and The Beatles sitting in dark rooms in a strange
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.680]   competition with each other using the available technology and pushing it out to the fullest,
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.680]   right?
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   What would have happened to them today?
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   Would they be rap artists?
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   Would they be, you know, doing remixes?
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.560]   Would they be doing mashups?
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.560]   And within the context of the studio environment, would they even be studio artists as we know
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.200]   them now, right?
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.120]   That might even be a better, a better question.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.040]   The EMI is certainly within its rights, its legal rights to do this.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.520]   I mean, it just, just shows you though, how stupid they are about that.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.920]   They've taken a leave of their senses.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   It doesn't.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   It's.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   And you know, this is the, it's basically.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   I just offer them a contract.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   Well, yeah.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:34.920]   No kidding.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.560]   It's the record.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.360]   It's funny because I actually had this fight with EMI once at a European presidency event
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.560]   in London where I talked about Danger Mouse and she said, oh, but that story's got a
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.080]   happy ending.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.120]   We hired Danger Mouse to produce an album for us.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.280]   And like, well, you know, we always hear how copyright is great because it ended patronage,
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   right?
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.320]   We're only, you could only make art if the Pope said you could.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   So now we've got it.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.680]   So you can only make art if EMI says you can.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.680]   You know, I don't see that as a huge improvement, you know?
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.200]   You get the occasional nice ceiling when the Pope says you, when the Pope's in charge
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.040]   of art, you get the occasional, you know, Beatles album when EMI is in charge of art,
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:13.320]   wouldn't it be better to have less people in charge of art, more decentralized decision
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.320]   making?
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.320]   He produced the Narls, Narls Barkley.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.320]   Yes.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.040]   Well, before that, he did a mashup album for them.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:24.200]   No, he is half of Narls Barkley Danger Mouse.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.840]   So it's, I mean, it's, I feel like I'm Mr. Bad Vodge today, but, but, but,
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.240]   You just unhappy mood.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:30.640]   You're taking no Dvorak's place.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   It's fine.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.000]   I am the designated Dvorak.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Somebody always is.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.920]   I'll tell you something that'll really get you upset.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:43.680]   Don't take your Ubuntu laptop on an airplane because even though it's Ubuntu, if it's a,
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.360]   if it's a power book, both Qantas, Korean Airlines.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:55.400]   And now I hear from Alex Lindsay, a virgin are not allowing Dell or Apple laptops on
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.640]   their planes.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.120]   You can put a language, Virgin to.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   Oh, no.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:05.240]   Virgin, but that's what Alex said he said that he was about to get on a virgin flight
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   and they said, sorry, if you have a Macintosh or a Dell laptop.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.920]   Now now this is what's really crazy.
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.600]   Put it in your check luggage.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.440]   Let it, let it flow up in the hole.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.440]   Much safer.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.440]   Qantas is actually my preferred airline.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.960]   That really, well, luckily I just switched to a stink pad, but man, that's.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.400]   It's just, it's just insane.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.320]   It says, you know, I think that air travel, I think for air travel, what they should do
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.120]   is strip us naked, shoot us with tranquilizer darts.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.040]   Chain actually, I got a better idea.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   Ninja Airlines, right?
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:39.080]   In the middle of the night, a ninja sneaks into your room and blow darts you.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:43.440]   Saran wraps you, sticks a routing tag onto you, packs your suitcase for you, ships you
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.080]   to the other side, takes you to your hotel, slips you into the covers, unpacks your suitcase,
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.880]   stands in the window of your hotel, blow darts you with the antidote, slips silently out
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:56.760]   the window while you stretch your arms, yawn and go, I've woken up in Hong Kong.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.040]   That, that would be a perfectly safe airline.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.280]   I see people who had, blow dart allergies.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.440]   I see a new Corey Doctor O'Shade story.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.000]   Any minute now, fantastic idea.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.080]   Well, it was so couple of, but access ninja capacity.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.120]   We certainly have quite a bit of that.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.120]   Just don't fly.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.360]   I guess Qantas Virgin or a career airlines.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.960]   Just kind of hard to believe they could be that goofy.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.000]   Tuesday, we'll have another Microsoft patch Tuesday.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.880]   No major critical flaws, although there is a critical flaw in word, two thousand and
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.360]   zero day exploit.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.880]   Sorry, that's just like critical flaw in word.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.880]   It's just like, what a bizarre concept.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.960]   Yeah, what, you know, what, what could, anyway, I don't know exactly how.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   Spell check is broken.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   Oh my God.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.320]   Well, and here comes Mr. Badpipes again.
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.680]   One of the reasons there's nothing big in this one is they managed to rush, you know,
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.880]   the fastest patch in the history of Windows had last week, which was their DRM patch,
[00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:50.880]   right?
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:55.000]   Windows exploit wait till Tuesday, but if the DRM gets broken, it's coming down the pipe
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   today.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   That's a good point, isn't it?
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.640]   They don't waste any time on that.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   Do they?
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:00.640]   You're right.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.160]   Well, actually, they're, they, it's not even, it's not even that they had to create a patch.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.600]   You just know they've, they've basically have known their flaws and that much better than
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.760]   the operating system upgrades available.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:16.440]   You know, I mean, it's just, it's just, it's a matter of actually, and it's, it's some
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.000]   of their partners have and some of their partner.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.360]   And I haven't, I've been told implemented the patch for that.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:27.240]   Just, just, just for what it's worth the day after the Windows DRM patch came out, I'm
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:30.400]   told that Windows, that it was cracked too.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.040]   It doesn't take long anymore.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.440]   No, you know, the world has this efficiency of Norwegian, board Norwegian teenagers that
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.440]   Node DRM will ever stand.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.360]   Let's hope they never get together with an engine or we're in deep.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:47.760]   Well, we could have very secure over technical air dark.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.120]   They're not going to bother suing you.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.120]   They're just going to kill you in your bed.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.120]   In your bed.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.920]   If you're a second life user, you might want to log on.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.400]   Your password has been changed for your protection.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.640]   Somebody hacked into second life last week and stole a database containing every single
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.360]   name and address of every single second life member.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.680]   And apparently the passwords too, although they're encrypted just in case second life
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.680]   is, is reassigning your passwords.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   You got it.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   Well, we're on the top.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   Sorry.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   Well, we're on the topic.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.480]   You got a guy that got arrested for illegal arms dealing online.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   You can in game.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.520]   You could sell game arms.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520]   What game was it?
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.320]   Well, it was in a game called Legends of Mere, which is fairly sort of mainstream, especially
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   in the East.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:36.600]   And one of the, one of the guys that actually worked on the game basically manufactured,
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.960]   you know, through the programming tools, all these high end weapons in a spare time,
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:46.200]   sold them to two of his mates who then sold them for, for currency on eBay.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.800]   They have an escalation going on in Mere.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:49.800]   Absolutely.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.200]   And so there's all these guys, you know, racing to get the best weapons being produced by,
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.520]   by this guy on the development team who eventually got caught and, and hauled up in front of
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.040]   Melod.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.480]   The metaverse is not far off.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:03.440]   It really isn't.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:08.320]   I think in a lot of ways these online worlds are getting closer and closer to the real, real
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   thing.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.040]   You know, I've been collecting these stories because I'm doing the keynote at state of play
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.880]   this year with, with Neil Stevenson.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.360]   We're going to be talking about the metaverse in Singapore.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.280]   And this stuff is just, just coming every day.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.840]   There's more and more of these things, you know, people getting murdered over having
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:26.720]   their sword stolen and those kinds of, those kinds of weapons where they, they're limited
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.360]   supply, especially the ones that are created early in the game.
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:33.100]   And then they, the people who run the game go, you know what, they're really bad for
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:34.100]   gameplay.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.160]   They're way too powerful and they get taken out of circulation.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.440]   But you know, there's, there's two or three that we're still, you know, people managed
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.080]   to score before then.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.320]   There's all kinds of weird stories that happen with that.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:49.240]   The stuff that shakes out when you add scarcity to video games is so bizarre and cool and,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   and such amazing.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   It is really interesting.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:56.160]   Of course, Stevenson really kind of invented all this with snow crash and the, the metaverse.
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   How does he feel about this?
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.320]   Does he, does he feel like he was a prophet or is he surprised?
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.120]   He certainly articulated it and took it to a, you know, a really nice place where it was
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.640]   all about amusing yourself rather than, you know, commerce or trader.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.640]   Right.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   Right.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   I don't know how he feels about it.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.640]   I do a lot of public speaking.
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:19.840]   He's, he's, for someone who is as eloquent as he is when he writes, he's, he's a little
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.000]   hesitant when he speaks.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.200]   He, although the last time I saw him speak, he was, he was much better.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.840]   But the first time when he won his Hugo award, he might have just been overwhelmed, but he
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.120]   was really, he was really tongue tied, which I was very surprised by.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.040]   It's like, uh, William Gibson, who, or, or, or Bruce Sterling, or both really, really articulate
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.720]   when they write are also super articulate when they talk.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.720]   Bruce is a heck of a talker.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.080]   And we were able to get Neil, we tried really hard to get him on the screen.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.280]   He doesn't, he basically doesn't do television.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.280]   I've been told.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   Have you ever seen his webpage?
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   No.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   It was a log.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.280]   It was a log.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.760]   Basically, no, no, no, his webpage, which is just, it's just, it's a page on the well.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.800]   It's all like just ASCII flowing on the page.
[00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.680]   And it's basically 22 paragraphs of why he doesn't want you to send me now.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:06.040]   Oh, well, you know, I went, I was at the science fiction museum in Seattle at Paul Allen's
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.840]   science fiction museum a couple of weeks ago.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:13.120]   And they have, I didn't realize this, but Krypton Omicow, the Quicksilver trilogy was
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.400]   hand written within pencil on, on yellow pads.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.000]   And they have some of the yellow pads there.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.760]   It's kind of mind blowing to see that size of a not pencil quill pen.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   You're right.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.760]   They have the quill pens.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:27.760]   They have the nibs.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:28.760]   I don't know.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:32.360]   I think it's fountain pen now because he had also found way of cartridges of fountain pen
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.360]   cartridges.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.440]   It's kind of mind blowing to think that you could write something like that by hand.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.440]   There's something, there's something cool about that.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:40.440]   It's a century set way, Leo.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.400]   But there's something cool about the physicality of writing that way.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:47.640]   You know, Linda Barry, the cartoonist, she started writing these novels and they were
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   really well received.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.280]   And she got this huge advance for a novel that eventually came and it was called Cruddy.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.280]   It's an amazing book.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.040]   And she was totally blocked on it.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:00.320]   And she took out her cartoonist paintbrush and she painted the novel five words to a page
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.800]   and big, swoopy letters and had a manuscript like seven feet tall.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   But that was how she got out of her writer's blog.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:09.840]   A lot of writers say they like that physical creation.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.040]   You use a word processor though, right, Corey?
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   Oh, hell yeah.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.720]   No, I learned to type before I learned to write cursively.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.440]   I've never written anything longer than a shopping list with a pen.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.720]   Yeah, it's physically painful for me to actually use a pen and paper.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.760]   No, I say I'm Amish for Quirty.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:31.360]   You know, they'll replace it with phones and they'll replace it with speech to text and
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.360]   all kinds of other stuff.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:37.520]   I'm just like, I've got so much muscle memory in my hands for composing that I'll never
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:38.520]   be able to switch away.
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.720]   50 years from now in the science fiction museum, the Corey doctor exhibited a saying, he used
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.720]   this keyboard.
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.480]   Yeah, yeah, you could even switch it to board.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.080]   He was actually typing Quirty.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   Unbelievable.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:55.520]   And 100 years from now it'll be any use these hands cryogenically preserved.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   Excellent.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:03.120]   Before we go on, let me let's pause for a commercial break, shall we?
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.960]   I never thought I'd be saying that on Twitter.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:12.720]   We're so glad finally to get to Dell on the air on the Twit podcast network.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.480]   Dell has been a part of our lives for many, many years.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:21.280]   I know Patrick, you remember we used Dell computers on the set of the screensavers.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.320]   We used it to Dell computers from day one.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.760]   In fact, even going farther back to other TV shows, Dell reliability.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.240]   Dell service and support really made the difference for us.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.760]   That's why I'm really glad to have them on the show.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.800]   I want to remind you about the Dell.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.520]   We have a number of Dell picks on our Dell page.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:42.160]   It's twit.tv/del.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.640]   Among others, the Dell XPS 410.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.840]   I'm really, I'm really liking this system, a good looking system that is very flexible.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:53.000]   It's one of the reasons I picked this for the show, for our launch.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.520]   Here's something you can start with a very reasonable cost with a Pentium D, but you can
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:04.240]   all go all the way up to a Core 2 Duo at 2.66 gigahertz, depending on your needs and what
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   you want.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.040]   Of course, Dell has always made the best monitors and peripherals, so you've got a great package.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.760]   I encourage you to check out the Dell specials.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:22.040]   Twit picks of the week every week, and I'll add some more as the week goes by to twit.tv/del.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.640]   There's actually some good little specials in there.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.920]   Little things we've dug up for you.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   twit.tv/del.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.560]   Thanks, Dell, for your support of the Twit podcasting network.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.080]   We of course also want to welcome Visa.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.960]   They've been here for a couple of weeks now.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.160]   I love this.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:47.560]   I owe a nod to the thanks to Paul Colligan and his blog, PaulColligan.com, in which Paul
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.120]   examines the reality of profitable podcasting.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:57.240]   He noted that we started where our Visa ads last week, this week in tech.
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.240]   I love it.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.640]   He said, "Advertizing his entered Twit, and guess what?
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.640]   The show is still great.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.840]   The groove is still there.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.600]   Nobody looks at Leo and company's sellouts.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.920]   In fact, he went out and bought lunch using his Visa card that day."
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   So thank you.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.160]   I appreciate it, Paul.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.640]   Visa is really to remind you that they are working very hard to protect you when you
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.040]   buy online with Visa, you are absolutely protected.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.880]   In more ways than you might realize, of course, you know that they back up all purchases
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:32.120]   online, but they also use a very sophisticated fraud prevention technologies to make sure
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.440]   that your purchases online or off are protected, that you're not being defrauded, that you're
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.360]   not being ripped off.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.280]   They call this continuous monitoring, they use very sophisticated software to keep an
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.480]   eye on your patterns.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.320]   If their sudden changes, they call you and say, "Hey, did you do that?
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   Did you buy this?"
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.200]   It's happened to me and I really appreciate it.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.160]   It's a great early warning system.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.880]   Visa reminds you to sign your Visa card on the Signature Panel, choose a pin that's unique
[00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:57.880]   and secret.
[00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:03.080]   Don't write it on the card, memorize it, and do check your statements online or via paper
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.240]   I use online statements.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.960]   It's a little easier regularly to make sure that your account is being used the way you
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.360]   intended.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.520]   Visa, better, safer money.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.800]   Life takes Visa.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:21.560]   I do really want to thank everybody for joining us and remind people that right at the beginning
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.680]   we talked about emailing gwen@ef.org.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.920]   That's true for podcasters.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.040]   What if you're not a podcaster, Corey?
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.760]   How should people get involved in the WIPO battle?
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:36.800]   If you're not a podcaster, the best way to get involved is to get in touch with your
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.000]   trade representative if you're not an American and tell them how you feel about it or your
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   government.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.080]   The other thing to get to do in general is to get involved with EFF and like-minded groups
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.600]   all around the world in the UK.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.040]   I'm sure you know Org, the open rights group, and in Canada there's work.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:57.240]   The Org is the Canadian one, online rights Canada.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:03.080]   There's bits of freedom in Netherlands and there's groups like this all over the world.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.920]   There should be a directory for this because we have listeners all over the world.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.480]   I'd love to send people to one spot where they could find their local...
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.200]   It's a great project.
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.560]   You'll find an intern to put something like that together for me this year.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.640]   The other thing is every campus now can have its own chapter of freeculture.org.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.520]   We're just starting the first one up at USC on Monday.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520]   What's freeculture.org?
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.520]   That's a neat idea.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.520]   Sounds good.
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.040]   It's a campus organization that came out of the Swarthmore Kids who got sued by Deebold
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.800]   for publishing that whistleblower memo where a whistleblower or a debold basically said
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.040]   they were committing this electoral fraud.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.120]   Deebold said, "Well, yeah, it's true, but the memo is a copyrighted work.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.240]   You can't circulate it and sue these Swarthmore Kids."
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:47.480]   When they founded this group called Free Culture and the Free Culture Kids on different
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.840]   campuses have done everything from organized art galleries and live shows of creative commons
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:56.600]   license music to street demonstrations to the Free Culture and why you guys have been
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   trying to do it.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.640]   Our kids have been trying to do a thing where they're going to get 10,000 World of Warcraft
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   players to switch to the Chinese server and then paste in web pages that are blocked
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.840]   by the Great Firewall of China when people ask them to.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.640]   Just all kinds of really creative, amazing stuff.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   They're really good.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.640]   Fantastic.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.000]   I see there's one in Toronto too.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   That's great.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.520]   Are you in LA now, Corey?
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:17.520]   I am.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520]   I'm in Angelino.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.160]   I'm looking for some unnecessary cosmetic surgery just to cement my relationship with
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160]   the sitting.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.280]   It's a really disturbing image.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.160]   You want to do eyelids, breasts, butt?
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   What do you want?
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.080]   I was thinking about Smappo.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.840]   It's kind of like Botox, right?
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.280]   Except it's instead of getting Brazilian wax, you get smallpox or Smappo and you never
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.880]   grow hair anymore.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.680]   Okay, let's do it.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:47.240]   Are there any unpleasant side effects, sausage fingers, flatulence, anything I should worry
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   about?
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.240]   Dying.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.240]   Dying.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.800]   Well, you never do have hair again though.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   That's the case.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.800]   But you sterility, dying plagues, horrible source.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.000]   You know, it's been a bunch of time in England.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.240]   Have you been reading the Quicksilver books?
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.760]   Stephen, I started rereading Quicksilver yesterday, the Stevenson book.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:07.760]   They're great.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.480]   You know, I couldn't get through it.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:14.280]   I tried, you know, I'm a huge fan and just for some reason I couldn't get through it.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   I don't know why.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280]   You know what, they're like a curry.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:21.440]   They start off really mild and you might even find them bland in places and then they rebound
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.440]   on you.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.840]   Your mouth is getting uncomfortably hot the more you read.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.840]   It's they're really good.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.840]   I'll give them a chance.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.840]   They're really, really good.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.840]   Folks, thanks for joining us.

[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:40.640]   enthusiast site.

[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.400]   CPC Magazine has given you a nice big plug down on the front page.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   That's a good thing.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.400]   That's a good thing.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.880]   Cory, Dr. OERG, if you're in the US anywhere else you'd like people to go, I guess, craphounds.com.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:07.560]   I'm sure for books in going for my blogging and whatever you happen to be, freeculture.org.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.320]   Raise the free culture.

[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.800]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.800]   Do it the Twit.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.800]   All right.
