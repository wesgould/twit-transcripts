[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   Happily named to it. Great panel here. We do have a lot to talk about. Let's start with
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.080]   Serenity Call. Well just back from CES. Bye.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.480]   Bye.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.680]   I'm more.com. You were part of that big mobile nations. You took over the old booth we used to use.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.240]   Yes. CES live. We did it with Gipi and Tom's.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.000]   Tom's hardware. Yeah. It was great.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.600]   Yeah. It was really fun. And you were the star of the show I might add.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.240]   Oh no. Oh yeah. But now Renee Richie was, I mean you had a good bunch of supporting cast.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.600]   Yeah. I feel like Georgia Dow and Anthony Kisselli get all the props because they were
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.520]   yeah. Georgia is basically the queen of making crazy videos that Trey shows and she was,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.880]   I was basically stealing all of her stuff. She and then Anthony, her husband was the one sort of
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.800]   filming all of it all the time. It was, it was his last a really, really good time.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   It's great to have you back. We'll ask you what you saw and liked and thought was of interest.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.000]   They're also with us a first timer from the register, which is of course the greatest place
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.720]   to go to get tech snark. I've been reading it for how long, it's been a long time. Ian Thompson is
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.840]   here. Hi Ian. Hi there. Thank you. When did the register start? 94. Wow. Yeah. 20 years old, old
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.040]   man. It's just sold out as an email list and then went on, then went web and yeah. Sometimes I was
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.720]   talking to the publisher last week and he was just like, yeah, it's 20 years. We should do
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.880]   something but we're kind of busy. So just carry on. And of course the great vulture logo, the icon.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.080]   I'm biting the hand that feeds it indeed. Yes. Was it more it focused in the early days or?
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.240]   Oh, it was totally it focused. I mean, the whole thing was a reaction against all the
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.080]   all the computing magazines were so terrible. Terrible. Yeah. It was like, and this computer
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.920]   does this and it has this and this and this and it's just like, oh, let's have some fun. You know,
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.280]   I mean, it's yeah. So we took the tabloid style, red top red top tablets from the UK style and
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.160]   applied that to the headlines. And yeah, it's people seem to like it. So we're banging around for a
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.840]   while and great writing in kind of the tradition of, you know, the spectator and punch and the great
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.560]   British have so much in Silicon Valley is just a aching to have the big stake in it. There are
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.680]   an awful lot of people with massive sticks up their backs who really should just chill out and
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.480]   take themselves a lot less seriously. And you've been how long in the States were you assigned here?
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.760]   Like I came over for years posting in 2008 and wow, I've got to say it's a lovely place to live and
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.800]   I kept on extending and extending. Great. Yes. And now I've met a local girl and settled down.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.440]   I think I'll be here for the duration. So also British winters are terrible this time of year.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.520]   Much better here. Oh, yes. Yes. Much better here. Just think like a snow, but you know, can't have
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.160]   everything. I've been stalling because I want to wait till the oh my gosh till the game finishes
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:05.040]   and I think it just finished. So it's my guess it just finished. So we can now welcome
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.760]   are you a Seahawks fan or a Packers fan Ben Thomas? I'm a Packers fan and it's not over,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.960]   but Seattle just took the lead. So yeah, it's a minute 25. Yeah, it's not over. In fact,
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.360]   you probably won't be with us for another couple of minutes. Well, actually, I don't have it.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.800]   It's not on TV here. So oh, it's more muddling along with with. Can we point a camera at the
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.280]   we got to figure because I got to do this without violating NFL rules. But I think we could feed
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.960]   you our video and then you'd really be distracted. I could stream. I mean, I could find ways to
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   stream it. But that would that would ruin the stream. But we should mention that Ben Thompson,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.480]   of course, it's trajectory, which is the best, most insightful independent tech blog I know of
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.760]   is in Taipei, Taiwan. So yes, and it's early in the morning. And agonizing through the
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.360]   end of this game here. I didn't know you were packing a little looking a little grim right now.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.840]   I wouldn't have booked you. You know what? You got Rogers? He's got a great two minute drill.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.680]   I think it's not over till the linebacker sings. Yeah, I was at the times actually. And I think I
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.360]   must have missed calculate the time zone because I was sure it'd be be well over by now. But that's
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.680]   fine. I know. Well, you're not watching. What are you watching? Like a text fee? Are you somebody
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.520]   texting you the score? No, I mean, you could follow the like the game. Oh, yeah. And NFL.com.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.640]   They have kind of a thing. Yeah. Yeah. I'll give you a play by play.
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.080]   No, I mean, so now a big guy in the black outfit.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.720]   He's he's it looks like he's wearing tights. I have to say, and he's running and he's kicking the ball.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.280]   It looks like it was he did all the way down to the other end. So that's good, right? And then
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.760]   a guy's running with it. But they oh my God, they're hurting him. And then and then
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:09.280]   that's likely running. So Aaron Rogers has 12 game winning drives and 37 opportunities. He's 32
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   for this particular situation. But I'll tell you, there are not many quarterbacks in the NFL.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.360]   You'd rather have there. I'll tell you what, Ben, you keep watching the game. There we go.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.720]   There we go. We have the we have the footage now. I dialed into the fees direct from the game.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.000]   Number one is running around. He's really exciting. Number two is in a fist fight,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.480]   it looks like, but he's he's falling down now. And now number one's running around in a circle.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.960]   Do it. Actually, go back the other way. The most crazy number two is again,
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.680]   falling down. That's terrible. Number one's just running back and forth and forth and back.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.920]   It's terrible. I think that's Russell Wilson, isn't it? Oh, just the humanity.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:59.440]   This is cruel. He's just playing with the classic. Yeah, it's a cool ball. You
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.840]   you Bo Jackson, you basically see if you can run the entire quarter. Oh, that's interesting. Really?
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.120]   This is it. This is an old classic. It's Atari Sega. What is that?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:15.120]   Now this is this is Nintendo. Yeah, 10. Yeah. So the idea is you just keep running until they
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.280]   tackle you. Bo Jackson was basically unstoppable in this game. And so yeah, the goal was to do a
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.400]   running play on the first play and then see if you could run out the entire quarter. And I guess
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:33.360]   this is a speed run because yeah, Bo Jackson touchdown. There you go. Bo knows football.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.720]   And baseball. Oh boy. So I, you know, I figure out a way to distract so that Ben could continue
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.120]   to watch the game. I'm just going to ask Ian about the hey, what about that David Cameron, huh?
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:52.160]   I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. British Prime Minister David Cameron, we actually should get the video
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:58.480]   of this. He's speaking at something called shame, you know, the future. But now he's he's
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.000]   there's an election coming up. Yeah, there's an election coming up. They do too. We choose
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.760]   when we have the government chooses when it has a selection, but has a deadline. So he has to call
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.800]   it by May 7th. Yeah. So there's some heavy electioneering going on, which is why he's over here with
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.040]   Obama to sort of show that he can power up with the world leaders just like everyone else,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.440]   even though the two apparently don't get on that well, if gossip is to be believed anyway.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:31.280]   So he and is he challenged by UK IP or? Well, UK IP, you can't will only take supporters really
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.600]   from conservatives because they're kind of like the rabid wing of the conservative party who's
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.080]   attitude towards foreigners is standing at the English channel and shouting, just leave the wine
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:48.000]   and cheese and bugger off. So I hypothesize that maybe he's feeling some heat from your kip
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.760]   and has to take and has to kind of be strong. Yeah, he's this is very much I mean, he's seen as
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.360]   there's a very sort of limp character, if you like, and he needs to try and sort of beef up the
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.800]   toughness of the conservative policy to try and hold off you, Kip, on this he's bucking completely
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:14.720]   up the wrong tree. So he said that he believed that it would be a critical for law enforcement.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:21.440]   And this is in the wake of the terrorist attacks at Paris, that there that there be no communications
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.960]   that law enforcement can't read. Yes. In other words, no crypto or crypto must always have a
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.480]   backdoor for law enforcement. And he said, there's nothing to fear here because the home secretary
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.920]   will have to sign a warrant. Yes. So which why what's all the worry about this? Well, that's part
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.600]   of the problem. The home secretary is the truth is Theresa May, who is let's just say she's
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.840]   technology challenge should be a nice way to put it. And when it comes to human rights,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.360]   she's was famously criticized by her predecessor in the position as being as making remarks that
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.240]   were described as childlike and incompetent. And when he was forced to apologize, she was
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.760]   conservative and fellow conservative. He said, I regret the language that I used. And does that
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.600]   mean you regret the words? The language that I used? And yet he was careful not to call for a new law.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:14.160]   Well, I think to be honest, he's calling for this, but he must know deep down unless he
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.960]   that this isn't going to work. The security services would love something like this. He would
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.160]   introduce a new law in the next session, a parliament is what he's saying to banning cryptids
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.640]   applications, whether or not you get it through and whether or not you might see sense before,
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:34.160]   then remains to be seen. But it's electioneering. So there's a certain flexibility in what you say
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.120]   you will do and what you'll actually do because it's really just at this stage, trying to garner as
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:46.320]   many votes as possible. It does seem to me, and I got a lot of emails from our UK viewers showing
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.920]   real concern, but it does seem to be almost impossible to enforce a law that prevents encryption.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.520]   Well, this is it. I mean, Apple and Google and Microsoft are going up against their own
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:00.320]   government about this. So if they honestly believe that their former colonial masters are going to
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.000]   be able to say, actually, you're going to have to do what we want you to do, not going to happen.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.200]   So it's one of those things that sounds like a great policy idea, but in terms of actually getting
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.240]   into working practice, just it really isn't going to work. We're going to have to keep talking about
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.360]   this because they're now going into overtime. Then they just open up for advertising break,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.480]   just being a market for all of it. So I'm just spent playing. I didn't even have to know that I
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   didn't even have to know the score to see to know that because I saw Ben go. I mean, the thing is
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.920]   with the all the dead space, yes, I fully admit it's a problem in most games, but you get in a
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.200]   game like this where it's, you know, it's just unbelievably intense. I mean, it's like, it's
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.320]   sitting with baseball. I mean, I personally am not a huge baseball fan, but when you get to the post
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.000]   season, just like every pitch is so much weight on it. Yeah, this is exciting.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.920]   The stress. So we'll let you the anticipation. We'll let you continue to watch.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.200]   Now it's fine. Bo Jackson is now crossed the
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:08.880]   I just think, yeah, it's one of those. I was going to make a smart column, my camera,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.640]   but you're right. I'm totally, I'm totally distracted. Yeah, go ahead. Pay attention.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.800]   It's more important. The game's more important. What's scary? It's like, what is there? It's like,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.240]   what is there to say? It's crazy. It's well, the only thing I would say is just like,
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:28.000]   we and I've written about this previously is I think like there's some aspect of we intact, you
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.160]   know, like it's clearly these people have no idea how how this works. I mean, because you can't,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.640]   you know, it's so obvious to us that if you put it in a backdoor for law enforcement,
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.160]   you're by definition putting it in a backdoor for everyone else in the world. And that clearly,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.200]   at least it seems to be clearly doesn't resonate or doesn't make sense to people. And I mean,
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:59.280]   at some point, part of it has to be beyond just like going nuts about this stuff. Actually,
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.560]   I'm trying to help people understand like how how this stuff works.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.480]   Corey, Dr. O'Rodham, Blaine Boing, what David Cameron just proposed was in danger. Every
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:13.200]   Britain and destroy the IT industry. He says, if they understood the technology, they'd be
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.320]   shocked to their boots that this and he gives actually a list of why this is a terrible idea.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.040]   He says Cameron is proposing first, all Britain's communications must be easy for criminals,
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.360]   voyeurs and foreign spies to intercept. Because you put a backdoor in.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.200]   Well, I mean, particularly if you put a backdoor in and you tell people you putting a backdoor in,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.960]   it's going to be like the sort of the Manhattan Project to find this backdoor, exploit it and,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.360]   you know, the whole thing's toast. It's a ridiculous process.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.800]   It's worse than that too, because if you think about the incentives and what the addressable
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.240]   market is to use like business terms, like for the government, they are trying to prevent
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.480]   something from not happening, which is already kind of problematic from an incentive perspective
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   and a child perspective. And two, they're looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.480]   If you're a criminal just looking to skim off credit card details or whatever,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.480]   or personal information or whatever it might be, like the world is your oyster now, you can
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.040]   attack everyone. And not only that, but there's a very high incentive from a monetary perspective
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:19.120]   to do so. So like almost by definition, there's going to be way more break-ins and successful ones
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.880]   by their criteria by not at all like terrorist bad guys, just run of the mill bad guys.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:30.640]   Or boy, there is people who want to snoop. No, totally. And so like just from a pure kind of
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:38.720]   incentive and like theory perspective, it's clearly going to fall very heavily on the
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.920]   vast food people that aren't even involved. And we haven't talked about the most obvious thing,
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.000]   which is like how many people have died of terrorism in the last 10, 15 years and how
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.400]   many people have died from car accidents or alcohol or all this sort of stuff. It's just a
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:58.240]   total lack of perspective that gets back to kind of more more fundamental questions about like
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.720]   society and like what motivates people and like what's the incentive here and who's really
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:12.320]   benefiting. We should point out that the ministers in Parliament have encryption that it has no
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.520]   backdoor. Oh, yes. There's no issue. No, no, no. I mean, yes, if you look through the number of
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.360]   people who are actually using PGP and standard encryption techniques, they're all using them.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.520]   That's fine. But you know, if it goes to the general populace and things could get routed.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.440]   Then you have to go to Apple and say messages has to either have a backdoor, you have to leave
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.840]   your iPhone at the border. Exactly. You're going to have to go to Microsoft to say Bitlocker has to
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.680]   have a backdoor or no Windows sales in the UK. It's just it's unenforceable and clearly Cameron
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.520]   must know that what scares me a little bit is that the thing is I've got a worrying feeling that he
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.800]   doesn't. I got to get the thing worse. He came up with this idea and thought, right, okay, that'll
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.720]   show I'm tough on on a non-cyber crime as he likes to call it. But I mean, the fact is, if
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.440]   GCHQ, which is our equivalent of the NSA, wants to get your encryption keys, they could do it either
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.200]   by physically breaking into your house and it's getting up. Give me your private keys, dude.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.080]   Or by hacking your system. So there's no real need for this. Yeah. But I mean, GCHQ are pretty
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.760]   damn good at this. Here's what scares me because he is in the United States, Cameron is in the
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.640]   United States, meaning with Obama. And he and the president had a press conference two days ago,
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.920]   in which it sounded like Obama was sympathetic. Yeah, I read that and I was just like, wow,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.840]   that's he said we're still going to have to find ways to make sure that if an al-Qaeda affiliate
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.560]   is operating in Great Britain or the US that we could try to prevent real tragedies,
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.120]   I think the companies, he's talking about the technology companies want to see that as well,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.560]   their patriots, they have families they want to see protected. He does mention that there are
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.200]   technical issues. Can you say think of the children or is that a little bit sickly?
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.320]   He says think of the children. Think of the women and children. We've had this ever since,
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.960]   you know, for the last year or so law enforcement, the director of the FBI is saying it would stop
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.480]   us from getting from rescuing kidnapped children. It is to be fair. It isn't Cameron invented this.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.520]   No, no, it's I mean, it's James Comey, the director of FBI called for it a couple of months ago. And
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.680]   frankly, the FBI has been calling for this for decades. But I mean, I was going to say we were
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.080]   fighting this battle decades ago with the initial crypto battles and we thought we'd won it,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.720]   but they keep on coming back with this. And it's just designing good crypto is hard enough,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.360]   designing good crypto with a backdoor that no one else can exploit. Just forget about it.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.440]   It's never going to happen. So it's impossible. It is like, where are we impossible?
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.320]   It's safe then to say based on all of this and all our serenity, get her, get her, give her a
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.480]   chance that this is just politics and no one really intends for such a thing to happen.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.400]   I think yes and no. I mean, on one hand, you do definitely have the both the president and the
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.480]   prime minister basically probably having a certain amount of pressure from security agencies and
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.320]   from national security basically saying, hey, if you put your voice behind it, this would mean a
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.640]   lot more, it's more weight. Maybe the public is more receptive than the big mean over arcing
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.840]   security agencies being like, we really need this. But the fact of the matter is I really,
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.120]   the lack of understanding is the which Ben mentioned is the real danger here,
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:20.800]   where I just I really don't think of the majority of people on the hill in DC and not in Britain
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:28.000]   or Europe either really have any good idea of just how ridiculous trying to put a backdoor
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.960]   is into a high crypto system. It's just it's baffling to me. Like I think just it just doesn't work.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.160]   What's fascinating is at the same time and the Guardian had this story, there was five years ago
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:48.800]   a secret report on cybersecurity from the United States, I think it was the DoD in which it said
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.760]   that strong encryption is necessary to protect the United States.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.880]   Yeah, the FBI had that on the website up until 2011.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.160]   Yeah, take that down.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.600]   This is the question about the question they said about that the companies companies ought to be
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.080]   patriotic. Oh, that's to me, that's scary. Last refugee scoundrel. Yes. Yeah, there's
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.360]   their families. Well, there's lots. There's lots of impact there. I mean, for one, I mean,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.520]   these companies are all serving people around the world. And there's obviously an implicit,
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:30.000]   you know, valuing of some countries lives over others. And as someone who lives abroad and is
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.840]   married to someone who is not a US national, that certainly is frustrating to hear,
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.760]   although it's obviously kind of sentiment. The other thing though, is if they're talking about,
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.240]   even if they are protecting about protecting citizens, this is making as Cori Doctoral
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.480]   wrote in the piece you noted, this is making citizens less safe.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.880]   And I mean, not to get if we're going to get all cold and analytical about this,
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:04.080]   if you take the kind of expected value of a terrorist attack, like the minute percentage is
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.440]   going to happen, and the chance that you or someone, any of your loved ones are going to die in that
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:18.080]   terrorist attack, and compare that to the expected loss per person of having bad encryption or these
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.840]   quote unquote back doors, then the reality is, is you're actually, you are, you are, you are hurting
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:30.160]   people. And so you ask, is this politics or is this a knowledge? I mean, I think it's probably both.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.360]   I suspect by extraordinary said, it's not really understanding how this works and that you're
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.680]   asking for a unicorn here. But it also is, is that, and this is endemic in our politics, is that
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:49.120]   terrorist attacks are scary. Standing up against them is brave. And it's easy. It's easy in that
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   it doesn't really require meaningful sacrifices from a political perspective, even if it is hurting
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.200]   us in all these other ways. And that, you know, it's, it's, it's all, it's all, it's all very
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.960]   frustrating. And it's frustrating in a, in a small and big picture perspective.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:12.720]   Yeah, it's the same idea of calling for like, yes, we need to be safe from all attacks. Okay,
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:19.760]   what are you or we need to bring down the national debt. Okay, how? And the, we'll just put it in
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:25.280]   a back door. Yeah, you know, that doesn't actually work. We'll do it. It's fine. Well, let me play.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:31.920]   Let me be a little bit of a devil's advocate. Ever. Okay, I understand the technical issues here.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:38.960]   It's not, it's hard to do. And it's very, very hard to do. But if the mandate and the mandate
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:46.560]   certainly from our government has been protect us, NSA, FBI, CIA protect us. Yeah.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.680]   Isn't it critical that there be some way? I mean, we know that the electronic monitoring of
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.480]   communications has been useful. Does help protect us? Does it not?
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:04.240]   In terms of doing it on a mass scale, the jury is still very much household.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:11.200]   Torture. Well, you know, there are two different questions, right? Like, I think the mass surveillance,
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.120]   yes, the jury is very much still out. But that's a completely different question than
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:27.520]   mandating the insertion of back doors. Like, is it possible to, for these agencies to do their job,
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.680]   if criminals and terrorists can communicate freely.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.640]   Criminals and terrorists are always going to be able to communicate.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:41.440]   They can't stop that. Not really. No, without banning telephone, mail, and access to the internet.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.200]   Right. I mean, the fundamental problem is that mass surveillance brings you such a
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.760]   deluge of information that the chances of picking an actual terrorist conversation after that.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.920]   But I'll give you an example, and maybe this is a spurious example, but after the attacks
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.680]   at Charlie Hebdo, one of the things that we heard was, ah, the NSA is now going to go back
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.040]   through this massive pool of information and try to make connections, because now we have the end
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.320]   point and backtrack from the end point to prior communications, which they would not have had
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.360]   they not been collecting this information all along, but that's perhaps figure out who planned
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   this attack, who are co-conspirators, where other attacks may be coming from. Isn't that
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   valuable information? If that comes from the mass collection of data. I mean, yes, but you're
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.440]   talking about going back after the event. So it's not exactly keeping us safe. Well, they should
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.120]   have been doing it. I mean, well, but it also could be known. It could be keeping us safe going
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.520]   forward as well, because maybe you find out there are other co-conspirators. Maybe you find the ring.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.760]   There are, I mean, I mean, these guys had been to Yemen and come back. They should have been on
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.840]   a watch list anyway. They were on a watch list. They weren't a watch list. The government had
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.400]   been watching them. They had recorded tons of their conversations or recorded or tracked or
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.640]   had the metadata or whatever it is. Like the issue, additional, there was nothing that
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.840]   additional that tech company or else could have done to prevent what happened in Paris as tragic
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:08.880]   as it was. Like it was a fall down after the fact, which by the way, was the same thing with 9/11.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.640]   The fall down there was not in getting enough information to know it was going to happen. It
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.400]   was actually putting the pieces together and stopping it. So it's another example of,
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.640]   I think this is an easy thing to ask for. It was easy from a political perspective, even though it
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.600]   is impossible. You can't put it back to us for a second.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.760]   It's a very important question. It's a lot harder to do good police work and to actually
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.080]   prevent this from happening. And this is a good way to distract attention from the fact that
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.840]   that didn't happen. Just give us these technological means and somehow magically this will all work better.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:49.280]   Well, they're not asking for, sorry, Leo. They're not asking for the tech to help them sort through
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.000]   the data. They're asking for just the raw data. It's collective.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.960]   Well, exactly. And we've seen already that just having a raw stream of data,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.600]   I mean, it's like looking at the Twitter firehose, like without good tools to sort and understand.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.600]   I mean, you go back to World War II and the Enigma machine and everything like that.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.400]   But would you kind of presume, serenity, that they are working very hard on data mining techniques
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.600]   and big data is, I mean, there's very smart people that, you know, a lot of this stuff is just stored
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.480]   presuming that we'll have some better data mining techniques in the future.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.360]   Yeah, but it's just interesting to me that they're calling just specifically for that,
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.960]   where they're saying, we're going to call for the thing that maybe we think the public will
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:33.760]   understand better and will make us look more sympathetic to the cause of freedom rather than
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.880]   let's actually say, all right, we're going to put our money where our mouth is and let's
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.360]   let's actively recruit at MIT and let's actively recruit and say,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.560]   I think they're doing that. They'll make things better. I think they're doing it.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.080]   I think they're doing it. They're just not publicizing that they're saying, you know,
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.560]   instead of instead of getting all the data, let's talk about getting, you know, let's get
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.840]   let's get smarter algorithms and smarter people. And let's focus on making making the system the
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.840]   best it possibly can be. Well, I'm talking the chat room says, well, then the bad guys just use
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.280]   paper mail because in the US anyway, that's what strong protection there, much better protection
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.880]   for paper mail than there is for data. Well, I mean, David Cameron said, oh, we've always
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.360]   had the ability to read your mail. Oh, thank you. What? Well, no, but also if you actually,
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   they haven't they've had the ability to open the mail. But if you're writing an encryption to
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:25.200]   someone else, they still got to break the encryption in the first place. So they're kind of asking
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.680]   for free parcels. Let me let me ask this. And maybe you're so close to China, you might know
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:37.360]   Ben, is there any country in the world currently effectively pursuing this strategy? Backdoors
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.120]   and encryption. Nobody's doing it. I mean, you've got some of the most oppressive regimes in the
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.240]   world. I'm sure China would love to do this. They can't they're not doing it. Are they?
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:50.560]   Well, I mean, that's complicated question. I want to get you in trouble. And by the way,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.600]   you can pay attention now, as you know, the game is over. But don't say who won.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.480]   Yeah. Well, I don't think the glove look off my face.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:06.400]   This is a positive, I think, for the for the US is the fact that we're even having this
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.720]   conversation. I was actually going to say something similar, you know, along these lines.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:17.520]   Is you know, the relative freedom we have on the net or anywhere else is
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:24.640]   why years ahead of a place like China, where where everything is tracked. Everything is
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   is looked into. There's a, you know, I in the other issue is because these companies are based
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.400]   in the US because our technology industry is so strong, that's where the pressure can be applied.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:43.520]   I mean, the if there are services that don't come, it's very, it's a very, it's a very
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.000]   questionable if there are services that don't comply to China and try and just ban them.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.640]   They certainly, you know, they've obviously banned Google. They've banned Twitter. They've
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:57.040]   banned Facebook. They banned other messaging services like line, for example. And then when
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.320]   it comes to ones that do work there, like say, we chat, it's kind of assumed among everyone that
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.520]   was there that the government is tracking everything on there. So I mean, relatively speaking, if
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:14.800]   you compare somewhere like China, our freedoms are still far ahead. And the government is being
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   far more egregious in violating, you know, whatever privacy you may or may not have.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.080]   So in that, I mean, I guess everything is relative.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.480]   Is it what is the sense? I know Ian, you live here now, but
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.600]   sometimes I feel like GCHQ is worse than the NSA.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.840]   Well, it's a subject of some debate. It's got to be said. I mean, the two work very closely,
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:47.360]   hand in hand. GCHQ, however, just hasn't faced the publicity problems that the NSA has.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.400]   There was no Edward Snowden.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.960]   There was no Edward Snowden, and they've just had a parliamentary inquiry into mass surveillance,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.160]   and GCHQ were cleared completely of, in time everything they were doing was entirely within the law.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.560]   The CIA, the internal investigation of the CIA,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.280]   spokes who broke into Congress's computers, and said, Oh, no, they're okay.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.240]   Everyone says the Americans don't get irony, and you did it beautifully that day.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.600]   Oh, no, we did an internal investigation.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.840]   There's nothing to see here. Move along.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.640]   I mean, GCHQ have a long record of doing this stuff,
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.520]   a phone monitoring about people's mail and the whole thing.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.000]   I have said this again and again, and I really feel strongly that that probably most of them,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.240]   if not all of them, are patriots and do want to do the right thing and protect people from
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:36.640]   terrorist attacks. Well, the Patriots is a very challenging one because the reality is,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:44.480]   is that these revelations, particularly the snow revelations, have hurt U.S. tech companies,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:51.040]   full stop. And we're only just now seeing that hurt manifest itself because there are lots of
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.440]   countries, including countries like Brazil, but particularly like China,
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.080]   undertook significant efforts to extricate themselves from dependence on U.S. tech companies
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   in order to avoid this. I think one company in particular that's been heard or will be
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.160]   because you've been heard is a company like Cisco, for example, which you don't really think about,
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:16.880]   but China is well underway and has been really been accelerated by the snow revelations
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.000]   to build, having their entire infrastructure be completely homegrown.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.400]   And that's literally dollars and cents that are not flowing into the U.S.,
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.560]   that are not flowing into the U.S. economy. And that's just one example of many,
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:39.600]   where this has hurt the U.S. and has hurt U.S. tech companies. So it's a little rich for the U.S.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.760]   to be, the reality is, is it is U.S. tech companies that have borne the greatest cost
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:50.800]   of the snow revelations to date. And it's a little rich at that kind of they're going back
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:57.920]   to the well, as it were. And so I, again, the whole patriotic question is certainly a little
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.840]   fraught. You cannot make, I know people make the argument that these U.S. companies were
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:08.720]   established and thrived because of being in the U.S. and the environment there and all that sort
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:18.320]   of thing. At the same time, their customers, in many cases, a majority of their customers are not
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.400]   in the U.S. And there's a lot of tension here. I don't think it's any company's charter to further
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.840]   a particular country. And so there's a lot of tension there for companies as well.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:43.200]   Can we then safely conclude this by saying, enforcing this as a non-starter, but politically,
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:49.280]   as well as technically, but... No, again, politically, it's a great idea. I mean,
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.360]   the reason... Yeah, but I don't think Congress would be reluctant, and I'm sure parliament would
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.480]   be reluctant to pass a bill that would not only be technically unenforceable, but would be flouted
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.720]   so widely that it would become a joke. See, they have done it before.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:11.680]   No, you were such an optimist. I try to be. I try to be.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.800]   But the UK government has done this before. They instituted their famous... They didn't call it
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:22.880]   this, but a porn filter across the entire country. So that if you wanted to receive an unfiltered
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.360]   internet stream, then you had to actually opt in and have been seen as going to your telecommunications
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:33.280]   for a while. To be honest, I think about just under 15% of people have opted out and said,
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.960]   "No, I don't want anything naughty on my screen." When they've tried well, because when they've
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.360]   tried to implement the ban, they've blocked perfectly normal sites, which were false positives.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:52.720]   And it's easy enough to get around with a VPN. And to be honest, it keeps a certain section
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.600]   of the Conservative Party but a populace happy and it's widely ignored by everyone else.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:03.120]   The danger with this is if they actually tried to enforce it, as has been said, it would destroy
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.720]   the IT industry in the UK. It wouldn't be nobody would want to sell us products because they'd have
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:13.360]   to do so much to them to make them compliant. It's just, it's like I say, it's one of those
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.080]   things that sounds great, but actually to do it, I think, was ahead will prevail.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.680]   I believe so too. Although I get a lot of email and a lot of tweets from people say,
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.240]   "Oh, you're an optimist, Leo." They'll pass this in a heartbeat.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.920]   I feel like that's a risky business.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.280]   But yourself in a very difficult situation with regards to the rest of the world.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.200]   UK is 60 million people who's really going to change the world standards.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   Apple just says, "Okay, fine. You don't want iPhones? No problem?"
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:48.960]   Well, it's encouraging US tech companies to venture elsewhere and say, "Oh, yeah, this is going to
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:54.000]   be a problem. Yeah, not so much." Although, I have to say, I mean, Google got out of China for
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.040]   about five minutes. I mean, these companies, they're not great at being... They need money.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.320]   They go for the money. They're not... They're businesses.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.960]   It's a business. Let's take a break. Serenity Caldwell is here from iMore.com.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.480]   Great to have you, as always, from the register Ian Thompson, first time on the show. So nice to
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.160]   have you, the register.co.uk or @enin Thompson.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.400]   Extra letter in the Ian. No P in the Thompson.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.000]   Yeah, I know. I know. My parents, we've had words.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.440]   And then Ben Thompson, who does have a P from Stratecaries,
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.960]   S-T-R-A-T-E-C-H-E-R-Y.com, a great panel. And Ben's just going to dry his eyes for a moment
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.080]   and compose himself. We were at the end.
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.960]   It's what... I'm actually grateful. One of the things... I've lived in...
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.320]   First Moon, which I won in 2003, is here for six years when back to the US came back.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.280]   Are you from Wisconsin? Is that why you... Yes, I'm from Wisconsin. So, I mean, I was a sports
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:02.640]   nut when I came and kind of by... I had no choice but to kind of weigh off a little bit.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.760]   You go to Sumo... I don't know. What is the big story?
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.280]   There's no symbol here. Probably... Baseball and basketball are both pretty popular.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.240]   But there's also stuff like ping pong and pool. But in general, it's less of a sporting culture.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:23.040]   And I think it was good for me personally to kind of have forced sobriety as it were when it
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.320]   comes to sports. There is a tech angle here. I'm watching them receive the trophy for the NFC
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:34.880]   Championship. And lo and behold, there's Paul Allen, who owns the Seahawks for Microsoft's partner
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.600]   and billionaire. There he's talking right now. The yellow submarine. Yeah. Yeah. Paul Allen,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:47.120]   who also owns tech TV and sold us to the highest bidder on the river. Strangest person I've ever
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   met, very odd. He also owns the Portland Tramblazers. Yes. But I think if you've got unlimited funds
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:58.240]   owning a sporting team, it's probably fun. I would tell you my team if I had no kidding.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.640]   Yeah. It's one of those things in your portfolio. Let's form a coalition, the four of us. And we'll
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.040]   just buy who should we get? We should get there's got to be a soccer club in the
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:07.460]   Oakland Raiders. The Oakland
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:11.440]   Raiders are going cheap right now. Absolutely. We can buy a week.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:17.280]   We can buy a quarter. We seem to wear the jets. Actually, I'm going to buy a mattress from Casper
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:23.120]   dot com. Yes, Casper, the online retailer premium mattress is for a fraction of the price. We have
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.280]   a couple of caspers. I got one at home. In fact, you have the video of me opening my Casper box.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:33.840]   And then I liked it so much. I got one for my son in college. Casper saves you money by selling
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.000]   you mattresses over the internet. Now you might say, "Well, wait a minute. That's no good. How am I
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.960]   going to get it? Well, it comes in a nice box. This is a queen-sized mattress in a box.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.520]   You know, it's smaller than maybe a port. You know, one of those little college refrigerators.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:52.880]   You take it out, you open it up and it becomes a beautiful, luxurious queen-sized mattress. Now,
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.480]   you may say, "Well, okay, that's finally, oh, you can get it to me, but what if I don't like it?"
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.240]   Well, this is really cool. So much better than just kind of lying on a mattress in a showroom
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.920]   for five minutes. You have 100 days to try your beautiful, comfortable Casper mattress.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.360]   If for any reason you don't like it, they'll take it back. They make it easy to return.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:15.280]   It's completely risk-free. Free deliveries? I think this will be blocked by the UK porn
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:24.400]   filters, by the way. It's kind of sensual. It's sensual. I loved it. I love my Casper. They're
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:31.120]   watching the video of me just falling. This is really into my Casper. The dog liked it too.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:36.560]   Free delivery? Painless returns with 100-day period. They're made in the USA. They're
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.040]   really wonderful. Lisa liked it too. Look at that. She just fell right asleep. Latex and memory
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.520]   foam come together to give you kind of the best of both. A mattress with just the right sink
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.840]   and just the right the bounce, just the right firmness, just and support, but just the right
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:55.920]   comfort. I can't describe it. You've got to get it. $500 for a twin, $950 for a king size.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.520]   That's a great price compared to what a mattress in the mattress store is going to cost you.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:05.760]   You'll save an additional $50 by going to Casper.com/twit. Just use the promo code TWIT
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:11.280]   and save $50 on your Casper purchase. Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:23.360]   Promo code TWIT. It is a great night's sleep. We love our Casper. I think maybe more important
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.760]   in the encryption issue is the issue of cyber warfare. We've stopped talking about Sony and
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:34.720]   whether North Korea was involved or not. Either way, it's clear that we are about to enter a
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:43.200]   digital arms race. In fact, the latest Snowden leaks from Der Spiegel talk about how the NSA is
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.520]   arming for future digital wars. Arming, but not preparing for defense.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.280]   Well, it's so hard to prepare for defense. I'm actually not the sexy one.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.600]   Well, you can get one. The sexy is attacking. No, it's worse than not preparing for defense.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.920]   We are actively weakening our defenses. This is directly correlated to the last thing
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:11.920]   with a crypto. They call them D-weapons. What is the D-data? It's digital.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:18.640]   By the way, the Geneva Convention, even though the Geneva Convention blocks A, B, and C weapons,
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.200]   atomic, biological, and chemical weapons, there's no mention of D-weapons because they didn't know.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:28.160]   What's D-weapons? There's no mention of flying laser cannons either.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.200]   Yeah. That means we can do those now. You can do it. Laser clip shocks.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.880]   Marshall McLuhan wrote about this in 1970. World War III is a guerrilla information war with no
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.600]   division between military and civilian participation. In 1970, McLuhan said that.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:51.360]   It's absolutely part of it. Now, we're right now in phase zero, which is the surveillance phase.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:57.200]   Well, it's going to get very busy very quickly. There's already been the first reports of
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:02.480]   somebody at ISIS trying to use this to track down on opponents.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.840]   Is that the problem? Is that it escalates? I mean, this is why you have the Geneva
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:11.280]   Court. Is that if one side uses chemical, the other side does and it becomes untenable.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:19.040]   I think I'm not sure it's a direct correlation so much as it's just that stuff becomes so
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.800]   cheap and easy to use. I mean, you can buy off the shelf malware for a couple hundred bucks on a
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.880]   black forum right now. And if you can use that to keep track of your political opponents or the
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:32.560]   people you're trying to rule over, it's all the defenses are so unsophisticated that pretty much
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:38.000]   anything can get through. And now that it's been kicked off, we've seen this work in Stuxnet,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.280]   everyone else is now saying, right, we've got to get into the game. I mean, earlier this week,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.880]   the Danish government said that it was going to spend $73 million developing a cyber attack and
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.280]   defense system. The Danes, I mean, no one's invaded them since the Germans. They took them
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:58.640]   over in eight hours. I mean, it's but the Danes can now punch away because it's digital and
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.560]   everyone. Yeah. Oh, you need a university, some CS graduates. According to these documents
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:11.840]   from Edward Snowden seen exclusively by Der Spiegel, the NSA is planning for the war of the future
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.960]   in which the internet will play a critical role with the aim of being able to use the net to
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.560]   paralyze computer networks. And by doing so, potentially all the infrastructure, including
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:27.440]   power and water supplies, factories, airports, the flow of money, the US Army, Navy, Marines,
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:33.120]   and Air Force already have their own cyber forces, but the NSA is taking the lead. Now,
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.080]   as with much of the Snowden material, it's not completely up to date. But for the 2013 secret
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.160]   intelligence budget, the NSA projected it would need about a billion dollars to dedicate to this
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:49.520]   computer network attack operations. And well, I mean, the only thing is, I mean, this is a,
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:58.160]   you put it in the context of that kind of APCD thing previously, but this is a difference of
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:05.200]   type and it's a problem in particular for the United States most of all. And the reason is, is
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.960]   when it comes to digital warfare, everyone, I think, you know, is referring to this, everyone's
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:15.920]   on the same, same starting position. Like there, there's no inherent advantage to having a, a
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.040]   big military. There's no inherent advantage to having a large industrial base. It's easy.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.680]   It's cheap and it scales. And, and in fact, the US is probably in a worse position because we have
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:35.200]   the largest, the most things to attack. Exactly. And so it's completely flipped on its head where
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.760]   the, the asymmetric actor, the one, the one that's that's hard and small and hard to catch
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.120]   can inflict a lot of damage. It's interesting. And the one that's large is easier to be attacked.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.160]   So it's the old tenant of the war fair. It's easy in a guerrilla war. And that's why
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:55.520]   Vietnam was so difficult. It's the, it's the mobile person who understands the terrain better.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.360]   You can disappear in an asset site doing a normal amount of that. So it's analogous to guerrilla
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:05.200]   warfare. Yeah. Well, this, the skills and what's needed don't really cost money. Right. Like, and
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:11.760]   that I just want to tell Denmark right now, not on my watch Denmark, not on my wall.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.720]   So get this. This is how he drinking Hanukkah before you know it.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:19.680]   All downhill from there. So bad. A little two board here.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:27.200]   Politrain. This is a project funded by the tailored access operations or TOW,
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:31.280]   which is a group of the NSA, the digital snipers, the Dershbeagle
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.680]   calls them are looking for interns. Now listen up kids, because this would be a great internship.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.720]   They're looking for people who are into breaking things. Potential interns are also told that
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.440]   research into third party computers might include plans to quote remotely degrade or destroy
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:52.080]   opponent computers, routers, servers, and network enabled devices by attacking the hardware.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:59.040]   There is a program called passionate polka that will allow you to remotely brick network
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:05.200]   cars, always handy program like berserker that implants persistent back doors and parasitic drivers.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:10.880]   Piece of software called barn fire that would erase the bios on a brand of servers that act
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:16.320]   as a backbone of many rival governments. The interns tasks, case you're interested,
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.520]   might also include remotely destroying the functionality of hard drives.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:27.200]   Ultimately, the goal of the internship program was developing an attacker's mind set. This listing
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.360]   is eight years old. You got to figure they found some people.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:36.480]   Well, they recruited Black Hat and Defcon each year. It's always interesting to see the NSA
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.880]   stand there and just like, "Okay." You talk to people who are attending the show and they're
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:46.640]   like, "Well, on the one hand, you get access to all this really cool technology." On the other hand,
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.360]   you might blacken your soul a bit. But on the other hand,
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.840]   Sony was working in Hawaii on a six-figure salary. I mean, it's got to be putting some people in.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.680]   Exactly. So, starts with surveillance. That's phase zero. The aim of the surveillance to detect
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.760]   vulnerabilities in enemy systems. So, that's going on right now, looking around, snooping around.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.400]   Kind of like what happened in the spring at Sony Pictures Entertainment. The first break in
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.080]   was easily ignored because nothing seemed to go wrong. At that point, the bad guys,
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:19.440]   whether from North Korea or wherever else, were able to wander the network, get passwords,
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:26.080]   get logins. And it wasn't until the fall that the actual secondary attack, phase three.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.880]   So, it's a battle. You've got the reconnaissance. You've got reconnaissance.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:28.880]   Reconnaissance.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.200]   You've got the battle plans and then whoosh you're in.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.520]   So, phase two, stealth. Go ahead, sir.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.080]   Oh, no. I was the same. Then you take everything.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.120]   You take it off. Yeah.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.200]   Stealthy implants in phase two get placed to infiltrate enemy systems,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:46.960]   then allowing permanent access. This is exactly what happened to SBE. This is the Sony Act.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.080]   Then phase three, a phase headed by the word dominate in the documents.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:58.880]   Control slash destroy critical systems and networks at will through pre-positioned accesses
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.680]   laid in phase zero. Critical infrastructure is anything considered by the agency
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:09.920]   to be important in keeping society running. So, you go after power plants, you go after communications,
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.440]   you go after transportation.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.720]   So, for instance, research on sewage systems. You actually stop a sewage system.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.440]   You can make a city uninhabitable within a matter of weeks.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:17.760]   Oh, lord.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.040]   That's amazing what these people...
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.960]   And these are very vulnerable targets. I mean, we know this. I mean, our power grid,
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:32.240]   many of the power companies in the United States are run by not governments, but third parties
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.400]   franchised by the government. They're using software that's...
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.320]   All tech, 1960s and 17s.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.360]   Windows XP machines sitting unprotected on the internet.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.360]   I know it's worse. This is Windows 3.1.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.880]   Actually, that would be safer because it's so... That couldn't do anything.
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.720]   It's just a shell.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.600]   The problem with security in general, and if there's a silver line to the Sony Hack, it's this,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:02.960]   is security is a successful security is something not happening.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:09.920]   And that's really hard to attach a value to, whereas the cost of having effective security
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:14.160]   is quite expensive. And so you talk about companies being money-making enterprises.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:19.360]   You look at the balance sheet, and on one side, there's this huge expense to have security.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.160]   And the other side, what is countering that? How do you put a price on not being hacked?
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:30.880]   There was a fascinating article from seven or eight years ago with the head of Sony
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:35.760]   Pictures Security actually basically saying that we're not going to spend too much.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.840]   What's the point of spending $10 million or something? In retrospect, we take a small amount of some
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.720]   money. He's like, "You have to... It's all balancing risks and benefits. Is this really worth it?
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:54.000]   Should we take a chance?" And in retrospect, he completely underestimated the damage that could
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:01.120]   be caused. And his approach, though, it's hilarious in retrospect, but it was very rational,
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.080]   and lots and lots of companies take that approach. It's not a we need to be secure.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.280]   It's a we need to balance the costs and benefits. The problem is the costs, I think, have been
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.440]   dramatically undervalued. And if there's one good thing that comes out of Sony, it's that people
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.760]   will properly start to properly evaluate just how much does it cost to be insecure,
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:26.080]   which will result in a lot more investment in security. And if that does happen, that's the
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.160]   equation that's going to make it happen. One of the things we want to watch closely is next
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:35.360]   week's, actually this week's now, State of the Union speech. There's a lot of interesting stuff
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:42.960]   going on. Actually, there's a bunch of stories around this, including the incredible social media
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:48.800]   strategy the Obama White House is using. They're going to give interviews to three YouTube stars,
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:55.520]   the president, because they realize fewer and fewer people are watching the State of the Union
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:01.520]   on TV. And I guess they've decided, Oh, no, we want to get those 10 year olds who watch a lot of
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:08.000]   YouTube. So that he's going to give interviews to three YouTube stars as part of this huge social
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:17.200]   media Twitter, YouTube, Reddit will get on there as well. Yeah, I sure it will. He's going to be
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:25.680]   interviewed by, according to the LA Times, not a grumpy cat. Yeah, actually, we'd be smart.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:30.720]   A teen style guru, a video blogging nerd, and a green lipstick wearing comedian who says she's
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:37.040]   ready because she's been watching Veep. Oh, great. Oh, wow. That's going to be some tough questions.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:43.840]   What's your favorite color? Let me let me be an opposite voice here. I don't understand why
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:48.640]   we are here seeing so skeptical. No, no, I mean, it wasn't that long ago that it was the weird
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.880]   geeks on the internet with a podcast and a blog and a message board that they've skipped right
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.600]   back. You do pass the podcast. That's all I'm just jealous. I mean, that's reasonable.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:08.240]   I do find it interesting how quickly many, you know, geeks and nerds or whatever term you want to use
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.280]   are so quick to turn around and mock and judge. Here's why. Here's why.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.400]   That are different than us. Here's why. And by the way, this is this, you know,
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:24.240]   the presidency has always been fairly astute. Nixon beat Humphrey in '68 because he brought in a lot
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.040]   of ad men. He'd learned his lesson from 1960 in the TV debate against Kennedy and he said, all right,
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:34.880]   this isn't going to happen again. And I'm going to market myself as a product like Tide or Coke,
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:39.280]   and I'm bringing in admin. It was the first time that admin arrived in the White House, and it was
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:44.400]   very successful. And I think what's happened is the Obama White House is digitally literate.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:51.200]   And so very similarly, they say, well, look, we've got to go to the people where they are.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:57.440]   I do have to say there's one. I nothing wrong with that. There is one concern, which is that you
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:03.360]   might tend to pick people who aren't going to ask tough questions that you might say, we're going
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:13.440]   to end around the critics, the tough informed reporters by going to people who are just, you know,
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:19.680]   lifestyle reporters. That's not an unusual strategy. That's why Bill Clinton played the saxophone.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:27.040]   Was it on Leno? Because what was it? It's like MTV.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.960]   It was on MTV. Yeah, I can't remember which one.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.240]   That's where you go because nobody in MTV is going to ask him hard questions,
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.960]   but he's going to play the sax and everybody's going to go, hey, it's cool.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.040]   I'd like to have a beer with him.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:47.040]   Even with tough questions, I feel like being able to have the dialogue opened up to folks who aren't
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:54.160]   politically literate is really important. If there are young kids and guys and girls who are
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:53:00.800]   watching YouTube tutorials on makeup or whatever, and that's their first exposure to actually being
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:06.160]   able to listen to what the president has to say outside of maybe catching half of a blog post
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:11.760]   somewhere, no, they may not be the toughest questions you might get from the room.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:16.960]   But then again, I mean, the room's filtered anyway. So it's one of those things where I feel like
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:24.080]   exposure in this case, especially, I mean, the graph of young Americans who are interested in
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:29.200]   politics and interested in participating and making their voice heard goes up and down and up and down,
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:37.920]   and there has been some decline since in 2012 and going on. I think keeping people under 30,
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:45.840]   keeping them in the public debate and being able to actually get energized to pay attention to the
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.680]   local fears is really going to be key in the next 20 years because they're going to be the
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:56.720]   generation. You're absolutely right. I stand corrected. That's absolutely true. I hope they
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.600]   will ask the president about law. He's supposedly during the state of the United
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:07.760]   States, you're going to propose new laws against hacking, which would make it a felony to intentionally
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:14.000]   access unauthorized information, even if it's just the link on Twitter. And this is a post on
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.600]   a rat as security by Robert Graham who tweeted, "Haha, New York Times accidentally posted their
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:24.480]   employee database to their website." And then he said, "And if you click on this link, you're
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:31.120]   committing a felony, or you would be under this new regime." It's not as though that
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.160]   sentences are particularly light for hackers as it is. Anyway, they can manage to get 35 years
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:42.240]   for Aaron Schwartz to face than I don't think they really need to be upping those sentences that
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.920]   much more. And some of the things they're talking about, I mean, we've got a real problem now.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.200]   And the first generation of people who bought their musical iTunes are getting ready to die.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:55.520]   And when that happens... Wait a minute, who gets hold of the iTunes password?
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.640]   Stop it! Well, no, technically you don't own that music, but most people are planning to
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.360]   leave their passwords to the next generation. But technically that would be illegal.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.760]   Right. You know, it's... You don't actually own those. That's your account. But, you know, under
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:15.200]   these charges, then sharing passwords in that way could be construed in such a way as to be a big
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:20.640]   criminal offense. One big concern is that they propose, or he will propose, upgrading hacking to
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.960]   a racketeering offense. And as you know, these RICO rules were made to help the Department of
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:33.120]   Justice fight organized crime. And they've been used widely to enrich police departments who
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:36.960]   just grab houses or boats or whatever. Well, I think you were hanging out with a bad guy.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:44.240]   It would... You could be guilty of being a hacker by just acting like a hacker. For instance,
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.360]   hanging out an IRC chat room giving advice to people could make you a member of a criminal
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.800]   enterprise, which means the FBI could confiscate all your assets without ever charging you with a
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:56:01.200]   crime. He says, "If you clicked on that Twitter link and you think you can defend yourself in
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:06.720]   court prosecutors can still use the 20-year sentence of a racketeering charge in order to force you
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:10.960]   to plea bargain down to a one-year sentence for hacking." There's some real issues about this.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:15.920]   This is a good article to read. I hope the YouTubers who interview the president get a chance to read
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.400]   this and ask him some good questions. But it comes by the same problem with politics,
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:24.560]   as you and Ben were saying, and that politically this sounds great. Let's get tough on hackers.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:30.560]   Or war on hackers who gets that in practice. The whole thing is a pointless and b-actively
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:35.920]   counterproductive. Yeah. Well, if you look at it also... Go ahead, Serenity. No, go ahead Serenity.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:42.320]   Well, so if you look at it from a realistic point of view, there are things that we could
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:47.040]   be making laws against if we wanted to really... We could be focusing on doxing. We could be
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:54.160]   focusing on all of the things that are actually physically harmful to people day to day rather
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:01.360]   than focus on the big picture of the nebulous, the hacking menace. But there are still... You
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.680]   see all the stuff, of course, that's going on with Gamergate the last six, nine months now.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:13.680]   And the fact that it's still so difficult to get sentencing for threats on the internet or any...
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:20.880]   There are different kinds of problems of internet crime and internet hacking that
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:25.040]   haven't been addressed at all by the Justice Department and that they seem to be not necessarily
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:30.800]   turning a blind eye to, but not being able to adequately address nor are the lower courts.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.400]   So it's one of those things, it's like, if you want to make new laws and they want them to be
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.040]   hacking focused, there are options and topics that you can focus on.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:45.920]   Actually, the UK has arrested another guy in conjunction with those Christmas day
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:50.880]   DDoSes on Xbox Live and the PlayStation and Network an 18-year-old arrested near Liverpool.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:58.400]   He was also accused of swatting by his Skype. So who knew you could Skype in from the UK and get
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.560]   somebody swatted in the United States? I know there's a big discussion about this death on last
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.680]   year and it's surprisingly easy, disturbingly easy to do because the actual security on the
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:12.960]   systems that learnt the SWAT teams is quite simple to spoof if you know how to do it. But
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.400]   huh, another one of my countrymen getting arrested, it's such a proud week for us.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:24.960]   Two now, Lizzier Squad members in the UK, a 22-year-old was arrested in London at the end of last month
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.480]   and a Finnish man has been interrogated, a 17-year-old over the attacks.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.600]   Yeah, well, to be honest, it's dark and Finland, there's not a lot else to do.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.920]   It's probably got a bit drunk. Hey!
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:39.680]   Dude, you can hack Sony but do not mess with our PlayStation Network. Do not,
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:45.520]   or the full wrath of the United States and England will come down upon thine head.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:51.120]   Let's take a break. Got a great panel here. Ian's nice to have you. I hope you'll come back.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.160]   Thank you for watching me, certainly.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.680]   Yeah, a nice posh accent to the mix and I love the snark from the Register.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:58.820]   What is your beat at the Register, Dark
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:05.360]   Co-op? I cover mainly security, science and a little bit of public, a little bit of public
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:10.080]   six. You're here on the exactly the right day. Works for me and I will note that he is using
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.840]   a Chromebook, not just any Chromebook but a Chromebook Pixel as his laptop.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:19.360]   Is that your day to day? No, this is my just internet email. Carry around, it's nice and light.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.120]   You don't care if you lose it, computer.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.200]   Ultimately, no, not that much. I mean, it would be, I do like it, don't get me wrong,
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.880]   but I've got a proper system back home. I'm going to be super locked down and yeah.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.560]   Yes, I love the Pixel. I do too. I use it this way.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.600]   Almost every check yard was written on it.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:38.880]   That's my breakfast computer. Yeah, the one thing I hate about it is without an internet access.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.680]   It's a very expensive paper, like what a beautiful one. What computer isn't though?
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:49.920]   Well, I don't know. I mean, it's like a security blanket. The reality is, if I don't have internet,
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.840]   I'm not sitting around like creating like collages and photosop or something.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.640]   That's a good one. I know. You can just play a game on this one.
[00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   It's just a fancy, you can't at least fire up a game and just blast away half an hour.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:05.680]   One reason it's good to be in studio, Ian, is we have snacks.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.600]   Ooh, sweet. It's snack time. Well, they could be sweet. They could be savory. They could be spicy.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.000]   I would say America, they're probably going to be sweet.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.840]   Wait a minute. Sea salt pop pops, sea salted popcorn kernels.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.240]   That sounds pretty good. Whole corn, soybean or soflour, sunflower oil and sea salt. That's it.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.480]   These are nature boxy. These are not your average. Go to the vending machine.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.080]   Get a candy bar snacks. These are the kinds of snacks you want to have available. Delicious
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.920]   nutritionist design snacks like honey dijon pretzels.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.800]   Wow. Yeah. All right. You want sweet? We got sweet blueberry almonds because you get the
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:47.040]   antioxidants of the almonds along with the sweet that your mouth needs. I have to say,
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.360]   nature box is awesome. Here's coffee kettle popcorn. Now, the cool thing about this,
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.880]   these are on resealable bags. So they lock back up.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.800]   And what's really great is they'll deliver these to your door every month.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.480]   Hundreds of delicious nutritionist approved snacks. Never any artificial flavors,
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.080]   collars or sweeteners, zero grams, trans fats, no HFCs, high fructose corn syrup.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.360]   And if you want snacks with bold flavors, my friends, you will get them like chocolate banana chips,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.680]   kung bao pretzels. You'd probably like those there. I see your pictures on Instagram,
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:26.320]   Bem, delicious meals and Taipei, little kung pao pretzel, hmm, or lemon pucker pistachio,
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:34.560]   nature box. You can even get snacks that are vegan, gluten free. They've got them all naturebox.com.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:40.160]   Here's the deal. I'm going to get you a complimentary sample box right now. If you go to naturebox.com/twit,
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:45.200]   you'll get five snacks. Get an idea of the tastes available. Just pay $2 for shipping.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:52.080]   That's it. Naturebox.com/twit. Stay full, stay strong. Start snacking smarter.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.800]   Which one do you want? You can have any of them. I'll go for the sea salt, actually.
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.320]   Really? You like that? Yeah. I mean, the coffee looks interesting, but I'm allergic to coffee,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.520]   which is a real pain in there. Here you go. Sea salt, sun crunch. That's another one. You can
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:11.360]   choose pop pops. It was good for that. Or sweet blueberry almonds. More of a savory chance to
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.680]   eat stuff. It's tough, isn't it? I do not. So fast. I can get into the microphone.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.720]   I'd send these out to you, Serenity, if I could. I know. Of all the days to be on the East Coast.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.760]   They're awfully good. Is this snowing in Boston? It is not, but there is snow on the ground.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:34.240]   But all winter. How cold is it getting that type A? Are you in type A? I'm just assuming that, Ben.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:42.080]   Yep. I'm in type A. Do you get snow? No. It will snow on the top of very highest mountains.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:49.520]   Like maybe once every couple of years. Right. So no, it gets down to it's in the coldest
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:56.400]   times are probably about in the 50s. Which doesn't sound bad, but the problem is it's very chilly
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:03.040]   because it's rainy. And there's no heat or no insulation. So inside your house is just as cold
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.720]   as outside your house. So it's actually it is it is a bit miserable, but it doesn't last that long.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:14.400]   And I will definitely take it over it being like zero degrees and snowy on the ground. So I
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:20.080]   know it means complaining. Where do I see those great? Is it Mitzmunk, Ben, on Instagram? Those
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:27.200]   pictures of the amazing stuff you get to eat. I'm jealous. I know. Look at this. Ooh, good
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:57.200]   sculpture as well. Oh, yeah, of course. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:03.360]   I'm not I'm not like some people are just massive fans. I'm I'm not gonna go out on that way for it,
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:09.120]   but it's good. Crispy? No, it's very it's very soft. It's very soft. That's actually why I don't
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.840]   like it as much. I find it too soft. It's gonna say surely if you're reaching chickens feet,
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.920]   that's a sign that some of the else is still in the rush to the chicken. I mean, it's all
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.720]   it's left. And we had we got some got some barbecue last night where one of the one of the one of the
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.840]   best things is is chicken butt, where you have a skewer and you have like four or five of them
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.480]   right on there. Oh, there's it's I mean, think about it. It's very muscular. It's uh, it's good.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.880]   It's really good. I'm trying really hard. There's a tiny bit of gristle in there, which is a little
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:50.960]   to serve. Oh, suddenly I'm not hungry. Yeah. Those pop pops away. Yeah. Save them for later.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:58.240]   Let's uh, let's see. You were at CES, uh, Serenity. Do you see anything, uh, you know, we talked about
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:02.640]   last week, of course, but uh, do you see anything you really enjoyed or you were where you stuck at
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.040]   that booth the whole time? No, I actually got a fair amount of time to walk around Wednesday,
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.320]   Thursday and Friday. Um, I was saying before the show, my the big thing that I sort of had the takeaway
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:20.400]   of walking away of getting to try the Oculus Rift's new prototype, um, which is really, really impressive
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:27.760]   and it makes me more and more excited for the eventual release. Maybe we'll see it this year,
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.760]   maybe, but um, it was it was really something spectacular. Like people talk about, um,
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.680]   seeing sort of next generation technology actually in action and the Oculus, I mean,
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:44.640]   the headset I wore was still tethered. Um, and I was confined to like a certain amount of space and
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.720]   it was just a, just a pre-roll demo, but even so, that was the first, like, that's the first tech,
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:57.280]   technology that I've seen in a while at CES that really made me go, oh man, we are actually like,
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:04.240]   this could change a lot of things about the way that we game, about the way that we, you know,
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:11.360]   interact with people. Um, it's just, it's, it's a really cool system. They've done some amazing work.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:16.640]   So this is the Crescent Bay. Crescent Bay prototype. Yeah. Okay. And we're, by the way,
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:21.760]   watching a video created by a tested, it's on their YouTube site of them, uh, using this. So
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:28.880]   what I have the original Oculus Rift, the, the D2 model, is that right? Uh, whatever the Kickstarter
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:37.200]   thing was. Um, but so what is different in here? Well, for one thing, um, they've greatly improved,
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:43.680]   uh, in terms of the motion sickness and the field of vision is much better. Um, and
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.640]   the resolution higher because it was 720, I think. I believe the resolution is slightly higher or
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:55.600]   at least, I mean, to my eyes, it felt like a full, full frame HD, but, um, I'm not, I'm not,
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.080]   I'm not personally qualified to be able to be like, yes, it was this many pixels,
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:06.080]   but it does, it's, it's very immersive. And one of the great things about, uh, about this prototype
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:12.000]   is that they've added in stereo sound. So they have like, yeah, little tiny half speakers,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.640]   you just put on when you put on the headset. And it really does, it absolutely immerses you. I
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:22.720]   mean, you talk about, you know, people filmmaking one on one, the sound, good sound design, uh,
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.880]   and good sound experiences, the thing that makes or breaks you getting sucked into a movie,
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:33.680]   um, with the Oculus having a stereo sound experience, both of the sound effects and the music that
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.440]   they chose for each segment, uh, completely immersive. Absolutely. That's, as I was saying before the
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.840]   show, there's a, there's one segment in the six and a half minute crescent bay demo where you're
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.040]   standing on top of a building, an 80 story building, and you can hear the city. Like, you can hear
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:54.800]   all the words, you look up and you can hear a, uh, air balloon, like a Zeppelin passing over by.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.840]   You hear the traffic, the city noise, the rain, like it's, it's incredible what they've been able
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:09.920]   to do. It really is. I think sounds interesting. It is. It's a, it's an extra step onto the VR
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.480]   experience that I wasn't really expecting. Um, and especially this was my first time being able
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.400]   to play with an Oculus prototype. But I know, you know, they've been at C. Yes, the past couple
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.280]   of years, but I had, I'd been taking a quick like CES break. And so when I, when I saw that they were
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:29.520]   at the show this year, I kind of jumped at the chance to try it. Um, but sound adds such a, such
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:36.960]   an interesting additional experience to virtual reality. Because again, like, there's only so much
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:42.720]   that your eyes can trick you into believing. Like, I can stand on the edge of a virtual building.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:50.880]   Um, but without the sound, I still hear like the humming of my, you know, say my air conditioner or
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:57.200]   something. I was doing it in my, in my room. You add speakers, you add headphones. Um, and not only
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:01.920]   is it, you know, not only do you have background sound, but you have immersive sound. And I think
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.600]   it's the difference between, you know, a stereo sound system that you get in a theater and something
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.720]   that's actually being piped directly to your ears that's encasing you almost fully in this world.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:18.160]   Wow. Um, and did you, did you ask them how the Facebook relationship has been? Of course,
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.720]   because Facebook bought Oculus last year. And a lot of people were a little perturbed by that,
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.960]   the notion that somehow Mark Zuckerberg or Berg might steal the, or, or steer the development.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.480]   Yeah. Well, you know, go ahead. I was gonna say a lot of, a lot of people who invested in the
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.160]   original kick style. So we're happy with that as well. I mean, include, but yeah, I mean, do you
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.120]   think they got their money's worth? Yeah, you know, Mark's got money to burn. It doesn't,
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.960]   it doesn't ask to ask that question, right? The thing that I think is really important for,
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.880]   for a bigger company sort of putting in development resources into Oculus,
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.160]   Facebook had me a little bit worried just because Facebook, you know, I mean, it's, it's not exactly
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.200]   your first choice. If you're saying, Oh, a yard game development company. Perfect. Perfect.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:11.840]   Yeah. Perfect. And then also with all of Facebook's, you know, myriad concerns, but,
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:19.200]   but I actually, it makes sense from me from a wider perspective. If you take away, if you take
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:26.560]   away Oculus just being for video games and movies, right? And you consider it more of a world-reaching,
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:32.960]   help, like general day-to-day help tool. You think about, you know, there have been tons of
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.640]   books written about this over throughout the years, but I think about Ready Player One. And I think
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.760]   about the idea of, you know, people being able to have virtual classrooms who can't necessarily
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:48.800]   get to college and actually being able to interact with students. You think about retirees who maybe
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.440]   have some kind of disability that prevents them from getting outside the house and being able to
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:59.920]   put on a headset and interact with someone who may live, you know, down the street or 100 miles away
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.040]   in the same sort of recreational center, being able to talk to a therapist or something like that
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:10.640]   without having to, you know, to leave your house. I mean, yes, in some respects, this sounds maybe
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:17.280]   very antisocial, but for people who legitimately can't leave the house for one reason or another,
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.720]   people with disabilities, yeah, autism, like any, anyone with, I'm going to be in the nursing
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.040]   home in a couple of years. I want to be able to still go to Paris with my VR helmet.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.280]   Yeah, no, I mean, I think that there are a lot of possibilities for virtual reality beyond your
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.120]   traditional, let's put it on and feel like we're really, you know, in an alien environment,
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.600]   issue people. And I think that's what Facebook's really interested in is they don't, you know,
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:47.040]   they're not, they're not looking at, I am Max Mark Zuckerberg for all of his flaws as a smart kid.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:52.800]   He knows that, you know, the Facebook's current model, you know, scrolling and talking to friends
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.720]   and typing and all of that, that's not going to be around forever. And they need to figure out,
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.360]   all right, if we're really focused on the social experience, if that's our method,
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.840]   if that's our voice for the next 20, 30 years, how do we stay vital and how do we survive in the
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:15.520]   future and in this next, you know, generation of tech. And I really, you know, I think VR
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.960]   is definitely a potential solution. It's not perfect yet, but it's, but for a version,
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:27.920]   for a version one, a real version one, a stippable version one, I'm really, really impressed by
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.640]   Crescent Bay. No question that Zuckerberg and Facebook are all in on this effect.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:40.160]   Mark was in Columbia this week and Reuters snagged an interview with him and found out that they're
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.560]   planning, there are listings for 54 new positions at the in the Oculus division alone. In fact,
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.640]   Facebook is according to this exclusive story on Reuters set to swell its ranks,
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:58.800]   but as much as 14% 1200 new employees. And virtual reality is one of the key areas
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:06.160]   slated for growth. There's a really, I think fundamental question here. I think, I mean,
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.560]   first off, no, I haven't used Oculus. I don't think this would when you hear what I said on the
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:16.880]   other teams, what I have to say, but I'll have that out there. From a gaming perspective,
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.400]   we're from an experienced perspective, we're from some of the great examples that that
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.000]   string just listed things like going to a classroom or going on a trip. I think that
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.840]   for sure, it's the future. It's very compelling. But all those are destination sort of activities.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:41.680]   They may be more immersive. They may be more there, but they're still, you are deciding to put in
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.400]   the very action of wearing one of these, you have to go get it and you have to put it on. And then
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:52.080]   you go have an experience. And I think that there certainly is room for this. And we see that right
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:58.720]   now, we see amazing video game systems. We do see, you know, traveling through things to the
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.200]   internet. Obviously, a lot of it sucks now because it's not fully immersive and it will be way better
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:08.240]   when virtuality comes along. So from that perspective, I think it's interesting. Where I question
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:13.360]   Facebook in particular is when they bought it, Mark Zuckerberg said, I'm quoting here,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.160]   strategically, we want to start building the next major computing platform that come after mobile.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.680]   There are not many things that are Kansas, the next major computer platform. This is a long-term
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:27.440]   bet on the future of computing. And that's where I'm a little more skeptical. And the reason I'm
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.040]   skeptical comes back to kind of just a fundamental philosophy I have about computers and about
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.840]   computing. And that is, I don't think that I don't think that for most people, computers are a
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:44.080]   destination. Computers are a means to better live their life, to accomplish the things they want to
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:50.240]   accomplish, to talk to the people they want to talk to, to waste time they want to waste. Whatever
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:58.080]   it might be, I think most people view computers as a tool to steal Steve Jobs' words as a bicycle
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:03.600]   for their mind. But the point, the point is still the mind. The point is still what you're doing.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:11.520]   And so I think Oculus is interesting and will and absolutely has a future. But I see that future
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:19.040]   as being more of a additive destination type future as opposed to the controlling feature
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.600]   in our day-to-day lives, which mobile very much is today. Yeah, but Facebook kind of missed the
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.280]   boat on mobile initially. And I think they don't want to miss the boat on whatever's next. So I
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.000]   imagine it's more than one investment and more than one investment. Which is a great way to
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.960]   assume bad decisions because they have questionable incentives. They have a lot of headroom,
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.480]   though. I mean, they can afford it. No, it's just fine. Again, the technology itself is fine. I'm
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:48.640]   just skeptical on this is the future. And Facebook wanting it to be the future doesn't make it more
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:54.560]   likely to be the future. Well, here's what's really clear. There's two big trends. And you see them
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:16:03.200]   going on. You certainly see the movement of CPU power from a centralized position,
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.840]   the mainframe computer farther and farther out on the periphery. The personal computer is the first
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.200]   step. The Internet of Things is kind of the most recent step where chips are so small, so powerful,
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.480]   so low power that you can put them in almost anything. And now you see CPUs in almost anything.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.680]   And the other trend is towards immersion. And this is not just for gaming, but for content of
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.400]   all kinds, the idea of going to a movie and having it be immersive, whether it's an iMac
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:35.280]   screen or 3D playing a game and having it surround you. But I think immersive can also doesn't just
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.520]   have to be consuming content. It could also be participating with content. I disagree with you.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.400]   I think you actually skipped what is the trend if I may be so blunt. Please do. And you're so
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:49.200]   good at this. That's why we read Stretecory every week. The trend is to be more and more personal,
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.480]   like is to be more and yes, when you went from a mainframe, went to a PC, what was compelling
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.960]   about that was that it was accepted to more people. And then from a desktop to a laptop,
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.400]   it was not just accessible to more people, but it was accessible in more places.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:13.040]   Mobile too. And now that's what's that's what is so meaningful about mobile. It's not just
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.720]   you say like mobile first, Facebook is the best example, we're going to be mobile first. And they've
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.080]   done a fantastic job of actually executing and doing that. But mobile first is not just about
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:27.840]   apps. It's not just about services. It's about it's about how every single aspect of a person's life
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.480]   and every single business in the world is changed by the fact that people have a computer with them
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:38.240]   all the time. Like and so you see everything from the way small businesses will market themselves
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.560]   or the way that they'll that they'll do services or the way that they'll reach customers or do
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.800]   orders. You go to a place like China, you pull your mobile phone and you can go on like on WeChat,
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:50.800]   the chat map application, you can literally just order food from the dumping place down the street.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.320]   You can order tickets like all this stuff that people are announcing here in the US like their
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.440]   way ahead there. And part of it is because for so many people, the smartphone was their very first
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:06.160]   computer. And but but what's what's what's key about this and what makes the mobile so compelling
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:12.960]   is that the smartphone goes with you into your actual life. Right. Like and yes, there's an
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.440]   aspect of on the subway. I'm looking at my smartphone and I'm really present. But but the fact of the
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:25.600]   matter is we're becoming more engaged with the real world, not less. I like that.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.280]   That's actually my pitch for the Apple Watch is the idea and connected technology in general
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.920]   part wearable computing. The idea that not only do you have computers that you can put in your
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.280]   pocket, but contextual computers, computers that are smart enough to know what you want to do
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.160]   when you want to do it or sometimes even before you want to do it where you're you know Google now
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.280]   is a little bit of a creepy version of this. And of course, there's there's that line to walk,
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:58.960]   right? Because a computer doesn't want to be you don't want your your service to be so
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:05.360]   intelligent and so predictive that it makes you feel unsettled about using it. But at the same time
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.120]   having something that's keenly aware of what you like to do and you know what you're interested in
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.680]   and presenting you with the correct options and that and something that you can communicate
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:22.080]   with constantly. You know, my ideal my ideal future computer is something that's so like a
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:28.480]   combination of something like a like a mobile tablet or a watch and a connect where you know you have
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:36.000]   you have an ability not even minority report style, but something where you've you've got the ability
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:44.400]   to create whatever you want wherever you are. If I'm sitting on a subway, I can you know pull up a
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:49.360]   pull up a screen or a tablet and instantly start sketching whether or not I actually have a physical
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:53.280]   implementation in my hands. You know, that would that would be really, really cool. The idea that
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.680]   you can just pull things from wherever wherever they're stored in your life. And that's you know,
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:04.240]   that may be super future talking, but we do have a variety that already existing in our current
[01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:10.720]   technology. You know, on my on my phone, I can pull up almost every book I've ever bought digitally,
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:15.840]   which is most of the books that I have physically in this room as well. You know, I can pull up my
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:21.280]   social life. I can doodle. I can sketch. I can pull up files for my computer. I can pull up my
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:27.040]   computer screen. I can share with my media server. You know, we have all these connections. It's just a
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:31.760]   matter of building the right the right tools that can actually help us interact day to day. And I
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:37.280]   agree with you, but I don't think Oculus in its current form is something where it's, you know,
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.720]   snow crash like where we're going to constantly using it all the time.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:46.560]   What the universe. I think what we always write was that there are two paths.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:52.000]   Again, I was probably more more arguing with with the one like one is personal. And there's always
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.800]   been the diversionary path. We've always we've gone to movie theaters. We've sat down to watch
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:03.360]   TV. But isn't there the more personal version of that? Like when you're wearing an Oculus Rift,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:11.840]   it's as personal as you can get. No, no, no, the distinction is what is as serenity just laid out.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:17.680]   What are ones that are a part of your life and which ones do you are destinations?
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.320]   I put Oculus in the destination category. Well, you're not going to walk around with one on one.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:27.040]   Exactly. And well, and well, that's that's maybe augmented reality or a heads up.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:34.000]   The analog here, I think is Microsoft like focusing on Xbox, for example,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.560]   that they've been relatively successful. But everyone thinks of the company's last 10 years
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.720]   as being a big problem because they missed mobile because mobile is way more important. And the
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.280]   reason mobile is more important is because mobile is a part of your life at all times.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.840]   And Xbox is something you make an appointment with and you sit down and do.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:57.840]   And I put Oculus in that category. I, and perhaps I'm biased. I hope we don't have a future where
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:03.200]   it's like, what's the Pixar movie where they're up and out of space?
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:10.000]   Oh, yeah. That's, oh, I want Wally and I can sit my soda and wear my visor.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.760]   I mean, this is where Oculus are quite clear they're going with this and that they're giving
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.360]   a presentation last year. And what we want is putting on sunglasses, which give you the full
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:26.960]   virtual reality, but you can run and augmented reality view. And they're quite clear. It's 10,
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:32.240]   15 years in the future. You need massive computational power. You need huge bandwidth.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.760]   And you need the battery life to make it work. Gosh, it doesn't feel like it's that far off.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.720]   I moved back to a decade. I would have been 15 years.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:42.800]   It's been really that far away. Well, it is for me. Like I said, I don't have much
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:49.520]   longer to live. But it's like demon. It's like, it's like in that great book,
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:54.320]   demon and freedom, where you would be walking around and people's reputation score would be
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.920]   hovering over their head. You would look at, I would look at somebody like you and I could
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:05.280]   immediately sus, you know, your credibility, your integrity, your body mass index and your blood
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:11.840]   sugar. I feel like I, I understand what you're saying. And certainly right now mobility is
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:17.200]   clearly and personal is clearly what's going on. But I don't think that that's to the exclusion of,
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.120]   you know, the expansion of processing into everything, which creates this mesh of intelligence and
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:30.160]   awareness that we can then participate in as we walk around. If you think about the
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.720]   Internet of Things and what's compelling about that, it actually fits with this personal thesis.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:42.240]   I mean, what happened with, with gadgets for lack of a better word is they all got subsumed
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.360]   into the smartphone, right? There's a picture that's been floating around for ages of like all the
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:49.200]   stuff that is now in our smartphone. Right. One fan that's been the process of the last six,
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.600]   seven years is gadgets going away. But you think back where those gadgets come from,
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:59.600]   those gadgets were all like video recorders, mp3 players, like all these things were meant to
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.960]   plug into a PC. Because the problem with a PC is a PC ultimately wasn't mobile, not a laptop isn't
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.320]   mobile. At the end of the day, you have to sit down, you have to put on a desk, you have to turn it on
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:13.600]   and use it. And what a thing like an mp3 player did was it took a specific function of the PC,
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.120]   in this case, listening to music, and it made that specific function mobile.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.440]   Or a video recorder took a recording function, made it mobile. You could bring it back to the
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:26.160]   PC and you could plug it in and you could do stuff with it. What's been compelling about the
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:31.120]   smartphone is it took all that stuff and it also made the computer mobile. So that was all in one.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:35.600]   You didn't need to. There was no point in having something separate and plugging it in. And this,
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.800]   by the way, is why I think a no-port MacBook Air makes a ton of sense. Like, it's all on your phone
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.400]   anyway. But if you go, if you think about the, I don't know why my printer is going crazy,
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:52.320]   but if you think about the Internet of Things, why I actually think gadgets are getting more
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.520]   interesting now, it's not because it's because well previously gadgets made a
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:04.800]   immobile PC mobile. Now you can assume that everyone has a mobile computer with them all the time.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.920]   And now what's interesting is all the objects that can't move can become smart in a meaningful
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.120]   way. So your garage door can become smart. Your door, your locking your door can become smart.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.720]   Your car can become smart. And it becomes smart, not independently, I think, in the long run.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.040]   It becomes smart because it becomes smart when a smartphone gets close to it.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:31.600]   I remember talking very early on in this transition with Paul Odellini, who was then the CEO of Intel.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:36.720]   And I said, what's the future of the personal computer in a world like this? I said, oh, we'll
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:41.120]   always be the hub. You're wrong. Yeah. And Intel.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:45.920]   So they thought Intel's playing catch up and mobile all of a sudden. What a surprise.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:51.120]   You have a great post. I want to point everybody to it. Ben Thompson on Stretecory called mobile
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:56.480]   first in which you talk about this type C port, the single port Mac book. And actually, I want to
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.960]   take a break because it'd be a good time to segue to our next subject, something you were very
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:07.440]   interested about. You talked to Hugo Barra, who was formerly the guy who did all the demos at Google.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.920]   And then up and left and went to a Chinese company, the Xiaomi, he's the VP of international now at
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:21.520]   Xiaomi. And you talked to him on Friday about their strategy. They announced the new, was it
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:29.200]   called the me the me pad? No, me note, me note. So yeah, well, we're gonna take a break. But I
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.240]   know this was something that's a near and dear to your heart. And I'd love to get your insight on
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:38.480]   this. I just wish we could get one in the United States. We'll have more in just a bit. Lots to
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.880]   talk about today. I showed it a brought to you by Linda.com. There's lots to learn as you probably
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:52.400]   can see the world is a rapidly changing place. Linda.com empowers you to learn. By giving you

[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.360]   was all about. We used to interview her all the time on the screen saver. She's great.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:12.400]   She expanded though to Photoshop photography, design. Now they have courses in business skills,
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.560]   too, like negotiations and resume building and time management, software training like Excel,

[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.040]   Bert Monroy. I mean, if you're going to take a Photoshop class, you're taking it from the best
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:33.200]   in the business when you're studying Bert Monroy. We had him on a triangulation. He talked a little
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:39.440]   bit about his, they've got free courses from a Bert on Linda.com and then his more elaborate
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:46.800]   courses, including the step-by-step walkthrough of how he made his newest painting, "Amsurd Ammest."
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:52.720]   This is a Photoshop master showing you how to do stuff with Photoshop. You didn't even believe
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.800]   you didn't even believe possible. There's also the weekly office workshop series,
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.120]   the Monday productivity pointers, photography 101. If you want to, it's for hobbies, too,
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:06.400]   the creative tips series. That's Justin Sealy. He gives you a little five-minute
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.040]   tutorials on improving your creative skills in Photoshop and Illustrator and WordPress.

[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.680]   and design. You can see I've got a bunch of courses going on. I've got Bert Monroy's. I'm
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.480]   up and running with Lightroom 5, the Swift programming language. I think this old Excel one I can get
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:59.840]   rid of now. Excel 2007, an essential training. That didn't work out so well for me. I'm not good
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:05.280]   at spreadsheets, it turns out. Do something good for yourself in 2015. Sign up for our free trial

[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:45.840]   all that Snapchat is all about. They got a course on it. lynda.com/twit2. Xiaomi is a really interesting
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:52.960]   story. I think sometimes people feel like they're a copycat company. Tell us, is Xiaomi the number
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:59.440]   one hardware phone manufacturer in China? Well, I think the way this numbers are that they're
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:05.120]   number three in the world behind Apple and Samsung. Which, wow, not just China, the world.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:12.160]   Right. Well, I mean, but they sell almost completely into China. I think 98 or
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.920]   I look at some of these phones. I think we got what do we get, Jason? We got a
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:24.800]   the me. The me for I believe it was. Yeah, it was it was really, I mean, it would sell hugely in the
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:30.000]   house. Really nice. I liked it a lot. Why don't they? What are they planning to come into the US or
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.040]   the rest of the world? Rest the world. Yes, not the US and probably not Western Europe at least
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:42.160]   for a while. Yeah, well, they're kind of their kind of core thing to date has been to offer
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:51.600]   very well-spect phones that are that are nice for a price that's half the cost of
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:57.520]   of a top of the line Samsung or iPhone. They do TV's too. They do tablets.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:02.640]   Right. Well, that's I mean, that's what's interesting is it's kind of been a question is how is this
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:07.040]   company going to make money and the whole thing is well, they're going to make money on services,
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:10.960]   but the problem is that doesn't really add up because when it comes to services in China,
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:17.440]   the all the money is being made by by Tencent with their WeChat application,
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:23.200]   so made by Baidu who dominate search there. And there's really not a lot of money left over to be
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:28.320]   made in services. We traditionally think about them. And so that kind of was the money that
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:34.480]   Xiaomi just raised another round at the end of last year, valuing them at $46 billion,
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:40.640]   one billion larger than Uber to take the title. And the question is like, well, where is this
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.360]   valuation coming from? How are they going to make money? And that's what makes the company so
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.640]   interesting. I actually think there is a like any startup is not guaranteed, but I think there
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.720]   is a very compelling opportunity here. And it actually gets back to what we're just talking
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:01.120]   about, which is the Internet of Things. And what happens if you start a company with the assumption
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:08.240]   that the smartphone is the center of everything. And what Xiaomi is doing, and it's the interesting
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:11.440]   that you know about, and you mentioned things like the TV, or they sell things like an air
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:18.560]   purifier, or they sell like routers. At their last announcement on Thursday, which I was in Beijing
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:23.920]   to attend, they opened it up by talking about their partnership with Medea, which makes air
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:29.040]   conditioners and things like that. Although when you drive through Beijing, everybody has an air
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:33.040]   conditioner. Well, I raise air conditioner and everybody certainly needs an air purifier.
[01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:39.040]   It's an air purifier. It's a very big business there. But what's happening here is,
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:47.760]   I wrote about this couple of weeks ago, is it's incomplete to think of Xiaomi as a smartphone
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:54.480]   company. They're much more of a wife style company, and their lifestyle company,
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:59.920]   for a specific set of customers. There is customers that can't afford an iPhone,
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:06.480]   care about things like specs and features and stuff like that, and tend to be young and about
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:11.760]   to move into their own places, about to buy their first phones. Interesting. So this is really
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:16.480]   their first computer. Right. With the first computer, it's the center of their existence,
[01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:23.440]   and Xiaomi has to a very impressive extent in a way that few other companies in technology
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:28.320]   broadly, much less than China have, have built a very strong brand and a meaningful brand,
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:34.400]   a brand that people ascribe to and are proud to be associated with. It's very Apple-like
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.280]   in that way. Now you have these people that are moving out there, they're going to start buying
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:42.160]   things and what kind of things they're going to buy. They're going to buy the Xiaomi air purifier.
[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.760]   They're going to buy the Xiaomi TV. They're going to buy the Xiaomi air conditioner.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.840]   And a lot of these will show me that I'm going to make even the majority of these,
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.760]   that they're going to be wet-labeled or to be sold with partnerships. But you think about this,
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.040]   what's happening? Now they have all this stuff and they're all smart. They're all tied together
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:04.080]   via software through Xiaomi software, the MIUI. What you actually have here is an Android maker
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:09.040]   that's actually building meaningful stickiness in a meaningful moat around their products,
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:15.120]   because they have actual physical products that are tied together by software. And now it actually
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:20.080]   is different to own a Xiaomi phone than is to own something else. And it's very,
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.280]   and so you think about it, it's really almost the first internet of things company. They're
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:27.680]   selling you the whole house. They're selling you the whole lifestyle. They have home automation too.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:34.560]   No, exactly. And so it's the sort of company that can only make sense if it was born with the
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:38.960]   assumption that the phone is at the center. And that's the advantage of being a star. It just
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:44.560]   started four and a half years ago. And now you have this week, they had a new announcement,
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:49.600]   the the Mino Pro or the Mino, Mino Pro, an unfortunate name to be sure. I'll let you
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:56.160]   talk about that a moment. But it's a it's a excellent phone. It is not a copycat of anyone.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:02.000]   The build quality is a significant step up from the Mi4, which was already, you know, it was good.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.920]   I liked this Mi4 and it's the battery level is the best in the business.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:12.160]   Yeah, it's a very important point. The specs are amazing. What is so MiUI is Android. How is it?
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:16.000]   How pure is it? How much like would we recognize it?
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.040]   Yeah, two degree. I mean, it looks different. And there's lots of skins you can apply to.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:25.600]   This is something that's very popular in in Asia of def broadly is to do this sort of customization.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.760]   So it's a little complicated within China. It's a it's a OSP and right and it has all their own
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.240]   services as by do services. I think it has Xiaomi Xiaomi App Store. No Google services.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:41.120]   Well, you can download the Google Play Store. I mean, it just doesn't but no, they don't come
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:47.680]   pre-installed. And so outside China, like in India, where they're making a really big push right now,
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:53.440]   they greatly exceeded their expectations anyway, at least according to to you,
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:02.320]   Obera in the last four months of the year last year. They're they outside China, they do run Google's
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:07.520]   version of Android with I mean, you can do quite a bit of customization and still stay in bounds.
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:12.800]   You see that with with with Cenogen Mod. And you'll see that with Xiaomi's external version.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.360]   Absolutely. But the but it's okay there. And I think this is really hard for people to understand
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:24.080]   because people people are so stuck on the Android versus iOS battle. That's kind of self contained
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:28.800]   within the smartphone. And whereas Xiaomi's differentiation isn't the smartphone, it's the
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.880]   ecosystem of stuff that is tied together by the smartphone. Do they sell music? Do they have a
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:36.800]   music store? They do. They have a music store. They have a video store. They have all that all those
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.320]   sorts of certain. And they are looking to make money from those types of services.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.720]   But I think there you have to look at them with a different from a different frame of reference to
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.360]   kind of understand what they're doing and what they're trying to accomplish.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:52.880]   In terms of the data that they collect, are they monetizing that in any way? Or is it just sort of
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:59.040]   you could build up a very accurate profile of someone's personality by how they if you tie in
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:04.400]   their phone, their TV, their music and video buying habits, the health and ease their air
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.480]   pure fire. Are they actually marketing that data as well? Or is it just being stored or is it private?
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:14.960]   Not that I know of. I mean, I would presume they're probably storing it. But I mean, the other
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.280]   thing too is we're still at the very much like you're seeing the outlines of this strategy come
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:26.320]   into picture. There is a very long road of execution and actually seeing it work out to justify that
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.240]   valuation. But at least I think you can start to see what they're trying to do. And that's certainly
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:34.080]   an option for something they could do. I don't think they're doing anything like that now.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:41.200]   But why not the US market? Well, there's a couple of reasons. One just from a business perspective,
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:46.960]   the US market, everyone has appliances, everyone has their homes. And it's not that big of a market.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:59.520]   China and India combine each other to main markets right now are 12 times the size of the US market.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:06.400]   And this is like asking, why not the Madagascar market? Why? When? No, it's true. I mean,
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:09.520]   isn't that interesting? It's something hard for us in the US to get used to.
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.880]   One size and two, it's people that are buying this stuff now. They're buying appliances.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:19.280]   And there's people that are getting their first computers. And it's already very mobile first
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:25.600]   in a way that the US isn't. The US has much more of a PC hangover, as it were. And if you go from
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:31.520]   no computer to a smartphone, you're going to buy into that mobile lifestyle in a much more
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:35.680]   substantial way than if you're going from a PC that you've used for many years to a smartphone,
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.320]   which is more mobile and better. But you still have a lot of old habits and ways of doing things.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:45.760]   That's number one. Number two is IP. They have an IP problem. For some of its legitimate,
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.080]   some of its not legitimate, that's a philosophical decision. Isn't that sad, though, that the patent
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:56.080]   wars keep us from getting the best stuff? Well, I mean, that's the I tend to fall on this side of
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:04.400]   things when it comes to Xiaomi, Apple PR is an excellent job of framing Xiaomi, I think, in the
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.720]   tech leaders conscious. Yeah, I think people in the media are probably familiar with that.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:20.880]   On one hand, I'm uncomfortable with technology patents in general. And the reason is because
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:27.520]   the whole of patent is inherently a bad thing. It is a government granted monopoly. And monopolies
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:32.640]   aren't great. The reason why patents exist is because they're meant to spur innovation,
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:39.840]   to make it worthwhile, to invent, to do new things. In technology, no one needs a spur. There's so
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:47.920]   many gains from being first to making the market that I feel pretty confident that if there were
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:54.080]   no patents, there would be no slow down in innovation. And if you question the fundamental premise,
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.000]   then it's like, well, yeah, you're right. Why should Xiaomi be living in this perspective?
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.480]   So I do have a problem from the we have to pay license fees perspective. From a copying perspective,
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:12.080]   that's something that Xiaomi quite frankly needs to do better at it. I think it's a cultural thing
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:17.200]   in some respects. The idea of copying isn't nearly as frowned upon or even thought to be a bad thing
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:21.920]   in China. And a lot of this is very much a cultural thing. And you look back through history and the
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:30.000]   way art was valued. Copying is not it's not considered a bad, morally bad thing like he kind of is
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.680]   in the West. And as long as I'm on my soapbox and monologuing, the fact of the matter is when the
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.840]   US came to power, we stole a whole lot of IP from England and lots of other places.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:45.200]   Yes. And it's a whittle, it's a whittle hypocritical for us to be on our high horse now. It's
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.080]   understandable. But it's certainly hypocritical. Now, I mean, I'm with you, Charles Dickens had
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:55.200]   spent a lot of time coming over to America, doing book tools, doing lecture tools, so to try and
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:59.280]   get his earnings up in the US because the minute American printers got hold of his stuff, they
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:03.760]   just slapped out their own copies. And I didn't you can see it from that perspective. But over the
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.360]   last 10 years in this country, IP is more about lawsuits to protect your market than it is about
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:13.360]   rewarding the event as of anything. It's just that it's got way out of control.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:21.440]   Did you, Sir Annie, I'm sorry, did you have? Oh, no. I mean, I generally agree with all of that,
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:28.400]   especially the last couple of years, you know, I have a couple of people who I'm pretty close
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:34.160]   within the community who are app developers. And the fact that they, you know, the recent
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:39.440]   the patent trolls going after them for things like pull to refresh, it's just it's very frustrating.
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:44.160]   Yeah. Is there the problem with Xiaomi? I think from a copy cap perspective is it's a business
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:50.320]   problem. I mean, they may be okay in China. They, I mean, they're late June, their founder is like,
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.120]   you know, is a rock star and people follow them and like they'll be on their social media presence
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:00.400]   is excellent. And they sell. And so it works very well there, but they want to go abroad and
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:05.360]   succeed in a meaningful way. Like they're going to need to depend much more on the on the worth
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:10.240]   and value of their products. And and copying doesn't help in that respect at all. And it actively
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.040]   hurts. Look at this headline from Engadget, which is a perfect example of how the tech press buys
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:23.360]   Apple's line. Xiaomi mocks Apple with its very own premium phablet as if Apple created the
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:29.600]   phablet. Of course, if they relate to the game, they just got into that first iPhone when it came
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.560]   out from a hardware perspective was junk. Sorry, compared to the rest of it. Well, let me
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.560]   see. In other words, Apple can dictate the storyline here in the United States and it's
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.600]   and it's picked up. Well, it's interesting. I it's a little I think it's a little more
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:50.240]   complicated than I think that I think that Apple and has been active pushing the this the line that
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.640]   Xiaomi that Xiaomi rips off Apple. And I mean, Johnny, I said something very explicit that regard
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:01.040]   and how we use outraged and offended. And and I think I agree that it's particularly with the
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:08.960]   most recent generation than me for Xiaomi took way too many design cues from Apple. And that said,
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:13.920]   from a from a business model perspective, they're already very different from a software perspective,
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.480]   they're very different to actually use a device is completely foreign compared to an iPhone.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:24.800]   But I think it's justifiable. And I think that it's a problem for Xiaomi from a hardware perspective.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:32.640]   That said, I think Xiaomi is aware of this and this new product, again, the names unfortunate,
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.520]   they've had a note for a while for what it's worth. Almost all big phones in China by all the
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.040]   no name manufacturers are all called notes. Like that's kind of the name for a phable now.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.160]   But I mean, we all know where that came from. And it's just it's a stupid move to be perfectly
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:52.880]   frank. But that said, the hardware is totally unique. It's it's it's glass on both sides. And
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:58.880]   when I say glassable size, it means like an iPhone five, it's it's it's it's curved. It's it's
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.600]   it's it feels unlike other phones that I felt. And that's a that's a good price for them.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:10.080]   So this is what's really interesting. The regular note is 270, I think, which
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:16.960]   which that said, I think is still more expensive than any Xiaomi phone has been. They also did a top
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:21.200]   of the line one, but they don't expect to sell many, but it's basically the best of the best.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.320]   It's got the Snapdragon 810. It's got four gigabytes L D D D R RAM or something like that,
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:30.960]   which is like brand new to market. It's super expensive. But that's selling for over $500,
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:39.280]   which is still have a Apple which are yeah. It's it's interesting. It's both really cheap and
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.800]   really expensive. It's really cheap compared to other manufacturers. It's really expensive
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:49.120]   marketer to Xiaomi. Yeah. Thank you for that. Great insight on Xiaomi. And I really want to
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.720]   keep covering it because I think it's fascinating. I think that I think there's just there's lots
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:45:00.720]   of challenges in thinking about it. I mean, one is just just the market perspective.
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:03.920]   Right. It's it's a different market the way everything that works is different to.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.600]   It's the it's the business model perspective. They're not following an Apple or Google business
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:15.600]   model. It's something it's something different. And then three, it's it's this mobile perspective.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:22.560]   It's it's it's really the a company that only makes sense if you start with the premise that a
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:29.120]   computer is an accessory. It's not the center of what you do. And I think for geeks in particular,
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.200]   that's something that's really hard to wrap your head around. But that's very much the reality for
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:39.360]   more and more people in the West and a vast majority of people in a place like China.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.480]   How do you write them going internationally? I mean, Indonesia and India, but India
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.760]   in particular, Tough Market for China is a crack. I would have thought. Yeah. I mean,
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:54.320]   yeah, they have. I mean, they have a it's hard for any Chinese company in India for, you know,
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:46:00.000]   for lots of reasons. But they they've done quite well. I mean, according again, this is
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.720]   not object information, but according to, you know, who where are they went into
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:10.240]   India with 100,000 units, assume that will last them for six months and sold out in two weeks.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:14.880]   And something they've had a lot of success with in India, their product resonates, I think.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:19.760]   Again, you hesitate to get too much into like, you know, country, you know, stereotyping like that,
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:26.320]   but they their marketing is is is kind of a geeky in a in a positive sort of sense. Like they
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:32.240]   mark themselves on their components and on their specs and being a very good value for
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.680]   the fantastic performance that you get. And that's something that they found that really resonates
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:43.200]   in India. And they've they've made good inroads into that. And what they do is they lead with
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:48.320]   these high these, these high end products from a spec perspective that are still great value.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:53.200]   And then they come in the bottom with their red me line, which is like a hundred dollars. So you
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:59.440]   get a smartphone for a hundred bucks. It has the Xiaomi brand and software and interaction with
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.560]   the ecosystem. But obviously it's built on a media check check media tech chip, although
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.760]   they do have Qualcomm ones as well. It's it's lower cost components. And that actually makes up the
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:17.520]   volume of their the volume of their other business. But so it's very much a a they have a very clear
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:24.160]   segmentation. They have they really build their brand on the me brand. And then they they have
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:29.200]   a fill the market perspective with the red me. And it's it's I mean they it's been pretty successful
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:35.760]   to date. I mean they their growth slowed slightly less quarter. Part of that is because they've
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:43.200]   they've just so thoroughly eviscerated Samsung in particular in China that you know they need to
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.080]   go international. But I think they've pulled back from other markets actually mainly because they
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.760]   want to spend so much more time on India. And you know it's it's a pretty nice option to go from
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:48:00.400]   a 1.3 billion market to 1.1 billion one. Yeah. We're going to take a break. We've got Ben Thompson
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.880]   for a strategicery from the register Ian Thompson. I know it's confusing the Thompson twins. I'd
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:12.480]   like to call you. And we're there three in the Thompson twins. Very confusing. And Serenity called
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:21.920]   well who's just getting over her cold from yes. See I just I hear it. I feel it. I sympathize.
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.080]   We had a fun week this week on Twitter having fun with some David Cameron stuff among other
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:35.440]   things. Take a look. That was fast but it was it was a quick week. Previously on Twitter. Tech
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:40.720]   news tonight. UK Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a new law that would either ban apps
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:45.520]   that encrypt messages or force the creators of such apps to provide a backdoor for the UK
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:53.120]   government. So Cameron said we're not going to permit encrypted communications like what's app
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:49:01.280]   like I message security now Leo I'm worried about the future marketing Mavericks racing
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:07.920]   specifically of all sports is so brand intensive. Think of any other sport that literally low
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:14.240]   dose are thrown in the audience's face nonstop and the audience love it. Tech news today.
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.440]   The top scientists have signed a letter of warning talking about artificial intelligence
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.280]   and the potential dangers. Now the big question here Mike is whether Skynet is going to honor
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:29.200]   this letter once Skynet comes online. Triagulation. Ten basics that you think everybody knows but
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.920]   they really don't even know. Gates doesn't know. I'll bet he doesn't know about the the number

[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:55.200]   or what time it is you should check the one plus site they've done this before and when you get
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:01.680]   there it's usually a crazy alright is a one plus still a thing the one plus one we all had them
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:08.320]   and kind of moved on I'm I'm moving back because I just shattered shattered your Nexus 6 oh you
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:12.560]   know what I'm not too sad to move back because it was a great fun I am actually tempted to buy
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:18.240]   another one I love the one plus and nothing out at least in the US maybe the the me for but nothing
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:23.760]   in the US has anything we're near the battery life of the one plus and cyanogen has said Steve
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:30.160]   Kondek who is cyanogen has said that they're doing a lollipop version for the one plus one
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:37.440]   which will be available next month and right 5.0 CM CM on is great or whatever they call it CM 11
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:43.600]   or 12 is great on the one plus it's just a wonderful operating system I really like it now I got one
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:47.680]   and the centre was broken and they wanted to charge me two and seventy dollars to repair it it's a
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:55.360]   cheap phone so they give you no support yeah basically so I'm right I'm scarred I think that
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:58.800]   it's an interesting story and I never really did quite figure out why they have never gone
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:03.600]   beyond this invite system doesn't look like they ever will somebody said well these they're such
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:06.720]   a small company they just want to make sure they have sales for everyone they manufacture
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:11.760]   for a while I thought it was because the screen was the same as on the iPhone 6 plus and that they
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:16.240]   were just constrained by Apple's huge demand I don't there but they're still invite only
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:21.360]   well I'm rapping is hard I mean it's yeah but they've been rapping for a year
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:26.240]   that's not ramping that's uh that's just floating it's hovering
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:35.280]   now I'm I think uh we see companies like Apple do it so I know I know yeah we forget that
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:39.200]   especially for a new company some people I'm complaining on this Nexus 6 by the way the
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:43.600]   back's coming off there's there are some maybe some manufacturing problems with the Nexus 6 and
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:48.160]   that shattering is not unusual just yesterday somebody on Google+ was like did this happen to
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:54.400]   you I'm like no thank god not till tomorrow today and I was like man it'll happen tomorrow
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:59.440]   what did you what did you hit it on oh well it shattered on the concrete right in front of the
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:04.000]   front door on my way into work here it and it hit an uneven part of the sidewalk so I don't even
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.880]   think a case would have saved it I think it was just destined if a point hits glass hard enough
[01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:16.560]   yeah and you know I'm tall so it hits from a higher distance so yeah you dropped it from like eight
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:22.000]   feet practically practically almost give or take I want to see I'm trying to I'm trying to find
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:29.680]   your your picture of it oh my god uh yeah that's one spider screen that's it oh and I tell you the
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:35.520]   sound it made when it hit I still hear it echoing through my my brain because it isn't just like
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:40.640]   an object hitting the ground it's it's the sound of a heartbreaking it's it's like banshee's screaming

[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:43.600]   rush of people say oh i gotta get my glass well i really need it oh my glass when i was
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:48.480]   they first put them on sale at i.o i called it my them wife to be and it's like how sold you are
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:58.160]   sold out you are on the honeymoon you know i mean it was a it's a cute idea killed by bad
[01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:03.440]   implementation of bad marketing and it's just not there yet and maybe not and maybe let's face it
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:10.400]   a product that that just doesn't appeal well it it i mean just to go back to before it inserted
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:17.280]   itself in your actual life it made itself the center right instead of sitting back making my
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.440]   life better right exactly is there a way to design this that it doesn't do that
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:28.560]   i i'm fundamentally skeptical of of anything on your face in the long run just because it's it's
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:35.600]   um it's it's it's again it's too it's too intrusive i mean right maybe when we get to contact
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:41.760]   ones is that our virtuality will love something to talk about but i'm so super distracting um and on
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:48.800]   top of that you know it just it feels uh alienating you look like it let's face it you look like an
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:55.040]   ass yeah when you wear glass i just made it out but also you make other people feel uncomfortable yeah
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:00.000]   like you're staring at them big the big mistake they made was either having a they should have
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.160]   left the camera out the front of it right or they should have put a clear cap over the camera
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:07.760]   so that if you're wearing these things at the moment if you're wearing these things people think
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:12.000]   they're being video the whole time they have no idea not yeah whereas if you didn't have the camera if
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.440]   you had a cap over it you just be whoa check out the gargoyle wearing the glasses rather than oh
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.640]   are they possibly recording me and and i think that caused a a social backlash against it but
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.480]   there just wasn't a clear use case for it would have wanted one of the things that just like
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:31.920]   yeah would have been you know it should be great in in a geek discussion but in the widest
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:35.920]   the widest one actually made it it was like yeah and that's so great yeah you know actually and i had
[01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:40.960]   to say as i was kind of thinking smartwatches we're going to go down the same road but i had a lot
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:46.240]   of the functionality glass is the notifications always available and i like android wear a lot
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:50.080]   i wear it all the time i don't see you wearing a watch now i you see i tried the smartwatch for the
[01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:53.920]   for the first month i did a month sitting around there and i found it made me incredibly rude
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.560]   because every time i was looking at me and i was checking my watch and it's it's perfect you know
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:02.400]   it's one of those twitch things that you do but if you're talking to somebody it's incredibly rude
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:06.640]   to be constantly looking at your watch the whole time i'm sorry what were you saying yeah exactly right
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:13.600]   can i ask does android wear um because i have only very briefly played around with the moda 360
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:20.240]   does it allow you to select certain notifications like yeah vip two ways there's an app you can use
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:24.720]   on the phone but also many end notifications if you swipe them over it says you you want to
[01:59:24.720 --> 01:59:28.800]   you don't want to see this ever again do you and you hit yes and then they won't ever come up so you
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:34.880]   can really choose you can't choose uh like when the phone rings anybody's going to show up so you
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:41.280]   can't say i only want to see my vip's like when the phone rings or texts but by by app you can say
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:45.120]   i don't want to see notifications from that app but you've still got to carry around a smartphone
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:49.040]   and you still have to carry around a smartphone so you still got to get your phone well i did
[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:53.200]   wear the samsung whatever it was gear that had a phone built into it for a while that was really
[01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:58.080]   awful yeah because you also got to have a samsung phone to go with it so much it was huge yeah i was
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:03.840]   like wearing a curved iphone on your wrist i i feel like apple's gonna have some competition i think
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:09.600]   android wear because it's been out for a long time they've learned a lot um i think it's actually a
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:16.800]   pretty useful smart product looks good looks maybe not as well as an apple watch but looks good and
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:21.040]   this apple's gonna have some competition not that i'm not gonna buy one i'll just have
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:26.480]   thank god i'm too rich that's all i can say you just stack it up you do this super futuristic
[02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:32.400]   style 2015 style would be similar hey you want to buy a watch yeah but you know i actually i think
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.560]   android wear from what i've seen event and what i've played with it is really cool my main beef is
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:43.280]   like the mode of 360 it's like this on my wrist like it looks it looks like i'm wearing a you know
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:48.400]   a power ranger's bracelet or something just so then you see the lg when i tried that my wife called
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:54.240]   it a matte a woman repeller i mean that's just a flat fuse exactly chick magnets i will get i will
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:01:00.240]   grant you that i feel like apple maybe has the right idea they have two sizes for each edition right
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:06.240]   uh a little bit smaller one you know you know 38 in the 42 yeah 38 actually fit on my wrist yes
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:11.040]   either you go so the thing the thing i'm most interested i think i i we're onto something where
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:18.080]   you talk about the tons of notifications being distracting anything that anything like that i
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:23.920]   think it is is not going to be where this wins if it if it wins at all um because the smartphone
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:27.520]   the thing about what is the big problem with smartphone the big problem is pulling it out in
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.720]   the fact that it is kind of distracting don't people i don't know what it how it is in type a
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:34.720]   but don't people just constantly walking around looking into their smartphone all the time anyway
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.960]   well that's what that's what's really compelling i'm actually i'm actually really interested in the
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:45.280]   where they call it the the taptic the taptic dinger yeah yeah like i thought the most compelling
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:50.480]   thing in the entire presentation was the the idea of walking along with the maps app and it tapping
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:54.640]   you in this is the apple direction you want to yeah although android rare does do that so if you
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.720]   have two talks to you about it if you get known if you in fact i did this in london if you uh
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:03.840]   do some nav i want to get to the tower of london the watch will then buzz you when it's time to turn
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:07.840]   left right it's great on foot i wouldn't on driving probably wouldn't be useful but on foot
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:12.320]   it's actually really great and it shows a little thing this is turn here i found that incredibly
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:16.080]   useful i mean the one thing i did i did really like about the smartwatch was we'd been out to dinner
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:21.440]   that night my wife was driving just like directions home and it just automatically you know gave
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:25.680]   us the thing does it understand that when you said direction is well wasn't that drunk so
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.440]   jay still yeah we have here yeah you know i'm one of the things that really excites me about the apple
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:36.400]   watch is when it like at least i feel like when i pull out my phone be like oh yeah i'm gonna get
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:41.040]   directions to go home and then three minutes later i find that i'm checking twitter and maybe i've
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:44.720]   gotten directions by that point or maybe i've just gotten completely lost because
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:50.160]   the phone you know despite the fact that it is a single target app you still have so much accessible
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:55.280]   on the phone that it's very easy to subconsciously just try and do a whole bunch of tasks whereas
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:59.840]   the watch right yeah exactly the watch is so single focused that either you know it buzzes you for
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.440]   something very specific or you have to request something very specific you can't just be like
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.440]   i'm just gonna play around and it does feel it feels less intrusive to me to general natural
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.960]   conversation then pulling a smartphone out and having a smartphone around i realized i have i
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:21.520]   figured out what the killer app on the phone is i realize i very often pull out my phone hoping
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:27.600]   to be delighted amazed impressed excited and then i look at it i go no there's nothing here for me
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:31.520]   today and i put it back in my pocket maybe instagram or facebook but somebody should make an app that
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:36.640]   just you guarantee every time you you tap it you're delighted adorable kitten adorable kitten app
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:42.160]   and then we just i would use it all the time i'm just saying that that that's actually the rationale
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:48.080]   for twitter putting in uh random tweets in your in your screen just be more delightful to the top
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:53.200]   and how's that every every if you're doing that pull down you want you want that dopamine hit yes
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:58.000]   dopamine it's all about the dopamine baby i said reddit oh i mean it's just the most
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.400]   concentrated form of cuteness on the planet because yes everyone is partying in this
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:07.840]   yeah i mean the whole watch so also don't you get irritated at having to recharge it every 24 hours
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:13.200]   no i have to do that with everything i just i go to bed put my watch in his charger put my phone
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:16.800]   in its charger and i can wake up it's all done yeah but we're both old enough to remember a watch where
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:21.280]   you change the battery once a year yeah i know but i remember i remember phones that lasted a week
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:26.400]   on a charge and i noticed i were to go back to that i remember when we used to boil soup in the uh
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:31.840]   in the fireplace it doesn't necessarily have to stay that way and i know it's not such a big deal i
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.800]   know i never understood that frankly you just take it off what do you what do you don't it was too
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:41.040]   much trouble to put it in the dock well no but you then you've got to carry the dock around with you
[02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:44.880]   no i don't know if you go off hiking for a week you can complete this is that's one thing on the
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:50.560]   motor 360 it is a Qi charging device so any Qi charger will charge it wirelessly that means i
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:55.920]   and i've got those all over the place yeah i i love Qi i'm getting coming around to it myself
[02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:00.960]   yeah just going with us while it's charging it's pretty cool you get the right charger yeah it's good
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:08.880]   monument val i love this uh u.s two games was unusually uh transparent in talking about this was the
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:14.720]   game of the year on on ios uh and android monument valley i'm sure you all played a great puzzle game
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.440]   uh they talked about how much money they made how much it cost to make how many sales they had
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:26.160]   2.4 million sales that was mostly ios 1.7 million ios only 300,000 on google although they came later
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:31.680]   to android big day though on amazon the the day that amazon gave it away for free on their app store
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:40.240]   407 000 sales but this is the sad news lots of piracy uh 10 million unique devices which means
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:46.000]   75 percent of all installs were pirated installs doesn't mean they didn't make money highest one
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.080]   day revenue was on launch day on ios the the the they talk about how much it costs to make
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:58.080]   uh which is kind of interesting usually yeah i really love this it took them 55 weeks to develop
[02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:05.120]   the original game cost 852 000 it's 18 members based in london uh then they did the forgotten
[02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:12.000]   shores add on and that actually cost took 30 weeks almost and cost 549 000 so the total cost uh
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:19.040]   just a little bit uh about i don't know i'll do some quick math uh 14 million 14 1.4 million
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:25.600]   dollars but they made 5.8 million yeah uh not not so bad i think good return most of it
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:30.320]   81 percent of it from ios well this was the problem amazon's sorry android seemed to have
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:34.800]   much bigger problems with piracy right and yeah you got to wonder where were those 10 million unique
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:39.840]   devices where they mostly android devices uh almost certainly i was so apples got such a tight
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:44.640]   lock on its apple on its app ecosystem whereas android is all over the place on it and that's
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:50.000]   bad needs malle earn its bad needs in piracy i should point out that 10 million installs some
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:55.680]   of those are legit family sharing um i install it on everything i buy it once and put it on all
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:07:02.400]   my phones so what that doesn't say much that actually doesn't say the full uh cost of the uh
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:07.440]   piracy um 50 percent of players who started the game completed it that's a very high number i'm
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:13.440]   surprised i said from mobile game that is yeah um 2.2 million totems were drowned i don't know what
[02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:19.520]   that is but that probably makes sense all right be totem and what's interesting is only a quarter
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:25.920]   of the players bought the second uh pack the puzzle pack yeah did you finish the game you obviously
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:32.800]   did oh yeah i love i love that game it's a great game and it's it's adorable and you know it it
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:37.840]   i appreciate it in the day and age where you know you've got your flappy bird you've got your you
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:43.920]   know desert golf you've got your crazy games where you are playing forever and drowning into you know
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:48.400]   but at the same time like monument valley is self-contained and it's a little cute story and it
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:53.920]   really it's delightful yeah it's it's challenging it's thoughtful but at the same time it's soothing
[02:07:53.920 --> 02:08:05.120]   and calm there's no timer instagram 17 on ios 17,965 people posted their pictures of their uh of their
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:11.200]   quest on instagram just so you know only 14,000 on twitter so another big win for instagram people
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:16.400]   with way too much time on the hands look how i'm doing i just love that uh we're gonna wrap it up i
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:22.720]   want to make a one little note uh young guy who worked for us for a couple of years and really uh

[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:35.760]   thanks to a uin rankin on the british tech network where eric lannigan made some appearances he uh
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:41.680]   informed me about it and he has created a condolence uh blog he has spoken to eric's dad i was at first
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:45.760]   a little concerned i don't want to announce somebody's passing uh unless we're absolutely
