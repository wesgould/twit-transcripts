[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920]   Do you know that I have a start button for this show?
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920]   John C. Devorak is the year before.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.920]   [LAUGH]
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   From channeldevorak.com, good to have you in studio once again.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920]   10.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.320]   Also with this, Gina Smith, I feel like it's old home week.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   It is old.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.480]   When John left Devorak on computers, I called Gina and she came in and took your place.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.480]   Gina Smith has a new domain called...
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.720]   She was scared to death.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720]   She was at the time.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   She was...
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   Was she shaking?
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720]   Well, you're shaking.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   Now I'm scared.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.520]   That is where you have gone with all of your...
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   Minions.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   Minions, including Mr. Moore.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520]   Including Mr. Moore.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   I'm helping her.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   Are you a minion?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520]   Yeah, apparently.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.520]   I'm going to great story.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   I'm going to tell you about one of your minions, just to say.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   I have minions.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   Everyone has minions.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.920]   Also joining us, Dan Patterson, formerly of ABC Radio News.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.160]   He is now doing something super cool.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.640]   He's reinventing journalism as we speak.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.720]   He's in his new studio.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.720]   It's kind of...
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   How many mics does he have?
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   Well, he does a show there.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   Unless those are props.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   I'm sorry to get him.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   Dan is covering the campaign, but you're kind of on your own.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   No, I'm not on my own.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   I started a podcasting company, Leo.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   It's called Co-Point.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   You're not allowed to do that.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   Please disconnect him immediately.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   No, I don't have venture capital because I don't need it or want it.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   I mean, this is a real deal company.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   You know why?
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.720]   Because podcasting is cheap.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   Well, it's cheap.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   I mean, having a business model, how novel?
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   We're...
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   But Dan, you've done some really...
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   You've always done some interesting.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   When you left ABC News, you were covering the Occupy movement kind of on your own.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   You were using Storify to tell the story of the Occupy movement.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   And then you got credentialed and were covering the campaign.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   You're not in the campaign trail anymore?
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   You know, I go back and forth.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   But yeah, this is the second presidential campaign I've covered.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.720]   And I mean, back in '08, '07 and '08, I used Twitter very early on.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   I was in Darfur for a while in '08 and used Twitter and social media to cover the war there.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   And this year, it's really interesting to see the adoption.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.720]   You know, back in '08, we all had to evangelize these social tools.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   And now, you know, they're pretty mainstream.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   Now you have to tell Rupert...
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Rupert, stop tweeting.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   Yeah, right.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   Now, kidding.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   Which tweeting means...
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   Cut it out!
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.720]   It's great.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   Press credentials for all.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   And now, right.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   Now you can be on the web and be credentialed and meet Robotmit.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   Isn't that great?
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   Robotmit.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.160]   Also here, the man who crowned me president of the internet, and that's going to guarantee
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.720]   you a regular seat on the panel, Mr. Jason Heiner of TechRapublic.com.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.720]   I just wanted to say that I love the stuff Dan's been doing.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   I've been following Dan on Twitter for a couple of years, and we've podcasting before a couple
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   of times.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   Isn't it cool?
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   It's really cool.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   Yeah, it's wonderful to see how media is changing dramatically.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   So here we have, you know, the perfect example of the old school.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.720]   You know, I first got a machine, and then there's a hand crank.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   So I had lunch with Tom Anderson.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   Actually, I have to tell this story like Paul Harvey would tell it.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   So now you know the rest of the story, but I can't.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.720]   I have to tell it backwards.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   I should do it.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   I should do it backwards.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   Hello, America, and standby for news.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   Paul Harvey.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   So he, I'm sitting in my having lunch.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   He said, you know, I used to work with you before I found in my space.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   Paul Harvey?
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   No, Tom Anderson.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   So really?
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   He said, yeah, I was an intern at ZDTV.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   He wrote, he wrote for internet tonight with Michaelan Harriet.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   But then he said, but even before that, I wrote chapters.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   What am I hearing?
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   Why are you?
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   I'm trying to say.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   I'm trying to say so.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   John, you're here.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   You don't have to watch the show.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   You can actually.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   I wanted to get to the chat room.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   Sorry.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   I muted you.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   Sorry.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   But before then he wrote a chapter.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   He wrote, he wrote for you.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.720]   He wrote chapters of War X, God and Telecommunications.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   He said John won't remember me.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.720]   I remember him to the minute.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   Do you, Tom Anderson?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   That's so cool.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   So we both wrote for you in the good old days.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   Right.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   Isn't that great?
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   And now you're.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   We were all on Tech TV.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   A minion.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   Yeah, and I'm working with Jason Heiner.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   Are you working with Jason as well?
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.720]   Kinda, right, Jason?
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   Would you say?
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   So Jason, you're referring to CBS via Tech Republic, CBS Interactive Onstick Republic.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.720]   I can cover consumerization of IT.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   You're writing about the what?
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   I'm writing about consumerization of IT.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   Holy camole.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.120]   Why is this thing turning off the?
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.120]   People bring in their iPads.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   It turns it off.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.120]   Which is a beat.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120]   No, no.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.120]   Right, Jason?
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   Absolutely.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.120]   It's a really important one.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.720]   A lot of money, you know, it's daked with, you know, enterprise now, not controlling.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   That's right.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   The stack is right.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   So, Gina's great work.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   Look, I didn't do any.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   I'm killing it.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   I'm killing it.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   I'm killing it.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   But these guys are talking over here.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.720]   Just so you know.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.400]   Can I get you in the chatroom, John?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.720]   I'm in, I'm getting in the chatroom.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   It's a computer, John.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   It's a whole new concept.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   This actually is really nice.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.520]   This is Dell's MacBook Air clone.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.440]   Everybody who's doing these ultra mobile PCs is doing it.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.960]   This is a Dell XPS.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   That's nice.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   It's kind of like it's aluminum.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   It's lightweight.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   It's very thin.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   It's probably really real tough.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   What happens when you drop it?
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   I don't know.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   Should we try it?
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.960]   Drop it.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   Yeah, let's try it.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960]   Burn it.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   Freeze it.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   No, I won't do that.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   It's all to take mine.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   It's got a nice little grippy thing.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.960]   She tried pushing it.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.960]   I like it.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.960]   It's got a grippy thing.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   It's on the bottom.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.960]   It's called rubber feet.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.400]   That one, I don't have the Mac.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   I don't have the Mac.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   I have something separate.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.760]   You know, I have a cover that ungrips it.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.880]   Oh, that's why it's red.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.760]   That's why it's red, baby.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.080]   So there is lots to talk about, including right now a breaking story which has pretty
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.960]   much broken from the Sunday times of London.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:09.840]   It's so funny because Read Write web and others have reported on it saying that it's
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.880]   behind a paywall and they apparently didn't want to pay the two pounds to read the article.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.320]   So they're all saying, we don't know what they said, but Fox says they said this.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.760]   This is so bad.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   I tried.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.240]   Well, no, and that was my thought also.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.640]   I thought, well, just pay two pounds and find out.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   And I tried and you saw me do it.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.880]   I tried to pay two pounds.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   You couldn't get in.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.880]   And it's a mess.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.880]   Craped out.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.880]   So they got my money.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.120]   So what you're telling me is that Murdoch makes a big stink about this paywall thing.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.360]   You spend the two bucks and you can't even get on.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   It's a crap.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.160]   Well, not only that, apparently the story itself is a piece of crap.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.720]   So here, let me read you what's going on.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:53.960]   Fox News summarized the article that says Facebook using its Facebook app was reading
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.240]   text messages on your phone and admitted to it.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.680]   According to Fox News, furthermore, YouTube can remotely access and operate your smartphone's
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.800]   camera.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.600]   Flickr, Badu and Yahoo Messenger have access to users' private information.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.400]   I mean, if this were true, especially the Facebook allegation, it would be a bombshell,
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.000]   a huge story.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.120]   And that's why I was trying to get to the bottom of it.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.720]   My suspicion when I first read this is I want to read more.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.560]   I wasn't sure that this was exactly.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.880]   Well, and by the way, talking about accessing other things.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.360]   Here get that microphone in your face.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.360]   This is the first thing I always do to one of these machines.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   Oh, look at that.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   John's taped over the camera.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   I always tape over the camera.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.120]   So you're worried about getting a spine upon?
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.200]   Here anybody wants to use my camera.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.440]   It's not taped over.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   John, see that?
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   That's a camera.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   That's a camera.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   That's a camera.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.960]   Oh, but you're in the bathroom when you use that.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.760]   Go on, Leo, just you're trying to do.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.400]   You're going to do some, you're doing material.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.440]   So let me talk, let me talk a little bit about this.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.520]   The Facebook has responded to Ian McKenzie responding on Facebook.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.200]   Says another day, another piece of disingenuous reporting that does nothing for journalism
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.760]   and confuses users.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.440]   And apparently he says we worked with a Sunday Times to explain why the Facebook Android
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:20.040]   app requests SMS read and write permissions.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   Here's what we sent them.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.000]   Facebook is currently running a limited test of mobile features which integrate with SMS
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   functionality.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.720]   SMS read write is not currently implemented for most users of the mobile app.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.160]   But as part of this test, we declared the presence of that functionality within the
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   app store permissions.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   That's part of Android.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.000]   If you've ever used an Android phone, you'll get a list of things.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.280]   The phone says this app wants to do all these things.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.160]   And what does everyone always do?
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.400]   Say, yeah, whatever.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.800]   I don't even read them.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.800]   I mean, this really is a rehash of the, right, we've had this conversation a million times
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   and a long time ago.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.880]   It's just the default permissions that we all kind of clicked.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.400]   To say that they are reading it is really this harkens back to the story you did last
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.320]   week about, you know, the declining state of tech quote unquote journalism.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.640]   I think it's worse than that.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.600]   I don't think that this is accidentally bad journalism.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.000]   I think this is maliciously bad journalism.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.320]   You think it's maliciously bad?
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.000]   I mean, I just think this is lazy reporting, but this is I think it's I think it goes part
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.920]   and parcel with the same sensationalist reporting that sister publication, The Wall Street Journal,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.080]   has been doing about privacy.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.520]   I think that this is good copy.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.400]   It sells papers.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.840]   It generates links and I whether I think that they look at a blind eye to the fact that
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.800]   they may or may not be doing this.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.560]   They they write it in such a way that it can't be said that's wrong, but they but it's very
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.720]   sensationalistic.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.160]   It's saying they're asking for permission.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.160]   They must be doing it.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.400]   Essentially, and I think that sells papers, but it but I think that it is also scary to
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   people.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   And I think it doesn't.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   I don't know.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   Anyways, scared by it.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.240]   Yeah, I agree with her.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   Right.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:09.800]   No, in fact, as as as Ian now, I don't know who Ian McKenzie is, but he's writing on on
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.040]   behalf of Facebook.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:22.000]   He's he's saying that as far as he can tell, nobody at the times looked any farther than
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.080]   what permissions these apps asked for.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.600]   Now that's admittedly an issue.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.720]   And as part of it is the is a is actually the fault of Android that in order to it happens
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.680]   on the iPhone too, in order to do some things that you want to do, you asked ask after ask
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.240]   for broader permissions than you really want.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.800]   In this case, Facebook said the features aren't used outside testing.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.960]   It was a small number of people who we tell exactly what we're doing.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.720]   And what we're doing is testing things like carrier billing.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.520]   That's why we need to read and write SMS messages.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.360]   He says the paper wrote companies are using smartphone apps to extract vast quantities
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.800]   of private information about users lives.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.240]   In some cases, reading the text messages and intercepting calls.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.440]   I find it hard to believe that any company would want to intercept anybody's calls.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.640]   What would you do with that?
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.600]   Don't you hire enough people to listen to those to make it worth it?
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   You can target people.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   I think that's the real concern.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.680]   And that's what the real business is.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.920]   Okay, I got a guy that's one of my customers and he's on the phone all the time and I
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.000]   can listen to his call and he happens to be a stockbroker who has some great clients.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.640]   I'd love to listen to these calls.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:34.320]   But I don't think that a big corporation like Google, Facebook, Apple, this is important.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320]   They're business model.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.000]   How do you know it's not the part of the stock tips?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.960]   In the executive suite, I'd do it.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.640]   Have you ever worked for a company where you have not found a guy that's an IT that says,
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.840]   "Yeah, I got the payroll for everybody to come to me?"
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   That does happen.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   That always happens.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.080]   And you know if they're doing that, they're doing other stuff.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.760]   And that was the complaint about Dropbox that you weren't allowed to use your own encryption
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.760]   keys.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.760]   Dropbox knew what your encryption key was.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.880]   The concern was somebody in the back room would take advantage.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   And they do.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   They're boring.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   Among those that...
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.560]   Again, reading from the London Sunday Times.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:11.600]   Among those that admitted reading text messages this weekend was the Internet giant Facebook,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.000]   which said it was accessing the information as part of a trial to launch its own messaging
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.720]   service, which has already been launched months ago.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.240]   Companies ranging from Facebook and Apple to small operations run by individuals gain
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   access to the treasury of data when people agree to the terms and conditions of downloading
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.240]   an app.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   Well, I mean, this is the business.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:40.200]   When Facebook went public, somebody wrote a ridiculous article on one of these blogs
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.520]   out there that said, "In the Facebook documents that went forth, it didn't ever say what
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.520]   business Facebook did."
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.520]   And Facebook said they were in the...
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.960]   They're in the business of...
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   In the spying on us.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.400]   Yeah, they're in the data aggregation business.
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.400]   What are they doing?
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.840]   I mean, it's a hugely profitable...
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840]   Go ahead, Jay.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   Selling stock.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.880]   One other question is that on all these apps, like you said, both Android and iPhone, we've
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   agreed to a lot of these permissions and we've given carte blanche to a lot of companies
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.960]   to do stuff that a lot of us would, frankly, be uncomfortable once we find out it happened.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.000]   So, this is related to the path thing to a certain degree.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.040]   It's related to some of these other apps that are sort of overstepping their bounds in
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.560]   some of the things that they're doing.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:33.600]   In some cases, they're overstepping the permissions and in other cases, the permissions are there
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.320]   and companies can do a lot of things.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.120]   And I think we're going to see more things come out where some smart companies are either
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:46.120]   going to do this sort of on the slide or they're going to do stuff maliciously that they could
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.880]   eventually monetize, pull a bunch of data from people that they could eventually monetize
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.280]   in lots of different ways.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.320]   Part of the problem is we don't have a good solution.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.120]   Right now, there's two ways to do this.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.560]   One, are the Apple Way, which is a company just writes an app.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.360]   Apple presumably vets it, decides whether what it's doing is okay or not.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.040]   Doesn't tell the user because Apple doesn't have that set of permissions and just says,
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.480]   you're approved or disapproved.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.640]   The other way is the Android system where there isn't much oversight, but a software
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.600]   does have to say, this is what I want to do and that list is given to the user.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   And clearly we have problems with both solutions.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.040]   What if, now let me just, let me just pose this this way.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.280]   I don't think, I don't think any of these companies really want anything about you personally,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.280]   John C.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.920]   If I was a stock broker with some great clients, they would.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.400]   What if I were a company creating an internet app, a really cool internet app that I didn't
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.440]   want to charge for.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.760]   I wanted to have it be ad supported.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:53.280]   In order to make this a viable business proposition, I would need to know what my users were doing
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.600]   so that I could give them appropriate ads.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.520]   I would need a way to track this.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.640]   And I would need a way, and I would want, because I'm a responsible business person,
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.440]   some way to notify the user that I'm doing it without overwhelming them, without getting
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.480]   too technical.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.400]   To make, for instance, when you buy a grocery store card at a Safeway store, you know what
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400]   you're getting.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.480]   You're giving them personal information and return for lower prices.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.480]   You refuse to use such cards.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.480]   I know.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.480]   Okay, but that's because you know what you're doing.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.200]   And some insurance companies going to get a whole lot of information and boom, they're
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.960]   going to make that intelligent choice.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.120]   Or you do this on a couple of ones, that's a thing.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.400]   Everybody does this, right, Dan?
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.480]   And so the question is, how am I as a company supposed to create a valid business plan that
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.840]   I don't get attacked by everybody for spying on them?
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.080]   Maybe you shouldn't be spying on them.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.880]   Well, I can't, then I can't give you the free service.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.840]   Well, I think we as consumers need to change our expectations instead of expecting that
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.920]   companies are going to treat us with any kind of like, I mean, companies, Leo, the path
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:56.600]   that you just described is, you know, the best intentions are still going to lead us
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   to hell.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   Exactly.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.880]   And even though I may want to, I have the best intentions at heart, it doesn't matter.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.520]   We as consumers need to change our expectations and not assume that a company's motive is
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.680]   not to make me happy.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.840]   They have a profit motive, particularly a public company.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.080]   And we just need to assume that if we engage in this space, our data will be sold out at
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:28.320]   one point or another and take personal precautions and either not use this stuff or not assume
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.800]   that our data is being protected.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.360]   I think a lot of internet users are acting like somebody walks into Safeway saying, I
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.080]   want those lower prices, but I don't want the card.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.080]   Right.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.800]   And the way you get the lower prices without the card, that's the irony.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   How do you do that?
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.120]   You just say, I don't have a, I don't have my card.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   I don't have a card.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   I don't have it with me.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   I forgot my note.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.200]   Or this person behind me, can we use their card and they swipe their card and they get
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   credited.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.400]   That's what you do because of the insurance companies are hacking when you're never had
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.400]   a problem.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.520]   That was not being tin foil had insurance companies are not tracking your grocery store
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520]   card.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   They want to.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520]   Not too.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.520]   Have you ever been, I think the speech was a progressive people once in Cleveland.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.000]   Holy crap, you go back in the back room with these data guys.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.840]   Progressive never was at the time I went to, they weren't an insurance company.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.440]   They were nothing but a data collection company that did all kinds of schedules so they could
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.720]   say that this guy has to be charged this much and this guy has to be charged that much
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.960]   because this guy's more dangerous.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   He's got a certain age.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   So here's the choice.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.960]   Then here's the, here's the choice.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.400]   You don't get these free apps.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.680]   You don't get the grocery store cards.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.960]   You don't use them or you don't get the free deals or you get the government involved and
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.360]   then we regulate the hell out of it.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.360]   Or you educate yourself.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.840]   I don't think the government needs to help.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   How does education help?
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.680]   Okay, for let me give you an example.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.560]   On March 1st, Google will unveil its unified privacy policy.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.440]   You know about this, right?
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.800]   So there is a way, if you're smart and you look around that you can go online and you
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:57.160]   log into every Google account you have, your Gmail, your YouTube, your Google Docs, everything.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.180]   Follow two or three steps or clearly outline on the electronic frontier foundation site
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.320]   layout and you can clear all that stuff before March 1st.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.080]   As long as Google doesn't save it somehow.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.600]   Google saves it for 18 months.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:18.240]   They claim on the Google dashboard and the EFF has pointed this out that you can opt out.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.200]   And I think that that's why I think Google's doing this right.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.120]   Not everybody's doing that by the way.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.720]   But I think that's pretty good of Google to offer that as a capability.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.880]   You can't do it until March 1st.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.160]   So are you going to do that on everything that you use?
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   Sure.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160]   Every app that you use from now on?
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.660]   Defending this in such a way that you're working on something.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.660]   No, I'm not.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.660]   I don't want to know.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.660]   Maybe you're aggregating.
[00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.660]   I don't want to know.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.260]   I just I think that there's a couple of things.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.100]   There's this knee jerk reaction that people say, oh, but you're getting my stuff.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.100]   Nobody wants your stuff.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.300]   Maybe the insurance companies.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.180]   Nobody really wants your stuff.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.460]   Advertisers want your stuff in aggregate.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.220]   I think that's an aggregate.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.580]   They don't care about an add to Leo Laport.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.780]   They want to get all of the mid 50s guys in Northern California or whatever.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.780]   They don't care about me.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.600]   How is that a privacy and you know, and fraction?
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.200]   Secondly, what you're the what you're are what people are arguing is going to end up
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:12.280]   with either European Union style government regulation of this or you're going to lose
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.600]   all the free stuff that you get.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.920]   Bye bye to the free services.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.520]   What free stuff are we going to?
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.480]   Facebook and Google are free.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.520]   You use either Facebook does it.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   Google.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520]   Yes, I do.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.520]   But Google makes this money from advertising.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.520]   It doesn't.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.720]   And this whole thing is a bunch of bull crap, by the way that they're aggregating all
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   this information.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.380]   All I know is I go and I looked it look for one product and for the next three weeks,
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.380]   I keep getting ads.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.380]   So what?
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.380]   That's wrong with that.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.140]   That shows me that it doesn't work.
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.140]   It's a scam.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.140]   Well, if they could they could they who are they scamming their scamming the advertiser?
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   Of course.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.140]   Well, who cares?
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.140]   Let them scam the advertisers.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.140]   Fine.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.140]   But they don't need to be bugging me about it.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.140]   You can go.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.140]   I don't want to be part of their scam.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.140]   There it is.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.140]   Don't use Google.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.140]   I don't want to be part of it.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.140]   I'd like.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.140]   Okay.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.140]   I use screw will half the time anyway.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.140]   Screw.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.140]   They closed.
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.140]   They did.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.360]   Face as Google disconnected them.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.280]   It all gets back to the story, right?
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.000]   A couple of a couple of weeks ago.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.040]   Target knows your pregnant, Jason.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.000]   Target knows that I'm that I'm in second trimester, right?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Not just pre-gradulations.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Thank you.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.840]   You feel great about second trimester, by the way.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.360]   Best part of all.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.520]   All the endorphins kick in.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.520]   They do.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.440]   So, so I don't know why defending these guys.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.760]   We're not I'm not defending them.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.600]   I'm saying that it's increasingly part of what we've what we've this tacit agreement
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:38.560]   that we've made with the services that were increasingly coming to to use all of us are.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.000]   So, but you do have the option.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.360]   I mean, you can be smart about it the ways that Gina and John are talking about and you
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.280]   can, you know, take the tiger by the tail, but you're going to be swimming upstream more
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   and more, right?
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.480]   Because everything we do is being tracked, is being aggregated, you know, big data, which
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.200]   is happening right now is enabling.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:04.200]   We were sort of having the computing power and the tools to take and find and aggregate
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.720]   what you are interested in that.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.360]   The interesting thing about that target thing is what one of the things that came out was
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.200]   that they could that I thought was so interesting.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.560]   They were targeting people setting them specific flyers.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.920]   So not they were in even their print media.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.720]   They were printing if they found out you were pregnant, for example, they say you a specific
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.360]   flyer for pregnant people, you know, mailer in the mail.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:34.760]   So, you know, if they're going if they can, if it's that, if it's cost effective enough
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:40.360]   to do that, you know, just your target mailer that you got essentially was customized now
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.440]   if you were in the sort of pregnancy category, then, you know, we're only a couple steps away
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.360]   from the sort of targeted advertising that we've all known is coming for, you know, a
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   great point.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.040]   So, but we're having to make these compromises and we're the problem is we're tacitly making
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.040]   them, right?
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.160]   And it's going to be harder and harder to swim upstream and get away from it.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.680]   So my question really, my question is what is the solution?
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.040]   So I want each of you to tell me how we fix this problem starting with you, Justin.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   I don't use Facebook.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.040]   No, I can't.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   I'm not saying.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:19.800]   I'm saying in general, I would like to have continued to have these free solutions on the
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   Internet.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.480]   And I understand people's desire for privacy.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.400]   You have no, you have no solution except I'm going to complain a lot and not use Facebook.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   Is that your solution?
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.880]   Is it your ridiculing me?
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   Yes.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.680]   So that's the best you could do?
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.920]   No, I could think about it.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   I can write a column.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.080]   I'll write a column about it.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   What I would do with you.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.080]   What do you, what do we do?
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   What's the solution?
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080]   All right.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.160]   So let me present, I'm not saying that this is necessarily my view, but let me play the
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:47.200]   devil's advocate here and say there's somebody behind you speaking up on you a guy from Google
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.960]   really turning around.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.560]   It looks like he's playing games.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.400]   He's terrifying.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.360]   Let me present the government argument, right?
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.920]   And that is only, I'm not saying this is the best solution.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:07.120]   However, the government is more accountable to us as citizens than a private company is.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.920]   And some type of legislation or regulation saying that you need to present this information
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.960]   and needs to be worded clearly to people.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:22.560]   At least that legislation will in theory come from individuals or from legislators.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:28.160]   I don't think that that is an ideal solution, but I think that the government is more accountable
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.360]   to us than a company is.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.600]   Having said that, I like John's solution.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.640]   I'm going to move this out the code to get a dog and a gun.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   All right.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.760]   So Dan says, let the government fix it.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.840]   Jason, you have a suggestion?
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:47.360]   Well, I think that I don't really like the government sort of getting in this stuff.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   I think they always screwed up.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.520]   They're about to, by the way.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.720]   I'll talk about Lamar Smith's HR 1981.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   It's true.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   But I agree with Dan.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.560]   I think that we're naive to think that this isn't going to happen, right?
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.920]   Because citizens more and more as they sort of realize this stuff is happening are going
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.640]   to, there's going to be an outcry for it and this is going to happen.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.360]   They're going to get involved.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:11.360]   I think that the personal sort of private solution that all of us need to consider is
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:17.960]   that we need to look at this the way that a lot of, essentially, those of us who are
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   in the media look at this.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.560]   You control the message a little bit, right?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:30.360]   You control the things that you, the places where you have these, your cards.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.040]   You control your public stuff that you have out there.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.040]   And then you have some stuff that you do try to keep private and you look at it at the
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.000]   places where you can.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Facebook, right?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.400]   You understand the fact that you can, that all, you know, Facebook wants to make yourself
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.040]   public and that there's some stuff you just want to be for only your friend.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.160]   So some of it is kind of education, but it's just, I think people are becoming more and
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.120]   more sophisticated about their understanding of this sort of social world that we live
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.200]   in.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.720]   The people that have been doing social media longer and longer, right?
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.600]   They start to figure it out, naturally.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.760]   Obviously, the first round, people are up there filing their drunken photos all the
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.760]   time.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.240]   After a while, people sort of start to get it.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.840]   I think we're going to see more informed consumers and I think that's the way that we
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.480]   have to deal with it individually is we sort of have the public persona that they can find
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.800]   and they can see and then we control sort of the private thing, the private stuff that
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.560]   we don't want to put out there.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.720]   I do think, though.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   Personal responsibility.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.680]   Yeah, I do think that, I mean, the personal solutions that Gina described, but I think
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.920]   that the EFF solution and what John describes getting off Facebook, A, nobody's going to
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.800]   do it, but B, it puts a lot of the onus on the consumer.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.320]   Is that really where the onus belongs?
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.720]   That's where it is.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.880]   Because it's because of guys like you, Leo.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   It's my fault.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   I take full responsibility.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   It's not just Leo.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.960]   It's a whole generation of people that don't care about privacy anymore.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.080]   Why should I care what Target knows about me?
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   Right.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   A lot of people don't care, right?
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   And a lot of people don't know.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:06.520]   There was a recent survey that came out that showed that 80% of Facebook users had no idea
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.120]   the state it was being collected.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.320]   So there's a lot of ignorance out there.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   That's pretty ignorant.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   So free.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   I have to say that is amazing.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   That's Facebook.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320]   80%.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   Wow.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   And try to delete your Facebook account.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   It's very rare to develop.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   I know.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.320]   I have done it.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.320]   I have done it.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   I've got to get a groovy post to find out how to do it.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.640]   We live in this age of like no personal responsibility, right?
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   Nobody wants to take responsibility.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.880]   They want to blame all their problems or all the things on the corporation, blame it
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   on the government, right?
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:35.120]   I'm just saying that at some point we're going to have to say people are still responsible
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   for themselves.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.120]   The governments have responsibilities.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.000]   Corporations do have responsibilities, but citizens also have responsibilities.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Is it?
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.080]   Is what Facebook did.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.600]   I mean, Google's done with their dashboard and the ability to delete item by item your
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   personal information.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.560]   Is that sufficient or do we need?
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:52.840]   Google, what Google thing?
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.720]   I think that's a great first step, right?
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.520]   I mean, I've I've I've plugged them for for doing that.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.160]   It does give people it does make it clearer and give you the chance to go in there and
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   do it yourself.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.080]   And it's, you know, pretty self explanatory.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.000]   It's a little complicated, but all in all, I think that's the kind of thing that we're
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.440]   I hope we see more.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.360]   I'd prefer that to a government law, a law.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.800]   Well, that's because the government law be some big, thick document with all kinds
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.360]   of weird crap thrown in there.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.200]   And the next thing you can't walk across the street without getting a ticket.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   That's just a sentence.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.600]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.680]   Like, yes, legislation is convoluted.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:36.280]   I'm not saying government is a perfect solution, but but it at least it is more transparent
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.800]   and the government cut him off.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.080]   And that's it for you.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.080]   There.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.720]   Yeah, the EFF, because I was looking around there on this other story we were going to
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.760]   talk about and they said, you know, our advice in 2006 still holds.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.120]   There are six things you can do to protect your privacy.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.040]   And I thought really, I thought your privacy was gone.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.440]   And I went to their site and this is a lot of work.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.240]   They say, don't put personally identifying information in your search terms ever.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.800]   That means don't self Google, right?
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   This is from 2006.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.000]   That's what's so funny about it.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.040]   The EFF published yesterday that all six of these things still apply.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   Don't use your ISD search.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   Wait a minute, though.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.800]   I have to say, let's start with the first one.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.280]   Don't put personally identifying information in your search terms.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.120]   It makes sense not to put your name, address and credit card number.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.160]   But if you search for Parkinson's disease and Facebook keeps track of it.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.520]   And then you search Leo LePort and then the insurance companies will jack up your rate.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.280]   So it's pretty hard not to.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.880]   In fact, we learned that when all these things are hard.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:47.400]   We learned that when a supposedly anonymized search information from ask.com was given to,
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.400]   I can't remember who, and a reporter in Florida was able to track down a person from that
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   data.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.000]   Because if you aggregate your search terms together, they don't need much to find.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.360]   So it's easy, not so easy.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   Not so easy.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.760]   And it gets harder as their list goes down.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.520]   They say don't use your ISP search engine.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.640]   I don't even know what that means.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.640]   What's an ISP search test?
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.640]   No one uses the word.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   This is from 2000.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.640]   No, they still do.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.280]   They use your provider search engine anymore.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   They still have them.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   Because Google's so much better.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.280]   Go ahead.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   Keep going.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   Get all your information to Google.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   Right.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.920]   Don't log into your search engine or religion.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   Now that's relevant.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.240]   Don't log into your Google Plus or Google account.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.240]   Right.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.240]   So you're not using Google.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.080]   And then there's a really interesting one that was never done.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.040]   By the way, that means that you can't use Gmail.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   You can't use Gchat.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   I don't use Google.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.520]   You can't use a lot of free services, right?
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.520]   I don't use Gmail.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520]   I'm a soundie.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   I don't use Hotmail.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.600]   You also can go and tell them not to record your history.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   That's what I do.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.560]   Sometimes I want to be logged into Google.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.680]   But I don't want them recording my search history, right?
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.440]   So you can, through the tools that you mentioned, Leo.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.440]   You can go in there.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.240]   That's the first tip I would give everybody right here.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:58.920]   Like if you are logged into Google or Bing, go there and tell it not to take your search
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:04.000]   history, to log your search history and try to give you all of its information based
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.480]   on search history.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   So that's a great place to start.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.480]   And you got to do it before March 1st.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.480]   When it comes to--
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.480]   What happens after March 1st?
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480]   That's where Google--
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.480]   That's where Google--
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.480]   --is saying goes into effect and goes into effect and goes into--
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.480]   I think it'll be even easier after March 1st.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.480]   I think it'll be easier after March 1st.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   Yes, it should.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.480]   It should be.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.840]   But Google or rather Yahoo announced the same day that they are only going to keep your stuff
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.840]   for three months, as opposed to the 18 months that Google--
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.080]   Yeah, it's a real question why Google needs to keep it for so long to be honest.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   For the government--
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   For the government.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   For the government.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   You can go to the Google Transparency Project.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.240]   Yeah, I mean, it doesn't help advertising.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.800]   No, no, it's for the government.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.800]   Yeah, and for the police.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.840]   Three months to be plenty for advertising.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:41.840]   The government's got you nailed.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.600]   They got to Google data for the last 18 months and then they have everyone using terabyte
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.240]   hard disk which means you never do any hard disk maintenance.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.880]   So everything you've ever done is on your hard disk for the rest of your life.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   Yeah, now the other thing--
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.120]   Step 4 is block cookies from your search engine.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.120]   You should take it out.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.840]   That's what iOS did automatically in Google and around it.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.080]   Yes, Google and around it.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   I suppose they--
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.560]   So I think they actually did.
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.200]   I think it's still a scam.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.680]   There's more to this than they say.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.440]   And they say, vary your IP address.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.320]   And I thought, OK, now it's too much.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   Now it's too much.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.560]   Well, no, it doesn't even matter if you do because if you change it, the internet--
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.560]   The internet's for bottoms.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.520]   Exactly what I hear when you change this is what the rest of the facility.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.840]   And they recommend that EFF recommends to use web proxies.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.280]   Well, but the Torin network, go into something that slows down everything.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.720]   You know, the truth is though, if you ask me if you're worried about government--
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.920]   I don't know if you're worried about Google, but if you're worried about government,
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:39.680]   using Tor is basically saying, over here, over here, follow me, I'm doing something private.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   Oh, CIA.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   Oh, NSA.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.240]   Now this kind of contradicts what you were saying a little while ago, which nobody cares.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.240]   Now you're saying they're--
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   No, I'm saying.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.360]   I said, if you're worried about the government, using Tor is a bad idea.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.040]   If you're worried about Google, maybe OK.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   Because I don't think Google--
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   Google's in league with the government.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   If you look at the Google--
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.040]   Oh, Google's in league with the government.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Absolutely.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   Well, they were screwed.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040]   Of course we are.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   Hooray.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.400]   Let me adjust that statement a little bit before Google sees me.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.480]   I do know the CIA has a stake in Facebook, so there you go.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.480]   Of course they do.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   They are in best place.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   It's not too.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.040]   The CIA has a venture arm.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.840]   I mean, I don't know what it means that they invested it.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.000]   You can go to the Google Transparency Report and see exactly what law enforcement agencies
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.600]   have asked them to give them and almost always Google provides.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   Everybody does.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   It's not just Google.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   You'd have to be crazy.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600]   What are you doing?
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   It's a great story.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   You're doing business in the US and you say no.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600]   I'm not giving you that information.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   You're going to look.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   You might close your egg and complaining.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   Good luck.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   Sorry, guys.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.120]   I just want to clarify one thing I said earlier.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.120]   It's the web history.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.160]   That's what Google calls it in there.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.160]   The web history.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   You can go into your settings.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.160]   Clear.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.520]   There's a thing that says remove all web history for yourself and then you can also
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.000]   pause it so that it no longer keeps tracking your web.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.440]   Here's some great news.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.920]   Moving it positive.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.600]   Here's some great news.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.360]   The White House has announced a new privacy bill of rights and an agreement not to track.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.360]   It's over.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.360]   We solved it.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   That'll do it.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.360]   No tracking is the ultimate answer.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.440]   American consumers cannot wait any longer for better privacy rules.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.600]   So President Obama took the wraps off his administration's framework for new privacy
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:12.600]   regulations.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.880]   The White House announced the first product of that framework, the completion of an industry
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.640]   agreement on do not track technology for behavior based web advertising.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.640]   It's over.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   Thank you.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   Congratulations.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   Peace is breaking.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   Yes, we're happy.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   Well done.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   Bravo.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   It only worked.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.640]   They only did it.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.240]   No, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL agree.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.240]   Yeah, they won't do anything.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.440]   They're going to put do not track into their browsers.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.320]   You got to remember that Google's ultimate responsibility is to its investors.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.680]   No, but they agreed.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   The government is, you know what, the...
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.680]   And that's your terrorist.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   Here's the long term.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.680]   Here's the long term.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.600]   Here's the reason Google does go along with this because the last thing they want is
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   a DOJ or an FTC investigation.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   Well, they haven't.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600]   They just got it.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.600]   Right.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.120]   So they're going to go along with anything that the government suggests and to allow consumers
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:03.080]   to opt in to do not track is of course very good business for all of the above.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.280]   But then mostly because most consumers go, huh?
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.280]   Right.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   Well, that's it.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.360]   If you've got 80% or 78% of Facebook users saying they're not even aware there is being
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.360]   there.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.360]   But doesn't this...
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   Isn't this the solution we were asking for?
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.400]   According to the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, consumers have the right to exercise
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.200]   control over what personal data organizations collect and how they use it, right?
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   Right.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.560]   Consumers have the right to easily understandable information about privacy and security practices.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   Right?
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   We all agree.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.560]   Yeah, but this is a document.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.560]   This isn't law.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   No.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.560]   This is empty promises.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   These are guidelines.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   But they agreed.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560]   Google, Yahoo.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.440]   I mean, they had guidelines in your parking lot over there and I parked completely illegally
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   because I have no...
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.440]   We're such a scuff law.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.600]   Now probably a cop is going to write you a ticket.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   It's Sunday.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   They don't have cops in Petalou Mon Sunday.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   That's what I thought.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   They have no cops in Petalou Mon Sunday.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   They're all in here.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   They're all in drunk.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   But people will...
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   They're all drunk.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   They're not drunk.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   I mean, that's what I was told.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.640]   The significance of this though is that, look, it's the executive branch of the government.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.440]   I mean, they're not necessarily jumping on top trying to create new laws.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.120]   But they are saying we're going to take the laws, privacy laws that are in place and we're
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.280]   going to try to put pressure on these companies to act in good faith toward their users.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.680]   I mean, I think that part of it, I like.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.400]   And Do Not Track is in Firefox.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.560]   It's in Chrome.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.640]   It's in Safari.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.320]   You can set a switch on those browsers.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.760]   Very simple for consumers.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.360]   And these companies have agreed...
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.840]   I don't see Facebook on this list.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.000]   Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL list have agreed to adhere to this.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.080]   And I think that that's exactly what we're looking for.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.320]   It's not a new law.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.480]   FTC will enforce this.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.480]   These companies have agreed.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   This is the solution.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.400]   And I think that's the solution to this topic.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   I think we should move ahead.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   We're going to move on.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.200]   But I just think that's the relevant news story.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   We'll see.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.160]   We'll look at all just true crypt, all of our stuff.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.160]   Oh, that's just a...
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.160]   And nobody will...
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   Asking for trouble.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.160]   Why is it asking for trouble?
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.520]   True crypt is great because you true crypt at once.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520]   And only you have the password.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.600]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.840]   There are conflicting opinions.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.080]   The 10th and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals have conflicting opinions on that matter.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.800]   And we'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   Right after the...
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.520]   Gina Smith is here from a new domain.com.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   And what is Groovy Post?
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   Is that related?
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.240]   Well, there are a partner's site.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.400]   And it's not a new domain.com.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   It's a new domain.net.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   Sorry, thank you.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.240]   And a new domain.net is the site that John and I are doing together with a bunch of people
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:26.160]   who bailed from BITE, who are freelancers, who I think are in the chat room.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   Jerry Cornell.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   He's with you too.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   Jerry Purnell is with us.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   And...
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   Awesome.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:35.400]   A number of security experts who I actually believe are spies, so I won't call them out
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   in the chat room.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   But...
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   You know RSA, RSA is in San Francisco next week.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   How many of you...
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400]   We have a pretty good group of people.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.200]   A number of you are here for RSA.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.040]   How many of you work for the CIA?
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.920]   They can't raise their hands.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   But life's gonna be like...
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.640]   You always tell them about the black bones.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.040]   They're supposed to get up and leave, I believe.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   Aren't they?
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.040]   I think they're supposed to...
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   I don't think they're supposed to...
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.040]   You say CIA, they're supposed to...
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.040]   They're supposed to get up and leave.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   You know, I had Eric and my little boy...
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.040]   I never heard that one.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   We were...
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.040]   I was with Eric over the summer.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.760]   And he starts itching.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.280]   We were in front of the White House and suddenly there were cops on horses who were going,
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.280]   "Get away, get away."
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.120]   And they were pushing us back off.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   You particularly?
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.040]   Me and every other tourist in front of the White House in the South.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.040]   What?
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.040]   Oh, you were in the White House.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.080]   We were in front of the lawn and suddenly out of nowhere these guys, literally the cavalry
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.360]   on horses, start pushing us all back and going, "What's going on?"
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.240]   Well, the guy that I'm with is Todd Moore.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.200]   He's one of the guys at a new to me.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.760]   He wrote Tap Move Shake, which is a great book by the way that Wozniak wrote the foreword
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.760]   to.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.400]   At any rate, I asked some guy who had the black glasses on and looked so CIA.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.680]   Wasn't talking to his sleeve because that's how you know.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.680]   He just looked like central casting.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.200]   Yeah, I said to him, "What's going on?"
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.640]   And he said, "Five minutes."
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:52.560]   He goes, "In 4.5 minutes, a helicopter's going to land on the White House lawn and pick
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   up the Obamas."
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   I'm like, "Really?"
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   And he goes, "Look at your watch.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   And in 4.5 minutes, a helicopter."
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.560]   It was great.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   I've got pictures on it.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.080]   Why aren't you glad it would be terrible for like seven minutes or eight minutes?
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   I mean, yeah.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   I don't know how we got on this topic.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.080]   Eventually, the CIA is some point.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   I wanted to run well.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   I'm glad that they're easy to figure.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   I'm glad that they're easy to figure.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.480]   I got kicked out of the White House last spring when I was there for press conference,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   but I won't worry.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   They threw you out.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   Why did they throw you out?
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   Sort of.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   Were you talking in your sleeve?
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.440]   No, they were really serious about it.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.680]   The security is crazy.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:31.000]   I was running in for a press conference on the IT, the Smart Grid.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.040]   They were bringing in, and so it was really interesting stuff.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.360]   But I went there.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:39.280]   It's the one on Pennsylvania Avenue that checks the checkpoint.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   That White House?
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.280]   That White House, yeah.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.280]   That White House is the one or in the...
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   She had a straight out of the Girl Scouts.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.680]   She was thrown out of the White House on her plate.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   So there's two.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.760]   There's a security checkpoint there.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.960]   I thought that I was ready to go in.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.680]   I was just like, "Hey, I'm here.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.360]   I'm ready to go in."
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.160]   And so they're like, "Just wait there.
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.160]   We'll buzz you."
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   I'm like, "Okay, great."
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.360]   So I'm standing there.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.280]   I thought she buzzed me in.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:14.120]   So the gate opens, and I just walk up to the lady behind the glass.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.000]   All of a sudden, out of nowhere, I never even saw.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.040]   You guys come and they've got me by my elbows, and they're like pulling me back.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.880]   I'm like, "Whoa, what's going on?"
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.360]   They hadn't buzzed me in.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.840]   It was a guy that was behind me.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.440]   I see the guy sort of go behind.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.840]   He had scanned his badge and opened it, and was going in.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.920]   So I just kind of walked in with him, not realizing it.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.240]   I thought they were buzzing me in.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.080]   Man, they took me out to the thing.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   They were serious.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   They take you out, beat you.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   You know what they do?
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.000]   They took me out and put me back in front of the gate and said, "You've got to wait
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.560]   here until we buzz you."
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.440]   And I was like, "I didn't even, like I said, those guys came out of nowhere."
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.800]   I mean, I didn't even know there were two guys standing around.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   Secret Service?
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.640]   They are no joke about security on Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.800]   Yeah, and I should have been clear.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   I said CIA.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   It's for service.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   It's not.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   It's for service as well.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.880]   But didn't, you know, it's funny because in the old days you could just walk in the
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.880]   White House.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.920]   Andrew Jackson is very famous for welcoming people to walk in the White House.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.360]   In fact, at one point he had a 1,400 pound wheel of cheese in the, I'm not kidding.
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   And then he'd have a dual with it.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.360]   In the portico.
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.280]   And people would come in, they could have a little cheese, they could talk to the president,
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.640]   they could look around and they could leave.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   And there was no Secret Service.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   That was it.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.320]   When he got inaugurated, he had the equivalent of, you know, coolers on the front lawn.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   Right.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   You might invite everybody to come and have a part of it.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.320]   That's where it should be.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.320]   I'm that sniper.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.760]   If people, people don't believe me.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:36.560]   This is the picture of Andrew Jackson and the giant wheel of cheese.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   And there they are.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.600]   There's people in the White House eating from a huge wheel of cheese.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.600]   There they are.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.600]   In less than two hours.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.320]   I've seen this show go off the track.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.800]   This is the cake taker.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.960]   We may go off the track.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.800]   This is right there, man.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.760]   This is totally off the track.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.320]   It's talking about government cheese.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.560]   It's off the track and then spun out and upside down.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   Government cheese.
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:05.880]   Andrew Jackson was definitely for consumer rights on the internet, I think.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   Andrew Jackson.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.480]   Just all challenge him to a duel.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.640]   I'm just telling you, go to picturehistory.com.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.400]   You can get a high res image of the cheese of Andrew Jackson's cheese.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.200]   I love that sight.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.520]   I never heard of it.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.920]   Now Henry's a bit.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.400]   My husband's so into reading presidential biography.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   That's cool.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   This was 1837.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.400]   I'm fantastic.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.600]   Now what did you got here, Leo?
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   A commercial.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.600]   Oh no.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   A commercial.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:32.160]   I did afford.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.560]   We had Steve Martin, the comedian on Wednesday.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.680]   And during a triangulation show, which you haven't heard it, go listen to it.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:40.480]   Don't look at it because Steve's completely pixelated.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   But listen.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   And I started a Ford commercial.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   He went, whoa.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.000]   I thought he thought we were like Wayne's world.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.240]   Well, you have an advertiser?
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   Wow.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.240]   Wayne's world.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.880]   You got to send you a memo before you do this.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.880]   Whoa.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.880]   Ford.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.880]   Wow.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.200]   This show brought to you by the Ford Motor Company who's really reconsidering their advertising
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.200]   strategy right about.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.280]   Now they are the creators of the fine.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.440]   Unless they like cheese.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.080]   They might like cheese.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   The fine eco.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.360]   Go look for some cheese in the commissary.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.280]   I bet you they come and every time I slip out stealthily.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   I know.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.280]   But I have to call it.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   I know.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:21.120]   Wide shot of John leaving.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.120]   Go ahead.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   Don't leave.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.120]   Have some cheese.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.120]   I'll check my email and tweet.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   Check your email.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.720]   You may smoke them if you got them.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.640]   This episode brought to you by Ford featuring the eco boost engine.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   So here's the issue.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640]   Here's.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.280]   Was he just do bunny ears?
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   He did.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.960]   Hey, you know what that means in Europe?
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.280]   That means in the UK?
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   What?
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   That means up yours.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   If you go to a new domain.net, you can see.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.280]   The way that this way.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280]   Right.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.480]   If you do it the opposite way, it means up yours.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:53.080]   And all of us doing this in our pictures in Europe, they're going, what?
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.760]   Why are they all flipping us off?
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   All these Americans.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.920]   Hey, did you have an ad that you were doing right now?
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   Today's show.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.720]   I guess it's my fault.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.920]   I was the one who brought up the cheese.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.200]   The day show is brought to you by Ford.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.080]   Did I mention that they are the creators of the eco boost engine?
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.320]   You could find out more at Ford.com/technology.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.240]   Amazing technology they're putting into these cars.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.200]   A 21st century car company.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:21.400]   The eco boost engine, the idea is you get the power of a V8 with the economy of a V6.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.760]   That's the 3.5 liter eco boost in the SHO.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.280]   Now they've got two liter eco boost.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:30.720]   Those are four cylinder engines that give you great pickup, great fuel economy.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.280]   You feel like you're driving a big car.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.880]   You are because it's in the 2012 Explorer with a 2012 edge, but you're getting small
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.880]   car economy.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:45.640]   In fact, an EPA estimated 28 highway miles per gallon on the 2.0 eco boost four wheel
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   drive.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.320]   That's the best in class for large utility vehicles.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   How do they do it?
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.960]   Well, two technologies, direct injection, of course.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   That produces a cooler.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.800]   I'm going to read this copy because I have no idea.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   It sounds so technical.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.600]   You don't have as much about cars?
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   Nothing.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.000]   I do drive a Ford Mustang.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   It's got a V8.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.280]   It does not have this.
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.480]   I wish it did actually.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.480]   It's got a direct injection produces a cooler, denser charge.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.840]   It generates more power per drop of fuel.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   Really?
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:15.840]   Yes.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:20.840]   And then now sometimes I've been told that the old turbo charged engines, big turbine,
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.960]   takes a little while to spin up because a lot of momentum in there.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.240]   And that gave you something we call turbo lag.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.320]   This is they're doing two smaller turbines.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.840]   Let me play that video again because they show in here.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:38.320]   Two smaller turbines that spin up right away, so there's no lag, but you get a huge amount
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   of torque.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.960]   What a turbine does is it takes power from the engine's exhaust to spin those turbine
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.000]   wheels, then compresses the air and the cylinder.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.440]   And that pressurized air, again, significant increase in performance per liter or gallon
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.960]   if you're here in the US.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:02.360]   So the 2.0 liter EcoBoost engine now available on the 2012 Explorer and Edge and next year,
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.360]   the 2013 escape.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.600]   Actually, it's not next year.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.600]   It's in the spring.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.560]   The 2013 escape will offer 1.6 liter and 2.0 liter EcoBoost engines.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.040]   Again, great performance and great gas mileage.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.520]   It's kind of a holy grail.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:21.160]   Actually, if John were here, he's the guy who told me about that one of the goals in engine
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.680]   design, this kind of holy grail is to get one horse per cubic centimeter.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   Really?
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.680]   I never knew that.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.880]   Yeah, that's like, in fact, when he comes back, I'll ask him.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:36.880]   He told me this, this 1.6 liter engine, which is what 1600ccs, or I don't know, I'll have
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.880]   to ask him to do the math.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:41.080]   But anyway, it's more than one horsepower per cubic centimeter.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   It's amazing.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.320]   365 horsepower and the 3.5 liter V6.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.600]   420 foot pounds of torque.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.720]   It's incredible.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.800]   So take a look at it right now.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   You just go to Ford.com/technology.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.040]   I'm trading in my BMW.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.040]   You should.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.600]   You would love this and you'd love the Ford Sync.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.160]   Scott Monty and his sister.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.160]   All the technology.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.160]   Ford have really made.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.160]   Isn't he?
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:11.320]   He's really a nice guy and he makes Ford seem hip, which it is hip and it has become
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.320]   so.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.640]   I'll tell you, if you hang out with Alan Malali, you will see how hip it is.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   He wears the sweater vest.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.800]   He looks just like that.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   Ford.com.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   How come?
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   Like, technology.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.200]   That's great.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.680]   The first time I met Alan, I wore suit.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.480]   I thought I'm meeting the CEO of a Fortune 500, a Fortune 10, whatever company.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.640]   I'm going to wear a suit.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.600]   He's wearing a crew, you like a pat, but he looks like Pat Boone.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.320]   He's got a V-neck sweater.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.840]   Maybe he's thinking the first time I'm going to meet Leila Porte.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:39.440]   It was because the next time I wore a V-neck sweater and he wore a suit.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   Really?
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   Swear to God.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.440]   Of course.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.440]   Very confusing.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.920]   You can never beat two cast outs.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.920]   What is that?
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   Don't let him in.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.760]   Oh, God, we're in trouble.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.080]   John is at the controls now of the show.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.080]   Is he?
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   Oh, no.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.600]   Okay, John, press F on the keyboard.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   Press F.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   Press F.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   What does that do?
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   Go ahead.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   Just see?
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   Look at that.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   Oh, cool.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   You let John drive this?
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   He's never driven it before.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.080]   I'm very nervous.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.840]   He's figured out how to do that.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.280]   He's got some weird transitions.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.280]   Oh, look.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   Wow.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.240]   Oh, yeah, there's a bunch of cool transitions here.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.240]   And by the way, I'm on.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.520]   Hey, how are you guys doing?
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   Good to see you, John.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   You can stay there.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.600]   Can you not tell me once that the Holy Grail of engine design was one horsepower per cubic
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.360]   centimeter?
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.360]   That would be one of them.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.160]   Yeah, it used to be one per cubic inch.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.560]   You remember in the old engagement, you'd have to put a cam in the car and all these
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.840]   crazy things.
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:41.920]   So I ran into these things out here, which is these kind of there's a mad magazine.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.120]   There's an autographed mad.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.040]   And right under it was this.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.840]   You really smell like Tom Buns.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.840]   What is it?
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.480]   What's the name of your show?
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.480]   What's going on?
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.640]   We are brainstorming new names for shows.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.120]   And we thought YRS, LDB.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.120]   It should be it.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.120]   It should be it.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   For sure.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.080]   You really smell like dog bun.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:02.080]   What is that?
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.080]   What is the story of that, by the way?
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   Does anybody know?
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.880]   John, do you know Chad?
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.880]   Nobody knows.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.720]   I'm afraid to ask what a dog bun is, but I guess I can imagine.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.720]   Talks don't have fun.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.720]   It's like a cow patty.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.720]   It's like a cow pat.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.720]   Dogs don't.
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.720]   Let's move on.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:19.120]   Actually, this is a story Gina wrote about in a new domain.net.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.640]   Uh, pleading the fifth.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.120]   Now this is what's interesting on this is there were two decisions from federal court
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.600]   this week.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.920]   The 10th and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:40.120]   The 10th was ruling on a Chicago, uh, story of a Chicago Colorado Colorado.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.120]   That's right.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   Very good.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   Colorado.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:48.040]   They let stand a judge is ruling in that case that the defendant in a mortgage fraud
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.120]   case could be compelled to produce the contents of her encrypted laptop.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.600]   Well, I mean, they can't make her talk.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.800]   Well, they could say you go to jail until you give us the password.
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:02.720]   They sue in jail for contempt of court, which is what they overturned in the 11th Circuit.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.720]   That's so weird.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.120]   The next day, the 11th Circuit Court of Court of Appeals overturned a Florida contempt of
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.760]   court charged.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.240]   This one was for a child pornography suspect.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.040]   He refused to decrypt the contents of several hard drives.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   Five laptops.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.240]   He wouldn't give them his true crypt password.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.200]   The 11th Circuit Court.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:23.320]   He has the right under the 5th amendment not to incriminate himself.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:29.880]   So the real, the really interesting question is if you have an encrypted drive, is giving
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:35.600]   the police the key in, is it, is it self incriminating?
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.280]   And one court ruling says, yes, the other said no.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.280]   This will go all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.280]   You can bet.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   Well, maybe.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.280]   Interesting thing here.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   And Jason, I'm glad you're here because I was going to pitch this as a story for you
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   too.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:54.120]   Is there's a whole cool enterprise angle on this is, say I'm a user in a big company
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.720]   and I decide to use true crypt.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:00.200]   And if you've ever used true crypt, you know, I mean, nobody can get into this hard drive
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.120]   unless they've got that password.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.120]   And I encrypt everything.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.240]   And let's say I break the law, you fire me and I leave and you take my laptop.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:12.520]   I T now, not only has no control over what's on your iPad and on Google Docs, they can't
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.640]   get into any of your email or any of the stuff that supposedly belongs to them on company
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.440]   property.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:24.400]   And that's what are the different than self increment, the right to not to self incriminate.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:30.840]   I mean, if they say you don't have to give up your password, the right that the Fifth
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.880]   Amendment covers your right.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.880]   That's different.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.160]   That's a civil in the IT case to be a civil issue, not a legal issue.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.160]   Right.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.160]   That's different.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.040]   I think in terms of criminal activity, I actually think that given your fingerprints and self
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.280]   incrimination and courts have ruled that it is not, of course, that it is.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   Right.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.120]   But it is your DNA yourself.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.120]   Same thing.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:53.380]   DNA fingerprints, all self incrimination, all completely legal.
[00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:56.040]   Some would say not the courts that that is self incrimination.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.440]   That's why I don't think this will say it.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.440]   I would say it.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.880]   I'm totally on that side of it.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.280]   You understand that you're not in the mainstream.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.600]   I've heard that.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.600]   A couple of times.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:11.080]   It's when anybody want to talk about first of all, the difference to the 10th circuit
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.400]   and the 11th circuit.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.240]   How can that happen?
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.800]   One court ruled one way the other the other way.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.280]   Dandy, you have a thought on that?
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.640]   That happens fairly frequently.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.440]   The way that this could go to the Supreme Court and that would settle it.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.040]   I mean, this is going to be a pretty contentious year for the Supreme Court.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.240]   I don't think they're going to take this.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:33.600]   But it depends entirely upon how each decision is written.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:41.040]   In your particular situation, how your court, and using the second person, if you are
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:48.640]   or if you will rely on this as precedent, it will depend on which one is written and
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:55.440]   which the discretion of the judge to look at which they want to use as precedent and
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.040]   say, well, this one was written better.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:03.640]   This one refers to law in a way that seems to, depending on the district or the circuit
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.400]   that you're in, this is interesting.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.080]   Actually, it's interesting because in San Francisco where we have the hippie, ninth circuit
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.000]   court of appeals, they've just ruled that we're going to have to do that.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.560]   But when the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars, you are allowed.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.040]   You're doing material again.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:21.840]   But that's, I mean, Leo, that is more accurate.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.280]   I mean, that sounds like a joke, but that, I mean, it really comes down to, well, you
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:32.200]   know, this piece fits with this piece and this piece refers to this piece of legislation
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200]   and precedent.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.160]   And I mean, it's going to be--
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.480]   Tim Lee, who writes the law and disorder column for ours Technica says, the issue is,
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.400]   in fact, there is a slight difference in the two cases.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:51.960]   So the cases may be reconcilable and then has to do with two, when he says, while two
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.040]   rulings reach opposite results, they don't necessarily contradict each other.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:01.400]   The results turned on how much the government knew about the contents of the drive ahead
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.880]   of time.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.960]   In previous cases, the courts have held that when the government already knows of the existence
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.440]   of specific incriminating files, they know that that drive contained the law.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.200]   They contain something that could put you in jail.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:18.920]   In that case alone, compelling a suspect to produce them does not violate the Fifth Amendment.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:23.200]   However, if the government merely suspects it, if it's a phishing expedition--
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.200]   Right.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.200]   This is one of the--
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   Which hunt?
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.360]   If it's a witch hunt, then the owner of the hard drive is entitled to invoke the Fifth.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   In other words, if there's no other reason to think that you, to get you in trouble,
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.840]   then the revealing of this, then they can't do it.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:39.840]   Does that apply?
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.440]   The DNA and fingerprints, the same kind of standard?
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.520]   I can't just take your fingerprints and see if you did something.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.800]   Well, that's why if you watch the-- of course, you don't know how much this is actually
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.880]   real or not, but they always try to get you to hold a cup or something in the--
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   Right.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.880]   Then your--
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   Take your tooth, take it, and brush your teeth.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   Yeah, hairbrush.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.880]   Brush your teeth.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   Brush your teeth.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.680]   He cites a 2006 case.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:08.200]   A border guard in Vermont examines the contents of a traveler's laptop and found by file name
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.840]   that several of the files appeared by child porn.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.160]   But when the laptop was closed, the portion of the hard drive containing these files was
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.160]   automatically encrypted.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.120]   Actually, maybe it wasn't the file name.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   He actually saw the pictures.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.120]   They were encrypted after the--
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:21.120]   Right.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:22.120]   That's how the file--
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.120]   Well, the true crypt--
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.120]   Right.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.800]   So if I was logged in and he could see the image, the border guard saw the image and said,
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.800]   "Whoa!"
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.800]   And he closes it.
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.400]   Why is the guy going across a border looking at child porn?
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.440]   Is this guy-- how could weird is this character?
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   You know, travel could be very lonely.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   It is.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.080]   The government sought to compel the suspect to decrypt the files again.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:48.360]   The court in this 2006 case ruled that because a government agent had already seen the files,
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:51.560]   it was okay to say, "You've got to give us the key."
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.680]   Well, this is just like the search and seizure stuff, you know, about the Rico Act, right?
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.600]   Which was created to get mobsters right now.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.040]   And so, but now they use the Rico Act against everybody.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.040]   That's kind of to your point, John.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   I get drug dealers.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.400]   These laws get passed with all sorts of--
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   Right.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   --become additional stuff.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.520]   Yeah, but with Rico, they say, "Okay, well, you know, you have the right for the government
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:15.560]   not to bash your door down and search your house unless you're a mobster, but now they
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.880]   apply Rico to everything unless you're a drug dealer."
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.440]   And they can apply Rico to Facebook.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.440]   Unless we think you might--
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.440]   Unless we think you might--
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.320]   I cite for you the case of Matt Speccarelli.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.840]   Matt Speccarelli is a hero for the modern age.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.840]   Do you know who Matt Speccarelli is?
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   Yeah, but I love his name.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.760]   Remember this name he is, by the way, watching this show right now, he called me on Saturday.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.560]   He sent me an email a couple of months ago, said, "I am pissed.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.280]   I have an iPhone and I have an unlimited plan.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.960]   I'm grandfathered in on my unlimited plan.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:50.080]   I got a message from AT&T saying, "You've used more than the top 5% of our users.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   We're going to throttle you."
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.080]   What does he do?
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.040]   I don't mean to throttle you like this.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.840]   This is your friend?
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   He won this case.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.480]   He went to-- I love this.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.960]   He went to small claims court.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:01.960]   Not--
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.480]   You know, he didn't make a federal case out of it.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.520]   He went to small claims court where you don't need a lawyer, right?
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:07.520]   You bring the case yourself.
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.880]   You can't have a lawyer.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.880]   He was smart.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:13.320]   He called the Associated Press before his day in court and said, "You might want to be
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   in the courtroom that day."
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.000]   The AP showed up.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.920]   So did somebody from AT&T, which is unusual because a lot of times--
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.200]   Generally speaking, the corporation just has asked for it.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.920]   But AT&T takes us fairly seriously.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:29.160]   Matt said, "I had a stack, a 30-inch-tall stack of documents, including bills and everything,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.840]   showing what had happened."
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.920]   He said, "I was throttled.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.720]   I've been watching Netflix.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:41.520]   I used 1.5 gigabytes according to AT&T's own data calculator."
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:45.880]   The judge said-- first of all, Matt told me this on the radio on Saturday.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:52.400]   He said, "First the judge said, 'In this country, we-- the rules get set in small claims court.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.760]   They get set at the most local level.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.160]   This is where true justice happens."
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   Right.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.680]   In fact, small claims courts are a great thing that a lot of people don't take advantage
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:01.680]   of.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   Justice happens.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:08.840]   And in this case, it was unfair for AT&T to sell you an unlimited data plan and then,
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:13.080]   buried in the contract, say, "We have the right to reduce data speeds if you use too
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.800]   much of this unlimited data."
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.480]   He awarded Matt $850.
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:18.920]   He said, "Matt, how much do you want?"
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.600]   Matt said, "Well, I don't know."
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:24.520]   And he said, "The judge said, 'Well, how much does it cost per gigabyte?"
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   Matt said, "A hundred bucks."
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.160]   The AT&T guy said, "Fifty dollars."
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.760]   So the judge said, "Well, we'll split in the middle.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:33.160]   Let's say 85, which is in the middle, but that's fine."
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.800]   And he gave him 10 gigabytes worth or $850.
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.600]   Yeah, we're spoiled.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.000]   AT&T says, "We are appealing."
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   I don't know.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.640]   Today, well, because data throttling is huge.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.440]   Most people are under data throttling plans.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   People on the East Coast.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.440]   West Coast.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.440]   Many of our--
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:51.440]   Why are you--
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:52.440]   Why are you at that message two, three days ago?
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.440]   Yep.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:54.440]   A lot of us do.
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.440]   It's very common.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.600]   I would say most of the people watching or listening to our shows have received from
[00:59:58.600 --> 00:59:59.960]   AT&T that message.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.280]   Hey, I just got it the other day.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.040]   You're in the top 5% of users.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.280]   I wonder if I saved it.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.280]   I don't think I did.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.280]   No, I know.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.280]   I did.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.280]   It took a screenshot of it.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.760]   What are you on the phone all day?
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.840]   Well, Matt was watching Netflix.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.480]   And I said, "Well, Matt, why don't you use Wi-Fi?"
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.920]   I said, "Well, why don't you watch my phone?"
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   But they did?
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   Did you?
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.920]   In his defense, he only used a gig and a half.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   Not much.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.960]   And they said, "You have unlimited service."
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   Seems reasonable.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   Switch to Verizon.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.440]   It's not going to help.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.440]   They'll do the same thing.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:36.360]   You know, in a related case, our good friend, Dane Jasper, who runs SonicNet here at one
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:42.000]   point offered to some professors who are doing a study on how do you fight congestion?
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.080]   And he said, "Well, I'll give you some anonymized customer data so you can see."
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.440]   Their contention and his contention as well is that, in fact, throttling in caps aren't
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.960]   how you fight congestion.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:58.560]   Most of the time, the people who get throttled or capped are not the data hogs.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   That's not the problem.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.080]   They're just people who use it during peak hours.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.000]   And in about 80 percent of the cases, these people are not the ones you really want to
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   go after.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   It's ineffective.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.520]   Dane Jasper then jumps to a conclusion saying, "Really, all of this throttling and
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:18.520]   capping is about preserving AT&T's right to sell you television via U-verse or Comcast
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:21.360]   right to sell you television by Xfinity.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.000]   They don't want you watching Netflix.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   They don't want you using VoIP solutions because--
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.760]   Well, they're going to have to do something about it some other way.
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   They are.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760]   It doesn't work.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.760]   And it's proven not to work.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.160]   So now the question is, "Well, why are you doing it?"
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.840]   Well, when you write a book, they give you an advance and the whole thing is designed
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.960]   so you will make no money past the advance that you get for the book.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.960]   It's a profit deal.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.960]   It's a profit deal.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   It's a profit deal.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.960]   It's a way that they make money.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.000]   They want you to blow through your limits so that you have to pay them.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Right.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   It's just like a gym.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   It's just a gym.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   It's just a gym.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   It's just a gym.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   It's never come back.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   It's just a whole world.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   It's just a gym show.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   It's just a gym show.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   The whole world is against you.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   All right.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   Let's take a break and come back.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   I want to talk about "Morpal World Congress."
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   There's a whole lot more.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Barcelona.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   I was robbed in Barcelona.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   Are you going to Barcelona?
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   I was robbed in Barcelona.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   So it's John.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   They still was passed from Madrid.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   I was robbed by gypsies.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   And I was gypsies.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   Really?
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   How do you like it?
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   I was two.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   And she is a gypsy.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   If you were robbed by a gypsy, would it then be okay to say you were gypped?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   I can say I was gypped, but you did.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   That's how it works.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   Just say it.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   It's considered racist.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   You know how to say that.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   That's recent.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Well, yes.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   It is recent.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   In the old days, you could say all sorts of things.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   It's recent.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   It is really recent.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   And it's bogus.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Let's take a break.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   We're going to come back and voor.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   John C.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Is your channel to voor.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   And now you're writing for a new domain.net and you're doing the actual thing.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   I do actually.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   The X3 thing goes over there and it gets posted.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   What is the X3 thing?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   X3Show.mevo.com.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   It's one of the great shows on the Internet.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   The great show.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.400]   And there's also the Generation X3.mevo.com, which is a good show with the millennials versus
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400]   me.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.000]   Is Meevio going to stick around for a while?
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   I hope so.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   Okay.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Just a question.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   Who said that?
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   Oh, you.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   Okay.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   I thought it was Eileen.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   I was married to all the boys.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   I was married to all of my.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.360]   She's the ear of your ears.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.360]   My ears.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.280]   Coming up in just a bit more.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   So is X3.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.720]   I went to X3.mevo.com and it gave me something else.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   X3Show.mevo.com.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.720]   Oh, X3Show.
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:28.720]   Oh, X3Show.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.720]   Oh, gosh.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.720]   There are an exchange.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.720]   Yeah, you can embed it on your.
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.720]   You can embed it on your.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.960]   And that's what she does.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960]   She prostitutes me.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960]   Is this it?
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.960]   My channel is loading.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   It takes a while to load.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   Activist news of the week.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960]   I think you have there.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.240]   Where's my pre-roll?
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240]   Here it is, all shit.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.240]   Isn't that easy?
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.240]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.240]   That's the show.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.240]   Oh, but you wanted an ad first.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   I was hoping to get an ad.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   I get a piece of that.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.240]   Oh, what does that sound like?
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240]   It often does show an ad for your show.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.240]   I don't know what happened.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   Look at that.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.240]   You got a fancy.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.240]   Where do you do that in your house?
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.240]   It's him and Andrew and I are in Joe and Go.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.240]   And it's a short story.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   It's the same people constantly.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.520]   Do you go to a studio to do that?
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.160]   Yeah, it's down in the basement of the amoeba.
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.720]   We got two studios down there.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.720]   What were they doing?
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720]   You go to Holland?
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.200]   No, it's over here in San Francisco.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.120]   You ask these questions knowing the answer.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   I'm leading.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120]   It's called leading questions.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.760]   Yeah, but you're leading.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.440]   I say, you are leading the witness.
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.240]   This portion of the Twitch show brought to you once again by another reluctant advertiser,
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.760]   Citrix, creators of Go to Meeting.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.760]   And Jakobuchi.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   And Jakobuchi.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760]   You know, he poked me.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   He's not there anymore.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.040]   Do you and I were in a car with the ad.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.880]   Yeah, we backed into it.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.880]   You totaled a car?
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880]   No, no, no.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.880]   There's driving.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880]   That was the red herring guy.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880]   Is that Tony Perkins?
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.880]   That was Tony Perkins.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.880]   We totaled a car.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.880]   Somebody was.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.880]   Stu Gaines was on the car.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.880]   Stu Gaines.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.880]   We totaled a car with Stu Gaines.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.880]   How did you total a car?
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.880]   We totaled three cars, apparently.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.880]   Well, we were pulling out.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.000]   We were at a hard time driving that night in Vegas.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.120]   I was in the back seat.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.760]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.040]   I was looking at the window going, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.200]   Who is driving?
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.840]   I believe it was Stu Gaines.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.840]   We don't remember.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   We don't remember who was driving.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   I was in the back seat with me when we were going, run.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:12.840]   We did run.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.840]   We did run.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.840]   We did run.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.840]   What kind of a story is this?
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.760]   We ran away from the car.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760]   We didn't know what to do.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.920]   We asked him, what should we do?
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.120]   And I said, we should run.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.120]   We'll run.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.120]   I'm from Florida.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.120]   That's what we did in Florida.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.000]   You ever see a Gator eat a dog?
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   I did.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   Okay.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Well, last year.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   I did see a Gator eat a dog.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   I'll tell you that.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.360]   But first, hey, did you do that?
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.200]   That was some full, full, full, full, full flesh.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200]   No, that was me.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   Oh, thank you, Ellen.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.520]   She's like, please, go to play.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.280]   Is the Academy Awards on yet?
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.280]   Not yet.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.440]   Not the Oscars soon.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.000]   They're not streaming that.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.160]   What do you think is going to win?
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.120]   Okay, let's go to the ad first.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.720]   I'll tell you in a second.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   Best movie.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.960]   Let's everybody think about that.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.280]   And while I tell you about go to meeting, go to meeting from Citrix, yes, Eddie Ockett,
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.520]   which is former company.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520]   He's not there anymore.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.560]   He actually does like net jets or something like that.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.120]   No, that company went out of business.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.120]   That's gone too.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:06.080]   And he's now at a company called Virtual Works, which is designed to help with the consumer
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.040]   and the consumerization of IT problems.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:13.360]   So the cool thing about Ed is that he was working at IBM and loaned to Microsoft when
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.920]   they started running NT.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   And this guy--
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   Oh, S2.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.680]   Well, he did-- so it was like a cross trade.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.720]   Like Microsoft guys went to do OS2 and OS2 guys went to do NT.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:27.240]   The idea being that the NT kernel was going to be built into OS2.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:32.800]   And he learned how like the deepest guts of Windows and as a result created Citrix,
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:37.480]   which is absolutely got the fundamental desktop sharing.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   In fact, Microsoft licensed it back for RDP and so forth.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.840]   Go to meeting is based on this incredible, powerful desktop sharing, but it takes at the
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.840]   next level.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.680]   This allows you to do screen sharing and now with HD faces.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.560]   They've also built in video, very high quality video.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.560]   So suddenly--
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.560]   We're meeting.
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   You could turn the sound off on this guy.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.040]   Suddenly you're in a meeting, you're seeing who you're meeting with, even though they're
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.480]   all over the world.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.160]   You're getting their body language is great for sales presentations.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.280]   You can see as a client, you know, going for this.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.280]   And the client sees you, which is great.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.360]   You got to make that personal connection in sales.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.320]   Great for team meetings.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.880]   We started using them for scrums and stand ups in our agile.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.280]   I don't know what that means, but they told me that's what we're doing.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.960]   It is so beautiful, so clear, so fantastic.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.560]   You just got to try this.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.960]   For product reviews and demos, sales presentations, training sessions, those weekly status meetings,

[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.920]   Jason, Dan, Gina, John, you go into Barcelona?
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.160]   I was robbed last year.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   We wish we were going to Barcelona.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   I think John left for Barcelona.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.680]   Yeah, we just got to Barcelona.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.560]   He thinks the flight is too long.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.560]   I would love to.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.560]   Go ahead, Jason.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.560]   I'm not going.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.120]   I'm just saying I'm not going, but we've got it.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:26.160]   Our CNET crew has it covered really well on Bonicha and crew from CNET are doing it.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.720]   We're doing a great job over there, providing some great coverage.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:35.120]   Roger Chang, Jessica Dolkort, I'm forgetting somebody else, but we've got a couple other
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120]   people there too.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.000]   It's going to be huge this year.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   Yeah, that's the one that made it awesome.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.080]   Normally, it's a big cell phone conference.
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.760]   We debated going and decided maybe next year, and I think we will go next year because,
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.720]   you know, not only are all these new cell phones going to be coming out, but Microsoft
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.800]   is there and they're going to, on Wednesday on February 29th, Leap Day, they're going
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.600]   to release the Consumer Preview of Windows 8.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.400]   Three o'clock at five in the morning California time.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   We'll get to see that.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:01.400]   Thank you, sir.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.440]   Can you wear your blue and yellow Leap Day stuff?
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.040]   Well, we're going to lock it yet, can't.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.040]   What?
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.960]   Blue and yellow, you got to wear blue and yellow on Leap Day.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960]   Did you?
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960]   He's making that up.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960]   No.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   You're going to research it.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.960]   You're going to the University of Florida colors.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.880]   Why would you wear blue and yellow?
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   Blue and orange, is it?
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   Blue and orange?
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.280]   No, no, that's the Florida colors.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.800]   Because John watched 30 Rock this week.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   Oh, 30 Rock.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.040]   Oh, all right, I missed that part.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.400]   So first of all, let's talk about what phones are going to come out.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.760]   Then I'd love to talk about Windows 8 and Windows on ARM because both of those stories
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.760]   are going to be...
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.600]   And Adobe's announcing Photoshop at midnight.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   It's...
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.600]   They haven't done that.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.600]   They're doing a new Photoshop at the end of WCT?
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.600]   Photoshop mobile and nine or five full accidentally.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   Right, right.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.600]   Why is this a story in blue?
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   They're in Photoshop.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600]   Why all of a sudden, who companies announcing?
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.600]   Yeah, they blew the important...
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   Who did?
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600]   Nine...
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.840]   I believe it's nine to five Google or nine to five Mac.
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840]   Nine to five Mac.
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840]   Is it nine to five Mac?
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.120]   And it was very funny because they ran the story.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.720]   Here are all the details about Photoshop mobile for the iPad and then they put a big thing
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.480]   on top of it saying, "Whoops, sorry."
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:09.480]   You're saying it's for the iPad?
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.920]   I believe it is for iOS.
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.880]   Yeah, it's very, very exciting.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.360]   I mean, the desktop version of Photoshop is one of the most convoluted applications.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.000]   In terms of downloading it and the crap it leaves on your computer and on the iPad, it's
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.360]   so I've been told it's just going to work.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.760]   Yeah, I bet it's going to be...
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   No, it's weak.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   Exciting as hell.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.880]   With that processor, I'm not going to be able to do anything.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.600]   Well, remember, there's a new iPad coming out in the next couple of weeks.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.600]   Two of them.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600]   The rumors, too.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.600]   I don't know.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:45.200]   Putting these prosumer or professional tools in the hands of everyone who has an iPad, it's
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   incredibly exciting.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.720]   The amount of people who are talented designers who haven't had access to things like this
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:57.480]   and now on very inexpensive devices can do things like Photoshop, that's very exciting.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.880]   It does lend credence to the idea that we are in a post-PC world and that you will not
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   need a PC.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.120]   Avid's released a very nice video editor for the iPad.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.360]   I like it a lot.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:14.000]   It's pretty competitive for even not only with the iMovie, but with really desktop apps.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.400]   Microsoft, even though they denied it, I think it's agreed is going to be doing office on
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.640]   the iPad very soon.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.280]   Microsoft issued a non-denial denial of the original story.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.640]   A non-denial denial?
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.720]   Mary Jo Foley writes about it quite nicely.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.480]   We talked about it on Windows Weekly this week.
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.120]   Let me look up the full story.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:43.360]   I can give you the details of all this Microsoft Office for the iPad.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.000]   The original leak came from the Daily.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.640]   They had pictures and the Daily said they were briefed by a Microsoft guy.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.400]   Peter Ha of the Daily, who's trustworthy, said we didn't fabricate the images.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.880]   A working version of the app was demoed to us by someone at Microsoft.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:08.000]   Microsoft, though, were very clever in their denial.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.160]   They said the picture is not of a real Microsoft software product, which would imply maybe
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.720]   it's a fake picture.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.680]   But in fact, Mary Jo says after working with Microsoft for years, I know what they're really
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.880]   saying is that's not what it's going to look like.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.880]   You cover Microsoft.
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.880]   That's the beta version.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:29.920]   When you cover Microsoft, if any reporters ever cover them, you have to ask them the
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.920]   exact, precise question, or they will say no.
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.680]   You have to say, are you coming out with this version of this product that looks like this
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.520]   can be very detailed and only then.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.520]   Exactly, because they're denial.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.520]   That's not Microsoft.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.680]   It's like all the presidents, man.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.280]   Mary Jo believes, and I think this is true, that the Daily is right, there will be an
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:56.920]   Office 15 for the iPad, very similar to the one for Windows on ARM, Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.560]   OneNote, they will be Metro, which will be very interesting.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.080]   In fact, remember Apple has to still approve this.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.680]   I think Apple would be, it's an Apple's interest to get Office on that.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.680]   Microsoft failed Apple.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680]   Apple was Microsoft.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.960]   In fact, I think Apple's probably going, hey, this is pretty cool.
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.440]   We've got Avid, we've got Photoshop, we've got Office.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.400]   This iPad, this little toy, this little content consumption device is turning out to be a
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.040]   pretty good computer.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.960]   It's still a content consumption device.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:26.640]   Go ahead, Dan.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.200]   I mean, that's the excitement that I'm kind of getting to.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.400]   If you think three, five, ten years ago, you had to have a device that was so expensive
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:42.240]   and so convoluted that it excluded most creative people from that marketplace.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:49.120]   Now on a 500 or in two, three years, a $300 device, you can put these incredibly powerful
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.840]   tools into everyone's hands.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.040]   That's exciting.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.400]   Post PC means more people can do computing.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.720]   It's exciting and scary.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.320]   It's like, you know, the way that people have been locked out of doing computing.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.320]   Yeah, I'm not so strong.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.480]   Well, I do, John.
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.640]   I don't think all creative people have been locked out of computing, but middle-class people
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.920]   and lower-income people, I mean, we can't simply talk to the people who can afford to
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.360]   buy into this.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.960]   And there are a lot of people, particularly if you think about Africa, if you think about
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.160]   India, the developing markets, there's a ton of creative people who've never seen these
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.160]   devices.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.800]   Now, we have revolutions being held on SMS.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.640]   These devices are not just about the North American market.
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:39.120]   It's about the world and it's about putting powerful devices into the hands of creative
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.120]   and smart people.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.760]   We need some music behind you.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.560]   I was going to say that was so inspiring, I wouldn't buy it.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560]   Where's the flag?
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560]   The flag's up.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:53.000]   No, but I go a step further, Dan, is the touch interface also makes it more accessible.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.960]   If you can solve the issues of how do we wrap complexity enough so that we can make it
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.480]   touchable, but you watch a kid use an iPad.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480]   It's so intuitive.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.840]   They're immediately doing stuff with the iPad very comfortably, very easily.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.840]   So I agree with you.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.360]   I think that touch is also very, not just price, but also the interface is very important.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.280]   More accessible, but less powerful for power users, right?
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.720]   Don't forget it is less powerful for power users and they're not going to get away from
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:26.240]   the tools they have now, even though they're more complicated and more sophisticated, but
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.400]   it is more accessible to a lot more people.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.720]   There's a lot of value in that.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.600]   And remember that, as Jobs said, not everybody needs a truck.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.840]   So actually, this is a big question for professionals.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.580]   We know our editors, people next door doing audio and video editing, people doing high
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.120]   end music production.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.960]   They're all using Macs and they're all asking the question, "Is Apple going to continue
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:56.560]   to make tower computers, Mac pros with expandability features that we need for high end work?"
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.440]   Because it's very clear that Apple sees the real power of this platform, the iOS.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.800]   I worked with my producer when I was on the first week of the campaign through New Hampshire
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.800]   and Iowa.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:09.800]   I mean, he makes movies.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.400]   We were thrown together and didn't know each other.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.720]   He makes movies and he said his entire industry is moving over to the PC, which just blew
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.720]   my mind.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.360]   And for that exact reason, there are concerns that Apple is with Final Cut X or Final Cut
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.920]   X that he just said, "No, we're moving to PC.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   It's so weird."
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:27.920]   It's weird.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.920]   Did you guys see that?
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.560]   There's a Google lighting video?
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.560]   You probably covered this.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.160]   Yeah, horrible Google lighting video.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.880]   Microsoft attacking them.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.080]   So this is Microsoft saying that the Google cloud, the Google cloud, that Google Docs are
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.160]   never going to go anywhere.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:46.680]   And they did it somehow by parodying a show that was taken off the air 23 years ago.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.680]   Moonlighting.
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.680]   Moonlighting.
[01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:49.680]   But they do Google lighting.
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.680]   You kind of a bad old reference.
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.680]   Have you seen the video?
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.680]   Yeah, it's a new demo.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   It's a horrible video.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.680]   I'll show a little bit of that.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   But let's finish the conversation before we completely shift.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.920]   Well, how is it relevant?
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.440]   I do want to remind people that Jason tends to sound like Max Kellerman when he gets worked
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.440]   up.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.160]   I just want to point that out.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.160]   Who's Max Kellerman?
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:08.160]   Thank you.
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.160]   But he gets excited.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160]   He gets us to...
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160]   The sports reporter.
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160]   Oh, right.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160]   He's exactly like Max Kellerman.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.160]   It's relevant because you were talking about Office coming on to the iPad.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.160]   And all the things that Microsoft is doing.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:24.960]   And Microsoft in this video is attacking Google for doing a lot of the stuff that Microsoft
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.040]   does, which is relieving releasing.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040]   Here's the video.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.040]   There it is.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.040]   But...
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:33.040]   ♪ This top of his skin ♪
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.160]   He's got a Google tie on, see a little white suit.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   Behind a plan.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.480]   Microsoft makes these videos.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.480]   They're just bizarre.
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.480]   Yep.
[01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.480]   I wonder what they paid.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.680]   Oh, I'm sure they spent a lot of money.
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.800]   I'm not sure who the audience is for this.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.800]   First of all, moonlighting.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.800]   Mostly for...
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.000]   Yeah, the moonlighting reference is pretty tired.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   That's...
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   It's this guy trying to talk.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   That's supposed to be Bruce Willis with hair.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.440]   And this is supposed to be Sibyl Shepherd, apparently.
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.440]   Yep.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.440]   He's trying to talk to people after.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440]   And they're terrible actors.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.440]   He's using Google Docs.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   He's probably in house.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.440]   I'm guessing.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.440]   I think it's for sales.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.800]   Yeah, sales guys love this stuff.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.280]   And I'd like you to implement this.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.120]   And it shows the age of the sales guy making this.
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.120]   The best part, totally.
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.280]   The best part is a little later on.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280]   60.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280]   When...
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.880]   So you're going to change yourself where...
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.080]   So he's trying to sell her Google Docs, right?
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.680]   And she's skeptical.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.680]   She's saying, "What?
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.880]   Why would I use an open system like that?"
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.440]   And he's like, "Oh, don't worry."
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.720]   And he's seen the future.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.840]   He says, "Who knows what the future is for Google Apps?"
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.640]   And then some guy on a conveyor film with a fog machine, because I don't think his legs
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   were moving.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   I...
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.280]   Dude, two times after Google in 1987.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.760]   I like the sweater over his shoulders.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.600]   I like his tie.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600]   This is just...
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   I don't care.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.600]   This is historically bad.
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.600]   I mean, this is...
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600]   It is.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.600]   I can't...
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.720]   If you hear what she's saying, she's trying to give the Microsoft argument back.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.160]   Doesn't it make Microsoft just look like the stupidest down market company?
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.400]   If it was really funny, it wouldn't.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.400]   It would work.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.400]   But it's not.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400]   It takes one to know.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:14.320]   It takes their summarize.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.440]   Microsoft looks at Google, right?
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.640]   And that's why Microsoft thinks Google is its biggest competitor, and why they sort
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.800]   of totally took their eye off Apple, right?
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.160]   Is because they look at...
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.880]   Microsoft looks at Google and they see all the stuff Google's doing, and they're like,
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.240]   they're doing all the same stuff that we used to do, and they're doing it better than we
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.160]   did, and they're going to burn us.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.200]   Meanwhile, what they should have been looking at was Apple sort of undercutting the whole,
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.760]   you know, just eating the whole bottom out of the PC market with the iPad, and that's
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.160]   what's really hurt them.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.120]   You know, John, I don't think this is for the sales team, because at the end of it,
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:52.360]   you get a link to why microsoftproductivity.com, and a terrible site, which I don't know
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   what the hell font that is.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.360]   No, it could be that.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.200]   It's for somebody other than us.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.200]   Yeah, it's made to validate business, guys.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.200]   This is a crazy logo.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   Yes.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200]   Why Microsoft?
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   I know.
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.200]   It looks like somebody made this up.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:04.200]   I know.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.800]   You know, the people they were in that commercial app...
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.640]   Not even curd right.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   It's not.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   The curding is more...
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   The heavy and the age do not curd out.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.480]   But there have been a lot of funny videos this week.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.960]   There's a company worth billions and billions of dollars, and they can't curd a logo.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.960]   Give me a break.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.880]   That commercial is aimed at 50-year-old IT managers who are right now looking at signing
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:28.560]   big contracts and getting off of office and signing over to apps.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.960]   And believe me, every single one I talk to right now is looking at it.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.960]   Wow.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:33.960]   I mean, at least considering it.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:39.080]   I mean, every single one, because it would save them, you know, they would spend a tenth
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:43.720]   of the amount on Google apps that they spend, you know, for their Microsoft license licensing
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.280]   on office.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.680]   And that's the only thing Google markets it on really is price.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   That's their main job.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.680]   I'm...
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.680]   Sorry to interrupt, man.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.480]   I am so cool with that exact person watching this and buying into this.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:04.520]   And the more they spend money on these crap products and buy into it, the faster they
[01:21:04.520 --> 01:21:07.080]   go out of business and the better for me and everyone else.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:12.760]   I mean, please continue to make and watch these videos.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.080]   We enjoy them.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.000]   You are suffering from wishful thinking.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.360]   We enjoy them.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.400]   So can I just get back briefly to Mobile World Congress?
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.400]   No.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.400]   No.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.400]   Yes.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   Two, one.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.400]   Okay.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.400]   Please.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.400]   What's so bad?
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.400]   Just beg you.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.400]   I just beg you.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.400]   I'm going.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   I'm not going.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.400]   Will there be any big phone announcements?
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   Anybody?
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   There's the HTC One.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   We're getting ready for that.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   That was significant.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400]   Sorry.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.400]   Go ahead, Lee.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:41.400]   So HTC One is a 4.3 inch screen.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.400]   It's the S X and the V.
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.560]   Are you still using that big clunker?
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560]   I love it.
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.160]   I'm sorry, 4.7 inch screen.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:53.360]   So this is HTC's response to the Galaxy Note, which is a 5, 3 inch screen.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:55.480]   Is that their Windows Mango phone?
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.480]   No, no.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.480]   No, no.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.480]   This is Android.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.360]   Wait, you threw me on that.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.360]   I'm looking.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.360]   No, no, I'd say I'm not going to make it.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.360]   It's Android.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   But this is Ice Cream Sandwich.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   It's 4.0.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:10.120]   Is this the Ice Cream or Jello or what is the next one?
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.120]   Ice Cream Sandwich.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:12.520]   Jelly Bean is the next one.
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:16.680]   This is 4.0, but since on top of it, which is the first time we've seen anybody skin
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.680]   4.0, skin.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.240]   It's LTE for AT&T.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240]   It's LTE.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.400]   Ice Cream has been left out too long.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.160]   I think this is attractive because of the screen size, which is a little smaller than the
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.800]   Galaxy Note, but it's bigger than anything else on the market.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.680]   The other interesting thing is that they partnered with Dropbox, so all of these phones
[01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:36.360]   are going to come with 25 gigs of-- you get 25 gigs.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:42.960]   That explains why box.net/com announced three days ago that if you have an Android phone
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.000]   and you sign up for her, you'll get 50 gigs free, it sounded like there was something
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.400]   coming, so that's what it was.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:52.720]   They're trying to get people to sign up before Dropbox made this deal.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.880]   Now Eileen and host are all about Android, so she should really be in our--
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:56.880]   She's the Android.
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.240]   Why don't you send her?
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.960]   She loves going to Spain.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   I know.
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.840]   You and she were caught eating churros in Madrid, I believe.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   Churros, indeed.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.440]   He said there were no churros in Madrid, but you were too wrong.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   But there were.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.440]   They were churros in Madrid.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.640]   And they had this weird chocolate that's like chocolaturros.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.640]   It's like mud.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.640]   Mm.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640]   Yeah, the chocolate.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.840]   What else, Eileen, are we expecting--
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.840]   Jason has this something you wanted to--
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:25.400]   I can say, there is one reason why this HTC phone is significant, and it really is
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:31.200]   an answer as much to their HTC Titan 2, which they announced it, which is their big thing
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.200]   announced at CES.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.040]   And that's a Windows phone, of course.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.360]   It's a Windows phone, right?
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:40.740]   So at CES, their big announcement was a Windows phone, and there were a lot of questions,
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:43.880]   is HTC sort of backing off of Android, right?
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:48.360]   Because they have gotten crushed by Apple in the courts, and they don't have the deep
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.360]   pockets of Samsung.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.480]   And by Samsung in the marketplace.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:52.480]   And by Samsung.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.480]   That's right.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.280]   They crushed by Apple, and that sort of made them kind of reticent, and they've gotten
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.320]   crushed by Motorola at the end of last year.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:02.520]   They got crushed by Motorola and Samsung in the market.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.840]   And they looked like a company that was backing away, maybe from Android, because Microsoft
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:13.000]   was giving them apparently some better patent protection with Windows mobile or Windows
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.040]   phone than they were getting from Google with Android, right?
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:21.120]   So now, this is looking like, OK, they're sort of back in the game.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:27.760]   They Google by Motorola in a sense, and them having access to more patent protection is
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.920]   sort of letting HTC step forward.
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:34.960]   And really, because this looks like the kind of phones we're used to seeing from HTC,
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   right?
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.640]   They're sort of, they had been one of the boldest innovators.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.800]   And the leading device maker.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.800]   That's right.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.120]   I love my note, but this makes me want it.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.280]   First of all, it's quad core Tegra 3.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.480]   It is 1280 by 720 on a 4/7 screen, which is, I think for most people, that's a bigger
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.360]   screen than they're used to, but not too big for them.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.840]   It's just a half inch smaller than the Galaxy Note.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:57.840]   This is a spectacular.
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.840]   It's really thin.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.320]   It's also important to note that there's not a removable battery from what I understand.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.360]   So all these phone manufacturers are going towards that.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.440]   I like the removable battery in my Galaxy Note.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.880]   I have five batteries now.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.080]   And I keep them all charged.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:13.080]   Wow.
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.040]   Because every hour on the hour, I put the new battery in.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040]   It's like privacy.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040]   It is.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.640]   You know, the Titan 2, you know, the big Windows mobile phone.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   I think it had a 16 megapixel camera in it, you know, which is insane for a phone.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.080]   This one does only have an 8.
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:30.320]   So they haven't put it, but it has the 4.7 inch screen like the Titan 2.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.880]   So but they haven't put everything in that they do with the Titan 2.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.400]   But obviously this is a pretty sweet device.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.560]   It's a very desirable phone.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.960]   Yeah, it's too bad it's AT&T.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.120]   They're getting all the good phones now.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.120]   I don't understand.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120]   They are.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120]   It's true.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120]   It's true.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.120]   It's a T-Mobile.
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   It's T-Mobile.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.840]   There's a T-Mobile one as well, but that's not the very nice X.
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.840]   That's the X.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.840]   That's the X.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.840]   Alas.
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.840]   What do you mean phones do people need?
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:55.040]   Well, they only need one, but they need the right one.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040]   And this is the problem.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.840]   I feel bad for consumers who every three months there's a phone.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.680]   This new one is like, I want that one.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.480]   Look at the size of this thing you're carrying.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.480]   I love it though.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.480]   Don't you love this?
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.480]   No.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480]   Yeah, the note.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.200]   This is and see I put it in a nice leather case.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.360]   So it looks like I'm a professional.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.360]   Let's see.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.360]   Let me unlock it for you so you can.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.000]   Yeah, unlock your phone.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.640]   I have to unlock it because otherwise John will try to crack it and he'll do it 10 times
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.640]   and then it will erase everything.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   I'm going to try to see.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.000]   I just minute over and see here John.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   Oh, John, he always sees.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   So last time I gave you the same phone, you put two things on my to-do list.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.800]   I'm all of a sudden I'm calling the mayor.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.360]   I don't know why.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:36.160]   T-Mobile wants the FCC to block Verizon's spectrum deals with the cable industry.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.200]   T-Mobile wouldn't even exist right now actually if the FCC allowed that merger.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.560]   And Eileen mentioned Dropbox.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.040]   Windows 8 is building in.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.040]   Sky drive.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.040]   Sky drive.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.040]   Sky drive.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   25 gigs.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.040]   25 gigs.
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.680]   Yeah, I've got the.
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.680]   Windows on arm.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.680]   Do we have anything to say about that?
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.680]   We'll see it on Wednesday.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.120]   The consumer preview.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:00.960]   Microsoft clearly trying to get into this tablet race too little too late or do they
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.800]   have a is Windows 8 compelling?
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.960]   No chance.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:04.960]   No chance from Devorect.
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.600]   Dan, what do you think?
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:10.000]   Yeah, I want to be more excited than I am.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.720]   Jason Heiner, you think maybe Windows 8 on arm?
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:19.640]   I know a lot of business people that are waiting to make their tablet their final strategy
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.880]   you know tablet strategy until they see what Microsoft comes up with.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.320]   So I don't I'm not sure if they will get it right, right?
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.200]   History says they they've not done a lot of smart things lately.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.600]   But I do know that the opportunities there if they do get it right there are a lot of
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:39.520]   people especially businesses that are waiting to see what they do before they sort of go
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.440]   haul hog on iPad.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.560]   If they don't get it right though, then they're toast.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:45.560]   Is it Jason?
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.520]   Do you mean buyers like big corporate buyers?
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520]   Sorry.
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:54.160]   Yeah, I mean buyers in the in the corporate market.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.160]   IT IT.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.520]   And of course I imagine there's some thinking that we should also wait and see what the
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.160]   iPad three holds.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.960]   Yes or no?
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.680]   Yeah, I mean I I had lunch with somebody from Intel who said you know we're not that scared.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.880]   The tablets going to take over the PC.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880]   I mean you're not.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.400]   That's why they're desperately trying to create a strategy to get Intel chips into mobile devices.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.760]   We're not worried but just in case.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:23.320]   Oh yeah, they've gone crazy just in case.
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.640]   They're always paranoid in Silicon Valley anyway.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.120]   But look at look at the numbers this year 2011 was the first year that mobile devices
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.200]   outsold PC's right.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.200]   Right.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:37.600]   This is going to accelerate in dollar absolutely we're the post PC era.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.600]   Yeah, right.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.200]   Well no because they're cheaper than PC's.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.800]   So our phones you say phones have taken over the world.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:44.800]   Well they have.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.960]   You know I'm counting that.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.400]   I'm saying when you guys don't stop using a desktop computer then you can listen.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.400]   Well that's it.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.200]   I mean I because people still want their big screen and you'd be surprised how many people
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.760]   come here with iPads now and and keyboards.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.920]   I think it's nutty.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.000]   But here's here's I think the iPad keyboard thing is lame.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000]   What's that?
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.880]   You're gonna take the device right?
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.880]   You're gonna set it down wireless USB or whatever the seat and you're gonna connect to your
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:08.880]   big screen.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.880]   That's right.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.880]   You're gonna connect to the big screen you're gonna connect to a laptop.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.800]   I mean I just want to come out.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:19.040]   Canonical thinks that you saw that they've released Ubuntu for Android and the whole idea
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:24.800]   is that you put Ubuntu on your Android phone and then connect it to a big screen TV and
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.880]   suddenly a big screen monitor and suddenly you've got a phone that is a computer and
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:34.280]   a phone Ubuntu dot com slash devices slash Android if you want to see it.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.160]   I don't know if this is just kind of nutty but they do make a good point which is that
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.160]   you now have in your pocket with a dual or even quad core phone a whole lot of power
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.120]   that could really be a desktop computer.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.000]   So maybe John I am carrying the desktop computer minus keyboard and and screen and I just have
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.560]   to add the talk a big game.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:55.240]   Why this is what the Intel look like here you got back to you got like a hundred thousand
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.680]   dollars with the computing equipment.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.600]   That's because I'm an old fart and I haven't yet figured out.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:03.720]   You're just the standard how to do do all this with an iPad.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.240]   It's going to be the computer the masses though is you're going to take your phone or your
[01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:10.240]   tablet and when you need to sit down and do work you're going to set it down and you're
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:15.040]   going to sit just the way we do it at desktop right now and you know work with your software
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.560]   all your accounts all your information is right there.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.600]   One more one more and we're going to take a break.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:26.280]   This is for mobile world commerce the galaxy beam it is a galaxy phone with a Pico projector
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.480]   in it never bring that power point projector with you anymore and a big screen either
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.120]   just projected on the wall.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.560]   And it must have like what 40 lumens three.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:41.320]   I don't know if we're going to say it I mean you're talking about 25 petabytes of storage
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320]   for your data.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.720]   I'm interested in the sky drive stuff.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:48.880]   Twenty five petabytes no gigabytes no they're not giving you twenty five petabytes.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.600]   I like that that'd be cool.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.320]   You just load it up with everything.
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.320]   Five petabytes.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:58.520]   Sky drive stores 10 petabytes of user data.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:30:59.520]   Hot mail.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.720]   Well that's my total but that's not you personally.
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.840]   Yeah that's for your that's a lot.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.920]   No no it's not for your account.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.600]   A venture overall over the lifetime of your account.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:09.600]   No way.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   Petabytes for money.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.400]   Do you know how much a petabyte is?
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.400]   Well yeah.
[01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.760]   Okay it's a lot I have no idea.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.040]   It's a thousand terabytes.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.320]   A thousand terabytes would be a petabyte.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.040]   That's why I said storage is cheap.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.880]   It's cheap to my I don't know where you got that figure.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.320]   It came from a live side dot net which is a great website about Microsoft.
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.760]   Vista sucked Windows 7 is actually really good.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.320]   We'll have to see it.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.600]   I'll tell you if somebody gives me 10 petabytes I'll take it.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.000]   Well you could actually use it.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.760]   I might be able to use it.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.840]   Let's talk a little bit about Audible.com.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.600]   We are blessed.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:47.320]   We are blessed with a great panel today including the fabulous Dan Patterson.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.680]   Dan where can we follow your new shows your podcast network all of that.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.160]   What's the website?
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.440]   Well there will be more information at co-point.com.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.440]   It's brand new.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.440]   So you have it?
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:02.800]   Yeah well I mean it's about six months old but I mean I'm sure you can hear in this room
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.960]   we're still waiting for our acoustical phone to come in.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:11.160]   So we're not going to give you anything publicly until we zero in on the sound but co-point.com.
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.080]   C-O-P-O-I-N-T.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:16.120]   K-O it comes from the game of Go.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:21.600]   The oldest game in the world if you a co-fight is a balance back and forth.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.400]   Oh from the Japanese word for mouth.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.400]   Mouth.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   Or that yes.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:29.200]   No but that's why they use that in Go because it's a mouse.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.200]   Oh I didn't know that.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.200]   Interesting.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.280]   Go is one of the few games that a computer cannot play well.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:38.280]   It's a great chess drive from the game.
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:43.200]   Chess is all over you know computers beat us but Go is so difficult that a computer cannot
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.480]   be made to beat the best or even the somewhat good Go players.
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.760]   Co-point which is why we called the company.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:50.760]   I like it.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:51.760]   I like it.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.000]   So what do you have a date that you plan to have this happen?
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.400]   Yeah I think the first show we're going to do is e-commerce.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:03.880]   We're going after like very small small small slivers of audiences.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.880]   We don't want you know gawk or type numbers we want to own markets right.
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.000]   So the first is I mean much like you narrow casting is far more important.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.080]   I mean having people care about the content that humans make is more important than getting
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.080]   tons of clicks.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.320]   I got a term for that Dan and I got it from a New York Times article about artisanal foods
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.960]   like people making beef jerky in Brooklyn.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.520]   We are artisanal media.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:28.520]   We're handmade media.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:29.520]   Interesting.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.520]   So perfect.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.520]   Yes.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:32.520]   Good word for that.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.360]   We craft it for a specialty audience that is never hurting.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.360]   Never ends.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.360]   The bull crap.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.280]   Welcome to the artisanal media hour.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.120]   This show brought to you by audible.com audible.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.120]   We love audible.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:51.480]   I'm going on a plane flight as soon as this shows over to Seattle two hours.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:55.760]   I can't wait because I will have two hours of the class.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:56.760]   It's a Game of Thrones.
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:57.760]   No the second one.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760]   The class of Kings.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:04.680]   I'm trying to finish it before HBO puts out the second series of the Game of Thrones mini
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.720]   series and I just it's so great.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.720]   You put the headphones on you lean back and you enter a new world and that's why audiobooks
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:14.240]   I think are the future in some ways of reading.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:17.880]   In fact when a new book comes out I look on audible.com first because that's where I want
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.000]   to that's what I want to listen to it if I can.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   It's really the best service.

[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:52.800]   You see they just released Stephen King's The Stand 47 hours and 56 minutes.
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.800]   What are you saying that?
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.400]   Oh it's such a great book too.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:56.400]   I downloaded it.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.200]   Who is the poor guy who had to read that?
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.000]   Want to hear Grover Gardener?
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000]   Poor Grover.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   Here we go.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000]   Let's play a little bit.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]   Go set on number 93 just north of Arnett.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000]   Oh this guy's in Great Street.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.600]   The stand for Street Berg about 110 miles from Houston.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.200]   What they have I just listened to 1122.6.3.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.400]   What do you get paid by the hour?
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.800]   Actually I know exactly how much you would.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.800]   What is it?
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.800]   Because they asked me if I wanted to do James D. Watson's book and I just don't have time.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.800]   Five grand.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   Five grand for a book?
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.800]   What about this book?
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.800]   Oh that book.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:29.520]   Well five grand for an eight or nine hour book I think.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.000]   So this would be 20 grand.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000]   20 grand.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.480]   You're going to read it anyway.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:40.800]   These guys are for the most part Broadway actors who have a couple extra hours a day to
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.880]   go in and read that they have the studios there in Newark and they just go and they
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:44.880]   read.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.280]   They're not going to do the comments their income but they are performers and it's wonderful.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.280]   Listen to Craig Watson, 1122.63.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.280]   He does such a great job of all the accents.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:54.280]   He's got the main accent.
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:55.280]   That's just great.
[01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:56.280]   Anyway.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.080]   So here's the deal.
[01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.080]   Here's a tough challenge.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:02.600]   You got two credits to figure out how you're going to use those two credits.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.760]   Go to audible.com.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:07.280]   I can tell you there's just stuff in every category.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.520]   Bestsellers nonfiction history.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.520]   What happened here?
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.520]   Where'd it go?
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.520]   Where'd it go?
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.520]   Jobs book is here.
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.520]   What was there?
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.520]   I wasn't even going to mention it.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:17.520]   I was.
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.520]   There's a baritone day.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.520]   How to be black.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.520]   He reads it.
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:21.520]   Which is awesome.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.520]   I've got an audible recommendation.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.520]   Yes, please.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.960]   You know, they have more than just books there, right?
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:33.600]   They have this great series called the Modern Scholar, which is professors basically just
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.000]   doing their books.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.760]   You know, so I've got this one here.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:39.560]   I know it's probably it's hard to see there.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.480]   Anyway, it's called Stranger Than Fiction, the Art of Literary Journalism by Professor
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.840]   William McKean from the University of Florida.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:49.080]   It sounds a little more highfalutin than what it is.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:58.040]   It's basically a history of modern journalism from about early 1800s forward.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.360]   But he tells it in such a great way.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:01.120]   I mean, the guy's a great storyteller.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.480]   He talks about Mark Twain.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:09.160]   He talks about the idea of sort of the Wall Street Journal versus sort of the rumor mags,
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:15.800]   which is what essentially the early newspapers of the early 20th century were.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.640]   And it's so parallel to what's happening today, right?
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:22.800]   You see the story of what's happening today and the way we're doing journalism and then
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:27.120]   the way there's sort of rumor sites, right, versus more traditional media sites.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.200]   And it really is a similar story being told over and over again.
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.680]   But there's a lot on modern scholar.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.600]   If you just look up there, there's awesome stuff.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:34.600]   No kidding.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:35.600]   What is it called?
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:42.640]   Jason, thank you so much because there are literally hundreds of these, 131 modern scholars.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.320]   And these are just lectures.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:49.080]   Here's grammar and rhetoric, Anglo-Saxon world, six months to change the world of Paris,
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:55.680]   peace coverage of 1919, history of ancient Rome, astronomy, philosophy, the history of
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.680]   Venice.
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.760]   That's really, so these are college lectures, basically.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:04.400]   Essentially, but they really, at least the ones I've gotten, they picked the really good
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.400]   professors.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:10.600]   They picked the guys you would want to and ladies that you'd want to listen to and all
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:12.240]   the ones that I've had.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.240]   It's the professors themselves giving the lectures and they do a great job.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.040]   And in this case, there's an accompanying reference guide.
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.960]   So you've got some, this is.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.960]   That's a great recommendation.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.960]   Thank you.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:23.960]   I didn't even know about it.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:24.960]   Yeah, sure.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.840]   So I want you to go and see, there's the PDF of this thing.
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:27.840]   That's cool.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.840]   So you get additional materials.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:29.840]   Sorry, I'm on there, Leo.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.000]   This is from Rutgers.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000]   Your book is on there.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000]   I was.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   The book you got on there.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.920]   Well, nobody ever would read that book.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:36.920]   That's a silly book.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:37.920]   The silly book.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:38.920]   What was the name of it?
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.920]   101 computer answers, right?
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.920]   Or questions.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.920]   What was the name of our book?
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.400]   What computer answers do you need to know?
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.400]   Well, you know why?
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.200]   101 computer answers you need to know.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.120]   You need to know, right?
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:50.560]   We wanted to call it, how do I get the dog hair out of the disc drive?
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.320]   But the publisher didn't like that.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.320]   That's right.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.320]   The publisher is totally against those.
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:58.600]   So immediately, like literally a week after our book comes out, 101 computer answers you
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.600]   need to know.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.360]   Kim Commando comes out with a book, a thousand and one computer answers you need to know.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360]   She did.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:06.360]   So what are you going to buy?
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.360]   A hundred or a thousand?
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360]   A thousand.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360]   A hundred quality.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]   That's right.
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.720]   And it had a cute picture of Gina.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.400]   A cute picture of you.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.400]   A little cartoon.
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:16.800]   We were driving a little car.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.760]   Anyway, that's not an Audible brother.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:23.640]   But lots of good stuff is go to audible.com/twit2 and sign up today.

[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:29.480]   Audible.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.480]   We love them.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.960]   What were we?
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.120]   I had some other things I wanted to talk about.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.880]   Google to oust Motorola mobility chief.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:39.440]   Now that they're taking over Motorola, they're firing the CEO.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.880]   They've got one of their own in there.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.400]   They got to do that.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.400]   Microsoft.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.400]   They're firing.
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.560]   Where's he leaving?
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.040]   It says this story from Wired says Google to oust.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:52.200]   Yeah, that's that sounds like.
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:54.920]   I've been trying to figure this out.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920]   I know.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:40:00.440]   It's a little unclear whether, you know, Sanjay got, Sanjay Jia got pushed out.
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:02.760]   Or if he decided to leave.
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:07.240]   Yeah, I mean, you can make an argument that he did some good things, right?
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.520]   To get Motorola turned around and really focused.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.360]   I mean, he was the one who decided, look, we're only going to do Android.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.320]   We're not going to try to, you know, go in a hundred different directions.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.760]   And that was a pretty smart move for them.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:19.760]   It was a winning move.
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.800]   And obviously, it's what got them bought by Google.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:29.600]   So my sense is, I just haven't gotten any good sources on it yet, is that he was just
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.400]   ready to, you know, move on.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.240]   And that part of his deal wasn't that he had to stick around for two years, right?
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.760]   Like there are in a lot of these things.
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:40.440]   What is germane, though, is that somebody from inside Google, Dennis Woodside, will be running
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.440]   Motorola mobility.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]   And it does.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:45.960]   What people are looking very carefully, HTC and others are looking very careful to see
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.200]   is, is Google going to give Motorola a real advantage in the Android marketplace?
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.880]   Or do we still have a chance to make Android phones that can compete?
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.560]   When the purchase, Larry Dicknet is eating net.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.560]   Look, Larry's great.
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.880]   Larry Dicknet is eating net, has a good piece on this.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.800]   And, you know, he really thinks that they're going to be out of the device business, you
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:07.920]   know, pretty much pretty quickly.
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.800]   You know, the guy, he talks about the fact that the guy that they're putting in charge
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.920]   is really an advertising guy, right?
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:14.920]   That says a lot.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.080]   It's not a device guy.
[01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:21.240]   Sanjay Levy, obviously, says a little bit of that as well.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:22.320]   I think that'd be sad.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:26.360]   I think that, I think, you know, Motorola becomes the Nexus.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:27.920]   It becomes a boutique brand.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.600]   Motorola becomes the Nexus maker.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.960]   And I think that's more likely, but probably they're going to cut pretty deep.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:39.360]   Well, and I think you'd have a lot of regulatory issues if you suddenly started competing against
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.360]   the other.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   And it's not in their interest, competing against the other Android manufacturers.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:47.840]   It's cool that's going to be announced in Barcelona this week.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:51.760]   There's a company called Vallea, V-A-L-E-O.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.680]   It's actually a giant component maker for cars.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.840]   You guys know all about cars.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.720]   And they're showing a self-parking app.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:03.960]   You know, why would you want an app that parallel parks your car?
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.920]   You get out of your car and they're working with all these cars.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.520]   You get out of your car and then you run.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.080]   I've got a video of it.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.080]   You can look at it.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.080]   It's the scariest thing.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:15.360]   You see this woman get out of her car and the car parks.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.360]   Park for you.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.360]   It's called Park for you.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:18.360]   Remote.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.280]   Because I could not remember the name.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.640]   Now remember, Ford has this.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:24.440]   A lot of cars have this auto park facility.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:27.480]   But this is parallel parking.
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.480]   It looks like.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.480]   Parallel parking.
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.080]   I mean, it looks like not.
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:32.080]   No, really.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.920]   Seriously, are you going to do this?
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.080]   Would anybody do this?
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.240]   Is this nuts?
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:38.240]   You only do this at the car.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:39.920]   Then you use the app?
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:40.920]   No.
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.080]   This has got to be built into the car obviously.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.240]   This is not just an app.
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:47.120]   Why would you get out of the car first of all?
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.600]   Don't you want to have a foot on the road?
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:52.280]   No, the reason they're showing it is because there's no room on either side to get out.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.280]   Oh, right.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.400]   She's using it like a remote control.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.520]   So it's not even doing it automatically.
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:00.040]   She's controlling the car via the app.
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:03.960]   If you get a lawsuit waiting to happen, there's a lot of losses waiting to happen with these
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:04.960]   things.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:05.960]   You've been able to explain how they do it.
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:06.960]   But you're right.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.240]   They use radar, ultrasonic, infrared, and vision sensor system.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.240]   So you're right.
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.240]   The car has to have the capabilities.
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:12.240]   The car has all the component.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.240]   They're a component maker.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.240]   This is never going to fly.
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:16.160]   They're probably going to work with Ford.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.160]   They're probably going to work with Ford.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.200]   She talked to your Ford guy and asked if they're working with the L.A.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.200]   Ford will do it.
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.200]   No, no, no.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.200]   In fact, I was in a flex.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.200]   I didn't have to place.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:25.800]   Well, I did because then that's why I wouldn't get out of the car.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:30.160]   It turns out after you park, you're supposed to set the break.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.160]   And I didn't.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.160]   And it was of course still idling.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:33.160]   So it just kept going.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:35.160]   And that's how you crash the car in Vegas.
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.080]   It's kind of stupid.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:38.080]   I didn't do it.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.080]   I'm kidding.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.080]   I'm kidding.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.080]   Apple buyers buys chomp.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.080]   Really?
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.080]   Who cares?
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.080]   I don't know.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.920]   I think it's actually kind of a big story.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:51.160]   You remember back this summer when Siri was the big deal.
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.480]   We all talked about search and Apple is.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.560]   I mean, Siri is really the interface, but chomp, I think, is going to be the guts.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.160]   It's a recommendations engine.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:05.280]   It was a third party app that recommended apps, right?
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.920]   And Apple is a search engine.
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:11.280]   So what do you think they're going to do with this, Dan?
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:16.000]   Well, I think that this is-- I really think that Siri is the front end, but they need
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.080]   something that is smart just in the index, right?
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.080]   It's smart.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.080]   It's not going to organize things.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:28.320]   It will bring-- it will make the-- however we surface things, it will make it relevant
[01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.760]   in ways that aren't Googly.
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.760]   That's interesting.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.960]   It's like curating the app store.
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:33.960]   Yeah.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.840]   Well, there's how many-- there's half a million apps.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.640]   You need something, right?
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.640]   Yep.
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:39.640]   That's--
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.640]   You know--
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.640]   I'm definitely going to do search, right?
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.880]   I wrote an article in the fall.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.600]   Why Apple's about to build by or partner on a search engine.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.400]   I mean, Siri is definitely the beginning of something big for them.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:53.160]   But Siri is audible searched.
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:55.000]   He's the word audible in a funny way.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.880]   And then right after that is visual search.
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:02.440]   So there's so far 24 billion, 763 million, 229,800.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.400]   Oh, 24 billion, 763 million, 232 billion.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:08.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.400]   24 billion-- I can't keep up.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:10.400]   I'm like, here we go.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.400]   So this solves two problems for them, right?
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.680]   The app-- the app-- the app discovery problem.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.960]   And the search intelligence, they need some more search brains in their organization now,
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:21.960]   right?
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.680]   So I think it's a pretty good acquisition.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.760]   Do you think now Apple has this-- OK, so we're looking at this--
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:27.480]   I think it's a fake.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.280]   And first of all, yeah, right.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280]   It's not really counting.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.280]   But the second thing is, it says download the 25th billion app and you could win a $10,000
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.280]   gift card.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.560]   Do you think somebody's going to try to download the 25th billion app?
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560]   Like, oh, wait a minute.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.560]   Hold on.
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:42.560]   Hold on.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.560]   Wait.
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.560]   OK.
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:45.560]   Buy it.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.560]   Like, they do it using Vegas.
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.560]   Right.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:51.000]   That animation is going up at a certain rate, right?
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000]   Right.
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000]   And I mean, that's an animation.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:54.000]   OK, we all know.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.200]   But it's got to be going up at a rate that is close.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.200]   Yeah, it's reasonable.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:45:59.200]   Right, right, reasonable.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:01.000]   So some nerd out there is totally going to go.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000]   All right.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.240]   You think this is actually-- that this promotion sells apps?
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.320]   Like, people are buying more apps so they can be the 25th billionth?
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.320]   No, no, no, no.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.360]   It affirms that we have the biggest junk.
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.160]   We are bigger, stronger, and like all those Google guys, yeah.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.480]   You think they got a store?
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.480]   We got a store.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:23.320]   The real point of giving somebody $10,000 is so there'll be all those stories afterwards
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:26.080]   of the eight-year-old kid who bought a fish.
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:27.640]   Yeah, Eric will probably buy a fish.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.640]   It'll be your kid.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:30.640]   Exactly.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:31.640]   Some kid will do it.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.640]   Or somebody who's the guy that always buys a lot of tickets.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.640]   It's your kid's birthday today.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.040]   You should give him a call out.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.840]   No, it's his-- her husband's birthday.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:37.840]   Oh, it's Henry's birthday.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:38.840]   Oh, it's Henry's birthday.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:39.840]   You came up here on Henry's birthday.
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.840]   Aren't I rotten?
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:41.840]   Oh, my God.
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:42.840]   Did you get him a cake?
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.840]   Say Happy Birthday, Henry.
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:45.840]   Happy Birthday.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:48.760]   Flicker disables Pinterest pins on copyrighted images.
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.080]   That's an interesting-- I saw that.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:52.080]   Response to Pinterest.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.080]   Do you use Pinterest, John?
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:54.800]   You seem like a scrapbroker.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:55.800]   Yeah, don't I?
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:58.600]   I actually wrote a column last week.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.360]   You'll check it out, PCMag.com.
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:02.400]   I wrote about Pinterest and what I thought about it.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:03.400]   What do you think?
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.880]   I think it's really a serious winner.
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:06.880]   Really?
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.880]   And I'll tell you why.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:09.880]   Why?
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:10.880]   Because it's non-linear.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:17.520]   It really uses human recognition, pattern recognition to an extreme.
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.640]   It's not this blog style.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.640]   First in, last out, last in, first out.
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:23.440]   Oh, it's just like a thing.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:27.000]   And it reminds me of these-- there's a bunch of websites very similar to this that you've
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:31.800]   seen that always show the guy with the big nose and some compelling headline.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.840]   Man's giant nose explodes.
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:35.520]   And there's a whole bunch of these pictures.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:36.720]   You ever seen these websites?
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.840]   Anyway, as soon as I think somebody saw that website, you know, we can make a user
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.040]   generated content site better than that.
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:44.040]   It does.
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:45.040]   It is compelling.
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.040]   You do kind of want to just kind of scroll.
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.040]   People get addicted, dude.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:49.040]   I thought it was great.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.200]   I don't look at it much.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.760]   It's-- you know, every time I go there, I end up spending 20 minutes and I come away
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:59.520]   with two to three useful or interesting things.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.920]   I've gotten to the point where I stopped myself from going there sometimes because I
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:03.920]   always end up spending 20,000,000 minutes.
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.520]   Yeah, it's a time killer.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.920]   It's the most modern of time killers.
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:15.920]   What Twitter is to real time Pinterest is the Facebook equivalent.
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.760]   There isn't an edge-rank system, but Facebook really doesn't care about the real time they
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.920]   care about the quality and stream and surfacing what's relevant to you.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.800]   I think Pinterest is kind of the same thing.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:27.600]   Or are they using-- so this isn't chronological.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:32.440]   Are they using some sort of algorithm to promote-- so this is people I follow.
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:35.560]   Isn't this just chronological or is there some sort of algorithm involved?
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:36.560]   No, it's chronological.
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:37.560]   I think your feet.
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.560]   It is chronological.
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:39.760]   And if I go to popular, of course--
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:41.120]   Yeah, but it's not linear.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:42.120]   You don't have one.
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.120]   It is not linear.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.240]   It's not like G plus-- this is the G plus killer.
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:48.400]   They're already three adult Pinterest.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:50.200]   Yeah, I think this is the Google plus killer.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.560]   I think this is a Google plus killer.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:54.760]   That's my opinion, yes.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:56.360]   The real winner is Cintrest.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.120]   Yes, that's the sex one.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.640]   Cintrest, go to that.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:00.640]   That's the winner.
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:02.120]   Okay, don't show my screen.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:03.120]   Don't show-- I'm not sure.
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.560]   Show John's reaction to my screen.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.720]   I don't have an account, so I hope that's going to load.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:15.080]   It should be easy to stash great stuff with one hand.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:21.080]   Actually, you can show my screen because they don't actually get show.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.320]   I need a bit part.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.320]   I work for scale.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:25.320]   It was Lent.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:26.320]   I thought you were a French singer.
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.320]   I'm giving up Cintrest.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.320]   I'm giving up Cintrest.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.840]   All right, moving on.
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:32.840]   I think that's it.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.000]   Anything, any other big stories?
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.040]   Gina, you have a whole bunch of stuff on a new domain.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.520]   I don't know if we've hit everything.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.080]   We mentioned the Google Heads Up Display Glasses.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.480]   Nah.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:43.160]   The visual search.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:44.160]   Would you buy those?
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:45.160]   The glasses you wear?
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.160]   The glasses.
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.160]   It's glass.
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:48.160]   It's for cops.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:49.160]   It's for cops.
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.160]   When they pull you over.
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.160]   You think it's real?
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.160]   Oh, yeah, it's real.
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.160]   Oh, I think it's real.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.160]   I still think it's just ridiculous.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:55.160]   It's just stupid.
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.160]   It's real.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.160]   Who's going to-- yeah.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.400]   You know what it reminds me of?
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:04.400]   You remember Microsoft did the smart watches a couple years ago?
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:05.400]   Yes.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:07.240]   And the spot watch.
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.440]   The spot watch.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:11.080]   They just turned off the spot server on January 1st.
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:14.760]   Yeah, these heads up displays are going to be really vertically targeted.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.520]   OK, I'm just curious.
[01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:17.520]   Do you wear a watch?
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.720]   Do you wear a watch, Jason?
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.080]   No, not anymore.
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:21.080]   Do you wear a watch?
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.080]   Never.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.080]   Do you wear a watch?
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.080]   No, not today.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.080]   Do you wear a watch, Dan?
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.040]   Only when I'm back country like--
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:28.040]   Nobody wears watches, right?
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:29.040]   It's dead.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.040]   Like watches are dead.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:31.040]   Do you use your phone?
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:32.040]   Somebody's going like that.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.040]   I have a watch on.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:36.120]   It's because I'm a fashion forward, interesting kind of guy.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.120]   What does that watch say?
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:39.560]   Is it a watch that says something-- it's a--
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:40.560]   It's just a watch.
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.360]   It just-- it's not even digital.
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.360]   It doesn't have the date.
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.360]   Nothing.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.360]   It's just a watch.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:46.360]   It's a dog.
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:47.360]   It's not a dog.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:48.360]   It's a watch.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:49.840]   What's a wick-a-leak story?
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.640]   I wonder why nobody wears watches anymore.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.640]   Is it just--
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:53.640]   Because you get--
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:54.640]   Because you use their phone and you get really accurate times.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.440]   OK, what's about wick-a-leaks?
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.440]   Anything?
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:58.440]   Wick-a-leaks.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:50:59.440]   There's a big wick-a-leak story.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.440]   There's always a wick-a-leak story.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.440]   That's right.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.360]   There's a story every day, guys, from wick-a-leaks.
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.040]   What is the wick-a-leak story, chakra?
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:08.040]   Tell us, chakra.
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.600]   Is it more interesting?
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:12.640]   Wick-a-leaks to publish security think-tank emails.
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.480]   There it is.
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:17.440]   Rotors.com just published a story five minutes ago.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.440]   That's how fresh this is.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.920]   The anti-secret group, secrecy group, wick-a-leaks.
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:23.760]   Is that why we define wick-a-leaks now?
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.760]   The anti-secret-secret group.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.760]   The anti-secret-secret group.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.760]   I know that one.
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:27.760]   I know that one.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:31.400]   A.P. or Reuters said it would begin publishing more than five million emails.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:37.640]   Tomorrow, from a UA-based global security think-tank, apparently obtained by hackers.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:38.440]   Right on time for our new-
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:44.040]   Strategic Forecasting Incorporated, or Stratfor, oh, that is Stratfor is big, actually.
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:45.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:52.280]   Austin, Texas, they are a subscription-based provider of, quote, geopolitical analysis.
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:54.360]   So it's a private spy firm, basically.
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:55.360]   Wow.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.360]   That's what they do.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:57.960]   So news writers for a new domain get on that story.
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:58.960]   Right?
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:51:59.960]   That's interesting.
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:00.960]   I don't know what it means.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.960]   I don't know what it means.
