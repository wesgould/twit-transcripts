[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And what a great panel we've got today.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Ladies first, I'm going to introduce Lisa Bettany.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Lisa is at mostlyleesa.com.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   She's a blogger, a videographer, a podcaster, and a great photographer.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And I'm so glad to have you on the show.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Lisa, it's nice to have you in the studio too.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   >> It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   >> A little bigger.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Also here, ladies and gentlemen, I'm so sorry.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   >> Aww.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   >> Okay, that's it, we're done.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Okay, we're through.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   >> No more burgers.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   >> No more burgers.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   She had her very first in and out burger right before the show today.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   How was it?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   >> It was tasty.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   >> They don't have them, Canada?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   >> No, they don't.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   >> No, they don't.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   >> Is there a good reason for that, you think?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   >> It's a little bit culty for Canada.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   >> Oh, no, we're not having the impact.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   >> You have Tim Hortons, eh?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   >> We do have Tim Hortons.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   >> That's all you really need in life.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> It's all you really need.

[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You didn't go to Vegas, did you, John?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   >> God, no.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   >> That's his new stock answer.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   God, no.

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   >> Oh, I was there.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Although, I actually, I kind of wish I was able to say what John said.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   God, no, I wasn't there.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   >> You know, is it a question of seniority that, you know, if you're somebody as old as John,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   you don't have to go anymore?
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   >> I can't walk that far.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   >> Yeah, you know, I love the game.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I miss it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You know, I missed not being with my old crew at Engaget and trying to, you know, just cover every square inch
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   of the show, but it was still fun.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   >> They do.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   They really do.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   It is their show.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   They own that show.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   >> Well, I thank you for that.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   >> On their behalf, I suppose.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   >> No, but you started it.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I mean, you deserve a lot of credit for building it up to what it is.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Also here, I'm really pleased, a first-timer, a newbie, and we'll try to be gentle.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Mr. Lavar Burton, you probably know his name from, he's Jordy Leford from Star Trek.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You said 25 years of reading "Rainmower" LaVar?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> 25.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> Wow.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Wow.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   And I was thrilled to be at CES.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   >> You were, was this your first or had you been there before?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> I was there once many, many years ago, and it's obviously blown up a whole lot more since then.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It was overwhelming.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It was almost mind-numbing, but I had such a blast.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It was a really good time.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Well, so there's the panel.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We're going to have a lot of fun.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   We're going to talk about Macworld and CES.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   There are a few other stories too, but we might as well start with CES.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Lavar, do you have one thing that really knocked your socks off?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Or was it a lot of things?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Were you looking at TVs?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   What were you looking at?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   >> I was looking at TVs.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I was looking at software.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I was looking at, well, one of the things that really blew me away was the advances in broadcasting technology.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Delivering the signal.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   As a filmmaker, I'm really interested in the end user and how the vision is consumed by the audience.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Pioneer was really impressive.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   They're new plasma, Kuro.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Fantastic.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> They're beautiful.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   >> They're beautiful.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   As a man who's really, really concerned with picture composition, the ability for them to crush the blacks in that screen is just phenomenal.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   The blacks are pure, pure black.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   For obvious reasons, I'm a big fan of the color.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   >> Lavar, what TV do you use?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   >> I've got to.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I have to know what gadget everybody uses.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's kind of my shtick.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   >> You've got mostly Sony monitors in my house.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> Sony, really?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   >> Can I say that?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   >> Yeah, you can say that.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   >> No, of course.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And LCDs then, probably.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   >> Yes.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Not all.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   We haven't made the complete and full conversion yet.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It's an evolving process here at Casa Corazon.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   >> There's a couple of things here.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Robert Herren, who is a pretty good -- in fact, he looks at those pioneers.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   He's very concerned about the fact that Panasonic is going to now be the manufacturer of those things and he doubts or has doubts that they're going to maintain that quality.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And the other thing is it's kind of interesting.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   >> Actually, John, I'm an inner up to you already.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   That's not true.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   They're working with Sharp on the Sharp's doing the panels.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   >> Oh, no, it's you there.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   >> I know.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I thought with John because I thought that was a big announcement that they said, "Oh, no, we're going to let Panasonic make them."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So is that a change, right?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   >> You mean moving forward?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   >> It's possible I might have missed that.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   But, I mean, as of right now, when they make it, it's a plasma.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   >> Sharp makes the panels because pioneers, as far as I know, doesn't actually make panels anymore.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   But I'm talking about manufacturing the entire unit as an owner.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   >> So you're saying -- wait a minute.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   You're saying Pioneer is going to buy the plasmas from Sharp and have Panasonic make them and then slap their name on it?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> No, I think Panasonic will take care of all of it.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   When you go where you am, you just hand over the paperwork to these other guys and they just do it.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I'm sure Sharp makes a lot of panels.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I don't think that's what the issue is.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   There's just some question as to whether or not they can -- those pioneers you're talking about are unbelievable.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   >> Right.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   So is the issue the issue with quality control going forward?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> Well, I mean, I don't have any doubts about the Panasonic quality control, but there's always, you know, you tweak things, you change things.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   You take this circuit board out and put a cheaper one in.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Who knows? I mean, because you have to make money doing this.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But that was -- anyway, the point I was really going to move toward was the fact that in England, as of the next few weeks --
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and there's a story in the independent I just blogged, as a matter of fact -- it's possible that the Great Britain is going to actually ban the sale of plasma TVs throughout the country as part of their green initiative.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   >> They're that much more energy?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   >> Well, I looked at all the calculations that were on the web, and apparently they're not in terms of square -- the amount of energy it takes on per square inch basis.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But it just got into somebody's, you know, craw, and the next thing, you know, the crazy British who are going off the deep end on a lot of these things seem to be wanting to ban them.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   >> But, you know, John, we might actually have to deal with that in California.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   You and I both. And I guess Leo too.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And I -- well, LaVar, you're in what? LA?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   >> Yeah, I am.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   >> The only person who doesn't is the Canadian.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   >> We all might have to deal with this because that's also been proposed for California law as well within the next couple of years, is barring the sale of any HD TVs that don't meet extremely strict power requirements, which would be most panels.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   >> And is it your opinion that you -- that Plasmas couldn't do that?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   >> Well, Plasmas are on the way out. I mean, almost nobody's --
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   >> What?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   >> -- Plasmas at this point.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   >> What?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   >> We're not talking about flat screen TVs. We're talking about a space.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   >> And you're saying LCD is beating Plasma and Plasma is going to go away?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   >> I don't -- I don't know that anybody's making Plasmas anymore.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I mean, it's the best looking home theater TV is a Plasma.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   >> That's not really true anymore.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   >> I think LCD can be --
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   >> Panasonic's making Plasmas continually. And that Panasonic retalk -- or that Pioneer we're talking about is a Plasma.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   >> It's a gorgeous Plasma.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   >> Oh, but you might --
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   >> The blacks are better in Plasma. How can the LCDs compete?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   >> Pioneer quit the Plasma business last year. That was their huge announcement.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Is that gross?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   >> This Plasma we're talking about who makes that.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   >> It must -- I think you might be referring to an LCD.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   >> No, no. The Kuro is a Plasma.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   >> No, the Kuro is a Plasma.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   >> It's a Plasma. And it's new.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   >> I'm very confused.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   >> Yeah, well --
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   >> You're not alone, Leo, but it's all good.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   >> LeVar, do you --
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   >> Maybe it's --
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   >> -- maybe it's --
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   >> You have a lot of LCDs, but you saw that Kuro, doesn't it look -- the blacks are black or -- I think the --
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   the only disadvantage of Plasmas is they have glass screens, so they're glarey. You have to draw the curtains.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   >> Ideally, you need to create the right environment in which to view the product.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   A dark room, obviously, is going to eliminate the glare issue, the glare factor.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   But again, you know, earlier this year, I shot -- actually, in 2008, I shot a feature on -- with a 4K technology.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   >> You shot a digital 4K?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   >> Yes.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   >> Wow.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   >> Using the Dalsa origin. It was -- it's the first, and as it turns out, because that division of Dalsa was just scrapped,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   it will end up being the only feature shot entirely with the Dalsa platform.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And I got to tell you, the quality of the output mechanism really makes a difference in terms of the experience
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   for the audience member that the filmmakers intended.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   >> I love the plasma. I have to say, for the -- I think for the home theater experience, I just love a plasma.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Very sad if they're going to stop making it.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   >> No, no, but I'm looking at it in the web now. What it is is that pioneers are the one ending all plasma production.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   They're outsourcing at the Panasonic, which is what we said earlier, and they're going to continue making them.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And it looks like production is going to -- it's right here -- Panasonic to pump up plasma production.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   >> What about the ASENest? >> Yeah, what about the alternate technologies like SED or OLED?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Are they coming along at CES? Did you see any of those, Ryan? Were there any impressive SED or OLED screens?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   >> There have been a lot of alternate technologies over the last few years, and very few have actually been able to make it to market,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   namely because at this point, HGTV technologies become pretty entrenched.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And it's really difficult to build both scale and cost while also trying to be the market leader, which has become LCD.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   So SED is a great, great HGTV technology, but hasn't really made it for a while.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   >> It was encumbered. I mean, Canon couldn't make it because of the patents.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They said that they would start to show them at this CES. Were they showing some?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> I mean, they've been showing them for years, but it's not about them showing them. I mean, the technology is there.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   It just hasn't existed in scale. So, I have a feeling SED is not going to be a contender, at least not for a very long time.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   >> I don't think it's ever going to be a contender. It's going to be a contender. It falls right into the pattern with the FED,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   which is just a variation of, which was a dog. And I mean, it was cool looking when you can get them to work,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   but there were, you know, there was all kinds of issues with the -- because they were pumping so many electrons into the phosphors
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   that they couldn't hold up over time. And I just think it's the same thing.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   There's just people are looking desperately for some way, for some alternatives, so they don't have to deal with all these, you know,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   the intellectual property with all the LCDs, which is really where it's all eventually headed, especially with the LED black light.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   >> Plasma may still be around for a little while longer, but it's -- in terms of a cost and performance level,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   there's not enough there to make it compete with LCD. If you look at like the arc of LCD progress over the last five years,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   it's just been off the charts, whereas Plasma's had a little hard --
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   >> That may be true, but that Pioneer were talking about kills anything that if you compare it to an LCD or anything else.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   >> And you know, the other thing is a beautiful product. >> The other thing is price premium. But anyway --
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   >> Yeah, but when you get big, LCD has a big price premium. I mean, if you want to go 50 plus --
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   >> That's not over Plasma. >> It doesn't? Oh, I thought Plasma was a better deal at over 50 inches.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   >> I think it might depend on the TV and who's making it.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   >> I think it's really interesting to hear a filmmaker's point of view on this.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   >> No, actually, I want to ask a var real quick about something else related to 4K, but just briefly to answer about OLED.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   The 15-inch OLED by LG is now kind of the largest production OLED TV.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I have a feeling OLED in the next five to ten years going to kind of pick up where LCD will eventually leave off.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   So we'll see that kind of come to the fore. >> OLED, really, the color's gorgeous.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   But it's difficult to manufacture and build big panels, right?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   >> It is for the novelty factor, though. >> So again?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   >> The novelty factor is off the chart. Sony made a big splash at CES with their OLED technology.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   When you can deliver a screen that is as thin as less than a millimeter, it's pretty impressive.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   That means you can hang that sucker anywhere, and its footprint in your environment is very minimal.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   >> Right. >> Yeah, part of the advantage of OLED besides the amazing color reproduction and contrast and black levels is that the panels are kind of self-lit,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   so they don't require backlight, which means that they're brighter and thinner, and they also take less power.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   So I think we're all eventually probably going to wind up with OLED panels, if you look 10 or 15 years in the future.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But no, actually, so, Levar, I'm really curious to know what your feelings are on the red.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   >> I'm not sure if you've heard of it. >> I have heard of it, and have not personally used the red.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Have a lot of filmmaker friends who have. It's -- look.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   >> When you back up and tell them what that is, because you guys saw it, you're talking about drugs.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   >> Have you used the red, man? >> Well, Oakley, the guy who does the Oakley sunglasses, it turns out to be an optical wizard designed this amazing 4K.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   That's twice high-def camera, called the red, and now they've got two new cameras they've announced.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   >> I know -- I mean, Alex Lindsey's shot with it, and it's amazing.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   >> Yeah, they're wonderful and legitimate filmmaking tools.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Look, this is the Wild West out here in terms of content, and the creation of content, and anything that you can do in the service of telling your story that doesn't get in the way of your storytelling is a good thing.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   >> Right. Right.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   >> What about internet distribution? You talk about really making it look good in the home, and yet more and more people are watching stuff like on Hulu on small screens.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Is that bug-yude? Is that something that you would prefer not happen?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   >> You know, I'm not going to get in front of that train. >> Yeah.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   >> When television came into being, all of the moguls of the film studios thought that it was the devil incarnate.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I'm still a fan of shooting on film and telling stories on film and having them broadcast and distributed in theaters because I believe the communal experience is an essential part of who we are as human beings.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It goes back to telling stories around the fire.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   But the future is now, and the point is getting your point of view across, or if you're an advertiser or if you're a storyteller, giving people an opportunity to share in the story.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   >> To share in the storytelling process. So for me, it really doesn't matter. Is that an Emmy behind your head, Leo?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   >> No, no, Emmy, not at all.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   >> Oh, okay. I'm sorry. It is a small Emmy. It's a little Emmy, not a big Emmy.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   >> I'm sorry. I was just -- >> You know, I put that there, Levar, because I'm doing internet television, and I don't want anybody to look into think that I'm just some guy.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   >> No. Clearly not.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   >> I'm some guy with an Emmy. >> Yeah. Absolutely.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   >> I love that.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   >> How many Emmys do you have, Levar?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   >> Oh, stop.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   >> You got a few.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   >> We do.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   >> You got a few. Give me a break.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   >> I'm proud of them.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   >> I get one little one. That's all. Just a little regional Emmy. It doesn't count.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   >> They come primarily from reading Rainbow. I'm most proud of the Grammy. The Grammy I love, because I never expected to be able to have one of those.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   >> What did you win a Grammy for?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   >> The Autobiography of Martin Luther King. Book on tape.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   >> Audible.com, folks.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   >> Big fan audio books.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   >> Rush over to audible.com. You can get that, but we'll talk about that later.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   >> I know you have a pickle of R. I'm going to hold off on that.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   >> Okay. All right.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   >> So TVs, I think that's a great discussion, but that's not all that's at CES. In fact, I think the biggest announcement at CE...
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Well, there were two really big announcements. Microsoft said Windows 7 is going to come out on Friday, didn't it? It came out on Saturday, because...
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Surprise. People wanted to download it. I guess Microsoft forgot.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   They were shocked. Whoa. People wanted it, so they had to put more servers online. They went to Bill, and I think he had some in his closet, and he had some money.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And they had some bandwidth, and they just threw it up there. But now I've downloaded it in Windows 7 in beta for two and a half million people through August 1st.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   They still don't say when it's going to be official, but boy, if the beta, they're only the one and only beta, they say.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And August 1st, I got to think Windows 7 will be out August 1st. And the really big story, huh? You know, buy it?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Well, I mean, the guy who heads up one of the least underreported stories was the guy who heads up Windows 7 says it's very unlikely this product is going to be shipping by the end of this year, no matter what Bulmer says.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   2010? Yeah, it's very likely. And, you know, the other thing, Leo, is just because the beta's ending doesn't mean that that's when they release.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Usually the beta ends, they take all the feedback, look at all the bugs that people had, you know, basically try to wrap it all up, and that takes a little while.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   So there's going to be a window between... Yeah, there's going to be a lot of happy people, because once you install Windows 7, you can't, you know, you can't, like, downgrade.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   You kind of have to format and reinstall. And a lot of beta users should go, "What happened?"
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   By the way, very stable. It's very reliable. It's ready to ship.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   What's the hurry?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Well, you know, if you got beta... Like you just said, if you got the beta, it's working, it's stable, and then it doesn't ship by 2010, you're still running it, so what?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   No, you can't run it off to August 1st. It stops running.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   Oh, is it going to die? It's going to kill you?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Yeah, and Microsoft might want to sell some more copies of Windows. Vista's not doing all that well.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Well, they did come up with the announcement. I'm sorry, they came up with the announcement that if you buy Vista after, I guess it's July 1st, you will get a free copy.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Yes, see, they're going to... John, I don't know what this guy's... Is this an off-ski that's saying it's not going to be out in 2009?
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I don't know what this guy's talking about.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I think he probably talking typical micro... I mean, this is the way Microsoft operates.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   No, yeah, you know what it is?
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Different kinds of information, and then who knows what happens when it's playing?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   But you know what it is?
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   They want to surprise everybody.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   They don't want the Windows Vista slip-slip slip.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   They want to under-promise and over-deliver, and so they're going to say, "Oh, 2010!"
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And then, "Oh, it's ready!"
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Because you know what? It's pretty well-baked.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   It's boxed sales of Windows for Microsoft is an unbelievably small portion of the number of users.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   It's all about new computers, isn't it?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Right, it's all about new computers.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   So when you're getting a new computer, it's coming with Vista.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   So Windows 7 doesn't really threaten that.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   People aren't going to not buy a new computer just because they want to run 7.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   In fact, they might be more inclined to buy a new computer so they can make sure they get the most out of 7 as a beta.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Lisa and LaVara's eyes are crossing because they're both Mac users.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   They're telling me to say something.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I'm just like, "I got nothing to say about Windows."
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   It speaks for itself.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   It goes...
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   But Macworld was kind of a dud to Lisa.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   I mean, it wasn't like Apple had any big...
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The new iWork09 is it?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You know, I've kind of been limiting, you know, talking about what I really think.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Go ahead, say it, spit it out.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Were you disappointed by your first Macworld?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Yes.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   It was nothing.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   It was a pretty disappointing Macworld.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It was lying there.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I just felt like, "Oh, no snow leopard, no taco Mac man."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   They didn't even mention snow leopard.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   They didn't even mention anything about the iPhone, the iPhone apps, how well it was doing.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   They didn't mention a mini, they didn't mention Apple TV.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Nothing.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Nothing.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   They hadn't...
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   They're stepping away backwards very slowly like a Homer Simpson in one of those situations.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Not so slowly.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   It sounds like they're running.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I'm out of here.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   See ya!
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   In fact, it was kind of funny because Phil Schiller even said, "The last Macworld."
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   I know, and I brought that up.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I said, "On Macbook Weekly," I said, "Yeah."
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   He said the last...
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And the Apple guy was like, "No, no, no, he didn't mean that.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   He didn't mean that.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Oh."
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Just our last Macworld.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Yeah, our last Macworld.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Well, you know, there's a big...
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   The fact of the matter is, now they're saying that they want to get people in free or they
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   want to do deals.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   The actual...
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   The reality of the Macworld show with Apple's involvement is that Apple costs up, and this
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   is an extremely good authority, $25 million straight up to do that show.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And they've just decided that with all the stores they have now and all the better ways
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   they can spend their money, that $25 million could be better spent on a lot of things.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Other than the Macworld show, which is...
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   I mean, somebody does a spreadsheet on this.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   They say, "You know, what is it?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Were we getting $25 million out of this?"
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   They get probably more business from the Emeryville Apple store.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   You know, I don't know if that number is right.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I mean, I deal with a lot of companies who have pretty big booths and stuff like that.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I mean, I have a feeling that it's still a very...
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It's not just a booth, though, Ryan.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I mean, it's the...
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   No, I know, but I mean, the whole presence and...
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   You can doubt the number all you want, but I can guarantee...
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I mean, where I got that number is extremely solid and it's a big number.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And that's one of the reasons I can't stay with it.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I have no doubt it's an enormous number, but I mean, if you really...
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Oh, I wanted to add to that, really, was just that if you look at Apple over the past couple of years,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   they really backed out of almost every industry trade show.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Well, now, here's an interesting rumor.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   You hear this Lisa that Apple might go to CES next year?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Yes, I did hear that.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   That's an interesting rumor.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   What they presented this year was more geared towards...
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You know, that sort of level...
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It's consumer-like trust.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Yeah, instead of the die-hards and...
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I mean, if they're still going to do WWDC...
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   The Developers Conference is there...
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   They have to do that.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   That's like Microsoft's PDC.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Every company has to do that.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Microsoft doesn't do a Windows World Conference.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I don't see why Apple should do a Mac World Conference.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And yet, Microsoft says CES, right?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Yeah, no, I mean, it seems natural, but I guess it's just for all the fanboys it's going to be...
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Sad.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Ryan, you said you...
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   As one of those fanboys, though, I just got to say, if Apple shows up at CES, it's a win-win.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And no matter what the number actually is, Ryan, if what they spend at Mac World means I get cut and paste
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   in applications on my iPhone...
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   I'm in.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Not going to happen, you know, who's going to give you cut and paste?
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Cut and paste comes to you, courtesy, Palm.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   The Palm Pre, I think, was the...
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I said there were two, I thought, big announcements, at least from a distance.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   The Palm Pre, the biggest announcement at Mac World.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And boy, the stock market reacted.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   38% increase in Palm's stock price on the pre-announcement.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Yeah, yeah, we went from a buck to a buck 38.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It's pretty much...
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   They got them above them in those align.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   That's about it.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   So this is, you know, Palm is back.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   This is the company that basically invented the handheld company.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   No, wait a minute, they didn't.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But they're the ones who made it work.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Of course, Apple and a few other companies, Scion, created the handheld but never could get it to sell.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Palm was the one that really made it sell.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And I think because of the sinking, oddly enough, the sinking wasn't a big story here with the pre.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   I think they're closest.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   There was a lot of formation left out.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Those guys, I'm sorry they're done.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I read my column in Market Watch that ran in the last Friday.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I can't see them surviving this.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Elevation partners, Votto doesn't think they're done.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   He put $100 million into Palm on December 20th, obviously looking at WebOS, knowing about the pre, thinking this is going to be huge.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Of course, they'd be smart if they'd sold that stock.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Like, at the announcement, I don't think they have.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   I don't think they could because that would really have been a bad sign.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Did you see the mod books?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   At Macworld.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   The mod books.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   The mod books.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   At Chron.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   What do you think of those?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I thought they were really, really interesting.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   They're a tablet made out of, you give them your iBook.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Your MacBook.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Your MacBook.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Your MacBook.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I don't know.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I asked if they could do an iBook because I have one for me around.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   No, I was thinking I said MacBook.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Yeah, it has to be a MacBook and they just converted into a tablet.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   For how much money?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I think to convert it, it's 1200.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   But then if they buy it new, it's sort of like 500.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I mean, it was really flashy and interesting, but a lot of people were talking about it.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You were excited about the mod book, Ryan.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Yeah, you know, well, the pro.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I played with the- What's the difference in the pro and the one they've been selling?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   They've been around for a couple of years now.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   The first mod book, well, they've been around in so far as they had announced the product.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   But they've only been selling the mod book for, I believe, about a year, maybe a little
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   bit more, maybe a little bit less.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   The pro is, whereas the first mod book was based off of the original MacBook, you know,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   the white plastic one.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   The new mod book pro, which they have, I don't know if they've announced that date on that
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   one yet, but it's based on the MacBook Pro.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Oh, so now I take my $2,500 computer and for a thousand bucks, I have a turn to do a tablet.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   What's interesting is they rip apart the unibody design and they had a really interesting
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   way of saying that.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   It's just like, oh, we take it and make it into a multi-panel.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   We disable- Do you get a keyboard?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   No, they take the keyboard, right?
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Yeah, there's a program within it that you- Software.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   But there's no real keyboard.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   No, no, it's a bit- I'm not paying a thousand dollars to get my keyboard ripped off my MacBook
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Pro.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I can see if you're a graphic designer, an illustrator, an anime, just happens.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   You know what, if I were a graphic-
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Very very in each market, but let's be honest.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And you know what, this is the reason why Apple is more than likely not going to do it.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   They're not going to do it.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   But any time in the near future, because it's still an unbelievably niche market.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   I mean, if PCs can't make it happen and PCs dominate every possible niche computing
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   market, if PCs can't make tablets popular, then I don't see how Apple is going to kind
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   of come in and change this game yet.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   I had a new- I had a new- I'm holding out for the Newton 2.0.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   I have a Newton.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I have the new two.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Oh, bring it out.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Is that your museum?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   This is my museum.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Look at this.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   There you go.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   There's the Newton.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   You probably weren't born Lisa when that came out.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Exactly.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   That's it.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   That's my baby.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   That's my baby.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   That's my baby.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   You know what?
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   I'm going to put mine on eBay one of these days and make it out.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Hold it up, Lisa.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Look how big that is.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   It's my head.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Compared to a palm or...
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.760]   Back in the day, that was the absolute state of the art.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:29.360]   I remember being on an airplane and checking and sending emails, and I thought I was just
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.000]   the height of technological sophistication.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.240]   Of course, you're writing it into this handwriting recognition, and everybody thought, "I don't
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.960]   know what's happened to LeVar, but I don't understand a word he's saying anymore."
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.520]   I thought it was cool.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.040]   You don't know that technology.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.880]   It wasn't there that Joe Caumane, Newton's, does it take to screw in a light bulb?
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   Farm?
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:52.560]   I believe that was the answer.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:57.080]   So anyway, I want to get back to the pre and why John thinks it's over for palm.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   I've got to hear this.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.760]   I want to hear your synopsis of the end of the palm era.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.840]   Because I'd love for palm to succeed, and I'm really impressed with this pre, but what
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   do you know?
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.840]   Me too.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   No, actually, everybody wants them to survive.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.000]   I mean, I'd like them to survive too, but why?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   All right, hold on.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Hold on.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   They bring you to the party.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Hold on.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   We'll talk about it in just a sec.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.840]   We're going to take a break and talk about audible.com for just a moment.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.120]   John, if you want to base your meat, go right ahead.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.200]   I need to base my meat.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   Burger.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   Burger.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   You promised.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.360]   It wasn't me.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.560]   We've got the Platinum deal this week.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.040]   This is where you go to audible.com/twit2 and you sign up for an Audible Platinum account
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.840]   and you will get a credit to credits toward a book.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   Actually, two books.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.040]   Well, it depends on the book.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:50.720]   Two credits could go to one book if it's, you know, Cryptonomicon or the new Neil Stevenson
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:57.800]   book, which is like 800 hours, or it could go to like two of Levar's books.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.280]   That autobiography of Martin Luther King is on there, I noticed.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   You have 14 books, Levar, on audible.com.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.280]   I love audio literature.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.760]   Why do you like it?
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.760]   Now, tell me.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.320]   See, you did reading Rainbow for years.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.800]   Give us the plug because everybody yells at me.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.040]   I even say I read audio books because I feel like-
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   Absolutely.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   That's the term.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.800]   Well, tell- you explained to me, they're going to listen to you more than they listen
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   to me.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.440]   Because I'm 52 years old.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.240]   I grew up in the era of the heyday of radio.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.720]   It is about storytelling, and when you plug in your headphones and someone is reading
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:41.400]   you a story, it's just the most essential part of being human to tell stories to one
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   another.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.160]   Did your mom read to you when you were a kid?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.120]   Not only did she read to us, she read in front of us.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.320]   My mom to this day has at least two or three novels going for her own personal enjoyment.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.480]   So I grew up in a house where reading was like breathing.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.840]   I grew up getting read to.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.520]   It's just I just feel like it's a better way to listen to a book, to read a book.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.520]   Agreed.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.000]   Now, again, look, every time you read a book, it's like making a movie in your head.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.480]   And so whether you're stimulated, not everybody learns the same way, not everybody enjoys
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.960]   media the same way.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.120]   So those who are, you know, get the information better in an audio way, fantastic.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.680]   They have that ability.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.120]   People who are blind.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.040]   It's a fantastic way to enjoy literature.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.320]   If you like to read it, if you like that contact with the paper and the hand and the turning
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.280]   of the page, it's all good.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.760]   The point is read a book.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.960]   Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.840]   Well, here's a way to do it for free.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.480]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.680]   Sign up for a platinum account.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:45.920]   I think the Grammy award-winning best spoken world album of 1999 would be a great choice.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:51.720]   LeVar Burton narrating the autobiography of Martin Luther King.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:55.320]   I know you came prepared with a pic, LeVar, but do you have another one or is that the
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.320]   one?
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.800]   No, that was not the one.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   I don't know.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   I haven't researched this.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:06.040]   I haven't to gone to the website to see if audible has the offering.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.720]   But I just re-recently read the foundation series.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.800]   Oh, they do.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   The Azimov Foundation.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.160]   The Azimov Foundation series.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   It's classic science fiction literature and re-reading again.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.440]   It just reminded me why I'm such a fan of the genre.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.680]   The best, he really is the king of that foundation.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.840]   Unfortunately, I think a lot of older science fiction never was recorded.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.800]   They have foundation abridged.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.080]   And I'm going to say you really should read it on abridged.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:37.920]   You should read it on abridged.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.600]   You want the whole thing.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.320]   If you want to get a kid excited about foundation, maybe a quick way to get into it because it
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   is a trilogy.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.040]   It's a lot.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.000]   The abridged might be a way to start, but you really, really want to read the whole thing.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.880]   Is there Harry Potter?
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   There is.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.320]   Jim Dale reads the Harry Potter books.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   He is amazing.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   I can't imagine my first.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.160]   I haven't experienced.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.320]   You haven't read Harry Potter?
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.360]   No, I have read Harry Potter.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   I'm just scared.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   No, I haven't read a book.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.600]   Oh, you haven't listened to a book?
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.040]   I haven't listened to a book.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.400]   Harry Potter would be a brilliant way to start because Jim Dale has the man of a thousand
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.400]   voices.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.200]   He is unbelievable.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.200]   Unfortunately.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.760]   Apple did a terrible thing.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.080]   Apple made the Jim Dale Harry Potter exclusive to iTunes.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.680]   It's from Audible, but it's not eligible for this audible.com/twit2 because you can
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   only get it through iTunes.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.680]   But you know what?
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.680]   A great one to start with.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   What would be a good starter?
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.760]   Apple's screwing the public yet again.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:38.320]   No, I don't want to go that far because this is in theory a commercial.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.280]   Although it's really completely lost control of it at this point.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.680]   But yeah, there's certainly a great one still listened to.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   You know what else?
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.680]   I didn't know this, Levar.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.000]   You did Miles Davis's autobiography also.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.880]   That was my first Grammy nomination.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.200]   Yeah, the autobiography of Miles Davis by Quincy Troop.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.600]   Yeah, fantastic book.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:01.840]   And I do it in my voice until the very last word of the book, which I do with Miles's
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.840]   voice.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.080]   Let's reproduce that moment.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.600]   How does Miles sound different?
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.640]   What's unique about his voice?
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:18.880]   If you know anything about Miles, he had a real, gruff, deep gravel quality to his voice.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.680]   And one of his favorite phrases, something that he said all the time, is the last word
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.080]   of the book.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   And that's later.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.360]   I love it.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.760]   Oh, you got to get this one.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   This is our pick of the week.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.600]   Miles, the autobiography, Miles Davis with Quincy Troop narrated by Levar Burton.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   Wow.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600]   This sounds great.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.600]   This could be.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   Yeah, you get both.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.920]   Get the Martin Luther King and the Miles Davis because you get two books.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   All right.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   So, I'm going to go to the
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   end of the book.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:54.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:08.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:15.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:22.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:29.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:36.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:04.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:11.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:18.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:32.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:39.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:00.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:07.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:14.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:21.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:49.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:56.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:03.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:18.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:25.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:32.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:39:00.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:03.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:10.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:17.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:31.920]   I'm going to go to the end of the book.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   You don't have to use the Facebook integration.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   I love Symbian S60.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   I call it the almost smartphone.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   We have these smartphones which are also computer platforms.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   This is the Symbian platform in Europe.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   You're talking to the wrong guy because I'm an E71 user.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   I think it will be like the fallback.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   There's going to be a tier of people that just have practical mobile phones that just want to use them for phones.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.920]   I'm one of those types of people.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   I'm not that interested in carrying around a computer in my pocket or are you happy to see me?
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:38.920]   You also have to take a long view on some of the stuff, John, because by the most basic phone that you can right now.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   I mean, go to any store by the most basic possible phone.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.920]   It's going to have SMS.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.920]   It might have a camera.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.920]   It would only have SMS.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   It might have a camera.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   It might have two cameras.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920]   It's got a color screen.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   A few years ago, that was a luxury device.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.920]   In a few years, smartphones are going to begin to be the norm.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.920]   I think so.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.920]   It's still at the high end.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:08.920]   But eventually speaking, every phone you buy is going to have a browser, might run apps, even if they're only Java.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   It's going to have email.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   This is just going to be the thing that phones become.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.920]   There isn't really any stopping that because that's just the march.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.920]   I think what John says is interesting.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.920]   One proprietary one open is Windows Mobile Gone.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.920]   Is that a history?
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:26.920]   I don't necessarily agree with that.
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.920]   I do agree that to a certain extent, some of these platforms are going to have to really step it up or they're going to dock.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   The Windows Mobile is a great example.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   It just shoots the horse.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   It's got a broken body.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   I would have said that about Palm about 10 seconds ago.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   I think the pre-kind of surprised me.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.920]   I was very impressed.
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   It's a crappy name.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   Here's what it reminds me.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.920]   You have that black brick because I was in the office up there a few weeks ago.
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   Yeah, the storm.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.920]   I get a hold of this thing.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.920]   I haven't seen it before.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.920]   I start playing with it.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.920]   I don't like it at all.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.920]   Immediately.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:07.920]   Once I get a hold of it, it's possible that the pre, once you actually get one, you'll find it less likely.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   I started this conversation with that and Ryan agreed.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   We don't know because until you really have it.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.920]   But look at, remember, it's John Rubenstein.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.920]   It's the guy who, the Apple iPod guy.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.920]   It's a bunch of people from the iPhone team.
[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.920]   I mean, the pedigree on this is pretty impressive.
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.920]   Well, I mean, anyway, back to John's original point though, that this is going to shake out into two players.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.920]   I think that's a really kind of a limited way of looking at this thing.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:36.920]   The mobile application, I mean, the mobile world is a lot larger than the PC world was when it started.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   And so when we're talking about smartphone OS's, we're also not encumbered by some of the same pairs.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.920]   And so we're encumbered by some of the same paradigms and expectations, especially in developing countries.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.920]   So when we're thinking about, well, what are the disadvantages of having multiple platforms?
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   You have to deal with writing application for different types of phones and all these various things.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   I mean, that's being abstracted.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   And a lot of it's moving to the web.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:04.920]   And I think that, Paul actually took a really interesting view with this by making their applications kind of run on web standards.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   Even though they don't run over the web, they run on web standards locally.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   And I have a feeling that's probably not the last time we're going to see this from a big mobile company.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.920]   But I mean, to say that we're all going to just go straight to Android or to Apple,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   I think that you discount how entrenched some of these players are.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.920]   I mean, Nokia is the biggest mobile device maker in the world.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.920]   Yeah, no, I'm not pushing.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.920]   I'm not knocking Nokia off the platform.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.920]   They're still going to be a handset.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.920]   They're a handset maker.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   And they can make the handsets for both Apple and Android.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   LeVar, what phone do you use?
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   iPhone.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   iPhone.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.920]   Yeah, iPhone.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.920]   I'm selling the 2G platform.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:44.920]   I haven't converted yet.
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   Both of my people got it.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   2G?
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.920]   Oh.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   Come on.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.920]   Don't you get it like in those movie star baskets that they get?
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.920]   Don't they like to give you the movie star basket with like all that stuff in it?
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:56.920]   And you just, you know, it's just...
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   Must have missed that part.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.920]   I thought that, you know, you guys would just get to give you everything.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.920]   He's not Meryl Streep for God's sake.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   He's Meryl Streep to me.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   I thought you didn't even watch Star Trek.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.920]   I...
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.920]   I do.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.920]   I watch Star Trek.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   I love Jordi.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   But you know, it's really from Roots and from Reading Rainbow.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.920]   That's where I really love him from.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.920]   I'm getting embarrassed now.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   So let's move on.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.920]   Ah.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.920]   I don't have any other topics.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   You don't embarrass easily.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.920]   I'm turning bright red right now.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   So, boy...
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.920]   Let's go to the Macintosh show where everybody...
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.920]   There's nothing to say about the Macintosh.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:37.920]   I thought there was a lot of cool stuff.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.920]   They all take Jordi's, you know, angle that he took with the CEO.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.920]   I thought there was a lot of stuff that wasn't from Apple.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   You don't have to call him Jordi, you know.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.920]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   What am I thinking?
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   I'm more...
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.920]   Do you prefer...
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.920]   You're the one that said Jordi, and you got it in my brain.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   You prefer Clinton, don't you?
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   'Cause I know it's on Twitter, LaVar, you use Kunta out.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.920]   I do refer to myself as Kunta often.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.920]   Is that interesting?
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.920]   I mean, how long...
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.920]   That was 30...
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   Some years ago, right?
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   It's 30...
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.920]   30 plus, yeah.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   It was January 27th, 1977.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.920]   You're exactly the same age I am, by the way.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   Seriously?
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.920]   And you look great.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.920]   I think I am.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   Now I am in birth.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.920]   So...
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.920]   What did you...
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.920]   I actually saw John wandering the floor at Macworld Expo, and...
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   So you saw something that you thought was cool?
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   Yeah, I saw Patrick Norton.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   That was cool.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   I saw Callie Lewis.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   I saw Lisa Bettany.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   So, well, yeah, there was a lot of stuff.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:36.920]   I can't remember any of it to being cool, but there was a lot of stuff that I saw at the
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   time.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.920]   So much for that.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   Okay, Lisa, one thing.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   You must have found something cool there.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   Well, I really like the Gorilla pod.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   I mean, that has nothing...
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.920]   She's got this metal Gorilla pod that's like to kill.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   You know what that is?
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.920]   That's that tripod that you bendy tripod that you can wrap around things.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.920]   It really is.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:52.920]   But yours is like...
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.920]   You're just like...
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.920]   11 pounds.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.920]   11 pounds.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.920]   It's huge.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.920]   I'm Joel.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.920]   What is this?
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   What are we talking about?
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.920]   Do you know what a Gorilla pod is?
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   I'm not going to describe it.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.920]   It's just a...
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.920]   Adjustable tripod.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   Yeah, but it's got like the legs bend and you can bend around stuff.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.920]   So you can bring it, you know, like your video camera or your camera...
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.920]   Is that the black and white thing that's got the little bendable thing?
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   You mean it's not a hat?
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   Uh-oh.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.920]   Uh-oh.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   You have a big giant one.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.920]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   She's got a gigantic one.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   Big enough to wear on her head.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   It's quite...
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   It's quite...
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   It's quite...
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   It's quite fetching, actually.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   It looks like something...
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.920]   It's like something might have been in a Star Trek episode.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   It's very...
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.920]   Very...
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.920]   Very annoying.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   I am in my butt.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   She looks like one of those people that sucks the salt out of you.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.920]   That's a salt sucking monster.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   That's right.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   From the first initial Star Trek series.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:49.920]   And you end up like a desiccated mummy.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   How do I look with it on?
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   Not so good.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   I was also...
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:54.920]   I mean, I...
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.920]   In Canada, we don't get a lot of access to...
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   I phone cases and that kind of thing.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   So you were kind of loud by that?
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   I wasn't loud, but it was nice to go and try everything out.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   And I really like the Griffin clarifying.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   I know Justine's been great.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920]   Is that a case?
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   Oh, that's the case with the lens on it.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   Yeah, and it has sort of...
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   It has a macro lens so that you can take a picture of something.
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.920]   And it also works well with Evernote.
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.920]   Take a picture of it in a part.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.920]   I love Evernote.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   Or...
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.920]   You know, I use it just to snap like...
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.920]   Oh, there's a movie poster.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   Snap that.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   Right.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:35.440]   The G1, the Google phone, the Android phone from a T-Mobile has such a good camera that
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.920]   you can use it to take barcode pictures.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   And the iPhone couldn't until the Clarify came out.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:40.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   And that magnification made it possible.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.920]   Yes, it's the autofocus, actually.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.920]   Right.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   Now, I understand the pre...
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.920]   It's a three megapixel camera, but they're talking about...
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   They don't say autofocus.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   They say something about depth of field.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   Yeah, they've...
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   They've got a lot of...
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   Yeah, they've done a lot of work on the software side too, to, I guess, to improve the camera.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   I think that's a killer app that scan the barcodes when you're at a store and find out why
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   I'd get it cheaper.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   I always say I know.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   I agree.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.920]   I mean, it kind of bumps me out that it doesn't have an autofocus, but in all reality, not every
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   phone is gonna...
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   I mean, that is still a pretty high-end feature.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   Oh, it's a nice feature.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   I think that's a feature.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.920]   So anybody talk about a flash for the iPhone?
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:16.920]   A flash for the iPhone.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   When is that coming for God's sake?
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.920]   So there's actually a company that built a flash for the iPhone, but because of the way that
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.920]   Apple has kind of done their thing, you can't really make that happen.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:31.920]   The reason being that Apple doesn't let you interface with the DAW connector for iPhone
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   peripherals.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.920]   They just...
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   That's off limits for them.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   So somebody found a hack around that, and the only way to do that is to kind of use the
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.920]   jailbreaking thing, which is kind of illegitimately putting non-authorized apps on your iPhone,
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   which is fine.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.920]   And I think I love it and I've always done it, but that's not a way that you're gonna be
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   able to build a business that does hardware.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.920]   I'm expecting people to do it kind of illegitimately.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   Speaking of cameras, get this.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:49:59.920]   Polaroid at CES.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   Did you see this, Ryan?
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:01.920]   Has a new camera.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   It's a digital camera with a built-in printer, so you still get a print out of it.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   It still goes...
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   And you still can wave it if you feel like it still doesn't do anything if you do.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   Yeah, Polaroid's been working with Zinc for the last couple of years, kind of trying to
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   get to this point.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   Last year at last CES, they had a Zinc portable printer, and so this year, you know, the expectation
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.920]   was that they were going to just get that Zinc portable printer into an actual camera.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   Unfortunately, the thing is gargantuan.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.920]   It is like the size of an original...
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   It's so stupid.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.920]   It's so draggy now.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   It's an epsilon printer with like a lens on it.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.920]   What was a duct tape of printer to your camera?
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   Is this actually Polaroid or somebody who bought the name and is coming?
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.920]   There's that Polaroid is done.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   I thought they were done.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   So is this not Polaroid?
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.920]   No, it's not Polaroid.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.920]   The Polaroid's company is defunct.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   They actually went out of business.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   So this is somebody who just bought the name like all those other names like...
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   Or Pac-A-Bell.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   Who could be seen as a next Polaroid people for all we know.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   Well, like home edicts and sharper image.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.920]   Right.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:07.920]   They're all gone.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   Did anybody see the PowerMat technology though, that they have over sharper image?
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:14.920]   This is kind of cool.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.920]   It's the same kind of magnetic...
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   I guess it's magnetic induction charging.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   Magnetic induction, yeah.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   Yeah, the pre is going to use that.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   You just put the phone on a little table and it goes...
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:26.920]   My toothbrush does it.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:29.920]   My toothbrush has been doing it for decades.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   So L'Var, tell us about the power table or whatever it's called.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   PowerPlate.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   They call it the power mat.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.920]   It's great because it's wireless.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:50.920]   They had a futures show and tell where they actually wired a countertop in a kitchen.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   Huge appliances all run by this magnetic induction technology, which has apparently been around for a long time.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   But nobody's ever figured out an application in the current modern day market.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.920]   The thing that bugs me is you have to...
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   Okay, so you get the mat.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.920]   It's only like 100 bucks, right?
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   But then you have to buy adapters for all your devices.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.920]   Until...
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   And here's the big question.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   Are they going to be able to convince manufacturers to embed the technology in devices so that you don't need the aftermarket add-ons to get the induction to perform?
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.920]   It's so cool to get home and just unload your pockets on this thing.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   Right.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   And then next morning it's all charged.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   You could put your car on it.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   Yes.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   In some cases it just does provide the necessary amount of power to kind of get the job done.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   Not all cases.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   But I mean the...
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.920]   The flip side...
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.920]   The TV with lighting in the home with all kinds of things.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.920]   Well, I mean, fortunately for them they get to kind of set up the demo and make it work.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.920]   Yeah, they want it to.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:51.920]   But no, you know, I mean the interesting part about induction is actually going to have its probably first major release in kind of a charging scenario.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   And that was the other part of the Palm pre-announcement was they announced that it will have a device called the Touchstone.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920]   Right.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.920]   And that you will place it on the Touchstone, which is kind of its version of a magnetic dock almost.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:07.920]   And it charges from there magnetically over induction.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.920]   I understand that Jason Calicanos is putting a mat in his garage so he just drives the Tesla under the mat.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.920]   I think it's just because he wants to sit on the mat.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   I'm just kidding.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:17.920]   He's not.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920]   And there's no way you could do that.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.920]   Here's another story not related to Mac, World, or CES.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.920]   It's the digital TV convergence.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.920]   Now, this is not something you're going to have to do in Canada for a couple of years.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   On February 17 in the States, all the analog television stations go digital.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:34.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.920]   Disaster waiting to have that.
[00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.920]   Well, apparently the Obama transition team believes that they're pushing for a delay.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.920]   They've asked Congress to consider delaying the date.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:48.920]   Kevin Martin, the outgoing FCC's chairman, says, "No way we're going to delay that.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   I think it's a terrible idea."
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.920]   Isn't it just a bunch, John, a bunch of procrastinators anyway?
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   If you don't do it now, they're just not.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   Now, you know what it is?
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.920]   Here's what's going to happen.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   The public doesn't know what digital is.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   We have dumbed down our public in the United States.
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   The public has no idea what digital is.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   They think if they have a digital clock on their TV set, it's a digital TV set.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.920]   If they have buttons you push instead of a knob you turn, it must be digital.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   You don't know what digital is.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   It's digital because I had a phone like that one.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.920]   And you would push the buttons.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920]   Exactly.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.920]   So what's going to happen, so they have all these PSAs floating around about saying, "Well,
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   you can call the..."
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.920]   If you have a problem during this transition, you can call this number.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.920]   Nobody's going to call that number because nobody's going to pay any attention to it
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   because they've already assumed, I mean, these people.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.920]   Well, they're running out of coupons too.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.920]   They've spent all the money.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   And they haven't got enough coupons.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   So what's going to happen is that, and here's why everybody wants to back off on this a little
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   bit, is they're going to call their local TV stations because they're going to turn on
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.920]   Channel 7 to get some show they want to watch.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:54.920]   It's going to be dead.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:56.920]   It's going to be dead for hours and they're going to call.
[00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   My TV is not working!
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.920]   They are going to flood the local stations with phone calls.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.920]   It's going to be a nightmare.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.920]   You know what happened?
[00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   Now they tried this back east, one town, Wilmington, North Carolina.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   North Carolina.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:12.920]   They filmed Austin's Creek.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:13.920]   Oh, really?
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   Well, thank you for that input.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.920]   At least I'm so glad we're here.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   Have you here today?
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.920]   Is it really where they need it?
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:23.920]   You guys are just...
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   I'm so sorry.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.920]   I'm so sorry.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.920]   They know it.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.920]   I apologize.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   Wilmington, North Carolina.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.920]   They did this six months ago.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.920]   You know what the real problem was?
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   The analog travels farther than digital.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.920]   So a lot of people who were able to get reception on the analog got the converter box, plugged it
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.920]   in, did everything required, and still lost the stations because they're unmarginal in
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.920]   the ground.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.920]   I think this is the failure of the PR campaign.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   I agree with each other.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:53.920]   There's no good time to do this.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.920]   So we might as well do it now.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   It's going to be painful no matter what.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   So let's just let it go.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.920]   I appreciate that.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   But I disagree with the whole concept that we have to make an abrupt change.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   With black and white to color, they just let it slide until a little bit.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   No, we've been doing that, John.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   We've had most stations went digital two years ago.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   How many years did black and white TV remain after they made the transition?
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   I think the first color broadcast were in 1955.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.920]   It was almost 10 years.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   John, the other thing you have to remember about this particular scenario is there's actually
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   a dollar figure associated with it.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   Oh, there it is.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:32.920]   No, I mean, I know that it's easy to be cynical about that.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.920]   But when you're talking about literally hundreds of billions of dollars that the FCC needs to
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.920]   make from auctioning off the spectrum, they have to make that break at some point of order.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:43.920]   I think we're all on the same page.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:47.920]   Do it now, do it later, but you're still going to have these problems.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   And yeah, it's going to be crappy for any number of people for a couple of weeks.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   But as soon as your TV stops working, you know that you have to go fix it.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.920]   You're going to go to your local Best Buy or whatever.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.920]   You're going to pick up the box that you need.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   And then it's going to be done.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:07.920]   So what you're saying is that it's going to within two weeks, I'm going to get this straight.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.920]   Within two weeks, according to you, it's going to be kind of resolved and it's not going to
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.920]   be a big deal after that.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:17.920]   I think it's going to be a nightmare for months and months and months and it's going to be
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.920]   a disaster politically and in a lot of other ways.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   Could be politically a disaster.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   This is, I would imagine the 20 million people who are still watching analog TV are mostly
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   older, right?
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.920]   I would to hope.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   And Lisa, you don't watch an analog TV.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   You know what?
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   I don't watch TV at all.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   See, you're the Hulu generation.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.920]   I know you can't get Hulu in Canada, but you're the watch it on the screen generation.
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.920]   I'm a person that likes to get the entire season.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   Oh, that's smart money.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   And watch it.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   Or I get...
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:50.920]   That's what I do too.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.920]   I get sort of DVDs delivered kind of...
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:59.920]   You go on a the wire binge and you just watch it or 24 binge and you just watch 12 episodes
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.920]   in one night.
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   Yes.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:02.920]   Or all of them.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:03.920]   The wrong movies.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   I noticed you're kind of pale.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.920]   Okay.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.920]   So you don't get out a lot.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   I just went to Australia and I think I'm really tanned.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.920]   For you?
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   No one noticed at all.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.920]   Not brown.
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   I could tell you right now.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   So what should we do?
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.920]   Should we put off this transition?
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.920]   We've got a chatroom, a guy in the chatroom, Scotland Colin.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   And Scotland says they've already done it and Scotland and it went great.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.920]   I swear to God, that's what he said.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   He said there was no problem at all.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.920]   Everybody was able to change over and everything was fine.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   No, I hope that happens here to be honest about it.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.920]   I mean, maybe I'm just like an alarmist.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   How did you feel about Y2K?
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.920]   Did you think the whole world was going to end?
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:52.920]   No, I was totally convinced it was a crock of crap from the beginning and I harped on it
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:58.920]   with everything from presentations to critical columns saying this is nothing was going to come of Y2K.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   XP99 is saying in the chatroom that Sweden did it too, but I think he's just baiting me.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.920]   Oh, double switch.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   He wants you to do a Swedish voice.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.920]   I think he's just baiting me.
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.920]   I want to hear your Swedish voice.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   No, I sound like the Swedish chef from the Muppets.
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   No, actually, the Swedish are very nice accent.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.920]   But they kind of sound a little bit like they're from Minnesota.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   Really?
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   By the way, Leo, I heard that in Russia.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.920]   Stop it, stop it, stop it.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:33.920]   Do you know how many flames I get in the forums when I use these voices?
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.920]   They think I'm insulting them.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   Russian guy is innocent.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.920]   I am going to spam you to death if you keep doing Russian accent.
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:41.920]   He's not funny.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.920]   This just in Namibia has gone digital.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:46.920]   Has it really?
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   I don't do Namibia.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   Yes, we need Namibia.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   Do you do Namibia and Lavaar?
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.920]   You could do it.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   I do a fair West African.
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   Do it.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   Do it.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.920]   Do it.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   Do it.
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.920]   He does a great Miles Davis, I hear.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.920]   I want the West African voice.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.920]   That would be a good one to get down.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   Do you do Trinity-edian?
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   You could do it from the islands.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.920]   Yeah, man.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   From the islands.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   We won't get digital until the spliff starts.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920]   That's right.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.920]   We don't have digital because we like the antennas.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   You know, it's funny what Tech TV was on.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   We would get so many emails from the islands, from the Caribbean.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   And I would go to the affiliate relations guy and say, "Oh, this is great.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920]   We're in Trinidad and Tobago."
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.920]   He said, "No, we're not."
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   We've never been anywhere near Trinidad and Tobago.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.920]   They just put up an antenna or a satellite dish and they just get it.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   They pull it down.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.920]   I mean, we were in Bermuda too.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   Well, we were in the Bahamas because we made an appearance in the Bahamas.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   The worst thing in my life is we had 24 hours in NASA.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.920]   So literally, Michaela Pereira and I, we had 15 minutes.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920]   We went down to the beach, put our toes in and left.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.920]   We had barely the time to have Conquita.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920]   That was it.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   It was over.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.920]   Why don't you just stay an extra day?
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   We couldn't.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920]   We had to go.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920]   We then went to Boca Raton.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.920]   It was one of those, you know, one of those five cities and five days kind of a thing.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   Do you have, okay, we have a Trinidadian in the chat room who says he has direct TV, but
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   that's gray market, right?
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   That's not a legal direct TV.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   I don't think you can get it.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   In fact, in Canada, they do that.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.920]   Everybody has direct TV, but it's not legit.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   No, they have the real direct.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   They have a direct TV version up there, but they don't have the one that we get.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   Oh.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   But you can swap out the cards.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   Okay.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.400]   I don't want to go any farther with this conversation.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.600]   Let me see what else is in the news.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.760]   We're going to wrap this up pretty quick here.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.680]   Any more on the digital TV delay, LeVar, you know, here's, you're a content guy.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.600]   Surely, you know, this is an issue for you.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.920]   No, not really.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.240]   I really don't believe it's an issue.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.880]   You either got it or you don't.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.040]   You know, do you not care about the 20 million who are still watching with rabbit ears?
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.800]   As Ryan said, look, when you turn your TV on that day and you don't get a signal, then
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.640]   you'll figure out that you've got to go to a fries or the best buy and you've got to
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   pick up a new set and end of story.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.560]   I don't see that it's going to be a huge issue.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.400]   Yahoo says we're going to hire a new CEO, maybe Carol Bartz of Autodesk.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.560]   John, you know Carol.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560]   Would she be a good choice?
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560]   She's six.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.000]   She'd be better than Decker, I think.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   Susan Decker, who's also in the running, currently running Yahoo.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   But Carol's retired.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.240]   I mean, she's like 60 years old.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.280]   She's too old to run Yahoo?
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   No.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.000]   I don't think so.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   No.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.720]   I think she's just the right age.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.880]   No, she's okay by me.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.240]   She'll be long.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   You'll do great.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   No, she's not.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.960]   I mean, 60 is not that old for as a CEO who's just an organizational person who can, you
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:49.760]   kind of, you know, what she can do, I think, is at least see, you know, the problem with
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.880]   that Yahoo has always been it's lack of organizational structures.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.040]   I mean, there was people who didn't know who to report to.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.520]   There were people double reporting to different people.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.880]   I mean, the whole mechanism, the entire company was a complete mess.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.840]   If you talk to anybody who even worked there was going to work there.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.280]   She turned Autodesk around.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   I mean, she took it.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   Well, she organized it.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.000]   I mean, she's an organizational type.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.200]   And then maybe that's what they need.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.880]   Someone who can say, hey, look, why is this organized like this?
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.360]   Here's the way it should be and then she can maybe fix things and then leave.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.720]   I don't think she's going to be.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.600]   It's not the visionary that's going to be seeing, you know, what the next, you know,
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.120]   generation of Yahoo apps is going to look like.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.040]   She just needs somebody to get the place fixed.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.600]   I think maybe that was the problem.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.840]   I mean, Jerry Yang was a good visionary, but he just didn't know how to make the trains
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.840]   run on time.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.280]   Yeah, that's what I think you need most of Leaney.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:43.760]   Yahoo's revenue in the fiscal year 2007, $6.97 billion.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.720]   The biggest Autodesk ever got was $2 billion.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.320]   So it's a bigger company.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.200]   But it's a different kind of company.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.240]   Don't forget that Autodesk was selling a product, which gives you different numbers
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.720]   than somebody selling advertising.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.720]   Oh, you're right.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.840]   That's a whole different, a whole different keloff fish.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.520]   Ah, I think that's about it.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.760]   I want to give some props out to Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor, who's I think always kind of
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.000]   got it about digital technology.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.960]   They shot on their lights in the sky tour.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:21.000]   They shot high def.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.760]   Many camera high def of the tour.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.240]   And I think they never got it together to put it out as a DVD.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:35.080]   So they have now released its three torrent files, not just like a cut down, but all seven
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:45.560]   cameras high def footage in final cut pro sequences, 400 gigabytes worth of files.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.640]   If you're on Comcast, don't bother to try to download this.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.520]   It does point out the kind of limited that can't bandwidth caps.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.520]   Maybe not such a difficult limited.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.120]   I think Trent Reznor hates the internet.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.920]   Maybe that's what I'll clearly Trent Reznor hates editing.
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   I'll show you.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920]   Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.360]   Like I'm not editing this.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   You do it.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.000]   You edit from me.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   You do it.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.080]   But I think this is a great idea.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   It actually is.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.840]   I mean, look, the future is having conducting a relationship for, you know, for musicians,
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.960]   for actors, for writers even, having a relationship with your audience, with your fan base is where
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.360]   this is all.
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.400]   And if you can, if you can conduct a conversation with those who are interested in the content
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.760]   that you are producing and make them feel apart, this is the failure, I think, of the
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.040]   Star Trek franchise.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:37.160]   If you can conduct a conversation with them and have them feel involved, it's a win-win.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.560]   Do you think the Rod and Barry estate mod gelled and didn't handle it properly?
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.560]   Do you think they should or paramount?
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.880]   Maybe it was paramount issue.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.160]   It wasn't major to handle.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.480]   I mean, it was certainly paramount.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.240]   And you know, over the course of my relationship with Paramount, I watched them take Gene Rodenberry's
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.480]   Cadillac and drive it into the ground.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.480]   That's really sad.
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.960]   No, actually, Levar, have you seen the new Star Trek, the JJ Abrams Star Trek?
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.520]   I haven't seen the movie.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.520]   I've seen both trailers.
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:04.240]   Okay, because, you know, it's that's so hotly contested right now.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.400]   And I think it looks great.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   It looks fantastic.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.560]   I can't wait to see it.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:12.000]   I'm certainly not incompletely, you know, people don't always agree with that assessment.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.720]   No, I think it's great.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:21.320]   But from a member of the family, I think that if this movie is successful, then the possibility
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.880]   exists that in their corporate minds, Paramount will then look to where else they can, you
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.920]   know, get this goose to lay another golden egg.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.000]   And the opportunity for the next gen to take one more trip around the universe will be
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   right there and waiting.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   I am so with you.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.680]   And I really, it's great to hear you say the way I put it is it's about community.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.000]   The audience becomes community.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.120]   It's not a passive consumer anymore.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.400]   You really do need to engage with them.
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.840]   And that's what we've learned on the internet that, you know, and boy, the power is amazing.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.200]   Certainly JJ Abrams knows that.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.200]   Yes, he does.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.400]   He's a smart, smart man.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.800]   Do you, does that change how you think about your projects, Levar?
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.040]   It does.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:11.280]   It's, it's, it's beginning to have a direct impact on the kinds of projects that I'm
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.360]   choosing to do.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:19.760]   And do you see, I think nowadays, if you're a recording artist, if you're a movie maker,
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:25.000]   if you're a writer, you, you don't think in terms of the kind of one to many broadcast
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.280]   model that we're used to, you really have to start thinking about involving people.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280]   I look at somebody like you, Lee.
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.040]   So it, I mean, you know, clearly everything you do is community based.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.240]   Certainly everything we do at TWID.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.800]   I think it's really important to, to have that interaction.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:44.080]   And, and that's why, you know, someone like Justine is just, Justine Azeric.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.960]   I just, hitting, hitting the mainstream because she is so interactive with, you know, you
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.960]   can follow her.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960]   Where is she going?
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   What is she doing?
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.080]   I follow Justine anywhere.
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:55.720]   You met her at CES, didn't you?
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   We hung out a little bit.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.720]   I'm, she's terrific, terrific young lady.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:03.640]   She's, and Lisa's reminds me also you, you, it's not gracious of you to bring up Justine,
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   but you remind me very much of Justine in that way that you're using.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   Tech Hotties.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:15.200]   Well, I see, I don't, I hate to, I really hate to focus on the cute sexiness of it.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.160]   But, but, I mean, obviously everybody is, but it, but it has to be more than that has
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.160]   to be subtracted.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.160]   There's nothing more attractive than a smart woman.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.400]   I have to say that's true.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.000]   Who's also beautiful.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   No, I'm burger.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.160]   I'm so, that's our, that's our, by the way, that's our safe word for the show today as
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.160]   burger.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.160]   I just want everybody to know.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.200]   So, can I, I just want to, can I just draw my two bit opinion in on this, it's in Star
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.680]   Trek movie just coming out.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.760]   I was, you know, I, I love JJ Abrams material, by the way, but I think he's, he does such
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.760]   an, his whole style is such an intense, weird kind of pacing.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:51.360]   And I'm not sure it's going to do the, the, the, the storyline justice.
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.520]   I would, would have hoped that a Joss Whedon, for example, oh, he'd do a good job with it.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   Would have done a better job because he has a more of us, he has more of a Star Trek style
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   pacing.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:07.160]   You know, John, I, I think that we've probably never agreed this much on, on, on, on, on,
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.160]   on any one show.
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160]   And it's kind of nice.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.160]   This is the 2009 John.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.160]   I'm digging it.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.040]   No, I know what you're saying.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.800]   And I'm sure what Hollywood is saying is, no, the kids today, they want the quick editing.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.240]   They want the fast pace.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.400]   They want the MTV style.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.760]   The JJ Abrams gives us, they want the mystery.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.640]   They don't want the old fashioned storytelling.
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   Yeah, but fire, firefly was phenomenal.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.120]   And it's the best.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.120]   It's, it's, it's fantastic.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.160]   And, and I think Josh knows about community just as much, if not more than anybody.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.280]   I mean, surely, but JJ got there first.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:42.760]   He made a condition upon coming to Paramount as a producer.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.320]   He got Star Trek.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.320]   He won, he won of the franchise.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.320]   We'll see what happens.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   That's interesting.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.320]   Well, I mean, he does.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   I mean, he's involved.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.320]   You know, I've always watched this stuff.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:58.240]   I couldn't, I couldn't, I mean, I started with the, the alias, which is, is early work.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.160]   And I thought it was the best thing, you know, on TV at the time.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.520]   The early part of his early.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.440]   And then he went on to, you know, the loss, which I could really not take much of.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:10.600]   And then now I've been watching some of the fringe and what she's involved with.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.440]   And it's, and it's so weird.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.840]   I mean, he's almost getting to the point where that, you know, the guy who did a racer
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   head.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   I can't remember his name.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   That's director.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840]   David Lynch.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.840]   Lynch.
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.640]   He's getting Lynch-like in terms of this kind of surreal, the story never resolves itself.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.840]   It keeps you on pins and needles and, and basically creeps you out.
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.920]   And I have this, the sense that he's going to, the movie is going to be creepy.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920]   Hmm.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.640]   Well, that would be a shift in the franchise.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   I mean, maybe that's really cool.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   Yeah, it might work.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.640]   I don't know.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:38.640]   I don't know.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.640]   I've always found J.J.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:46.200]   somewhat wholesome in his, I mean, I don't know if you remember, but he did Felicity.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.600]   Felicity was very wholesome.
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.280]   And I mean, it was more just the storytelling and, you know, he had it.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.280]   Who did Dawson's creep?
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.280]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.280]   That was me.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.280]   Come on.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280]   I'm sorry I said that.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.280]   Come on.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280]   No, I'm sorry I said that.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.840]   I have never, truth is I've never seen any of those shows.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.840]   I don't know why.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:04.840]   I don't know why I'm ever.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.840]   But I'm figuring, here's my theory.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.000]   I'm going to save it with the old age home.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.600]   I'm going to be able to watch Lost.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.920]   I'm going to be able to watch 25.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.920]   I've never seen 24.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.260]   I'm going to be able to watch all these shows and really see what you were all talking
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.260]   about 30 years ago.
[01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.360]   I could see you with a Jack Bauer bag.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.200]   Just pulling out stuff.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.640]   All right.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:24.640]   So good.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.840]   Well, I'm looking forward to seeing it.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:31.160]   I, you know, I mean, the good news is it's getting a lot of buzz, although anything that
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.760]   happens with Star Trek would get a lot of buzz.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760]   Sorry.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.640]   Do you do the, the Vard, you do the fan conventions?
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.640]   I do.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.360]   I do a couple of a couple of year.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360]   What's that like?
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.360]   Oh, it's, it's fantastic.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.000]   You could be honest with us.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.400]   You don't have to, nobody listening would care if you did.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.200]   Here's the real deal.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.320]   I'm a fan of Star Trek.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.920]   When I was a kid, science, facial literature was what I used.
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:01.080]   You kind of sound like Shatner when you said I'm a fan of Star Trek.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.320]   I think there's a little inner Shatner in all of us.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.600]   Yeah, it's definitely.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.640]   But Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future was one that I found myself represented in.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.000]   And so it was very close to my heart.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.040]   I was a huge fan of seeing Michelle Nichols as a Senator who wrote on the, on the, on the
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.040]   bridge of the original enterprise.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040]   Me too.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.120]   So, so I'm a fan.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:24.920]   So going to a Star Trek convention, I understand from an insider's perspective as well as from
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.600]   a fan perspective, it's, it's all good.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.680]   The thing, and I've said this before, but the thing that's really true is the, the vision
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:36.960]   of the future that people like Asimov, the sci-fi authors, it, it, envisioned really
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.000]   influences what actually happens in the future because I've talked to many scientists.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.160]   They all, like you, Levar grew up reading this stuff.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.720]   They decided on their career based on this stuff.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.000]   They decided we're going to the Mars.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.880]   We're going to the moon because of it.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.480]   So really these, these creators, these authors, these visionaries are really telling us where
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.580]   we're going.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:01.380]   The origins of the flip phone as, as a technology device.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.240]   So right back to Star Trek.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.480]   That's exactly when I got that first flip phone, I said, be me up, Scotty.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.480]   Everybody does everybody.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:09.480]   Yes.
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.480]   The freak.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.300]   But Levar, do you have, do you have the L cars, iPhone apps?
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.060]   You see, I have the L cars.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.900]   No, there's, there's like three or four L cars.
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.900]   You know what?
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.660]   But yeah, no, I, I don't have them on my phone.
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:24.460]   That's a little too much.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:28.260]   I have the visor in, in my house and do you other start, I do.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.260]   I have the visor.
[01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:32.500]   Was there only one or were there, there was the one that I wore and then there was the
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.900]   stunt visor that, that, that the stunt title.
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:39.260]   Who's nerdy here?
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.260]   You are well.
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.260]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:45.940]   I think well, well is certainly a master of the, of the tech genre.
[01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.420]   Um, and he's also a fantastic writer.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.420]   Yeah, he really is.
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.220]   And his blog is fantastic.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.220]   Well, it's luminous.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.220]   It's good.
[01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:54.740]   I've been wanting to get well on the show.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.740]   He just tweeted.
[01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:56.900]   He said, I think, I think I got a call.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.220]   Leo get on the show.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.660]   Sometimes maybe you and Will could come on together and that would be a, there'd be
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:05.340]   a lot of nerds out there going, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.
[01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:10.140]   You know, I actually, Colleen has, it has the Enochia and 800, the Twitnoki and 800 and
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.380]   it has L cars in her face on it.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.780]   She put an L cars in her face on it.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:14.780]   So there you go.
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.500]   We actually, I'm actually sitting in front of an L cars in her face.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.500]   God bless.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.060]   She's proud of that.
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:22.060]   She's representing.
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.660]   Levar, I'm so glad we could have you on the show.
[01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:25.660]   Thank you so much.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:26.660]   Please come back.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:27.660]   It's been a gas.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.060]   I've loved every moment of it, Leo.
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.060]   I really have.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:32.980]   Well, we've loved every moment of having you.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:34.540]   Make sure you follow Levar on Twitter.
[01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:38.140]   It's L-E-V-A-R-B-U-R-T-O-N.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.700]   It is not a Ben Vereen.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.700]   It is not.
[01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.540]   What was that?
[01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:46.780]   Was that Intel captioned a picture of you Ben Vereen?
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.780]   It was.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.780]   And you'd be surprised how often that happens.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.780]   That's Vereen.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.780]   You know what?
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.780]   It's all good.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.780]   It's all good.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.940]   Well, you're a real gentleman to put up with you.
[01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.420]   But it's fun to follow Levar.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:00.580]   You just started on Twitter a few days ago, right?
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.820]   I just passed the holidays.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:06.780]   It was actually, you know, Twitter, the whole idea came to me from the fan base.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:11.060]   It was brought to my attention that there was a Levar Burton on Twitter that there was
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.340]   some controversy as to whether or not it was me, but they were engaging in some questionable
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:18.460]   banter of inappropriate content.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:22.460]   And I looked into it and then just asked them to remove him.
[01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.820]   And I lurked for a minute and I decided to jump in.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:26.820]   And now I'm in.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.020]   I just, I love it.
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.180]   I think it's fantastic.
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.900]   You are in 6,459 followers.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.180]   Still looking to catch Greg Greenberg.
[01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.500]   Who's Greg Greenberg?
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.100]   He's JJ's best friend in fact.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.660]   And he's beating you Levar?
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.660]   That's not right.
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.660]   Oh, he's from Eros.
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.660]   He's not right.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.660]   That's not right.
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:47.660]   Oh my goodness.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:50.860]   Colleen also has the L cars interface on her G1.
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:55.580]   That's the tri-c- Oh, it's the tri-quarter app on her on her Android phone.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.580]   So look at that.
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.820]   It looks like there's no life readings in here.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.980]   I don't, that's very strange.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.900]   I don't know how that's possible.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.100]   Go to Twitter.
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:05.180]   He's got 6,459 followers right now.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:09.580]   I'd like to get him to 6,460 followers before the end of this show.
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:10.580]   Can we do it?
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.580]   Let's see.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.420]   Will you be followers?
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.420]   6,460.
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.380]   Levar, thank you so much.
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.380]   I would be well.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.100]   He's already at 6,500 now.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.900]   Oh, all right.
[01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.400]   I have to refresh.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.400]   What are you working on?
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.380]   Any projects you want to share with us?
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:30.220]   Just finished a movie up in Canada called "Take it in Broad Daylight."
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.220]   It's a lifetime movie.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.660]   It'll be out in February.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:38.020]   The feature that I did last year reached for me will be in theaters this year.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:42.020]   And I've got two other film projects that I'm working on and we'll have announcements
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:45.340]   soon about when we will go into production.
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.340]   Excellent.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.340]   Great to have you on.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.340]   Thank you so much for joining us, Levar.
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:50.180]   We really have a huge pleasure.
[01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:53.020]   Also, Lisa Bettany, who came all the way from Canada.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.260]   On a boat.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:55.260]   On a boat.
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:00.140]   It took hours and hours and hours, mostlyleesa.com.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.140]   We need some help.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:06.860]   Ev Williams and the Twitter crew, somebody has hijacked mostly Lisa on Twitter.
[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.380]   She's got Lisa Bettany on Twitter.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:14.180]   All I S A B E T T A N Y. But let's get that mostly Lisa back.
[01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.740]   Her blog is mostlyleesa.com.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.100]   That's where you should go to see great pictures.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.260]   She's a wonderful photographer.
[01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:20.700]   She appears on this week at photography frequently.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:29.300]   She's also a great videographer, crazy videos and a blogger and has cats.
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:30.300]   Or is it a dog?
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.140]   I'm not allowed either.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.300]   But I do have a seal.
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.300]   A seal puppet.
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.300]   That's good.
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.300]   That's good.
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.060]   I'll take anything at this point.
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.060]   JohnC.evorac.org/blog.
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.820]   Make sure you go to channeldevorac.com.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.540]   That's his place on the web.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.700]   On the interwebs, he's got all that stuff linked there, right John?
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:56.340]   Yeah, it looks like it.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:59.980]   We had the fight to get PC Magazine to do their RSS feeds, right?
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:02.140]   They weren't doing it right?
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.780]   Well, they're using the problem.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.260]   I think a lot of these big companies are using these.
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.500]   These huge and expensive content management systems.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.500]   Like Vignette?
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500]   Are they still using Vignette?
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   I don't know if they are or not.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.820]   But whatever the case was it, it malforms the RSS feeder, leaves something out like
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.940]   in this case the date.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:25.940]   And it's almost like amateur hour with these massive content managers that these big publications
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:26.940]   use.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.740]   They should just stop printing that magazine.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.460]   Just go online and sell off the rest of the print.
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.620]   Oh wait a minute, they did.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.620]   Hey.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.620]   Hey.
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:36.620]   Hey.
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:40.980]   Ryan Block is very kind to be on this show because he is exhausted as everybody is who
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.740]   goes to CES.
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:46.100]   I always appreciate having me on that.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:47.100]   We love having you on.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.740]   In fact, I sent a note to your partner Peter and I hope we can get you both on at some
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:54.500]   point talking about stuff.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.460]   Peter couldn't make it today, but we'll get Peter Rohan soon.
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.100]   gdgt.com, the site that never emerges.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:06.220]   It's been a couple of months.
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.580]   I know, but you know, this is good.
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:09.580]   This is good.
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.580]   People want it.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:11.580]   They're demanding it.
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.940]   They're saying, give us gdgt.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.740]   What I can't call it gadget.
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.740]   Give us gdgt.
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.940]   Can I give us gdgt?
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.100]   I've only been gone out of a gadget for a couple of months.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.100]   We're still working out.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.220]   We actually, we just recently said we're going to try to try our best to have it out
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:26.700]   in a Q1 of this year, so the next couple of months.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:29.820]   But you know, in the meantime, we've got our, we've got our little show.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:30.820]   Podcast is great.
[01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.820]   And just teasing you.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.660]   Podcast is fantastic.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:37.060]   You know that everybody loves gdgt and your CES coverage is excellent.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.700]   So make sure you listen.
[01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:42.340]   Peter and Ryan gdgt.com.
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:43.340]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:47.500]   Oh, I should give everybody the real, the Twitters, the Lvar Burton, Lisa Bettany, the
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.980]   real Devorak.
[01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.660]   Ryan, you're your full name, Ryan Block.
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:52.660]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:57.340]   I am once again back to fourth place CNN.
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.340]   They're back.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.660]   Sons of guns hate them.
[01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:04.260]   So please, if you haven't followed me lately, follow me again.
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:06.900]   I promise I'll say something interesting.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.900]   Another Twit.
[01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:20.980]   This is in the can.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:21.980]   We used to do that on the screen.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:27.140]   Did you ever do that Lvar on Star Trek where you do a tooth check?
[01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.940]   A tooth check, how so?
[01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.340]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:32.340]   After lunch.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:33.340]   After lunch.
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.340]   Oh, yes.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.980]   And you'd say, hey, Will, anything in my teeth there?
[01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:37.980]   Exactly.
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:44.100]   And because of the visor, Jordy was always able to see much more than he really wanted.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.740]   He could sense thousand island dressing miles away.
[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:49.580]   Zootikave, very unattractive.
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:21:04.860]   I'm going to do it.
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.860]   Do it.
