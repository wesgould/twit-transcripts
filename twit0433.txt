[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.440]   But if I might, I'd like to also ask you,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.680]   while you're watching Twit, and it's going to take you just
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.640]   about the same amount of time as this Twit did,
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.320]   I want you to fill out the Twit survey.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.760]   Would you?
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080]   twit.tv/survey so we can better know you and what you are
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520]   interested in on our network.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.080]   twit.tv/survey.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.600]   Start now.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.640]   You might be over before we end this show.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.280]   Let's get Twit on the road.

[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.500]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech to show the covers of
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.220]   the week's Tech News and boy, every week I say this.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.420]   But I'm sincere.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.100]   This is a great panel this week.
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.260]   I'm really excited.
[00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.700]   Starting all the way over on my right here, we got
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.860]   Cedric Ingrand from France, from TF1.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.580]   He's the host of Planet Crenn, which is a
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.260]   widescreen, big screen.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.300]   It means full screen.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.740]   Full screen.
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.380]   And as I usually do, I brought wine when I come to the show.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.020]   Sorry, I couldn't be in Pelume.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.060]   Now, having a wonderful, wonderful, good,
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.900]   all the way through the show.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.060]   Those are my favorite.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.420]   I'll bring some over next time.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.740]   That or a Bordeaux?
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.180]   Eh, I'm more of a Coudurongan.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.180]   All right, all right.
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.500]   That was fighting words.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.540]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.580]   I never fight with a Frenchman over wine.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.420]   You can't win.
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.380]   And it annoys the Frenchman.
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.580]   Were you in Japan recently?
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.500]   I seem to think that I saw pictures from Japan.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.020]   Yeah, a path is good for that.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.620]   I was in Japan a lot because there were two or three events.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.500]   There was the PlayStation launch at Tokyo Game Show in
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.660]   late September.
[00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.580]   Then there was C-Tech, which is like the Japanese CES, which
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.860]   is always fun because a third of the show is devoted to
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.500]   components, so there's a lot to browse through.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.580]   And last week was InterB, the big--
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.300]   it's like the Japanese NAB, the broadcast show, and we went
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.500]   there to also the startups because there's actually now
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.380]   Japanese startups that are doing very much OK of broad.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.940]   That's interesting.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.900]   I want to talk about that some more because that's counter
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.460]   to what one thinks about Japan.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.500]   They're great at imitation.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.820]   They are a great at process, but not so great at innovation.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.340]   So I'd love to hear more about that.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.700]   But first, let's say hi to Brian Brushwood from NSFW.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.620]   Well, Leo.
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.100]   BB Show.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.260]   From the very chilly Texas, we're under a winter storm
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.180]   advisory, so if I lose my connection, it means a--
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.300]   I don't know, a branch fell on a fiber optic cable somewhere.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.540]   Oh, no.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.100]   It's like 33 degrees outside.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.620]   What?
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.100]   And raining all weekend.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.420]   In Austin?
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.380]   Wow.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.660]   Does it ever snow in Petaluma?
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.820]   You ever get any of the cold weather?
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.380]   It snowed once back in '07, I think.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.780]   Maybe it was '06, but no, no, not very often.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.780]   Enough so to--
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.980]   It's so funny to me.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.180]   The odd thing-- everyone tried to say it during the time,
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.020]   and it felt too weird.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.780]   But now that that decades behind us,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.260]   I feel more comfortable saying the odds.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.020]   You can say it.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.820]   The odds.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.380]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.500]   He was talking about 20 odd 7-0.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.140]   Yeah, I am.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.740]   No, that's right.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.740]   Not in 1907.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.740]   I wasn't here then.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.740]   We didn't move here till later.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.820]   But yes, odd 7--
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.700]   that's Jerry Pournell's cackling,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.580]   because he does remember odd 7.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.420]   My problem is that I grew up odd 7.
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.020]   I mean odd 7.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.220]   Right, right.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.220]   I'm only 19, exactly.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.940]   There's no catch it on to the fact that you meant 20 of us.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.100]   But it's another odd.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.020]   Exactly, Jerry.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.860]   Isn't that great?
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.740]   You've lived long enough to see two odds.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.100]   No, I didn't.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.300]   Or at least no of two odds.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.020]   I didn't see, but no of them.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.100]   I grew up thinking odd 7.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.860]   I meant 19 odd 7.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.620]   No, I'm not that old.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.820]   And I may be the old man of the sea,
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.620]   but I'm not quite that old.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.220]   I absolutely not.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.100]   Although I have to admit, it is a little weird when you think
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.580]   about the songs, The Oldies of Today, which
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.220]   were from 1994, 20 years ago.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.020]   And the Oldies, when I was a kid,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.820]   were actually from the '40s and the '50s.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.820]   It really kind of puts everything in perspective.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.580]   And also, let's say, Hidalary Maggad from CBS Radio.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.540]   It's great to have you as well.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.540]   This is a panel of experts in every possible realm.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.540]   Great to have you all.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.540]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.420]   I'm here.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.940]   So, boy, I don't know where to start.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.460]   I guess we could talk about something
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.220]   that bridges all generations.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.740]   Game consoles.
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.740]   No?
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.460]   I mean, you say that jokingly.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.140]   But if there ever was a game console that can bridge
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.580]   generations, I mean, that's what Xbox One is banking on.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.860]   You notice that to the chagrin of gamers,
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.700]   they didn't cater to the hardcore gaming audience at E3.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.020]   They pissed them off by saying, we're
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.060]   going to be the console that pretty much rules
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.060]   your living room.
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.460]   We're going to let you watch TV, talk to your friends via Skype,
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.580]   do exercises with Xbox One fitness.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.020]   And while that seemed like a bad strategy at the time,
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.100]   in the bubble of hyper gamers, now that the Xbox is coming out,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.980]   like the press seems to be generally very positive
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.980]   on those features.
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.660]   Well, yeah.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.700]   I would say that the Xbox, as it's coming out now,
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.020]   is kind of a continuation of what Gates's dream always was,
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.900]   that he was going to computerize your whole life.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.460]   And that was the means of doing it
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.580]   by taking over your entertainment center, all of it.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.100]   Right.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.980]   Yeah, that wasn't always Microsoft's slogan.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.300]   It was written in the sidewalks in Redmond,
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.020]   a computer in every home running Microsoft software.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.260]   It didn't necessarily say running Microsoft software.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.020]   But I remember--
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.180]   I think that was the implication, though.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.380]   Well, it wasn't.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.900]   When I first met Bill, it was at the Southern California
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.140]   Computer Club meeting at Harvard School here in Studio City.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.660]   And he was about 18 at the time.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.660]   And his major concern was that people were
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.380]   pirating his paper tape copies of Microsoft Basic.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.340]   But even then, he was talking about a computer
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:43.260]   in every home and in every office and in every classroom.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.900]   Now, that doesn't sound like much of a dream nowadays.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.740]   He got it.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.980]   But I gathered for it that in 1977 or thereabouts,
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.540]   that was a really far out vision of the world.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.060]   Right.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.420]   And it was before we envisioned a computer in every pocket,
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.300]   which, of course, is what we have today with the classroom.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.660]   Yeah, computers everywhere.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.900]   But clearly, the living room was always the battle.
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.460]   Remember, Intel tried to conquer the living room.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.860]   And I don't know how many CESs or Condexs ago.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.020]   It's always been the dream.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.180]   And Intel came out with living room computers.
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.060]   Everybody came out with living room computers.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.620]   Google still is.
[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.380]   Yet, Microsoft and Sony, in a sense,
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.020]   have done it through game consoles.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.940]   Those are the living room computers
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.900]   that have actually caught on.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.660]   And you're absolutely right that it's not just about gaming.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.780]   It's about exercise, about conversation,
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.260]   it's about streaming video.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.340]   The dream is that that becomes your set-top box.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.220]   And maybe your only set-top box, if Microsoft
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.220]   has a set-top box.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.220]   And you're not going to be able to get it away.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.220]   Brian, have you used-- have you been playing with it?
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.220]   Who has played with it?
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.220]   I have the Xbox.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   Why don't you have been playing with it?
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.220]   Brian?
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.220]   Well, I have not gotten hands-on with it,
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.220]   so I can only speculate.
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.380]   But one of the things I really did like about the things I've seen so far is the potential
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.420]   ubiquity of their method of handling Skype.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.540]   Because they're such a high-resolution camera on the Xbox One,
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.980]   it has the ability to use software zoom on different individuals in the room.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.260]   And it recognizes, essentially, the skeleton of each individual.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.540]   And if there's two people, it's like, all right, let me frame this so that both the people,
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.900]   the person in the foreground and in the background are in there.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:17.220]   And I was thinking about it, and you probably know more about this than me, Leo, like traditionally
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:24.500]   for a telepresence setup, for real-time conversations with one group of people in Tokyo and another
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   group of people in New York, you're looking at $500 plus for one of those setups back
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.500]   in the day, right?
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.300]   Oh, yeah, tens of thousands of dollars on some in-room conferencing systems.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.140]   So Skype is a big breakthrough.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.140]   And I think you're right.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:43.140]   I think this could actually be used in business for $500 is an in-room conferencing system.
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.380]   It's very good quality.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.020]   It certainly can right now, but certainly you will.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:55.860]   I mean, the setup we have here is obviously beyond what Xbox can do to have four different
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.340]   people on four different lines.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:05.580]   But I would not think that many years away that it will just be a part of what you've
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.580]   got and it will be built in and everybody can have a multi-line conference if that's
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.580]   what they want.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.580]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:17.740]   You could do Google Hangout on Xbox if they, if Google wanted to support that and you could
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.500]   have up to 10 people having a conversation like this.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.940]   I'm very impressed overall by the Xbox One.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.740]   It's better than I thought when I've played with both now and it's pretty clear to me
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.500]   that the PlayStation 4 is really a game machine.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.740]   It wasn't merely the E3 demos.
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.540]   This really was what happened is that Sony said we're going for the game and we're going
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.180]   to make the best possible game machine.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.340]   And as gamers pointed out quickly, the specs are somewhat better on the Sony PlayStation
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.020]   4.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:54.180]   The Xbox One Microsoft kind of to people's surprise, at least in its original announcement,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.620]   focused on what you could do with media.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.620]   And you can talk to it.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.460]   It's almost what I thought the Apple TV might be where I can get, walk into the room, I can
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.020]   say Xbox turn on.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.740]   It's always listening.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.420]   It turns on and also turns on my AV receiver, my cable box.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.460]   It doesn't recognize my TV, but in most TVs it would also turn on the TV.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.860]   It then the connect camera sees you, recognizes you and logs you in.
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.420]   You're going to have up to six people with accounts.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.140]   The camera recognition is quite good and it's a little eerie to see a picture of me with
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.180]   my name and a bubble floating over my head.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.220]   So tell me this, Leo, like one of the things that intrigues me, and I haven't been hands
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.540]   on with this, but I am shocked at how many things over the last year or two I have started
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.540]   to ask Siri to do on my iPhone rather than open myself.
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.300]   Even though, like for example, call my wife just because it takes less time than opening,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.460]   finding and that kind of thing.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.460]   Do you find yourself immediately using the voice interface on the Xbox to find things
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.980]   like Netflix or any of the other?
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.980]   It's a lot like Siri in the sense that it seems like a great thing and then in practice
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.980]   it's not.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.900]   Of course, my connect is sitting on my center channel speaker, so there's a lot of other
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.980]   stuff going on, but you can in theory say Xbox watch HBO, it knows where HBO is on my
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.220]   system and changes the channel to it.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.380]   That actually works.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:20.180]   You could say Xbox pause and it will pause when I'm watching Xbox rewind, Xbox play.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.140]   Those things do work.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.820]   And always listening is a big difference to what Siri does and what the Xbox does.
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.260]   You don't have to press the button or do anything.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.820]   It's like, "Okay, Google now."
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.700]   Yeah, I've got to Google Nexus 5, I don't know if you can see it too well, which is
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.620]   running KitKat.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.660]   And I find myself using it all the time.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.180]   I mean, I'm surprised at how often I tell the phone what I want to do rather than type
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.660]   it in, especially when I'm driving, of course, when you really are not supposed to be touching
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.660]   it.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.100]   But even at home or walking around, I'm finding voice commands to really when they
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.940]   work and when you can depend on them.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.900]   If you kind of can on the KitKat and this phone, they're enormously helpful.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.460]   When they don't work, like with Siri on my iPhone, it works maybe 70% of the time if
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.460]   I'm lucky.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.460]   And that's not enough, it seems to be.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.140]   Just enough failure rate to get me not to want to do it.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.140]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.860]   That's been my experience with Siri.
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.700]   It works just enough to make it intriguing, but it really isn't something you can rely
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.700]   on.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:30.020]   But that's this step, you will understand, I think, that if jobs had not got sick and been
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.180]   dying for the last two years of his life, I think you might see something like Xbox
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.180]   on Apple now.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.020]   Yeah, I know I agree with you.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.060]   Although didn't Apple try, I don't remember if it was under Steve, I think it wasn't the
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.060]   Pippin.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.460]   Remember, they had a game, they had a wedge into the living room that did not take off.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.460]   But it wasn't good enough.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:56.100]   It wasn't anything that jobs allowed when his return, basically.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.620]   But I think that had he lived, he would be into that now.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.980]   Oh, I think that's what he was alluding to.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.420]   I think the last big of the mission that he...
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.860]   Oh, look at the Apple TV, never fulfilled its promise.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.580]   Maybe it will someday, but it isn't even close.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.620]   I actually like the Roku, which is you can buy them for 50 bucks to start with better
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.700]   than I like the Apple TV.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.620]   I think they've actually nailed it for a long time.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.580]   You know, the Xbox does much of what the Roku does.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.260]   It does everything I need it to do, which is Netflix, Amazon, it does YouTube, which
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.980]   the Roku does not do.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.140]   And it does, it does, unfortunately, Xbox, music, not Pandora or any of the other music
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.140]   players.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.460]   But all of that is voice commanded, which I think is an always on voice command.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.820]   So if you're in the living room and you're talking to your TV, it seems to work pretty
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.820]   well.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.900]   I think this is a very interesting first attempt.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.580]   It's not clearly not done.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.580]   Oh, it's...
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.380]   Leo, I got a question for you.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.380]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.660]   So Leo, have you had the chance to try out any of the Xbox Live fitness programs?
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.220]   Because if you have an Xbox Live Gold account, which of course you have to pay for, you have
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.220]   a...
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.140]   There's P90X, there's Insanity, there's the Gillian What's Her Name thing.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:11.660]   There's all of these that essentially grade you on your ability to follow along with the
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:17.500]   video and post your results, but more importantly, they're able to basically watch the skin tone
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.500]   of your body.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   It's gonna be amazing.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.500]   I haven't tried those yet.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   Well, what your pulse rate is.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.500]   I'll do that tomorrow.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.900]   How did it do with somebody 80 years old?
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.620]   Well, there's only one way to find out, Jerry.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.420]   Let's get to the end of this.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.260]   No, I'm going to.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:39.340]   I already have a message for one of my subscribers who's a heart physician saying, "Go get one
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.340]   now."
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.340]   Wow.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:46.780]   Well, the only thing I've used is that they have Connect Rivals, which is a sports program,
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.020]   and there's a beta of that.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.700]   The thing I do like, and so I've done a limited amount of it, but the thing I do like is the
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.660]   old Connect on the Xbox 360, I had to move furniture because you have to get far back
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   from it, or it wouldn't work.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.820]   It seems like you stand right in front of the TV.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   It's much better angle.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.820]   It's much better.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:11.820]   It's much better.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.820]   I didn't expect that.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   You're laughing.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.180]   That is, but it is you that some raise is a privacy issue.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.260]   Here I have in my living room a camera that's apparently always on and a microphone that's
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.260]   always on.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.260]   Should I be concerned?
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.500]   And the metal picture you have just generated in our heads.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.620]   I did that for the NSA.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.620]   Let's move along.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.460]   The next step here is really to find all these functions inside the TV.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.180]   You were mentioning Apple TV.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.740]   We are still to see what the last big thing that Steve Jobs worked on is going to turn
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.220]   that to be, which is an actual TV.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:53.140]   I had someone on a podcast we do here, an ex VP at Apple, the head of Apple, or Apple
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.620]   Europe, saying, "Yeah, he didn't say, "Yeah, it's coming out," but he said, "Yeah, we
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.620]   need to wait."
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.380]   The problem I have with that, Cedric, is that TVs are expensive.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.860]   So you spent two grand for a TV, which is what you pay for a nice big screen.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.540]   Two years from now, whatever that technology is, it's built into any of these smart TVs
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.540]   is going to be old.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.140]   Isn't it better to just spend a hundred bucks every couple of years to buy a new set top
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.660]   box rather than having to buy a brand new screen?
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.300]   Absolutely, except that.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   And Steve said that.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.700]   It sucks to be, if you're a device, it sucks to be HDMI 1.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.780]   You want to be there when you turn the TV on.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.540]   You want to be the main interface.
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.460]   You want to be what sits between the user and all the experiences.
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.580]   And that's what none of these guys are really, I mean, it's full.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:46.260]   I wish Samsung would come out maybe next CES with better voice recognition and they actually
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.980]   tell you what you need to watch based on what you've already watched.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:55.700]   This needs to get way better or it will leave some place for the apples and microsoft and
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.860]   googles to actually come up with something.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.940]   It has to be upgradable.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.900]   I don't know how often you guys replace your TV sets, but in my case, I still got a 20
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.380]   year old Sony, a Trinitron in one of my rooms, but I don't replace my TV every couple of
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.580]   years where I replace almost every other piece of technology that I use.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.660]   Samsung TV that has a breakout box, all the electronics are in the separate box.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.460]   This TV also has a Skype camera.
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.060]   Skype is built into it and has a lot of smart software built into it.
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.460]   And in fact, even the remote control has a microphone and it takes voice commands.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.540]   I don't find it anywhere near as sophisticated.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.540]   And I think companies like Samsung and Panasonic, Visio, LG, Sharp, all of these companies are
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.580]   not as good at software as they are at hardware.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.220]   Whereas Microsoft is a software company.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.500]   I think an Apple is a software company and these guys are, I think, are doing a better
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   job.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.220]   This is the whole problem with building stuff into TV.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:55.980]   It's one thing that the iPod got smaller and smaller from the mini to the nano to essentially
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.860]   invisible when it became part of your phone.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.060]   But I don't feel like the same thing's going to happen with televisions.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.100]   With mobile phones, we replace that every year or two.
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.500]   With televisions, there's usually a seven year replacement cycle on there.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.780]   So if you're going to tie yourself to a software platform and a hardware platform of whether
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:20.020]   it be Roku or Boxy or any of these things built into a display, I think it's a fool's
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.020]   errand.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.900]   Consumers only want one thing and ask for their monitors to display, to display exquisitely
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.060]   awesome content.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.060]   And that's it.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.900]   Everything else should be external from the display.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.900]   I agree.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.060]   So how often do you think that they will upgrade the Xbox?
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.580]   Well, that's the way every seven or eight years actually.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.380]   No, well, hardware, but software.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.380]   It's a PC.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.700]   I mean, let's, let's be honest.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.780]   This is a PC.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.540]   It won't play a Blu-ray disc.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:50.820]   Well, but, but it's happened to the old this, that, that new Xbox is something you couldn't
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.740]   have bought in anything three years ago.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:58.460]   Oh, I agree, but it's, but it's still fundamentally a PC with a hard drive with firmware with
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.020]   a CPU with an optical drive.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.780]   And in fact, when you want to play a Blu-ray disc, it has a Blu-ray disc.
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.780]   Thank God.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.460]   When you want to play it, you have to download the Blu-ray player and install it just like
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.460]   it very much feels like a PC.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.860]   And so you are getting upgrades, but software upgrades all the time, I'm sure.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.220]   Well, and, and keep an idea.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.020]   The original Xbox and go ahead, Brian.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.020]   Go ahead, Jerry.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.020]   No, you go ahead.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.020]   I just had a thought.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:29.940]   I was just going to point out that the Xbox, especially the Xbox 360, we saw a number of
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.180]   revisions as over time.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.940]   We saw the Xbox live interface change to something closely resembling the formerly known as
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.180]   Metro interface.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:43.180]   We saw the hardware get better with the Xbox slim and the black Xbox.
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:49.500]   In many ways, the Xbox one is not a revolution, but an iterative evolution of this unit.
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.420]   And the fact that that the Xbox one defines the new platform moving forward, I guarantee
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.980]   you in three years, we're going to see a slimmer interface, a slimmer design for the whole
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.980]   thing.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.020]   We're going to see software upgrades to the way you interact with it.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.500]   It will be very PC like in that everything will be iterative.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.700]   And that if there's a complaint you have about the new Xbox one, it's that it's not
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.380]   a revolution to which I say good.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.380]   That means Microsoft understands that evolution is the answer, not revolution.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.380]   Go ahead, Jerry.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.380]   You always have.
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:27.780]   That is both the pain and the glory of Microsoft, the thing that they've been criticized for
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.700]   the most is not being revolutionary.
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.020]   And at the same time, over time, they have been revolutionary.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:40.140]   Do you remember when Gates finally decided that the Internet was important and launched
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.380]   Internet Explorer at that conference up in San Francisco?
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.060]   95, 94 something like that.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.860]   Somewhere in there and he said, you know, well, one thing about it is the price is right.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.860]   Free.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.860]   You there?
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.260]   I was there.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:59.180]   Not only was I there, but then I went on the site, which was our MSNBC show.
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:05.140]   And I said, sell your Netscape stock because Microsoft is giving this sucker away.
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.140]   Okay.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.140]   Well, I said the same thing.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.460]   And Mark and Driesin saw it and came running down the hall.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.100]   I'm told and said, who the hell is this Leo LePorte guy?
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.100]   But I was right.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.780]   Where were we a year or two later Netscape had a throw on the tell.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.900]   They could not compete as a paid product.
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.700]   That's what I said in the first byte column that I did immediately after after Bill's
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.700]   talk.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:31.500]   It was clear once he turned his attention on it, he was going to influence the Internet
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.100]   in ways that nobody else ever had.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:42.540]   But he was still alive and and and dreaming his company then he's lost interest in that
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.540]   now.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:52.820]   The question earlier was how rapidly will the soft will the hardware make itself obsolete?
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.020]   Moore's law is continuing.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:00.260]   And when you double when you're already at 50 X and you double to 100 X and then you
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.980]   double it 200 X, at what point can you just finally say, that's good enough?
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.620]   I don't ever need to upgrade the hardware anymore.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.460]   I think I think we've already seen that, which is the answer is 1080p.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.900]   Keep in mind that when you go to the movie theater and you see a movie that's allegedly
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.700]   on a 4K projector odds are it's in 2K, which is slightly more than 1080p.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.500]   We don't notice that that's the same display that we have in our home computers or in our
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.460]   home box office or whatever on our televisions.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.380]   And what we're seeing is that increase in processor power is being used in ancillary
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.020]   ways that I think are fantastic for the home consumer.
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.100]   The fact that we have the ability to casually mention, hey Xbox, bring up Netflix.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.100]   I don't know where it is.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.780]   Just find it and they can do it.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.780]   That's where that extra processor power is going.
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.460]   But you're absolutely right when in as far as they're diminishing returns in the visual
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.020]   fidelity of the video games that we're seeing.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.020]   No, I wasn't thinking.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.020]   Well, this is 4K ready.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.500]   Everything's 4K ready, right?
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:01.340]   No, I wasn't thinking the hardware of the screen.
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.500]   I'm talking about the Xbox itself.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:09.060]   I am in complete agreement with all of you that you don't want to replace your TV very
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.660]   often, but replacing the set top box is another story.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:19.020]   This was really odd about this category, Jerry, because the last Xbox was eight years ago.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:23.260]   The last PlayStation was what, also eight or nine years ago.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.060]   These devices have to last nearly a decade and that's unheard of in the PC industry.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.540]   Well, they have and that was why I was asking at what point is it good enough?
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:38.340]   I mean, upgrading the software I understand, but the upgrade to the...
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:47.140]   My picture of the future was essentially told in the Moten Gods Eye and the motor around
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:54.620]   Murchison's Eye with the computers they were using then, where Sally looked up at the ceiling
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:00.540]   and said, "Finch click, tell me what our engagements are next week."
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.100]   And went on talking to her husband.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.420]   I can do that to the phone right now, right?
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.060]   It's getting there and I'm saying it.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:14.820]   My picture where we're going is beyond that now, but still we're almost getting there
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.180]   and then describing that.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.260]   You think the hardware is going to last long enough that you just leave it that way?
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.860]   At what point is the hardware good enough?
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.860]   It's what I'm running for.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.100]   In the software, Jerry, it depends on whether the software evolves to the point.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.060]   No, no, the software will always rise up to use up all the capabilities.
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.860]   The capabilities of the hardware.
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.580]   It will take them a while, but they'll always do it.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.460]   There is one factor that I don't think is being considered here, which is we live in
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.700]   an age where cloud computing alters the processing power of your conduit.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:53.180]   So this way, as long as the Xbox One is fast enough to get your words to the cloud, as
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.700]   the cloud improves, your Xbox One magically improves.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.700]   That's an X-ray.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:02.540]   We're entering a world where there is a huge difference between a two-second response
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.300]   to a question and a half-second response to a question.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.500]   That is the kind of thing that the cloud will fix.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.580]   That's why mobile is so incredibly powerful.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.700]   Again, all these little devices we have in our pocket, they're really not that powerful
[00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.340]   and they don't have that much storage, but they have the cloud behind them.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.660]   That's Google's whole strategy.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.780]   You're not really the computer with some other computer that you're accessing.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.100]   And I remember how upset people were not changed.
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.220]   The ancient question we all started with back in the '80s.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:39.660]   How much do you want to have home and its yours and how much would you trust in distributed
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.220]   computing?
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.620]   My big reputation was made on saying you want to do it at home.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.100]   You don't want to trust.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.420]   You don't want to time share with somebody else.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.420]   Right.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.500]   Probably like you.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.740]   I assume you like you.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.260]   I got my start in time sharing.
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.260]   When I first started using a computer, it was a fairly dumb terminal at the time, a
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:08.140]   very powerful mainframe far away doing all the processing, doing all the storage.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.260]   And in many ways, it feels like back to the future.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.260]   That feels like the case.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:16.340]   There's a substantive difference though because today you have the processing power on both
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.340]   ends.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.380]   You have the storage on both ends and it's an interaction between two peers.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.140]   That was a client-server situation.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.340]   I think that we have a really substantive difference in cloud computing today.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.860]   Well, it's literally time sharing the CPU.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.460]   And you have a pretty nice, pronounced law was one user, at least one CPU.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.180]   And we have that now.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.180]   Maybe.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.660]   You have four CPUs on the cheapest computer out there.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:49.980]   I don't want to be, I love having my data available wherever I go.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.260]   That's the cloud and that's great.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.580]   But I also don't want to find myself unable to do anything if my connection to the cloud
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.580]   is broken.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.580]   Well, that's the really.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:05.900]   At least good enough in my hand that I can finish the scene I'm working on on my book
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.140]   without having to get to the cloud.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.460]   A big controversy on the Xbox One.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.700]   When they first announced it, they said always on internet was required and people were furious,
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.140]   but in fact, it makes sense.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.140]   Can I throw a thought experiment out there?
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:25.780]   In what way are we all like our grandparents who didn't trust indoor plumbing or didn't
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.540]   trust electricity?
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.660]   Like there is an acquisition phase where you become comfortable with the idea that I'm
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.660]   not going to rely.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:39.940]   But everyone of my grandparents not only trusted indoor plumbing, they wanted it real bad.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.540]   And that's just it.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.820]   Is I trust, I trust and want the cloud.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:52.540]   I believe that that that that comment strikes notwithstanding, we're going to have internet
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.540]   all the time.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.460]   So why don't we just plan on having internet all the time?
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.460]   Like it'll be.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.860]   You don't get Santa Ana wind very often do you?
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.660]   Well, when's that in right now?
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.660]   But I do.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:07.100]   I think I think Brian's got a point that we that if you want to make if we want to move
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.700]   forward, we're going to have to act as if I think there's a I think you could split the
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:12.700]   baby though.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.780]   Jerry, I think you can have as you do on a Chromebook sufficient functionality.
[00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.140]   Offline computing, you can get enough done that you don't feel like, well, this is a
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.020]   useless piece of metal.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.860]   But the cloud makes a big difference in going forward.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.300]   And so I can get my Gmail and my Chromebook and answer it offline.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.420]   But ultimately I need to connect.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.420]   Can we not assume that we're always going to be able to connect until the comment hits?
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:41.860]   Well, but always being able to connect doesn't mean always being able to connect right now
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.860]   is what I know.
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:48.380]   But if we can connect in the near time frame that's adequate on a Chromebook, for instance.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.700]   Well, yes and no.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.900]   I mean, you know, if it used to be, I would go off to a coffee shop with my laptop and
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.300]   I work on Microsoft Word and our Excel and I'd be happy as a clam.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.900]   Now, if I don't have connectivity, I can't work.
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:03.900]   I can't write.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:04.900]   I can't broadcast.
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.420]   I really can't do anything useful these days.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.460]   And sometimes we believe in say good.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.460]   I'm going to go take a walk.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.460]   And that's okay.
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.460]   That's okay.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:19.260]   I tend to tell stories and I can go on telling my story when I'm unconnected to the rest.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.300]   If I can get the story.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.660]   Now if I discover that my computer no longer knows what I've wrote in chapter three, well
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.660]   that would be bad.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.660]   That would be bad.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.100]   But you're not that's not asking a lot.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.060]   I think that's not for answer me this and this is something I'd love to just hear from
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   all you guys.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:43.700]   If you had to choose one utility to go out for, we'll say 48 hours, would it be water, wastewater,
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.780]   electricity or connectivity?
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:46.780]   Internet.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.300]   Like to me, Internet's not even an option.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.780]   No, what no way, man.
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.780]   Internet.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.780]   I don't know.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.780]   P in the bushes before I give up my internet.
[00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.780]   Come on.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.380]   No, Internet is the least important of those for you.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.380]   Just to start.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.940]   Oh, you're highly on your crazy.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.420]   Without water and electricity.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:09.940]   If you're talking 48 hours, no country is more than about six meals away from a revolution,
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.940]   you know.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:19.180]   Jerry observed that in the Lucifer's hammer that we don't anymore have a reserve of food.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.620]   We can't go more than about a week.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.500]   Well, we have come down to just in time inventory on Grocery.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.020]   It used to be that in the grocery store, there was a back room with at least as much
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.620]   food back there as there is out on the shelves.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.220]   Nowadays, you go on your local Ralph's, what you see is what they have.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.340]   They don't have anything in the back room.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.500]   You go up and you see they're out of this.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.540]   You ask the manager, can you get me some more of this coffee cream?
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.820]   And he says next week or tomorrow or tonight at midnight.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.980]   And the truck gets here.
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.220]   Really Brian, you think that you would rather be without sewage, without water, without
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.980]   electricity, as long as you had internet connectivity.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.380]   And you don't know what else I guarantee you.
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.260]   Dude, you know what else runs on Justin time inventory?
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.260]   What do you do?
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:12.500]   My brain, my liver, my heart, my lungs, the entire body runs on Justin time inventory.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.420]   Well, it's going to have to be good.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.780]   The more red blood cells are coming in.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.780]   That's what it means.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:23.380]   I don't have to be connected to me in order for it to work in your in your body.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:31.220]   Right, but the point is, is that is that we as as a giant bacterial organism who has
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.500]   who have taken charge of this petri dish we call the earth.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:38.540]   We as a team rely deeply on interconnectivity.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:43.740]   And to be honest, I would say if everybody had to start peeing in the bushes for a week
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.340]   or everybody or if or if an entire state is coming.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.180]   I'm worried about Mr. Brushwood.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:54.900]   That's why my point is one of those would cause a riot and it's not peeing in the bushes.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.700]   It's not the internet.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.500]   Oh, I guarantee you.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.820]   I'll turn off your water.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.900]   We'll see how long you can last, Mr. Brushwood.
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.900]   No, no, no.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.900]   You're electricity to see how long you can last.
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.900]   Well, let's see.
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.820]   He has a battery powered device with internet.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.940]   And he's you can play his you know, you can play your little plants versus zombies, but
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.140]   you got to pee in the bushes.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.060]   You can't drink any water.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.900]   You don't have any lights at night.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:18.900]   Come on, Brian.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:19.900]   I'm not going to take it.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.900]   And we're going to have a logical energy.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.900]   How much do you need to put gasoline?
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:29.780]   So, all right, we're going to take a break.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.020]   Go to your corners.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.020]   We'll come back with more of this.
[00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.020]   Achievement unlocked.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.460]   I got in a fight over technology with Jerry for now.
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.620]   This is the best day of my life.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:44.980]   This is this is the first cage match, Twit.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.460]   We're going to continue in just a moment.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.460]   This is fun.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.460]   And there's lots more to talk about.
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.460]   I showed it.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.460]   They brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.420]   If you're in the IT business, you know that being able to provide support is key remote
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.380]   access is just one part of the overall picture.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.620]   And of course, go to assist has always had the best remote access.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.260]   You're going to assist somebody on a PC with a Mac on a Mac with a PC on a mobile device
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.420]   with a mobile device.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:12.020]   You have complete flexibility up to eight sessions at once on a tenant support.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:18.260]   But there's more now go to assist is the ultimate and cloud based IT tools.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.380]   You've got the remote support.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:24.140]   You've got the service desk, which lets you keep track of what's going on.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.180]   Keep track of changes and incidents.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.620]   Always know release management.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:32.580]   You've got a knowledge center that branded knowledge center, white labeled so you can
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.460]   put your brand on it so they can go to the full self service portal and get the information
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.460]   they need.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:43.980]   You look like a real support hero, manage configurations and then add the monitoring module and you've
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:45.420]   got the ultimate situation.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.620]   You put the go to assist crawler on your client network.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.740]   You know all the hardware and software.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:54.300]   You could set up a dashboard that'll let you know what's going on.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:02.060]   You could be proactive, get alerts via instant message or SMS or email before there's a problem.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.860]   I just think this is the ultimate in cloud based toolkits.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.180]   And if you are in IT or software support, you need to know about it.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.180]   You could take it to the next level.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:14.220]   It can make you a true support hero and that's why we've arranged for a 30 day free trial.

[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.740]   Well, the fight between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is going to be very interesting to watch.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:02.740]   I have to, whoa, whoa, that doesn't look like a normal gun.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:06.980]   Oh, this is an HP laser jet.
[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.220]   Oh, man.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.900]   He's going to dissolve you in a million particles, Brian Brushwood.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.740]   I've got my Guinness and my flask.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.340]   That's all I have to defend against you, sir.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.900]   That's probably sufficient.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.500]   So, by the way, both sold a million in pre-orders in the first 24 hours.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.300]   I thought the Xbox One was a laggard in pre-orders, but it seems like they were roughly equal.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:33.300]   I mean, there was no way they were going to announce less than a million pre-orders after
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.300]   Sony set a million.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.300]   Right.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.300]   So, just, they had it.
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.900]   Keep in mind also that Xbox went worldwide.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:43.460]   That was part of the thing that they ambitiously had a worldwide release with 13 different countries,
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.180]   whereas PlayStation was only like two.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.100]   And so, so some, you know, a place, I don't understand this tribalism where it's like,
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.100]   look, man, I don't know.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.100]   Isn't it silly?
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.500]   It really is to me.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:58.340]   But then again, it's like, remember back what it's like to be 13 or 15 when you have
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.940]   limited resources, you can only convince your mom to buy one.
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:07.020]   And the one thing we dare not face is that we might possibly have made the wrong decision.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:12.820]   So as a result, the moment it's locked in, and you're talking to a guy who vehemently
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:17.020]   told everyone that the TurboGrafx-16 was better than the Sega Genesis because he had
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.020]   a TurboGrafx-16.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.020]   It's never been.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.780]   So, it's like, I understand where that comes from.
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.100]   It's as scarcity.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.620]   I'm very happy with the one.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.500]   And I feel like I'm going to be able to do a demo with the one.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.140]   We'll do this on Tuesday and before you buy that.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.140]   That will really impress.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.300]   Because you can have a game going, fade it to the back, snap stuff around, all with your
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   voice.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.780]   You really, it's a very fluid experience.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.780]   And it's very intriguing to me as...
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.460]   So do you think they did a...
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.940]   They did a better job on Xbox than they did on Windows 8?
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:42.940]   I mean, if this didn't...
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:43.940]   Oh, God, infinitely.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.540]   In fact, that's the irony of this, is that this is a...
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.380]   This feels like a mature operating system.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.540]   Windows 8 feels like an adolescent that like Microsoft's going through a very awkward
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.540]   growing period.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   Yeah, and they're kind of...
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.540]   Oh, they're wrong.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.540]   Yeah, isn't it ironic?
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.380]   The Xbox is in many ways the real success at Microsoft, I think.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.380]   Yeah, I know.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.380]   It's very ironic.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.540]   Nokia shareholders have approved the Microsoft deal.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.700]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:17.100]   I think they still have to get Finnish and US regulatory approval.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.500]   And here it is, the Nokia...
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   This is...
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.420]   There are only two hardware devices running Windows RT.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.420]   And this is one of them.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:30.500]   It's the Nokia 2520 compared to the Microsoft Surface 2, very similar in many ways.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   A real missing point on the 2520 is that the keyboard isn't ready yet.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.940]   So you're basically buying a tablet.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.740]   That explains why they didn't send me a keyboard.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.740]   There's no keyboard.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.740]   I try to review the thing without a keyboard.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.740]   Well, I think that's the native way.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.740]   It's a tablet, right?
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.260]   It's supposed to be keyboard only, right?
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.260]   With the Surface, I never use the Surface without the keyboard.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.260]   Right.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.260]   Well, as soon as you get in the desktop...
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.100]   It's not worth waiting for that then.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.500]   It's not a bad tablet.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.860]   If you want an RT tablet, it's reasonable in each of the 1.35 pounds.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:02.860]   It's okay.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:11.660]   My granddaughter's parents did not want her to have an iPad until just now.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.300]   I can finally get her one for Christmas.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.900]   Why were they held as your granddaughter?
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.980]   She's 13.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.460]   And I don't get me started on that one.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.420]   I would have called her one when she was nine if they'd let me do it.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.580]   I had somebody call me on the radio show and ask me, "Should I get my one-year-old
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.580]   a Nexus or an iPad?"
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.580]   Yeah, one more one-year-old.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.020]   I'm more on the side than this, but after all...
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.020]   I would say a baby bottle.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.900]   She's their kid, not mine.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.460]   She's only my grandchild.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.460]   Right.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.460]   I want to get...
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.860]   And she wants the Surface rather than an iPad.
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   Really?
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.140]   Now, she thinks it's more versatile and she can get more done with it.
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.620]   Now, I'm going to get her what she wants, but I'd like commentary from you guys.
[00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:02.020]   We had a 13-year-old daughter who's in the top of her classes and is obviously headed
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.060]   for university education.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.220]   What would you get her when she was that age?
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.940]   I would find out what they're using at school and what are peer-of-views.
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:13.740]   I mean, the advantage of the iPad isn't that it's a better device, but it's got a bigger
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.380]   ecosystem and it's heavily supported by a lot of schools.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:22.260]   But actually, I think that the R key is not a bad device if you can get a keyboard and
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.980]   there will be a keyboard for the Nokia 1.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:24.980]   It's got office on it.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.980]   Oh, it's got a keyboard.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.820]   You can do productive things, but again, if the ecosystem ready for what she wants to
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:31.820]   do.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.500]   You know, if you're in middle school and you need to write reports and surf the internet
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.420]   stuff, it seems like a good choice.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.620]   You can add a keyboard to an iPad, but it's never really a natural fit.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.620]   Yeah, it doesn't fit.
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.020]   Except for Harry McCracken, you know, Time Magazine, he writes all of his stories.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.900]   Mike Elgin too, they'll show up with their laptop, which is an iPad with a keyboard.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.820]   And it's like, yeah.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:56.340]   Just show, you know, there's enough power, enough flexibility in these devices that they
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.340]   can do other things.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.460]   And don't ignore the Android tablets, Joe.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.540]   I mean, those are coming on, they're getting better, they're getting more popular, they're
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.340]   finally getting serious about tablet apps.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:11.460]   Yeah, well, basically what you're telling me is that it's safe enough to let her make
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:12.460]   her own mind on it.
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.460]   She should exactly.
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.660]   That's a reasonable thing to add.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.660]   Exactly.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.660]   Exactly.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:22.180]   I mean, if she is expressing an opinion, I'd let her get what she wants.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.780]   And then if she wants an iPad in six months, that's not my...
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.180]   I'm actually surprised though, I just assume kids have six months, you can go to where
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.340]   other grandfolds are.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.780]   Let's see what else.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:43.500]   Microsoft's so sad because for a long time we've been talking, when you start a show,
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.220]   some of our shows, you'll hear us do a plug for Winamp.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.660]   Winamp was the original MP3 software.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:50.660]   I loved it.
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.300]   Winamp really kicked the llamas butt.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:58.180]   I never knew what that meant, but every time you installed it, it would say that.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.420]   AOL bought and all soft.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.780]   The creators of Winamp now in 1999.
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.940]   So even that acquisition was 14 years ago.
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:10.340]   AOL announced this week it's shutting down Winamp forever.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.580]   They paid $80 million for it in 1999.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.580]   Now the interesting story according to TechCrunch is that Microsoft is saying, "We'll take it."
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.580]   Really?
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.340]   And there's value to the name.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:25.020]   I mean, I'll tell you why, because a decade after it seems to be relevant, continue to
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:26.340]   use it as my primary medium.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.940]   It's a great program.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.060]   It's felt, it's small, it's highly customizable.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:37.900]   As a matter of fact, my stage show, I get on stage and I used to have a freaking CD with
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.740]   tracks that I would have the sound guy play audio cues at various times.
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:47.340]   And they would screw up so often that I eventually went and decided to design my own system where
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.660]   I could run sound for my stage magic show while I was performing it.
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.220]   And I grabbed two keyless entry systems to cars.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:00.180]   I spliced some leads to old keyboard buttons, attached them to the back of my shoes, and
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:05.580]   I used a plug-in for Winamp that allowed me to hit play pause, fade in advance, queue
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.580]   up everything.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.860]   So to this very day, here we are, 2013.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:14.300]   I still use Winamp as my primary method to run all the video and sound during my stage
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.300]   show.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:18.540]   There's like 47 sound and visual cues throughout the whole show.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:23.980]   But because it was so customizable, this program, this plug-in was written by some guy in Russia.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:28.900]   But, and I got it 10 years ago, sent them 50 bucks and continue to use it to this very
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   day.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.340]   So I was really sad to shut down.
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:36.140]   But if they could keep that spirit of openness alive and just, you know, new boss, same as
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.860]   the old boss, that'd be fine by me.
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.860]   I'd be thrilled.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:43.700]   Winamp was created in 1996, you remember by a guy named Justin Frankel.
[00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.700]   It was just him.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:50.620]   Although in the first year, they had 15 million downloads in 1996.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.140]   That's a lot.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.820]   They named Justin named his company Nelsoft in a parody of Microsoft.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.140]   So it'll be very ironic if Microsoft picks up Winamp and Nelsoft.
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:07.940]   According to an article on Crave, written by Bonnie Burton, who used to work at Nelsoft,
[00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:14.100]   the slogan, Winamp, it really whips the llamas, but is a line inspired by the schizophrenic
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.060]   singer-songwriter Wesley Willis.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:18.940]   So it's not supposed to make any sense.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:19.940]   You know who that is?
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.100]   Oh, I know who Wesley Willis is.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.100]   Rock and roll McDonald's.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.780]   Dude, Chad will pull up Rock and roll McDonald's in two seconds.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:30.460]   He used to have, like in the early 2000s, I mean, he was genuinely schizophrenic.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.220]   And if you looked, he had a callus on the middle of his forehead because as a way to
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.700]   honor his fans, he would hit butt them.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:43.140]   He would be all like, yeah, no, just what I want from my favorite rock and roll performer.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.740]   That butt me.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.260]   So Winamp, I think, really was kind of the little scrappy little program that could we
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.220]   all used it in the late '90s.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.540]   Then AOL bought it.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.940]   Frankel survived for a little while.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.420]   But remember when AOL, are we listening now to Willis?
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.940]   Is this rock and roll McDonald's?
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.860]   I'm really quite worried that there will be something we have to believe.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:11.220]   We will not use a bleep.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.500]   That's just like...
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.540]   That's the whole song?
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.540]   Pretty much.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.340]   McDonald's will make you fat.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.180]   McDonald's will have to...
[00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.180]   Oh, dude, it's...
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.180]   Do you remember?
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:34.060]   In 1999, when AOL bought Nelsoft, that Frankel released Nutella, GNU Nutella, the open source
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:37.820]   period of your file sharing network that competed with Napster, just what AOL was hoping they
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.540]   would do.
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.900]   Which was a big thing at the time.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:46.260]   Nutella was, I remember it was technically very, very adept compared to, you know, Emuil
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.500]   and the other stuff that was around at the time.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.180]   That was actually before BitTorrent.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.180]   So, well, so world, I guess.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.540]   But, you know, in the modern world, wherever your device comes with a media player or if
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.700]   you're operating system, anything you play, I mean, do we really...
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:05.060]   I mean, except for those specialized cases like Brian, where you're, you know, literally
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.780]   doing magic tricks with your technology there, and do the average person really need a choice
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.780]   of media players?
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.580]   No, it makes sense.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.900]   And, you know, when kind of jumped the shark under AOL, by the version 3, it really was
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.100]   not the little fun...
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.820]   I got it because of the visualizations.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:27.060]   I remember in 1999, December 31, 1999, I was responsible for the music for our Millennium
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.060]   New Year's Eve party.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.460]   Of course, I used Winamp to play it back on a PC.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:36.940]   I had a projector projected the Winamp visualizations on the wall as we listened.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.820]   And by the way, there was no portable music player.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:39.820]   It was a day.
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:44.180]   It was a tower PC playing this thing back.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:46.100]   So there's some real memories with Winamp.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.860]   And so I don't know, I think it's not the same Winamp.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.500]   It hasn't been for years.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.500]   Well, how could it be?
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.500]   Moore's law is inexorable.
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.500]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.100]   And I'm still using an accounting system, I wrote in...
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.700]   You still use that?
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.780]   In 1985.
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:11.620]   But my bookkeeping needs have not changed since then.
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:12.620]   Yeah.
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:17.220]   That's true, bookkeeping probably hasn't changed since the 19th century.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.900]   But MP3 players have evolved.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   Well, I wrote my bookkeeping system quite deliberately to look exactly like what you
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.940]   get in second year accounting at UCLA.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:32.180]   I went down there and bought the textbooks because I figured if I'm going to be audited
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:37.180]   by these IRS guys, that's what they're going to have done is gone to college and taken
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.820]   accounting classes.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.980]   So I want my books to look just like what they're used to.
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.980]   And it's worked.
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:49.660]   I've been audited seven times and I always got money back before when it was over.
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.660]   Wow.
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:56.500]   Well, as Patterson pointed out in the chatroom, who of us has unchanged since 1999?
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.340]   Justin Frankl tweeted, "Don't worry about Mike the Llama.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.100]   He is safe in his native habitat."
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.700]   So if you were worried...
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   Anyway...
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:15.820]   One foot note to the legacy of that.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.260]   They will spit at you.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:18.860]   And they are quite...
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:24.260]   Not only will they spit at you, they are very accurate in what the way they spit at.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:25.260]   What is this, Chad?
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.260]   I could give you absolutely...
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.260]   Same thing.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.260]   I just thought you might want to music for the llama.
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.820]   Oh, there's the reprise of rock and roll McDonald's.
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.860]   Rock and roll McDonald's a dancing llama.
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:38.940]   One foot note that I think is of big significance, especially to your network, Leo, is the fact
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:44.420]   that Winamp was among the leaders in distribution with the Shoutcast technology.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:45.420]   That's right.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.420]   I remember to...
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.420]   Winamp.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.420]   The Shoutcast.
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:49.420]   Yes.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.420]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.420]   I mean, before there was Justin TV, before there was Ustream, there was Shoutcast.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.420]   A way to...
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:54.420]   And I remember...
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:49:00.300]   I remember on 9/11 turning on Winamp and tuning in to one of the Shoutcast distributed feeds
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.820]   of the police radio.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.820]   Back in the day.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.860]   So Shoutcast, which is somewhat proprietary, is an MP3 streamer.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.700]   We use actually Icecast, which is the open source version of Shoutcast.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.860]   Shoutcast will also be shut down by AOL.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:18.700]   However, if Microsoft acquires it, that might be...
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.460]   This might be a good reason for Microsoft to acquire a Shoutcast.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.460]   There are still...
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.460]   They'll put it in Xbox.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.460]   One, two...
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.460]   I'll take it.
[00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.260]   Who wants to have to pay money to stream?
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:33.020]   You know, if you wanted to stream something from your web server, you had to pay anything.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.020]   Only if you play music.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.380]   No, but I mean, no.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.020]   For the streaming technology, I think Reel would charge you a mic.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.020]   Reel would.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.020]   That's why this was a revolution.
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.020]   Absolutely.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020]   I'm like, "Work Plus blog.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   I've got a free streaming app that shows up."
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.740]   And MP3 streaming is very easy to play back.
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:55.460]   iTunes supports MP3 stream, Shoutcast, and Icecast.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.740]   So it means a very straightforward kind of stream.
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:00.820]   So I hope it survives.
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.820]   I think that's...
[00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.620]   You see the screw gool shirts, by the way.
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:04.620]   The Microsoft store.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:05.620]   Oh boy.
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.620]   What the hell?
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.620]   This is so bad.
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.220]   Those are some bold and plain.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.540]   It's so unexpected from Microsoft.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.220]   I mean, Microsoft is...
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.820]   Well, if something tasteful, usually.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:17.820]   Not this.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.820]   Not hip.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.820]   Not hip.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:23.740]   This is listening to Fox News talk about Obama.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:25.060]   Is he really American?
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.260]   I mean, look at the screw website.
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.820]   It's like, is Gmail violating wiretap laws?
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.820]   Sh*t, please.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:43.020]   I mean, that's the first job of stuff about Google Street Wi-Fi thing, which had no legs.
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.020]   This is...
[00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:45.020]   I mean, it's tasteless.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.120]   You know who did...
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.320]   You don't know the name...
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   It's coming from Microsoft.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:53.380]   You probably don't know the name, but the guy behind this is named Mark Penn.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:54.380]   He was a...
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.980]   His background is not in software.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:56.980]   He's in politics.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.580]   He was Hillary Clinton's pollster.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:04.180]   In fact, fired, famously fired during the 2008 primaries because he was doing such a crappy
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.180]   job.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.620]   And I think this is exactly the same kind of negative campaigning you see in politics.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:12.740]   The problem, just like in politics, it kind of can rub off on you.
[00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.620]   I mean, when they say, "Is Google breaking wiretap laws when they read your Gmail?"
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.940]   They conveniently ignore the fact that hotmail also reads your mail.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.660]   It has to, otherwise...
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:28.580]   If you have spam filters and machine reads your mail, that's a simple word.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.580]   Mark's.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.460]   Now, if it does it for spam, for spam, for ads, it's a different thing.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:37.300]   But your email is being read by machines all along the way.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.300]   Deal with it.
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   What does it mean?
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.620]   It was also like...
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.180]   And people are like, "Oh, well, in what situation would it be read by a human?"
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:50.580]   The answer is when they get a subpoena, which is exactly when it would be read by a human,
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:54.660]   no matter who's providing it, whether it's being hosted or never read by a computer.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.860]   And the whole purpose of webmail is to archive your mail so that you can get access to it
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.460]   any time you want.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.660]   That's what I love about Gmail and hotmail and Yahoo mail.
[00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:08.140]   And the government, given the right papers, can get access to it every time it wants.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:13.340]   So, if you really want to protect your privacy, don't use any kind of archival mail, whether
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.340]   it's...
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   Don't use the internet.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.140]   Don't use the internet while you're at it.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.940]   You might want to get an out of the house while you're at it.
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.940]   Larry.
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:25.580]   You guys seem to be a little naive.
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:31.140]   Do you really think that everybody gets those papers all the time?
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.140]   No.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.140]   The national security letters?
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.140]   No, we're all typically...
[00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.220]   The Apple says it's never received one.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.140]   There are very few of them.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:43.420]   I mean, Microsoft and Facebook and Google have all put out numbers, like zero to a thousand.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:47.900]   Yeah, I think everything they tell me to do is...
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:54.780]   The obvious thing is, if you don't want it broadcast, don't put it out on the internet
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:55.780]   at all.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:56.780]   Right.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:04.500]   The notion that you can have private email and it's going to stay private is just...
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:05.500]   It isn't.
[00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.500]   It won't.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:08.500]   No.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:09.500]   You're right.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.500]   Well...
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.500]   It's just like...
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.740]   You know, people didn't use U.S. mail back in the old days if they had something extremely
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.740]   private to share.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:15.740]   Right.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.980]   You know, you walk down the room with a...
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.620]   Turn on the shower and whisper, I don't know.
[00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:23.420]   I've never done it, but I know there are ways, because I've seen James Bond movies, the
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   red year book.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.420]   It's interesting.
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:30.020]   I think one of the reasons that kids use Snapchat is because they believe wrongly, as
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:35.220]   it turns out, but they believe that the pictures that are shared on Snapchat dissolve after
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:39.180]   30 seconds or whatever and disappear completely.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.980]   And I think that that's the reason Snapchat's so popular.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:42.980]   So there is...
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:43.980]   But that's for social reasons, Leo.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.540]   That's not from the government.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.740]   That's to protect them from your parents, from your counselors, five years from now, from
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:52.900]   your friends, two days from now, the ephemeral nature.
[00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:53.900]   But I think from a...
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:55.300]   It's the same thing, though, isn't it?
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.380]   Just to say, I don't want anybody to see this.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.380]   Government or parents, it's the same thing.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:00.380]   Sure.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.380]   But I want to archive it.
[00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.300]   I think there's a 13-inch or D-Mage danger as your parents, not GNSA.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:07.300]   Right.
[00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.300]   Exactly.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.540]   But I think the same desire for privacy, yes?
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:15.500]   Well, I think it would have thought that the real danger is not necessary.
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:21.740]   It's not necessarily the NSA, because if you're doing things that really interest them, you've
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.300]   got other problems, too.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:29.460]   I would think it's the HR manager, the human resources manager of the company you're thinking
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.780]   of applying a job to in five years that you need to worry about what you're doing on the
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:35.780]   internet now.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.260]   I think kids are aware of that, too.
[00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:42.460]   I mean, I know kids, high school kids who use phony names are on Facebook or names that
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.780]   wouldn't be searchable on Facebook.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.100]   Because they know that they don't want to use their real name because they know that
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.300]   they're going to be applying to colleges and looking for work.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:53.220]   Jerry, you're old enough to remember Joe McCarthy and I'm old enough to remember Jad
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.220]   Yerhuver.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:59.100]   So I don't put it past our government at some point now or in the future to want to go
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.180]   back and do an enormous amount of data gathering.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:03.180]   This is the first.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:04.180]   That's exactly what we do.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:07.300]   This is the first time I can remember that Jerry has said, "I'm not worried about the
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   government."
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.100]   And Larry says, "I am worried about the government."
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.100]   I know it's ironic.
[00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.100]   I'm confused.
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:15.420]   Should I flip the camera's ear?
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.860]   I would have to get a great investigation.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.660]   This is something that we have touched on in previous tweets.
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:25.860]   But one of the things that I honestly think you're going to see in the next decade is
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:32.740]   a case where retroactively facial recognition software is able to place certain prominent
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:35.380]   figures at certain events.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.220]   But it will be available on your telephone.
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:45.500]   Moore's law is inexorable.
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:57.420]   The old ecology thing about in 30 days the pond is going to be so full of facial all
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.620]   by.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:03.300]   So how big was it was on the 29th day?
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:10.500]   I mean, exponentials are exponentials and most people don't seem to appreciate that.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.820]   We're all on the wrong side of the hockey stick.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.140]   This brings up a news story.
[00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.900]   I don't know if it's on your round up, Baliou.
[00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.700]   But Chad, if you would bring up the second story on Larry's world, Twitter improves encryption
[00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.740]   against NSA and other snoops.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.660]   This whole perfect forward security is all about this, is to try to create a security
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:31.260]   system that protects you not now, but sometime in the future.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:37.780]   So that your encryption doesn't suddenly become like Snapchat, the encryption goes away instead
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.780]   of the data, which is the case with secure socket layer.
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.060]   So obviously Twitter picked up on that.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.300]   Google has picked up on that.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:45.300]   Google's been doing that too.
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.900]   We need to protect ourselves going forward, not just currently with our data.
[00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:50.900]   Oh yeah.
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.900]   Wow, Jerry and I agree on something.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:54.900]   Great agreement.
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:55.900]   Wow.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:03.580]   The Moore's law is quite real and it's good for another 10 years anyway.
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:07.020]   We don't think we're at the end of that, that we're close to the end of that.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:11.540]   Even I think even Gordon Moore thought we were getting close to the end of that.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.540]   Well, he's been thanking that for about five years, but yeah.
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:21.660]   The law, the law being that processors double in the number of transistors every 18 months.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:27.580]   That's the way he formulated it, but it is turned out to mean that to be that every year
[00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.660]   and a half, the machines double in power.
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.540]   I mean, that's kind of basic.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.300]   That's the effective effect of it.
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.460]   That's the effect of it.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:42.340]   Now his mechanism, which was that you can get more and more transistors on to a disk,
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:48.180]   was fine during those times, but that technology changes and we don't know what will replace
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.180]   it.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:54.300]   I'm not, I'm not sign going about it will run when it will run out.
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:59.060]   I'm not, I'm not up there with Werner, my friend Werner Wrenger who figures that we're
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:03.620]   eventually going to get things that are so good that we can't even possibly predict it.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:09.180]   We'll have this, this crazy period in which nobody knows anything.
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.020]   I don't think it'll get that.
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.020]   I think we're already there, Jerry.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.020]   Much fun.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.220]   I think we're real close.
[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:20.140]   I think so many things came out this holiday season that we can't even keep track of them.
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:21.340]   Next year is going to double.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.780]   Next year after that's going to double, forget it.
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:24.780]   It's over.
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.660]   Well, no, I'm going to get far.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:32.900]   Don't you think that that, that the hardware has, that was point I was trying to raise earlier.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:38.340]   At some point, hardware really does it get good enough to the point that it's going to
[00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:41.540]   take the software guys a long time to catch up with it.
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:45.620]   I am actually, it's interesting, Jerry, because I find hardware pretty uninteresting these
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:46.620]   days.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:47.620]   I mean, you know, I get a new tablet.
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:48.620]   It's commoditized.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.780]   It's completely commoditized.
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:51.780]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:52.780]   It doesn't matter.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.780]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.860]   So maybe that'll change.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.580]   Maybe a year from now some device will come out that's going to blow me away.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:00.460]   But it hasn't happened in the last year that I can think of.
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.020]   The issue really is software.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.020]   Maybe the wearable.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.860]   I mean, yes, yes, no.
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.140]   I don't think we're looking at a plateauing of hardware in general.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.820]   What we're looking at is the gap that comes before the next revolutionary leap.
[00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:18.700]   The moment we can get co-clear implants, all of a sudden you throw away your iPod earbuds
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:23.500]   forever because now you could just stream music directly into your brain.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:25.460]   That'll be a significant hardware advance.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.940]   The same thing with heads up displays in your eyes at all time.
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.580]   I mean, I mean, this stuff, this stuff is not the stuff of science fiction anymore.
[00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.460]   It's coming down the bike and it's going to be a big deal.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.460]   Yeah, it's your mission.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:38.140]   It's hard to write that kind of story.
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:39.140]   I bet.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:44.540]   I wrote that stuff in the 80s and I had mental input.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:50.260]   The Oath of Fieldy was a novel about people who could communicate with their computers.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.420]   Is it tougher to write sci-fi today?
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:56.940]   Because we're living in the future.
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.940]   Have you guys seen the...
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:05.940]   I mean, so many of my classic stories in the 80s took place now in the teens.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.540]   2001 took place 12 years ago.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:15.420]   I had asteroid colonies and I had moon mines and all of which we could have had the technologies
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:16.420]   there.
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.580]   We just didn't have the will to do it.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.300]   We'll get the will when we start running out of stuff.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.500]   Well, we're already running out of here.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   We'll get the will.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.740]   Unless you run out of stuff, you can't build a rocket.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   And you got to see the...
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.540]   You got a race between having investment funds and having to pay for entitlements.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:44.260]   As long as the entitlements that you have to pay for are low enough that there's still
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:50.540]   a surplus left over that you can invest to keep the revolution going, you're all right.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:56.540]   The problem is that left to themselves, the entitlements will lead to whole budget and
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:02.940]   more than that, Pernell's law of bureaucracy will take over the research establishments.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:08.100]   Right now an awful lot of so-called research really just goes to cubical workers who sort
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.140]   of read each other's minutes.
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:16.300]   They don't contribute anything into the research anymore and you can't follow them.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.380]   You want to talk about these augmented reality glasses, Brian?
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.540]   I see the video that you sent along in the chat room.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.420]   Yeah, well, and that's on that topic.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:27.980]   Just putting together, for anyone who thinks this is still far off in the future in science
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.420]   fiction, this guy, there's a video that came out this week of a guy who took a couple
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.060]   of cameras, stuck him to the front of an Oculus Rift, and basically set it up so that you
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.860]   could perceive the world around you through your Oculus Rift.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.180]   It's a video image that comes into the cameras.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.660]   Cameras go to the screens in front of your eyeballs and you see the world.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.940]   Then you click a button and all of a sudden you have augmented reality where you're able
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.060]   to reach forward and interact with heads up display stuff.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.340]   Well, you've seen Jerry Ellsworth's Cast AR.
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:59.140]   This looks a lot like Cast AR, which is very close to happening.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:04.740]   Jerry was an engineer at Valve, was developing it for the Steam box.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:09.460]   Valve fired her and her team and interestingly enough, she was able to walk into Gabe Newell
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.700]   and say, "Well, can we take the glasses with us?"
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.620]   And he said, "Yeah, what the hell?"
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:14.620]   And so they're working.
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.620]   Wow.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:17.620]   No kidding.
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:18.620]   How often does that happen?
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:24.660]   They had an Indiegogo, let me see if I can find Cast AR.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.660]   No, it was Kickstarter.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.820]   They had a Kickstarter.
[01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:30.900]   They raised a million dollars.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.260]   And she came in and demoed it.
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.340]   And that's exactly what this is.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.340]   What's interesting is they're heads up.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.660]   So unlike the Oculus Rift where you really wouldn't see anything if they failed, you'd
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.820]   walk into a tree, these are actually glasses you're seeing through and then projected ahead
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:52.540]   of them is on a screen is, so I guess it's a little different in the sense that you're
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:57.220]   not walking around looking at an augmented world, but you could play a 3D game and so
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.220]   forth.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:02.660]   And she says that they do have the same kind of capability as one of the things that they
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.660]   like to do.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:09.460]   Well, and how close are we to a world where all of this is built in to a unit small enough
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:10.460]   to fit inside your eye?
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.540]   I just want cerebral cortex implant.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540]   That's, I'm waiting.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.540]   Yes.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.540]   I will be the first.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:21.820]   This, this from the same guy who was just mocking me for, for being severed from the
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.820]   internet.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.900]   No, I'm not saying that.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.580]   I still want to toilet and hot and run cold running water.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.700]   I mean, I'm not giving up that.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.060]   That's all just a big space.
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:37.060]   But I wanted, I want ocular implants or cochlear implants.
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.300]   I want it.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:44.140]   Just put it all in here and if you're totally connected to the internet, electronic mess.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.140]   Yes.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.860]   I figure I don't have much more left anyway.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.860]   Why not?
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.660]   I'd love to be the guinea pig for it.
[01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.460]   And your toilet can have it fill an IP address.
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.460]   Actually, my toilet does.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.500]   We're installing one of those toto wash.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.500]   It's a total.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500]   It wakes up.
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.500]   It sees you.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:00.500]   It says hello and it opens up.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   They have a webcam.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.340]   What's so, what's so great about reality, man?
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.380]   We're all rock stars and geniuses.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.540]   We just don't have the right equipment.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.540]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:08.540]   You lost the genetic lottery.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.020]   You were born with a slower.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.020]   Right.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020]   Forget that.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.620]   That doesn't count when you go virtual.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.780]   I want to go post physical as fast as I possibly can.
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:20.820]   Does it intrigue you that John Carmack is going to oculus?
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:21.820]   Yeah, dude.
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:26.420]   I wonder how what's funny is this is what a dark I am is the first thing I said was it
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:30.820]   was like, Oh, I hope he doesn't quit armadillo air space because I want to see him make rockets.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.820]   Well, he has, but has he?
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:39.740]   Yeah, his wife is basically told him he doesn't get to play with it and it says more so much
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   anymore.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   That's too bad.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.340]   Jerry is a big proponent of private space.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.060]   I'm not so sure.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:52.420]   I mean, Armadillo did some good stuff, but he was so fascinated with mono propellants
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:05:00.460]   that one of the problems with mono propellants is the other name for the mittai explosives.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.460]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.980]   I'm fascinated with those two.
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.580]   Let's blow something up.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:11.580]   But yeah, well, but not you.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:19.340]   But before we do before we do, Leo, Jerry, are you are you a believer in like, like,
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:20.700]   would you put your money on SpaceX?
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:27.900]   Because I mean, if you're into private space exploration, well, you got to understand I'm
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:31.380]   not totally disinterested.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:35.020]   My son is a vice president of Nanorak.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:40.620]   And if you they just launched more satellites in one day than anybody else ever has.
[01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:43.300]   They have the world record for it now.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.300]   They're a little there.
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:45.660]   They're cube satellites.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.220]   They're 10 centimeter cubes.
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.420]   And if you want something put into space, Nanorak will get it there for you.
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.340]   They can do it.
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:58.140]   They buy left over launch capability from other people.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.500]   And they don't know wonderfully.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:07.940]   Yeah, I'm a big fan of of of Elans, but I'm also a think X-core has got some pretty good
[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.420]   stuff going to.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:13.060]   Now, there's a lot going in private space.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:19.300]   And fortunately, at the moment, the regulatory heat is not so bad that they can't do it.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:26.060]   One of the big problems with innovation now is that, well, it's like the problem with
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.180]   why don't we have better roads?
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:37.780]   We just spent $900 billion supposedly on shovel ready construction projects to give us better
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.620]   roads and bridges.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.460]   Only we don't know where any of it went.
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.940]   But I can tell you where it went.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.700]   It went into environmental impact statements.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.860]   Which isn't a road at all.
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:52.020]   You can't drive on an environmental impact statement.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.860]   Well, they're pretty thick enough, you might.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:07:00.860]   And the problem and as long as space doesn't get so over regulated as all that, yeah, we'll
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:01.860]   still get there.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.580]   And if we can get the space, you can get and solve the energy problem.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:12.140]   But it's a close deal in this world between the demand for entitlements and the needs
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.940]   for research and development.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.700]   We're going to take a break.
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.700]   We'll come back with more.
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.700]   Jerry Pournell is here.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:22.100]   Jerry Pournell.com, the great science fiction author, Rack Hunter and the guy who really
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:30.220]   started user focused tech journalism with his Chaos Manor column in Bite Magazine and
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.420]   now online at ksmanner.com.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:37.940]   Larry Magget is here for CBS Radio and Larry's World is a great place to go to find out what
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:39.540]   he's up to.
[01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:42.780]   We've got Cedric Ingran, who hasn't been able to get a word in Edge-wise.
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.780]   You've been very good.
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.780]   I'm listening to Jerry.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780]   He is the technology.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.780]   No, no, no, no, that's fine.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.780]   Really.
[01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:51.140]   Cedric will pipe in, believe me.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:56.740]   lcr.fr if you want to see Planet Crenn.
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.740]   And it's always good to see.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.740]   When are you coming to the US?
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.180]   Well for CES, that's for sure.
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.780]   All right, well we'll see in June, January then.
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:09.100]   And Brian Brushwood from NSFW and I've just learned that you will be joining us for our
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.100]   New Year's Eve party, Brian.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.100]   No, is that official?
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.100]   Oh, maybe not.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.100]   That was being talked about in the worst.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.060]   I think we're negotiating with Bonnie to make it official.
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.820]   There you go.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:23.860]   In other words, you tipped your hand, my friend, and I get to name my price.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:24.940]   You name your price.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:25.940]   You will be here.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.940]   I want you here.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.780]   You know, we're going to have so much fun.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.300]   We have a 24 hour broadcast we're going to do on New Year's Eve.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.060]   I decided we're such a global network.
[01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:37.860]   Why not celebrate New Year's in every time zone?
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:42.740]   So we're going to start at 4 AM Pacific time New Year's Eve and go to 4 AM Pacific time
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.740]   New Year's Day.
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:50.380]   And in those 24 hours, I think we're going to have 26 or 27 countdowns to midnight.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.780]   And we're going to welcome 2014 27 times.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.780]   Wow.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.180]   Now, Lillie, have you thought to have like a representative from each time zone call
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.180]   in over the sky?
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.180]   Yes.
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.180]   That's what we're doing.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:07.780]   I'm going to be looking for people all over the world, twit.tv/nye to book your time zone.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.780]   You know, it's going to be easy to do.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:12.780]   France is going to be a little harder to do a Papua New Guinea, but we're hoping to get
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.420]   somebody in every one of those times.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.260]   I'll tell you what, just something you pretend to be from there.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:20.780]   And then you just have a massive champagne 27 times.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   Wow, that'll be quite a bit.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:28.300]   We're going to have an ongoing D&D game live D&D live Dungeons and Dragons throughout the
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.300]   24 hours.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.300]   Here's all the time zones.
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.540]   We've got Darwin.
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.140]   We don't have your kutsk.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.780]   We're looking your cuts.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.900]   Yes, that'll do it.
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:41.260]   I don't know what Sri Jawa warden Pura is, but if we could find somebody there, we'd
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.260]   like to do that.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:43.260]   One word.
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:45.260]   Twit fans green screen.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.140]   What's that meant to start 45 minutes after the hour?
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.140]   Look at that.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.100]   There's 27 time zones.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:10:02.260]   So I'm told Kabul has its own Sri Jawa warden, Pura has its own cat man do has its own.
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:04.780]   I hope you are in Nova C. Bierst right now.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:07.140]   Yeah, we need a color from Minsk.
[01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.140]   So be the one.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.260]   And anyway, that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.260]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:12.260]   And you're all invited.
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:15.100]   And I know Brian, we want to get a little magic if we can.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.100]   It'd be a little fire eating something going on here.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.660]   It's going to be fun.
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:20.660]   It would be an honor.
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.300]   A lot of people coming up for it.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.500]   I think we're going to have music.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.260]   What I've done is I've got it's 24 hours.
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:29.180]   I've got three producers doing each eight hours and they're competing.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.260]   I'm hoping they're going to compete against one another for the best eight hours, right?
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.420]   From nine to midnight is going to be the best.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   The best.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:37.100]   See, that's what we want.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.100]   We want them.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.100]   We want them.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.980]   And I want of the producers called you see.
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:44.300]   So now that ups the ante because Karsten called Brian.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.100]   What are you going to do, Chad?
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:47.580]   Well, good.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.500]   I want so much to believe that Patalume International Airport.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.940]   There'll be a limo service from the Petalume International.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.700]   Anyone I book gets free limo service.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.900]   I want so bad to believe there's going to be like four or five hours where it's just
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:07.100]   a guy in a pretend boat green screen with an ocean in the background.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.300]   You're like, three, two, one.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:14.660]   Well, you're the big guy who wants the virtual world.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.660]   That's right.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.660]   That's enough for me.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.580]   You can virtually have everybody in the world.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.180]   I'm really looking forward to this.
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.180]   I've been.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.180]   I've been.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.540]   We've been planning this for four years.
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.220]   Years in the making and make you that long to recover from it.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:31.420]   Yeah, it'll be another four years before I wake up, if ever.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.220]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:40.540]   A great place to get royalty free artwork, photos, illustrations, vectors and videos.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.180]   Currently they update it all the time.
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.900]   31 million, 278,274 royalty free stock images.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.660]   They upload as many as 20,000 new images every day.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:55.700]   In fact, this week alone, 180,000 new stock images were uploaded to Shutterstock.com.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:57.740]   That means you can find something for everything.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:06.020]   If you do a publication, a menu, if you do videos, if you need great royalty free images
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:11.580]   for your work, Shutterstock has some of the best professional photographers and artists.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.220]   You could choose individual image packs or monthly subscription for the best deal.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.620]   I love the search engine, but before you use a search engine, I invite you to make a free
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.260]   account, no credit card needed, because then you can create light boxes.
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.300]   This is really, really nice.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:33.660]   The light boxes allow you to save images into a light box that you can look at at any time
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.660]   you can share with others.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.660]   That is really nice.
[01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:40.500]   Here's the Grey Matters light box, which is a bunch of grayscale photography.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.580]   Just really beautiful stuff.
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:45.820]   This Shutterstock is quite amazing.
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.860]   Even if you don't end up buying these images, just having them there for inspiration is
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.860]   so wonderful.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.700]   You can also share them, by the way, with other people.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.500]   They have a color picker that lets you choose a palette.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.020]   You can say, "My website needs these colors."
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:03.620]   It's just the search engine is super powerful.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:09.100]   They're also truly international, multilingual customer service in more than a dozen countries
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.900]   full-time throughout the week.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.660]   Wherever you are, you're going to love Shutterstock.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:15.620]   Now, once you create the light box, please do that.
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.900]   It's absolutely free.
[01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.900]   If you decide to buy, all I ask is to use our offer code.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:25.260]   Twit 1113, you'll get 25% off your new account.
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.700]   25% off.
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.540]   That's pretty amazing.
[01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:31.140]   The other reason to create an account is they've got free images every week, which you
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.780]   can get if you're an account holder.
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:36.980]   Don't forget to click the footage tab at the Shutterstock page to take a look at some of
[01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:42.340]   the videos there as well, the beautiful, beautiful videos.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:44.300]   It's just nice to have.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:45.300]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:49.140]   This is a grungy, happy Thanksgiving video.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.140]   Wow.
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:53.340]   I mean, there's something for everybody.
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:58.380]   Yeah, man, I want to say happy Thanksgiving, but I don't want to look like I care nothing.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.380]   Maybe like Rusty.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:00.380]   Rusty.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.380]   Rusty.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.380]   Rusty.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.380]   I want it.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.380]   Rusty.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.380]   Yes.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.660]   That's the time we thank them so much for their support and for their images.
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:11.020]   We have the 25-image a day subscription.
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.460]   It's very, very helpful for us.
[01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:17.140]   So, we didn't mention Apple once in this show.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:18.140]   Let's think.
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:26.940]   Samsung gets another big win, $290 million more in damages in their ongoing patent lawsuits
[01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.980]   against Apple.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:36.980]   The total award now is getting close to $930 million for patent infringed.
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:41.520]   At some point, at first I thought, "Well, a couple hundred million here, a couple hundred
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.520]   million there.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.660]   Samsung can afford it.
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.260]   It's the price of doing business."
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.500]   You get to a billion dollars.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.460]   It's starting to hurt a little bit.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.460]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:54.580]   Well, we had these arguments when the first trial went on.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:15:00.900]   It was like, "If Samsung actually infringed all the patents that Apple says it did, well,
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:05.780]   then a billion is that much saved in R&D."
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:11.860]   So, if it did it, if it did it very deliberately and it knew what it could afford.
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.740]   But it's funny now that we're talking about phones that have been around for like three
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:16.740]   years.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:21.980]   It sounds like a very old story, except there might be a new lawsuit coming up sometime this
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:22.980]   year.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:28.340]   I don't feel like, I mean, I'm torn on this.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:32.140]   First of all, I hate to see companies litigate instead of innovate.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:37.300]   I completely understand that a company has the right end duty, perhaps even, fiduciary
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.300]   duty to protect its intellectual property.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.300]   So I'm just torn on this.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.300]   I don't...
[01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.140]   Well, so let's say it this way.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.860]   Let's say that Apple definitely came in and was like a lightning strike.
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.860]   They were an earthquake to the environment.
[01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.420]   They fundamentally altered what people expected from their smartphone.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:56.780]   And Samsung had to make a call.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:01.020]   We can either sit here, dumbstruck, with our jaws hitting the floor and watch Apple run
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:06.380]   away with it, or we can quote unquote, "be inspired" by what they've realized and run
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.540]   forward.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:10.060]   And it's one of those self-correcting things.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:15.260]   If what they had done amounted to nothing, if it turned out that the secret wasn't in
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:19.900]   icons and all the things that we associate with smartphones now, then they wouldn't have
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.020]   been successful and Apple wouldn't have bothered to sue them because there was no money to
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.020]   be had.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:33.060]   But the fact that clearly the ecosystem wanted apps and again, those things that they're
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.340]   suing about indicate...
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:36.940]   And Samsung made a lot of money.
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:39.780]   So it's almost like they're paying a retroactive licensing fee.
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780]   It is, it is.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.340]   And but do you agree with Apple's attorneys?
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:45.700]   Apparently the jury did.
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:50.260]   Who argued that Samsung's patent infringement significantly harmed Apple.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:55.180]   You know, Apple's attorneys have said Apple can never get back to where it should have
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.180]   been in 2010.
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.180]   Is that correct?
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.580]   I think that Google's innovation harmed Apple.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:05.140]   I mean, Google coming up with Android fairly quickly on the heels of iOS and licensing
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:11.260]   it to a lot of companies, including Samsung, and Samsung's clever exploitation of Android
[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.980]   hurt Apple and caused Apple to lose market share.
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.100]   But you know, when you look at some of these patent fights, they're arguing over rounded
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:20.700]   corners and the way icons bounce around the screen.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.220]   Neither are not fundamental issues.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:27.940]   These are marginal things about what makes the Samsung phones good or not good.
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:34.540]   And I think that fundamentally just as people steal from each other, yeah, maybe Samsung
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.460]   owes Apple a few hundred million bucks.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.540]   But the bottom line is that we had to move forward.
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:42.940]   We had to go beyond the BlackBerry as a smartphone interface.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:48.820]   And even if you look at Windows, nobody's going to see Microsoft over Windows phone or
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:49.820]   over their interface.
[01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.100]   But even if fundamentally is the same concept, right?
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.460]   You're putting icons on a screen.
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.060]   They're different shape.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:01.700]   But the bottom line is that Apple changed the way people use mobile devices and everybody
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:04.580]   had to follow or they simply would have been out of business.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:09.020]   So, you know, I'm not losing any sleep over it.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:15.060]   It doesn't seem quite accurate to say that all poor Apple, it would be so much more successful
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:19.300]   if they get much more.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.980]   It's hard to buy that yet the jury did.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:31.300]   I mean, Apple was on its last legs when jobs went in there and returning from his exile
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:34.140]   and holding meetings.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.900]   And the next thing, you know, they're the biggest company in the world.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.740]   They're building a billion dollar spaceship.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:46.740]   How can the world can you say they've been boy, I'd like to be harmed like they have.
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:47.740]   I know.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:48.740]   It's kind of.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:49.740]   Right.
[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:50.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:52.780]   And I'll tell you what, if we're going to play a game of what might have been, which is
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:57.580]   what it appears Apple's trying to do, what might have been if there wasn't any competition?
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:01.140]   Are you telling me that Apple would have hustled just as hard as they did?
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:06.220]   In what way has Apple given more to its customers because of the competition?
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:07.220]   Right.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:14.740]   And more than that, I think that the fact that there was competition tended to legitimize
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.300]   what Apple was doing.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:21.220]   And there wasn't just magic that only a few people were going to be able to do.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:23.700]   My godly, this is taking over the world.
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.660]   There are other companies in there too.
[01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:33.180]   A lot of us went and got Apple's stuff, but got a sort of gratitude for having for their
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   vision coming to life in front of us.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:41.540]   And I just don't see this.
[01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:46.060]   I think they'd much better put their effort into something else than playing these legal
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.060]   games.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.100]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:51.100]   Go ahead.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:54.140]   No, I mean, I want to see Apple come up with their next act.
[01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:58.300]   I mean, I think it's great that they're improving the operating system and the hardware a little
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.300]   bit every year.
[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:00.300]   But we've talked about this before.
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.460]   What is their next act?
[01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:05.420]   What is their next new product that people can start stealing from?
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:12.180]   But certainly, the war between Android and iOS, one step forward in each direction, one
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.180]   step back sometimes.
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:16.980]   I think you'll say you came out of innovation from Apple.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.900]   Cedric, you're not in amortive and I watch.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:27.460]   I just don't believe that it's going to turn out to be big enough to warrant Apple's kind
[01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:28.460]   of new Apple's kind of planning.
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.700]   It's going to look like a slave bracelet.
[01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:31.700]   It'll be big.
[01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.100]   I mean, big market-wise.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   How many?
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:41.060]   Let's imagine Apple comes out with an amazing watch, an amazing watch.
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:43.780]   How much can it expect to sell?
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.140]   A few tens of millions maybe.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:52.260]   I mean, I tried the Samsung watch and it's about as good as whoever, you know, the rest
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.260]   of the market.
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.260]   It works.
[01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.260]   He's got a camera on it.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:57.900]   The design is actually better than I expected.
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.060]   It's got a few kinks, but okay.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.060]   I didn't hate it.
[01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.060]   I was surprised.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.220]   I was prepared to hate it.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:05.120]   I still haven't switched watches.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.640]   Yeah, I'm not going to wear it, but I didn't have it.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:12.560]   A Japanese watch whose battery will last 25 years and that does everything I want and
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.840]   time zones and more and alarms.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.840]   So people already have watches.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:19.240]   I mean, there is no hurt there.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.240]   There is no fundamental problem to solve.
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.860]   Remember, the original iPhone keynote when Steve came on stage and said, "We like the
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.480]   smartphones that are out there.
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.200]   The problem is what's down there, the keyboards."
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.800]   And that's what the iPhone was there to solve.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.360]   What's there to solve what you watch?
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.360]   It's fine.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.160]   What if the fundamental problem that Apple is trying to solve or Samsung is trying to
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.800]   solve is having to take your phone out of your pocket?
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.800]   That is not a good problem to solve.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.720]   That's exactly what the problem is.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.720]   That's what they're selling.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:55.760]   Don't you think that the next step may be exactly what Xbox is doing?
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.680]   You talk to the watch and then your phone, but I can talk to my phone without taking
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.000]   out of my pocket.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.120]   I really don't want to walk around like this.
[01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:05.640]   No, I don't.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.640]   Like Dick Tracy was my wrist.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.640]   I'm with you.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:16.560]   Look, I've got a watch and tells me that Tom, if I want something more complicated than
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.840]   that, I've got an iPhone.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.160]   I'll show you the watch I want.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.880]   I want the William Shatner watch.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.240]   Have you seen this on Indiegogo?
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:31.040]   Eventually, there is what human beings have discovered as the passages of time.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:39.120]   Every decade, more or less has a passage and it's those passages that I wanted to name
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.960]   our watch for.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.520]   This is a actually quite a beautiful watch.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.160]   Shatner's signature on the back.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.680]   You notice it's set to 1009.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.960]   Every single watch you see.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   Go through Wired magazine.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.960]   No, they're all 1009.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   I don't know why.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.960]   Why is that?
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960]   It's always at 1009.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.280]   Well, number one, because it doesn't obscure the logo.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.520]   Jerry, you were there when they invented the wristwatch.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:01.520]   Was there any?
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.480]   I can't resist these things.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.680]   Look, you know what's nice about it?
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.720]   It's only 400 bucks.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.520]   It could be a lot more expensive.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:12.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.520]   It sounded like you said it's only 400 bucks.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.520]   It has a dope.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.520]   It's only a PS4.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520]   I see.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520]   It's a PS4.
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.520]   It tells the time you say, wow.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:25.080]   Look, but it was created by William Shatner.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.600]   It's dusted with authentic asteroid dust.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.600]   I kid you not.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.240]   They dusted it with asteroid dust.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.240]   Oh, man.
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:38.640]   All I do is look at every one of them as it comes off the assembly line.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.040]   It has a dome sapphire crystal.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.840]   It's engraved with his signature.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.000]   Leo, Leo, Leo, I got something I think you're going to be really excited about.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   There's a company.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.440]   It's technically a novelty company, but they sell honest to goodness.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:56.440]   Gelatin capsules that have filled with 24 karat gold flakes.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.400]   So you can literally go.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.440]   Why don't you buy some of those while you're at it?
[01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:03.440]   Is that true?
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   Yes.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:05.440]   True.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.440]   How much are they?
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.440]   I don't know.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440]   It's some stupid amount.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.440]   It's literally just so you can look at the toilet.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:14.440]   It'd be like a deep gold.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.920]   Damn, I'm rich.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.760]   I has gold.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.720]   All right.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:25.000]   So this is not by the way, I just want to point out that this is on Indiegogo and they've raised
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.680]   $271,924 toward their $75,000 gold.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:35.680]   A lot of people want to prove gold, Leo.
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.320]   It's multi-layered Swiss super lumi nova.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.880]   And it's numbered.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880]   All right.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880]   All right.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.440]   I almost bought it, but now I'm not going to thanks to you.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.440]   You spoiled it.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.680]   But where can I get those capsules filled with gold?
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.680]   I don't know.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.680]   I think I said I'm not safe for wallet.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:55.680]   Or something like that.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.720]   Speaking of wallet, Google Wallet is now offering a physical card.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.360]   And I thought this was kind of interesting.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.680]   I thought it was crazy when I first heard it, but it actually makes some sense because
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.160]   it's a way in which you can actually extract your money out of your Google account without
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:14.320]   having to go to one of the very future merchants that actually takes Google Wallet.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.640]   So Leo, if you and I went out to dinner and you're wealthy, I would expect you to pick
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.640]   up the entire bill.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.200]   But let's say we were to split it.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.600]   Hey, I could go.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:22.600]   Dude.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:28.200]   I could use my Google Wallet to transfer the money to you.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.960]   And then you could go to your nearest ATM to get the money out.
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960]   Or you could go to a store and actually spend it.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.800]   Or you could try to take your Google Wallet and find a store you could spend it.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.280]   Good luck finding one.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.480]   So it's so it actually makes sense, ironically, strangely.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.520]   I like it, not as much as gold pills.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.880]   There they are.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:50.960]   I told you.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.960]   I told you.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.960]   They're 220 millimeters long.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.320]   They're only $425 each each.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.160]   Oh my God.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.960]   That's amazing.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.160]   It was a glittering gold.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.160]   Seems dangerous.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:09.160]   Thanks.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.960]   No, that's the idea, Jerry.
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.600]   Would you bring me a camp toilet, please?
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.520]   I want my gold.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.120]   I paid $425 with that gold.
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.840]   So I think that the Google Wallet physical card is response to this coin card that has
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.800]   gotten an awful lot of attention.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.800]   For reasons I don't fully understand.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.040]   Yeah, you guys, you guys apparently last week from what I saw on Twitter, you guys were
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.440]   saying that there were some security concerns with coin.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.800]   Oh, I think it just, I think it's just dumb.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:42.800]   You have a big coin?
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.800]   No, coin coin.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   Oh, coin.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.040]   Go to onlycoin.com.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:51.400]   The idea is it's a digital device that looks like a credit card, but you tie it via a low
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:58.600]   energy Bluetooth to your smartphone, iOS only, I think for now, and the smartphone has a
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:02.240]   little scanning dongle that you add to it that you scan all your cards into it.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.280]   The phone then sends the card information to this black thing, which programs the mag
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.600]   strip on the back so that when you swipe it, you know, you press a button on the front
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:14.160]   and say, I'm going to be, I'm going to use my master card today.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.080]   And when you swipe it, that's what it charges.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.920]   You choose what you're going to charge on it.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.960]   It's just Hootsuite for credit cards, right?
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:24.960]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:25.960]   That's an interesting way to sell it.
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.760]   I don't know if they've thought of that.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.600]   Hootsuite for credit cards.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.880]   I mean, it's like, look, I don't have time to log into my Twitter and then log into my
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.760]   Facebook and then log into whatever.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.720]   It's like, whatever, just let me log into one.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.120]   You're going to like, yeah, post this on Twitter.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.080]   I don't know. I think if you come up to a merchant and you show them this and say, can
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:46.560]   I swipe my black card, they're going to say, well, do you have a credit card?
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.800]   And it won't work in France because the France will use chip and pin, right?
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.800]   Sure.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.560]   That's the first thing that we said here.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.000]   No, we all have chip and pin for pretty much all our cards.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.760]   Even American Express switched a couple of years ago.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.320]   So, and the concern I have with corn is there's no signature on the back.
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.000]   They can't even check anything.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.240]   I can swipe your card into my corn and go to a restaurant.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.760]   That's the security issue.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.240]   To be honest, that's what I perceive as a benefit to this.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.360]   I have two employees who are trusts greatly.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:24.120]   No, I mean this because because, well, yes, there is that, but it's like, like I send
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:29.120]   off one of my, one of my helpers to go off and buy equipment for us to make stuff at
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   scam stuff.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.080]   And it's like, you know, it's awkward.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.920]   They're all like, well, it's not my name on it, but it's my boss and I need you to.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.160]   Where you guys live in a country where waiters will routinely disappear with your credit
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160]   card.
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.160]   Right.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.160]   If the waiter has coin, I'd be the waiter.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.160]   I'd be swiping all day.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.160]   Yep.
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.160]   Come on in.
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.160]   Come to that.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.160]   So what?
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.160]   So what?
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.160]   Our liability, we have no liability.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.160]   Well, that's why I think these are.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:58.080]   That's why Visa and MasterCard may not be too sanguine about this product and may kill
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:28:59.080]   it on a rival.
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.760]   The only reason I raise the point at all is because, A, I think Google's responded
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:04.760]   to this with a Google wall.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:06.200]   I think they were aware of it.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:11.120]   But B, because this company is asking people for $55 and people are just going to the website,
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.840]   giving them $55 saying, yeah, I'll take it when it's written.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.840]   It's a device.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.000]   I mean, it's a millimeter.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   It's like a credit card.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   It's a millimeter.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   It's not a credit card.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.880]   You know, the problem with a lot of these wallets, maybe this solves a little bit of a problem,
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.880]   right?
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:26.360]   Because, you know, you get your American Express and you're using your MasterCard.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:29.640]   But a lot of these products don't solve a problem that's really on.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.120]   Yeah, I don't see what the problem is.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.360]   And that's the other reason I raise it because it's kind of like a.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.160]   I watch it solving a problem that's not a huge, maybe it's a first world problem.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.400]   It's just not a huge problem.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.840]   Oh, taking the phone out of my pocket so hard or, oh, taking, having, carrying four credit
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.840]   cards, I don't know if I can carry all those credit cards.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:51.880]   Then you have all your loyalty cards and cards and whatever cards.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.360]   So I don't care that actually, I can understand.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.000]   I don't know.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.800]   You know, you can get away with American Express and a MasterCard or a Visa and that's
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.800]   all you really need.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.680]   So you're carrying 18 credit cards.
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.880]   I have to say, you mentioned.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.640]   I carry one of my suitcase for emergency.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.640]   There you go.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   That's smart.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.640]   I will get used to one.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.080]   I carry five passports under different names just in case.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.080]   You never know.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:20.640]   You mentioned the I watch situation like have anyone, has anyone here like I would
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.800]   never have bought one of these for myself because I'm holding myself out for whatever
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:28.840]   comes next because I'm not usually a first generation kind of guy.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.920]   But on his way out, John Tilton bought me as a thank you gift.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.000]   He bought me a pebble, which I am astonished at how much I absolutely adored.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   It's perfect.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.880]   Like, like there's times I'll leave my phone charging in the other room and I'm up here
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.600]   in the studio down there in the office.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:48.360]   A message will come in or somebody will be calling and I'll see it right here on my
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.360]   pebble.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.080]   Like once you've experienced that convenience of not having to put your phone out ever,
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:31:00.040]   I to be honest, I'm not only bullish on the idea of I watches in general, but I'm so bullish
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:07.280]   that I would not be surprised if Apple decided to leapfrog the watch as an ancillary object
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:12.080]   to the iPhone and instead, which straight to something called like the I cuff some kind
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.080]   of like coming like that's the whole thing.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:20.680]   One of the I cuff link or perhaps the I got maybe I dicky.
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:24.080]   I could wear one of those.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.080]   I showed it.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.640]   They brought you my squarespace.com.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:31.560]   The secret behind some of the best websites in the world websites that never go down because
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:37.360]   Squarespace is the best hosting ever attached to the best content management software.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:42.000]   And because they're tightly integrated, you get a great looking site that's always responsive,
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.260]   always up and running.
[01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:45.000]   You can make it look exactly as you want.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.280]   You start and by the way, I love it.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:49.800]   The Squarespace says all you have to do is go to our website squarespace.com.
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.040]   Click the get started button.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.880]   You don't need to give us a credit card for two weeks.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.440]   You can use the run of the place.
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.520]   You'll start with one of their 20 beautifully designed templates.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:02.360]   Now, you may say 20 that's not very many, but each and every one can be customized easily.
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.800]   You don't have to be an expert in JavaScript or CSS or HTML.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:08.000]   You just drag and drop point and click away.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.680]   And you end up with unique sites.
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:12.200]   These are all sites designed with the same template.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.560]   They all look gorgeous.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:19.680]   They all have some very nice features like their mobile responsive, which means that you
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:23.720]   can go to a site on an iPhone or look at it on a 27 inch display.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.720]   And it's going to reread, reread, arrange itself to look great on that site.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:32.080]   In fact, when you upload images to your Squarespace site, their software in the background automatically
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.240]   creates eight or nine different thumbnails.
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.680]   So at different sizes so that your image will look good no matter where it is.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.520]   It's just this is this is how it should be.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:45.600]   This is well designed by some of the best smartest people out there.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.920]   And of course, great support too.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:47.920]   It's very easy to use.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:52.280]   In fact, you'll find on the Squarespace site, they've got free webinars for users.
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.440]   They've got great forums.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:58.360]   They've got help, but they also have a 24/7 support team.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:03.200]   They just want a Golden Stevie Award for their support, for outstanding support.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.240]   Now you might say, well, for all of that, that's got to be expensive.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.840]   It starts at $8 a month.
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.160]   That's for the hosting and the software.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:15.560]   And when you buy an annual plan, you'll also get the domain name free and registrations
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.880]   free and they'll hook it up to your site.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.200]   Go to $16 a month when you pay annually.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.680]   They'll have the unlimited plan.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.680]   This is amazing.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.160]   You never get a bandwidth bill.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:28.800]   No matter how popular your site gets, you can't ever slash dot this site or diggers or
[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:29.800]   Twitter.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:33.960]   You cannot bring it down and you'll never pay extra for all those visitors.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.240]   Success is waiting.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:40.040]   You know, it doesn't, there's no, there's no, there's no friction unlimited pages, unlimited
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:43.440]   galleries unlimited blogs unlimited storage and limited contributors.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:49.520]   If you are a JavaScript or CSS guru, they've got a developer platform that's beautiful.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:52.840]   So you can really customize it or hire somebody if you want.
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.840]   You want to sell stuff for the holiday season?
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:55.840]   Commerce too.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.680]   Yes, $24 a month.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.360]   And they never charge a transaction fee.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:04.320]   You get unlimited physical digital or services to sell unlimited pages, storage bandwidth and
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:05.320]   contributors.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:10.960]   They'll help you with inventory tracking, tax calculations, shipping, coupon controls.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.400]   I just think this is, this is empowering people to really build their own business, to build
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.240]   their own website.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.000]   You deserve to own your place on the web.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.400]   No one else should own that.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.400]   You got it.
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.240]   No matter what you do, Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff, you still have to have
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.120]   one place that you point back to that you call your own, your website.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.800]   This is the place to make it squarespace.com.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.800]   It is easy to try.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.320]   And as I said, no credit card needed.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:41.120]   But if you decide you want to pay for it, you want to sign up, use our offer code TWIT11
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.880]   and we'll give you 10% off your new account.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.520]   So thank you for supporting this week in tech and try it out because you're going to love
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.520]   it.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.520]   Squarespace.com.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.080]   Tom Merritt is here.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.880]   He has a look at the week ahead, Tom.
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:54.880]   Hey, Leo.
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.680]   I took a break from playing with my Xbox One to tell you what's coming up in the week
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:01.760]   ahead for tech news today, Tuesday, November 26th.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.520]   It's HP's earnings report is that boat turning around.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.040]   Wednesday, November 27th, YOLAS, first sailfish OS handset goes on sale.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.920]   Of course, Thursday, November 28th is Thanksgiving, meaning Friday, November 29th is Black Friday
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.960]   sale day in the United States.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:23.480]   It's also the day that Xi3's piston modular PC launches for $1,000.
[01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.480]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.480]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   I want to piston.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.480]   Hey, Leo.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.480]   Hey, Tom.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480]   Hey.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   Okay.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.480]   Now, you know, it was prerecorded.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:39.960]   Oh, oh, oh, it's because Devorak wasn't here to point that out.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:45.120]   Hey, Leo, do you have a do you have a dog in the race on this FCC saying it's okay to
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.880]   use cell phones on an airplane?
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880]   I do.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.600]   I have a very strong opinion on this, but I'm going to let everybody else talk before
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.440]   I say what actually is going on.
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:59.760]   But as you know, the FAA recently said it's okay to have your devices on from gate to
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:08.440]   gate and now already JetBlue and Delta have freed the people.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:12.680]   But in no case to the FAA say you could use your cell phone and flight to make calls or
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.560]   text because that's not their purview, right?
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:16.560]   That's the FCC.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:20.120]   Well, it's both, but it's, but you know, the FAA could say, okay, but the FCC also has
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.120]   to approve it.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.320]   So in response, the FCC is announced.
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:24.320]   They're looking into it.
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:25.320]   Right.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.320]   What do you think?
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.720]   Well, I mean, I think everybody probably agrees what you don't want of the guy sitting next
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.000]   to you, yapping on the phone for the whole flight.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.840]   I mean, it's just simply a question to me of courtesy.
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.200]   I actually liked it when the phones were on the airplanes that were really, really expensive.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.120]   So you could, you could use them if you wanted to, but hardly anybody did and they only
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   used them very quickly because they were so expensive.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:52.240]   The airlines would have to equip planes with special antennas approved by the FAA.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:58.440]   And that's to handle the, a major technical issue, which is you're traveling, you know,
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:03.520]   six or seven miles high at 600, 700 miles an hour, the handoffs from cell tower to cell
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:05.240]   tower would actually bring the cell network down.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.240]   Right.
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.560]   So they would solve that by having some sort of equipment in the airplanes.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.360]   It would only be after the aircraft is above 10,000 feet, not during takeoff and landing.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:21.960]   FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said, modern technologies can deliver mobile services in the air safely
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:27.360]   and reliable and the time is right to review our outdated and restrictive rules.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.360]   What do you think, Brian?
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.800]   You think there's something going on here?
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.760]   Well, I mean, first of all, I don't understand this rejection of the idea out of hand.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:41.880]   It's, I mean, as a child of the 70s, you know, my, I spent my 20s staring at phones on the
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.880]   back of airplanes.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.920]   But nobody, yes, you say nobody used them.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.600]   And if they use them, it was crappy and brief.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.600]   And it's very expensive.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.680]   Well, and, and to be honest, that, that will continue to be the case, even though it won't
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:00.640]   be expensive in terms of dollars and cents, it'll be expensive in terms of like you will
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:03.880]   have to put up with the ire of everyone around you.
[01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:04.880]   Delta Airlines.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.880]   Delta Delta.
[01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:10.160]   Delta Delta to the survey in 2012, 64% of passengers said the ability to make phone calls
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.600]   in flight would have a negative impact on their onboard experience.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600]   They hate the idea.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:15.600]   Oh, whatever.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:16.600]   I mean, I hate the idea.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:17.600]   Yes.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.600]   Oh, no, no, no, we all hate the people.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.840]   We hate the idea of other people using phones.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:26.160]   But when our daughter goes into an epileptic fit and we need to call the hospital to find
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.040]   out what's going on, suddenly we think that we should have the ability to call.
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:32.400]   Look, this stuff self regulates, man.
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.040]   It's like if, if you have a situation that is so dire that you don't mind putting up
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.480]   with the fact of being that guy on the airplane that everybody staring at and making nasty
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.480]   faces with.
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.040]   If you don't mind the fact that everybody's going to listen into every word of your conversation,
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:52.560]   yes, your conversation is inherently so important that you deserve to have the ability to contact
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.560]   a loved one.
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.400]   I'm not worried about a person with somebody in the hospital.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.400]   I'm worried about the businessman who wants to share what a big shot he is.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.040]   You know, I tend to agree with you, Brian, because you know, people don't talk on the
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.480]   phone and restaurants as much as they used to.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.280]   Like I go to restaurants a lot.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:10.400]   And I'll take a phone call for 10, 20, 30 seconds, but then I'll walk out the door if I
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:11.920]   really have to chat.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.400]   And most people do that these days.
[01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.960]   So maybe there would be self-regulation and people would only use them either very briefly
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.560]   or if extremely important.
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.720]   I mean, that would be an optimistic way to look at the possibility.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:33.360]   I think that's a good way to put it because I think that yes, 10 years ago, 20 years ago,
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:36.360]   there wasn't that social stigma associated with it.
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.600]   There was no price for the person having a conversation.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.000]   All he got was to feel important.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.280]   But nowadays that's not the case.
[01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.880]   And nowadays, people are very aware of how they sound to people around them.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.880]   You ever take Amtrak?
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:49.880]   You never have a quiet car?
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:50.880]   It's terrible.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:53.480]   There's a real problem with people talking on the phones on the train.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.480]   They have a quiet car.
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.720]   They do have a quiet car.
[01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.720]   That's the response, right?
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:39:58.400]   How do you have a quiet airplane?
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:00.240]   Go ahead, Jerry.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.960]   I'm beginning to believe that none of you people have ever lived in Hollywood.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.960]   I have.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.400]   Why is everybody on the phone all the time?
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:14.440]   They are not only the even back before cell phones, people would have phones brought to
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:20.720]   the table so they could have their big conversations to be heard by all the way across the polo
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.960]   lounge about, no, I won't take that deal.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.760]   You have a full four more million dollars into it.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:33.920]   Hollywood is where they invented that guy.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:40.040]   I don't know, maybe I'm just unlucky.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:45.600]   But it is almost inevitably the case that if they allow those dang telephones to be
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:53.120]   used on the airplanes, I'll be sitting next to that guy, whether I'm first class or
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:41:05.760]   average, it will be that guy next to me and he will be sitting there.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.840]   I once a long time ago took the administrator of NASA over to Capitol Hill to meet the minority
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.840]   whip.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:17.520]   I was Newt's science advisor then and the administrator was a good friend.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:23.760]   New associate administrators, political appointees, neither of whom the administrator liked much,
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:26.160]   decided they had to come with it.
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:32.880]   They literally, this is back before cell phones, they used the car telephone to make calls
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.880]   to impress their boss.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:40.480]   We are driving across, I mean Dan and I told you after we got up.
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:49.080]   I just think the capacity of people to be that guy is a hell of a lot bigger than most of
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:50.080]   you think.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.920]   I agree, I don't think social restrictions are going to have any impact on this.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:57.720]   You live right by Jerry's Delacatecetescent on the tour boulevard, don't you?
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:01.640]   I do and they have phones, do they still have phones at the tables?
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.640]   Yeah, it still goes on just that way.
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:05.640]   Just the right thing.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:08.280]   They have a phone at the table for anyway.
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.880]   I don't know if they had them last time I was there.
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.520]   No, this is good to hear because I'm opening up Brian's diner in which there are telegraphs
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:17.520]   at every table.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:25.280]   Did you send a telegram to send Morse code at every table?
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:31.240]   Well, I just, I can't understand you if you use that.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:37.760]   I drew the day, I read the day when this is made legal, but I'm hoping that the FCC
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:40.920]   knows that this is a non-starter with most people.
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:44.920]   They're going to pretend to pay attention to this and then say, we decided it's not
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:45.920]   okay.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.040]   You know, let me throw something at you, Leo.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.360]   What would be so wrong with them making it legal, but leaving it up to, as they've said
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.080]   the entire time, leaving it up to the airline to decide if they want to do this?
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.080]   That sounds like something the FCC would do, which is basically wash their hands of it
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.880]   and say, oh, it's not our fault.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:10.400]   It's like, no, for example, for flying delta, if they advertise just as in the early days
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:16.600]   of non-smoking flights, non-smoking, non-phoning, I would go on that plane.
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.200]   But this is what always happens is that the legislation always lags behind the public
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:22.200]   opinion.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.760]   Maybe that's a way to create companies are usually first to jump on.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.840]   You could have the that guy airlines full of that guys.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:28.840]   Sure.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:31.160]   And then delta where it's nice and quiet.
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:34.320]   You know, actually, yes, which case it would be worth.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:38.080]   So go go and flight block Skype, but they don't block Google voice.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:41.080]   They block site reasonably because I think that that's going to be a great idea.
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.080]   They don't even try to block Google voice.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.080]   I don't know.
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:45.080]   You can do it if you want.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.080]   Because nobody tries.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.920]   If somebody's going to be on the plane and people will call in, I'll get incoming calls.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.920]   We'll never take them.
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:49.920]   Right.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:50.920]   But then I'll text them and say, hey, I'm on a plane.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.280]   Call back in a few hours.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.000]   I think there should be a flight where you get a pill filled with gold at the beginning
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000]   of the flight.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000]   And you're allowed to talk on the phone.
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.440]   They put a phone at you on your tray table and you just can make any call you want.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.440]   And I will be on that one.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.360]   And they charge you to you to see the rest of your gold out.
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:12.120]   You have to buy a you have to buy a strainer.
[01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.160]   Now, now here's the thing.
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:14.320]   I would I'm sorry.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.320]   That's disgusting.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.920]   I would like to see them allow texting, but not voice.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:19.920]   Yeah.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:20.920]   How about that?
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:21.920]   There's a compromise.
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:22.920]   Okay.
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.760]   Now, we understand that what I mean, understand that what you're doing is you are projecting
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:29.280]   your wishes onto the world.
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.640]   And yes, the hammer of laws are very important.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.640]   What's wrong with that?
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:33.640]   It's my world.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:35.520]   I get to project the images on it.
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:39.240]   Again, my default position is the greatest freedom for everyone.
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.480]   But just understand that when you use those freedoms, there are costs associated with
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:44.480]   it.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:49.680]   And I think that there are significant costs with being the one jerk on a phone who's shouting
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:54.640]   out, you know, the people who are those jerks like that negative attention is like saying,
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.840]   Oh, they'll never be trolling on the internet.
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.440]   They'll make sure it doesn't happen.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:00.440]   Well, that's an unfair comparison.
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.440]   That's not unfair.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.440]   It's exactly right.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:07.080]   It's going to sue your butt for for for denouncing him.
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.200]   So here's here's the rule.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.000]   You got it almost right, Brian, but not right, not not fully right.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.480]   You should be allowed to do whatever you want to do.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:20.720]   Whatever is privately beneficial without being publicly detrimental.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:21.880]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.800]   This is the first off the internet from cave bear.com.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.800]   We interviewed him on triangulation this week.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.080]   The burden of demonstrating public detriment should be on those who wish to prevent prevent
[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.080]   the private use.
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:35.640]   In other words, if I want to keep people from using phones and airplanes, the burden is
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:41.320]   on me to show why it's detrimental and it needs to provide clear and convincing evidence
[01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:42.320]   of public detriment.
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.960]   Hey, would you agree, Brian, that that's a more balanced.
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.720]   That's what you're saying.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.720]   It's it's closer.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.560]   The only thing that it doesn't factor in is the fact that there are different individual
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:57.800]   carriers of airline service and you might have one carrier that says it is a nonstop
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.800]   disco.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.720]   You don't even have to sit down for takeoff and landing.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.960]   It's music and punk rock and anything goes the entire time and you could choose to fly
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.920]   that that plane or not.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.640]   And then there's another one where it's like, Oh, no, no, no, you have to buckle your seats
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.040]   for takeoff and landing.
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:16.480]   You're not allowed to use electronics because we want to be totally safe and they will cater
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:18.400]   to their individual audiences.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.520]   That's I don't I mean, that's the answer going to allow that that I can't imagine.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:25.760]   The FCC is going to be a flat out where they head out.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:28.000]   So playing, I think it was where they that actually happened.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.240]   So playing, you know what I want to outlaw?
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.200]   I want to outlaw people being able to put their seat back so far that it almost breaks
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.200]   my laptop.
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.880]   I mean, that has happened to be, you know, when I have to fly coach and you put your
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:43.440]   laptop on the tray table and the guy in front of you suddenly lower their seat really quickly.
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:45.400]   They could actually squish the screen.
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.400]   They can squish it.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.560]   It's never happened to me, but I've had it come so close where the screen is trapped
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.320]   and I have to go, whoa.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320]   Exactly.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.480]   You hit the back of the seat.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:56.480]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.480]   Never thought of that.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480]   I do that all the time.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.520]   You don't want to sit in front of me in a plane.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:03.920]   Basically we're going to turn flying into a cage match.
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:04.920]   It's going to be so unpleasant.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920]   You're just going to stay home.
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:07.920]   It already is unpleasant.
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:08.920]   What are you talking about?
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:09.920]   It's getting worse.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:14.520]   The good news for your laptop is that actually reclining is going out of fashion.
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:21.560]   All the new coach classes and the new planes have well seats that either slide in but rarely
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:22.560]   reclining or more.
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.560]   Is that true?
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.560]   Really?
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:25.560]   Oh, yeah, yeah, really.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:32.000]   You can have now seats that whose width can vary according to how much you paid for
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.120]   your ticket, but these are only prototypes.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.880]   I think we can all agree on the fact that once we can place calls on a plane, of course
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:44.080]   we will all be the a-hole who will just once pick up the phone call someone and say, you
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:47.160]   don't never get one on the phone when I did that.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.600]   I think most of the time we will result to texts because texting is okay on planes.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.480]   I think texting should be fine.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:56.680]   I mean, you guys all remember the first time you used the internet on a plane and when
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:57.680]   go-go came around.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:47:59.680]   I was just amazed.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.520]   I remember writing a blog post and showing the flight attendant, look, it's already been
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520]   published.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.160]   You can see it right on my laptop.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.240]   It was so amazing.
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.040]   And now I actually look forward to not always using my laptop.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.040]   That was not funny.
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.040]   Actually getting some sleep.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.040]   I could sleep.
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:17.520]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.880]   You know who sleeps a lot?
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.400]   Postal service employees.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.360]   And if you'd like to keep them sleeping and not interrupt their naps, you might want to
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.560]   be using Stamps.com.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.920]   Actually, I'm being facetious.
[01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:29.920]   I love the post office.
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.640]   In fact, one of the things that the post office does really well is every day except
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:38.600]   Sunday, a mail carrier comes to my door, brings me stuff, picks up stuff.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.560]   Stamps.com keeps the best part of the post office.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.600]   You can free pick up and delivery, but does everything else at your desk.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.960]   You can print your own legal postage from your computer and your printer.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:51.280]   You do not need a postage meter.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.400]   You do not need special inks, just Stamps.com and your inkjet or laser printer.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.120]   You could buy postage on Stamps.com.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.120]   You'll get discounts.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.120]   You don't even get it.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:01.200]   The post office says they would love it.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:03.360]   They would love you to use Stamps.com.
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.280]   There's even a button on the Stamps.com website.
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:09.080]   You can push the button and say, "Have the mail carrier come and make another pickup today."
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.760]   And they'll do it.
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:14.520]   Stamps.com, it'll print right on your envelope so your company logo, return address.
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.480]   It'll pull the sender's address from your QuickBooks, your address book.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:22.320]   If you sell on Amazon, eBay, Etsy or PayPal or other sites, it'll pull addresses from
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.320]   there.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.880]   It'll fill out the international mailing forms, which is really nice.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.000]   Literally everything you can do with the post office you can do right from your desk
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000]   with Stamps.com.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.040]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:38.840]   This is a good time because the post office just filled with amateurs at the holiday season.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.680]   If you do mailing for your business, you don't want to waste time with that.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:44.520]   Go to Stamps.com.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:47.800]   Right now, click the radio microphone in the upper right hand corner that says, "Hurt us
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.520]   on a radio or podcast."
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.360]   Enter in on our offer code, which is T-W-I-T.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.880]   And then you're going to get $110.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.560]   No risk trial offer.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.920]   $55 in free postage.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.960]   You can use it over the first few months of your Stamps account.
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:03.960]   Free digital scale.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.720]   You just pay shipping and handling on that.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.040]   I think it's $5.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.040]   Not very much.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.800]   It's $5.00 supply kit and a four-week trial of Stamps.com.
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.120]   Cancel in that first four weeks.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:13.120]   You pay nothing.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:14.560]   The scale is yours to keep.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.880]   You just pay the shipping and handling on that.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.840]   Stamps.com.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.760]   There is no better way to do your mailing.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.680]   We do it here all the time and we love it.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.680]   Stamps.com.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.600]   Thank you for their support of this week.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:30.560]   In tech, let's wrap it up with a couple of quick stories.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:33.840]   Swansea, Massachusetts.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:38.480]   The police department there gets bit by the crypto locker virus.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:41.360]   Encrypts all the data on their hard drives.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:46.680]   Says you have 72 hours to pay $750 and get your data back.
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:47.680]   They did it.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:51.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:53.080]   Did they get their data back?
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:54.280]   Yes.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:58.520]   The police department spokesman says we were never compromised,
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:00.760]   except that our malware affected our system.
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:02.480]   And those were the honest crux.
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:04.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:06.600]   Police departments, of course, all over the world are saying,
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:09.440]   if you get a crypto locker on your system,
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:11.960]   don't, whatever you do, pay the money, pay the ransom,
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:13.840]   because that just encourages them.
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.600]   However, if you're one of those people that gets bit,
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:19.080]   and it's the only way to get your data back.
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.120]   No, crypto locker is the perfect virus
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.440]   because it has that credible threat.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.560]   It's like, they really don't care.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.520]   There was zero cost put into infecting your computer.
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:33.440]   There's zero cost to them destroying all of your data.
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:35.080]   All they're doing is locking it up.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.480]   And if it gets lost, all that does
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:41.440]   is bolster the reputation as being a credible threat.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:44.160]   So it's like, crypto locker terrifies the hell out of me.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:45.800]   And to be honest, I don't--
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:48.880]   I don't blame this particular department
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.160]   for spending the money, because I guarantee you the $750
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.920]   was way less than the cost of reconstructing that data
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.320]   after the fact.
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.000]   Well, they probably should have had a backup.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.320]   I hope they have a backup.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.760]   If only there was another sponsor on this week's episode.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:05.600]   I know.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.240]   This is the one show they should have--
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:08.480]   Mentioned.
[01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:11.280]   The word of the year, according to the Oxford Dictionary,
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:14.160]   is, any bets, any thoughts?
[01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:14.880]   Selfie, isn't it?
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:15.840]   I actually--
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:16.600]   Yeah, obviously.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:17.800]   Selfie.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:18.160]   Selfie.
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:19.680]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.200]   I have never done a selfie.
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:23.920]   Lies.
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:24.600]   What?
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:27.200]   Actually, my whole career is a selfie, isn't it?
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:29.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.040]   Because that's the way I'm on that.
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:31.800]   That's all I do.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.880]   If I'm not mistaken, if I'm not mistaken,
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:37.760]   we kicked off this week's NSFW with a selfie from the archives.
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:41.640]   I want to say 2010 or whatever after you've got a hot,
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:44.120]   like, jalapeno peel or some kind of thing.
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:45.560]   Oh, yeah, that was a selfie.
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:50.280]   OK, well, I've never twerked on the show.
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:51.520]   I don't think.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.080]   Bear not you.
[01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:55.000]   Not while I'm on the show, you better be honest.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.560]   It could be worse, the word of the year
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.400]   could have been twerk, maybe next year.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400]   Well, it's something that's selfies.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.400]   You know, some of these are photos of mirrors, right?
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:03.400]   You can actually see yourself.
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.600]   You can comb your hair in your phone.
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.320]   Except for it, 50 apples.
[01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:07.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:11.600]   Speaking of selfie, I'm going to go ahead and put into the chat
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:15.120]   a link to what might have been the original selfie,
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:18.440]   the first selfie in space from HuffPost Science.
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.280]   This is kind of cool.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.280]   This is kind of cool.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:27.320]   In 1966, taking a selfie of himself above in orbit--
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.840]   I assume in orbit-- over planet Earth.
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:30.360]   How are these?
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:30.960]   If you see that?
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:32.480]   It's a very cool selfie.
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:34.000]   And over his shoulders, yeah.
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.720]   I mean, that is a selfie, because you're saying, here I am,
[01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.080]   here's the Earth.
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:41.200]   You won't believe where I'm calling you from.
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:43.720]   And by the way, way to go, Earth.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:46.400]   Nice photo, Mom.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.200]   Trying to jump in on that.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.280]   I love Buzz Aldrin.
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:50.600]   That is the best picture.
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.800]   Wow, is that great?
[01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:52.320]   Wow.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.800]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.080]   That was my favorite interview when
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.360]   I got to interview Buzz Aldrin.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.920]   It was like such a trip to actually meet this guy.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.520]   I don't usually drop names, but that was one name that--
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.120]   that was a name worth dropping.
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:05.080]   I got his autograph.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.960]   I don't usually ask for autographs, but I did get--
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.600]   I've never talked to Neil Armstrong.
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:10.480]   I said to say I never got to talk to him.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:12.520]   I would have loved to have interviewed him as well.
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:13.680]   But yeah, what a guy.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:14.680]   What a guy.
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:15.680]   Yeah, pretty good.
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:19.160]   [CLICKING]
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.120]   Let's see.
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:22.480]   Turn table FM, shutting down.
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:23.040]   That's kind of--
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:25.640]   Yeah, that actually bummed me out for the publicity
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:26.120]   that it got.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.720]   It really was cool, but I always wondered
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:28.720]   how they got away with it.
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.280]   Basically, the idea was you could play your own music
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:36.040]   collection to people listening and then trade off DJs.
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:39.520]   Apparently, there is a turn table live platform.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:44.720]   That's where they're going to focus on live events.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.640]   Don't really understand how that works.
[01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:49.320]   Well, there's another company called Stagit
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:50.680]   that does a similar thing.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:53.560]   And they actually talk to me about doing live magic shows
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:54.960]   or whatever.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.640]   But the idea is, if you're somebody that normally
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:01.880]   would go to your local coffee shop and attract 35 people
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:04.480]   and then hopefully get $3 per person, well, guess what?
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.640]   It's a lot easier to attract 35 people for a live concert.
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:09.280]   It's called Google Hangouts.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:10.320]   Yes, exactly.
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.400]   So the idea is it's a platform, at least with Stagit.
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:18.000]   I can't speak to turn table FM's live stuff.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.960]   But with Stagit, you've got a tip jar.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:21.840]   People could come in.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.960]   They're like, oh, I love getting this concert one on one
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.760]   with you and you're listening to us.
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:26.680]   That's amazing.
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:28.520]   And then here's $5.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:31.040]   And it's like you can make the same $500
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:32.400]   that you would make locally, but you're
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.640]   able to do it globally.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:34.920]   That's cool.
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:39.200]   Warner Brothers admits to issuing bogus takedowns
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:43.600]   and says, hey, nothing you can do about it.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.960]   So apparently, this is, by the way,
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:53.200]   was revealed in the lawsuit against HotFile.com.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:57.080]   The Warner Brothers hired a guy, an employee,
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:59.800]   who just issued a bunch of DMCA takedown requests
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:03.280]   on stuff that was not even Warner Brothers stuff,
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:05.600]   just to harass them.
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:08.000]   And Warner Brothers admitted it.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.480]   And they said, and there's nothing much you can do about it.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:13.640]   And there isn't, apparently.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:14.440]   I mean, they're right.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.960]   That's the way the law is written.
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.480]   Wow.
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.920]   We get DMCA takedowns all the time from companies in Brazil
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:21.480]   and so forth.
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.520]   And I can't really understand it.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.360]   None of their content is on it.
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:26.600]   It's YouTube, almost always, for some reason.
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:28.520]   And it just drives me nuts.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:30.360]   We talked before about the Johnny
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:35.720]   Ive and Marc Newson auction at Sotheby's for a product read.
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:37.240]   It happened last night.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.800]   And you might be amazed to hear what some of these things sold
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:47.040]   for all of it to benefit Bono's red charity,
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:50.200]   to end AIDS in Africa.
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:53.240]   Johnny Ive, for instance, designed a--
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:55.120]   a lot of these were not--
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:56.360]   were just things that they liked.
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:01.560]   For instance, a pair of solid rose gold apple ear pods sold
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:05.160]   for $461,000.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:06.640]   Wow.
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:07.480]   You know, some of them--
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:09.280]   At that point, it's definitely not about--
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:09.920]   Oh, no.
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:10.760]   It's rich people.
[01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:13.480]   It's rich people saying, hey, there's a good cause.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:14.760]   And you can't swallow them.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:17.280]   And I can swallow my headphones in poop gold.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.480]   There you go.
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:20.920]   So there's that.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.920]   Stein--
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:24.920]   That's horrible.
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:27.640]   Now we were talking about the Johnny Ive, one of a kind
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:32.560]   Leica camera that he designed that sold for $1.8 million.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.360]   They were hoping for three quarters of a million.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:37.200]   It definitely pulled in more than they expected.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.480]   And this is the one I bid on.
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.120]   And I'm so glad I got it.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:45.120]   The-- no, I know you're thinking gals, the Christian lubotam boots.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.360]   But no, the Apple Mac Pro, the bright red
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:53.320]   new Mac Pro, $977,000.
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:54.080]   Oh, congrats.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:54.600]   You got that.
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.000]   Yeah, don't try to swallow it.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:56.720]   Just-- yeah.
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:57.440]   It'll be on the set.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:00.000]   I thought it was worth every penny.
[01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000]   Free Apple care?
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.240]   Free Apple care.
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:04.960]   No, I don't think it's throwing in Apple care.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:05.880]   Pretty amazing, though.
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:09.560]   $461,000 for a pair of gold earbuds.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:12.440]   What do you do with a $500,000 computer
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:15.680]   after it's four years old and kind of obsolete?
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:17.200]   You just keep on the shelf?
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:19.840]   I wonder if anybody will use this.
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.800]   No.
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:23.720]   I mean, will it ever get turned on?
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:24.560]   I doubt it.
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:26.520]   I mean, it kind of doesn't matter.
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:29.240]   It's like the object is the lesson right there.
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:29.240]   Right.
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:30.480]   You know, it's like--
[01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:31.720]   It's really pretty.
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.840]   Makes more sense than a golden-crusted cell phone
[01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.520]   that even mark itself.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:37.440]   I think this is just--
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:39.600]   anyway, for a great cause.
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:44.640]   And congratulations to Johnny and Mark, who raised a lot of money.
[01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:46.720]   Major League Baseball and the NFL say,
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:49.920]   if that aerial thing continues, we're not going to go.
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:53.720]   We're never-- you're going to lose the Super Bowl in the World
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:54.120]   Series.
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:58.280]   We're not going to let you watch it on free TV anymore.
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:58:59.320]   They're petitioning-- yeah.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:03.520]   They're petitioning the US Supreme Court to listen or adhere
[01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:06.840]   the broadcaster's challenge of the legality of aerial.
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:11.120]   Ariel is the weird Barry Diller startup where he has dime-sized
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:12.320]   antennas in a city.
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:14.600]   And then you can rent one of them and watch
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:19.480]   the city's local broadcast television anywhere on your iPad.
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:20.080]   If we--
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:21.480]   We talked about this.
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:22.520]   Yeah, we talked about it a lot.
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.440]   We talked about this on-- on frame rate.
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:25.400]   We talked about this.
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:29.200]   And specifically, our take was that, number one,
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.520]   if they did leave broadcast, neither of those institutions
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:33.440]   would lose anything.
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:35.640]   I mean, they would go on to make more money
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:37.200]   with their own individual networks with--
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.040]   No, they're saying they're going to go to paid cable.
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.600]   They're going to ESPN or TV.
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.600]   We're a lot of baseball--
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:41.600]   That's fine.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:43.160]   --football already is, by the way.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:46.200]   You know, Thursday Night Football's on ESPN.
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:48.320]   Here's my issue with this.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:49.640]   They're freaking double dipping.
[01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:51.160]   Are there not ads?
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:53.880]   Do they not show these things for free in New York City?
[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:55.080]   Can you not watch it?
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:57.160]   Do they not make money on the ads?
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:59.760]   They also want retransmission fees?
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:00.760]   Exactly.
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:01.960]   Come on, guys, let's not be greedy.
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:03.120]   Let's talk about change, Leo.
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:05.960]   I mean, the business model was once only advertising,
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:08.080]   in which case, I would think the networks had been jumping
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.400]   for joy over anything that could be free there.
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.120]   Their viewership.
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:13.720]   But now the business model has changed to transmission fees
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:15.200]   and advertising.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.960]   And of course, the aerial folks aren't paying those fees.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:22.520]   Business model, another word for greed in this case.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:23.760]   I didn't say that.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:24.880]   They made plenty of money.
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:28.280]   They get a lot of money with their fees.
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:30.240]   I just think this is absurd.
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:31.440]   It's also a control issue.
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.200]   I think companies want to feel like they can control
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:36.240]   what happens to their product.
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:39.680]   And if suddenly somebody else gets to make money
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:42.720]   by rebroadcasting of the permission, that--
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:43.880]   Well, there's rebroadcasting.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:44.880]   And there's rebroadcasting.
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.120]   If you took the signal and you put it over the internet,
[02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:47.920]   that would be one thing.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:49.800]   But what you're doing is you're renting these antennas.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:53.560]   I understand it's semantics, but it's also the fact.
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.760]   What was that company in Silicon Valley that would rent you
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:59.160]   a DVD player and they would deliver the DVD over the internet?
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:00.960]   And they got shut down before.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:01.960]   Yeah, I do.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.120]   OK, but keep in mind, Zadiva was--
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:07.080]   the problem that shut down Zadiva
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:08.920]   is that they actually had the hardware.
[02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:11.000]   But they were definitely retransmitting
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.360]   without authorization.
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:16.080]   Whereas the ARIO is in a very different position
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:19.000]   because what they're doing is renting specific antennas.
[02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.720]   There's never more than one antenna being used by one
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:23.400]   individual at a time.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:25.920]   And we've already seen precedent established
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:28.720]   by our friends over at Slingbox, where it's like,
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:33.280]   you are allowed to access your own antenna over the internet.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.640]   And so the ARIO is in a little bit different place.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:39.040]   You actually have to have your own cable subscription
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:43.320]   or broadcast or whatever it is that Slingbox is connected to.
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.400]   Whereas with the ARIO-- again, I'm not defending--
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.200]   and I'm not taking a position on this.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:49.760]   I'm just trying to say there are some differences,
[02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:53.600]   I think, between the Slingbox and the ARIO situation.
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.440]   But--
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:57.880]   Not legally, because Slingbox allows you to access
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:02.080]   your distribution service of choice, which you have paid for.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.120]   And that's exactly what they do with ARIO.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:07.560]   You have paid for one individual antenna that's yours.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.680]   And now, granted, none of this says
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:13.360]   that ARIO is necessarily worth the $8 a month
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:14.800]   that they're charging.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:17.680]   But the fact is they've gone extraordinarily out
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:19.280]   of their way to make sure that they're
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.040]   in compliance with the letter of the law.
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.880]   So what's in discussion right now is whether or not
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.640]   they're in compliance with the spirit of it.
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.480]   And this is why you should watch frame rate,
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.000]   because this is the meat of the matter that you discussed,
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.480]   Tom and Brian--
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:32.120]   Tom, Brian Brushwood, do frame rate.
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:34.080]   When do you do frame rate?
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:37.120]   5 p.m. central on the Twit Network right here.
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:38.800]   You just read that off the chat room.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.280]   On my name.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:39.780]   I did.
[02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:43.920]   Ken from Chicago, who's one of our biggest fans.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:45.320]   Twit.tv/FR.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.160]   Hey, we're out of time.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.120]   I do want to thank you all.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.120]   What a great show, Jerry Pournell.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:49.640]   You're the best.
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:50.600]   JerryPournell.com.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.880]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:56.720]   Well, if you haven't read Star Swarm, go read it.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:02:57.720]   It's a good book.
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:02:59.440]   That's a good plug.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:01.600]   We don't often get best-selling authors
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:06.480]   plugging their platinum albums on the show.
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.080]   So I'm glad to hear it.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.720]   Star Swarm is a young adult, right?
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:11.640]   Yes.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:14.160]   Well, it's young adult to adult.
[02:03:14.160 --> 02:03:16.240]   It's like Heinlein's Juveniles.
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:17.000]   You got to read it.
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.760]   And by the way, you can get an audio, hardcover, paperback,
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:20.240]   or Kindle.
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.440]   It's all there.
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:26.080]   On Amazon, Star Swarm by Jerry Pournell.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:26.680]   Thank you, Jerry.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:28.240]   Always a pleasure talking to you.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.000]   I really appreciate it.
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.200]   In fact, you should just everybody just
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:32.240]   buy every one of Jerry's books.
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:35.040]   Because you will lose your first hammer, the Moten
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.920]   God's Eye, Footfall, the gripping hand, Inferno.
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:41.040]   Fall in Angels, Escape from-- you just read them all.
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:42.560]   Just read them all.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:44.640]   I love that.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:48.000]   You will-- well, and so will you.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.200]   Mr. Larry Maggot is at Larry'sWorld.com.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:52.320]   And of course, on CBS Radio All the Time.
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:55.080]   Connect safely.org if you've got kids online.
[02:03:55.080 --> 02:03:55.880]   Good place to go.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:57.600]   And Leo, if I can mention, if you
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:01.280]   go to saferinternetday.us, we have this new campaign called
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:02.200]   One Good Thing.
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.520]   And I think people are going to love this.
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:06.400]   What we want to hear about is something good that you're
[02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.920]   using tech for that's going to improve the world.
[02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:10.480]   Whatever it is, it could be something simple,
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:13.360]   like taking a picture of a dirty lake on your mobile phone
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:14.840]   and organizing a clean up campaign.
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.200]   It could be improving the internet.
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:17.720]   We want to take these One Good Things.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:20.800]   You could put them on saferinternetday.usa or on Twitter,
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:21.680]   whatever.
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.680]   And we want to bring those to Washington, DC on Internet
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:27.000]   Safety Day, February 11, 2014.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.320]   It's not going to be about safety.
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:30.960]   It's going to be about all the positive things that young
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.560]   people and adults are doing online.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:34.680]   So let us know your One Good Thing.
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:37.480]   And we're going to spread the word widely about what people
[02:04:37.480 --> 02:04:40.080]   are doing out there that's going to benefit mankind using
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.040]   technology instead of complaining about bullying
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.000]   and all the negative crap.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:43.320]   It's good.
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:43.800]   I like it.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.800]   Something positive.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:45.880]   Something positive for a change.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.560]   If it weren't for the internet, I wouldn't know about those
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:48.760]   gold pills you could swallow them.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:50.240]   That's right.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.560]   Was there definitely one good thing?
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:53.120]   We'll be sure to feature that in Washington.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:54.040]   Would you?
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:54.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:55.320]   We'll tell it to comment.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.960]   I think the Senate would love to know about that.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]   Yeah.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.920]   Why don't you ask government money in it?
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:02.200]   They could take Fort Knox, grind it up, put it in a little
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:02.400]   tab.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.400]   That's right.
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:05.920]   Brian Brushwood, Frame Rate, NSFW.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.520]   What else you got?
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:08.240]   Oh, look.
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.480]   I don't know about you, Leo.
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:12.360]   But I'm having the hardest time as we approach this Christmas
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:14.520]   season trying to figure out what to get my friends.
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:15.200]   Oh, it's Brian.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:18.160]   Have you heard about scam school store.com?
[02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:19.600]   You mean scam stuff.com?
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:20.400]   Oh, that means that one.
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:20.880]   Yeah.
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:21.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:24.480]   It's like I've got some friends that I want to spend about
[02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:25.440]   10 bucks on.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:26.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:27.440]   And guess what?
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:31.960]   I found out that you can get the rogues flask.
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:32.960]   What's the rogues flask?
[02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.560]   It's an eight ounce flask with a freaking shot glass built into
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.560]   it.
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:38.560]   Freaking shot glass built in.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:41.840]   Hyroglyphs that tip you off out.
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:44.400]   How to do a whole bunch of tricks and also the scam school book.
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.640]   It's all at scam stuff.com.
[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:49.760]   Look, man, I'm really, really excited with what's going on.
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:53.320]   We may do one more sale like around December 1st or whatever,
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:54.880]   but we got these bulk deals.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:57.680]   Take a look at the freaking.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:03.080]   This was designed by by Brant Hughes, who is is the greatest national treasure I've ever
[02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:06.320]   had after Chad, the privilege to work with.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:08.320]   Of course, it's amazing.
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:13.520]   He designed this whole flask and those those symbols around the edges are crib notes to
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:17.760]   do a bunch of scam school tricks so that you can pull, you know, shenanigans on your friends
[02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:18.760]   to mess with them.
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:24.240]   I got to say though, whenever I am I'm wearing handcuffs in a straight jacket underwater,
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:26.840]   I'm glad I bought the rogues ring.
[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:31.800]   Yeah, the rogues ring allows you to escape from police issued handcuffs.
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:37.840]   It's got a built in shim right there and also a serrated edge so you can get out of zip
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:38.840]   ties.
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:42.280]   It's illegal in 48 states, ladies and gentlemen, but if you live in one of the two states in
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:47.480]   the United States where it is legal, please, it's half off right now at scam stuff.
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:50.080]   I love you, Leela.
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:52.840]   Son, are you wearing a rogues ring?
[02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:53.840]   Oh, look at that.
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:54.840]   Dude, they'll never know.
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:55.840]   They'll never know.
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:07:00.440]   And by the way, you'll notice there's different symbols on the rogues ring for another 20 or
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:03.440]   so, uh, scam school effects is crib notes all over you.
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:04.440]   This is good.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:08.440]   So presumably somewhere it explains what those cryptic hieroglyphics mean.
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:09.440]   Oh, yeah, I don't know.
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.040]   We've got a video that walks you through.
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:12.040]   Oh, okay.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.040]   It's just a reminder.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:14.040]   Yes.
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:15.040]   Exactly.
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:18.240]   It's you're like, Oh, I remember it was something to do with numbers and I've heard
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:21.640]   about an ear and it's like it's all there to be honest.
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:24.640]   It's all probably, but, but sure.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:25.640]   How would they know?
[02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:26.640]   I think it's a ring.

[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:00.600]   If you'd like to join the hearty few who like to sit on these extremely uncomfortable
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:05.720]   chairs in my presence for two, three, sometimes four or five hours, you can do that too by
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:06.720]   emailing us.

[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:21.160]   I'm so sorry.
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:24.520]   We had a company meeting last week for our benefits program.
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:25.600]   I sat in the thing for half an hour.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:28.040]   I thought, oh my God, I'm making people suffer.
[02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:30.280]   This is the, my ass is killing me.
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:33.440]   And on that note, another twit.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:41.440]   And that's the most reluctant applause I have ever heard of my life.
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.240]   All right.
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:45.200]   Leo, Leo, let me give you a little bit of advice.
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.200]   Here's what you do.
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:48.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:49.200]   Just say the exact same line.
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.200]   Okay.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.200]   Only end with this.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:52.200]   Okay.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:53.200]   That's a magician trick.
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:57.200]   So you're saying I need to, I don't think I can stand up.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.200]   No, no, no, you can't, you can't, you can't wait.
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:00.200]   I do this.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:03.200]   Another twit is in the can and then just hands up and you'll be in the book.
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:04.200]   Let's try it again.
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:05.200]   Okay.
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:07.200]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:14.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:22.200]   All right.
