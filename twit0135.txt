[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's time for Twit and ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.600]   we have a great Twit panel today.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.560]   Joining us, Jerry Pournell, who hasn't been on in a while
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.640]   because he's not been feeling well and his voice is still
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.320]   a little gravelly, but he says he's going to whisper
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.320]   and it'll sound better.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.320]   Hey Jerry.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.320]   Hi, I'm going to talk soft.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.080]   You sound fine when you talk soft, so just whisper.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080]   And do that.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.600]   The magic of technology we can hear you find.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.720]   We also hear you breathing.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.680]   So whisper, but don't breathe if you don't mind.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.680]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.320]   I don't know if you could figure that out.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.560]   Do that.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560]   Also here, Jason Calicanis, who is, you know,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.440]   basically this is the panel of people who didn't go
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.000]   to the South by Southwest and there's about four of you.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.840]   Jason just finished playing basketball on quick.com
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.000]   and now he's here with us.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.520]   He is a multimedia guy.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   Hey, Jason.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.520]   Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.720]   Always glad to have you on.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.080]   You've become a welcome regular on the show.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   It's getting a little momentum, I feel.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.120]   I think I'm making up for that episode 57, the infamous.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.920]   You know what everybody says?
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.800]   I hated Calicanis when I first heard him, but now I kind of
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.400]   like him.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.720]   And you know, that's what they said about the Vorek too.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.840]   That's what people have been telling me my whole life.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   I hated you at first.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   I met you.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840]   I thought you were a real jerk, but now I really like you.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   Now I like you.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   Story of my life.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.000]   I think it's a sign of a good personality.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.480]   Love them or hate them.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.840]   Also here, somebody everybody loves.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.280]   Will Harris from GB, the UK?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.600]   Seriously.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.760]   You never got a negative review.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.000]   Well, I wish my mother could hear you say those lovely words.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400]   It wasn't to be here.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   After last week's tweet, I thought I'm going to go with the pros.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.600]   Although I thought it was great last week.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.480]   We had Dave Weiner on and I think people, Dave, were on the reaction.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.760]   Dave rubs people the wrong way.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.480]   And I think some of it was people thought he was a little
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.200]   pugnacious, but I don't think he was.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.960]   I think he was just talking about his thing, which was RSS, which I found fascinating.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   Overall, most of the reactions were very positive.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.480]   I have known Dave Weiner for 30 years and he has not changed his style a bit.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.480]   No, he doesn't care if he's abrasive, does he?
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.400]   Not at all.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   And you know what?
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.680]   The guy's got some standing to talk about things.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.080]   So I don't have a problem with it.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.520]   I don't find him abrasive, to be honest with you.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.760]   I've always enjoyed his company.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   Exactly.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.560]   You know, it's like a strong belt to scotch.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.280]   We got a lot to talk about and really a lot of it is gossip.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.560]   Maybe I'll start with the news and then we'll get to the gossip because the news is really
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   boring.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.560]   In fact, you were on with me, Jason, on the gang, I guess they call it now.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.200]   Yeah, the Gilmore gang that we can't call the Gilmore gang because there's some bad
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.400]   blood between Steve and Gilmore and Adam Curry.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   You're kidding.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   That's why?
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.680]   I just, it was some from, I don't know from Steve because I asked Steve a thousand times
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.800]   about it and he would never tell me what one.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.000]   Do you think I can?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.760]   Adam, like, sued him and said, "I own the rights to that name."
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.480]   Basically he said, I heard the second hand, so this is all, you know, respect.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.760]   Adam Curry banned him from using Gilmore gang and he had a contract with him or something.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.720]   And so that, basically Adam Curry killed the gang and nobody wants to say that, but he
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.600]   killed it for a year and then Steve Gilmore came back and started the gang.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.800]   Because the Gilmore gang was originally a pod show show.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.480]   It was one of the first pod show shows and then it got, and right when it started to
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   hit steam and people were really getting into it, boom, he just cut it.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.720]   It was like Dylan going to Woodstock or something and now it's back and it's doing really well.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.600]   But, you know, Steve, it's like the anti-tuit that show, you know, is no structure.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.000]   None of the guests get an introduction and it rambles.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.480]   So it's incredibly insider and stream of consciousness and annoying, but it has moments
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   of brilliance.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   I love it.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   And it's true.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.120]   I didn't know who I was talking to on the call until after it was over.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.840]   Yeah, it's like if it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   Why would it matter?
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.400]   Why would you introduce the guests on a talk show?
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.120]   I guess I know.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.360]   You gotta love that.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.560]   You gotta, that's what this medium is all about is breaking the rules and I think that's
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   fine.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.000]   But one of the things we tried to talk about on there, and frankly it's a snore is when
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.360]   Microsoft did it mix '08.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.800]   So let's just cover it briefly here because it is, I guess there are two mainstream stories
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   from this week.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.800]   One is mix '08.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.000]   Microsoft and Vegas saying the internet is ours.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.160]   Resistance is futile.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:33.520]   The other was Apple announcing its iPhone SDK saying to iPhone developers, "Your apps
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.480]   are, your apps is mine.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.480]   Resistance is futile."
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   Long to us.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.880]   Your apps, but all your apps belong to us.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.840]   We'll deal with those and then we'll get to the fun stuff which is the juicy gossip coming
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.400]   out of South by Southwest, ValleyWag.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   Madness.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Madness.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.480]   If it weren't for ValleyWag, Jason, we would have so much gossip going on.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:03.520]   I think that ValleyWag has changed the entire nature of the internet industry in terms of,
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.280]   there was all this stuff that just wasn't important that now becomes half the conversation.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.800]   It's sort of stupid, you know?
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.600]   But Jimmy Wells is sex life.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.360]   I mean, that is really, I mean, who, I mean, I don't even want to have to imagine that.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   I mean, that is brutal.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.880]   You know, like, of all the things we could talk about, that is perhaps the most revolting.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.280]   More brutal for us than him.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   I don't know.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.280]   I'm pretty brutal for him too.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   Well, you know the thing about it is, are we going to talk about the Jimmy Wells thing?
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.800]   Well, as we don't know, just the cats out the back.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.280]   I think if you start with sex, then you go into Microsoft and Apple and then you come
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.680]   out with sex, you're going to have an overall good show.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   All right.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.280]   So here, let me give you my 10,000 for viewer on Jimmy Wells.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.400]   I think he's one of the most disingenuous, dishonest guys in the business.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.720]   And I think that's, you know, don't mean to be blunt, but, and I'll tell you why.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.240]   I met a guy named Larry Sanger.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.680]   Larry Sanger is the co-founder of the Wikipedia.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.160]   In fact, he's the guy.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.320]   And we'll pull up the Wikipedia.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.160]   We'll hire us and probably do it right now because it's kind of got his and it's, it
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   will explain.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   He always does that anyway, right?
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160]   He agreed it.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   So he's like having a researcher on the phone.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.920]   But anyway, he basically whitewashed Larry Sanger being the co-founder of the Wikipedia.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.320]   And so everybody says Jimmy Wells, founder of Wikipedia.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.000]   And if you say co-founder, he will correct you.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.080]   But even the Wikipedia's who, you know, are basically drunk on Jimmy Juice in a lot of
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.400]   cases, like they will not whitewash Larry Sanger.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.760]   Larry Sanger came to Jimmy Wells who was running Newpedia with the idea of putting a
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760]   wiki together.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.520]   He was the editor of Newpedia, Larry Sanger.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.440]   And Jimmy Wells basically won't give this guy his due as being the co-founder.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.520]   And in fact, there would be no wiki in Wikipedia if it hadn't been for Larry Sanger, which
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.720]   ergo there would be no Wikipedia.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.600]   What was, what was Wales doing before Wikipedia?
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.160]   He was doing a softcore porn site called Bomas.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   Okay.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.920]   Another disingenuous thing.
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.440]   I mean, the guy has got his own revisionist history that once you get into it, you just
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.120]   realize the guy has no ethics.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.880]   I mean, he basically was running a porn site.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.320]   Then he denied he was running a porn site.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.920]   They put it back on the Wikipedia.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.160]   He took it off.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.600]   And that's what this whole thing is about.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.920]   I think is the ethics side of it.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.720]   Forget about the fact of what a sex life is.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.720]   Who cares?
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   It's his business.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720]   Or whether he's...
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.720]   Or whether he's...
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.760]   Or what his expensing is because it sounds like the accountants at Wikipedia handled that
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   properly.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.880]   Well, I think that's sort of an ethics issue.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.320]   If you submit a $1,300 stake bill and...
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.680]   Well, they turned it down though.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   They turned it down.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   I know.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.680]   But if you're running a nonprofit and the guy who is like the figurehead is trying,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.240]   it tries to do something unethical.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.720]   If you try to do something unethical, for me that's the same as doing something unethical.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   In my mind.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.600]   So it's really interesting if you look up on Wikipedia at the moment.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:57.360]   I mean, number one, Jimmy Wells' page has a whole section dedicated to a role of Wikipedia
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   creators and the controversy of that.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.280]   Although if you look at Larry Sanger's page, Larry Sanger is actually credited as co-founder
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   of Wikipedia.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.280]   Right.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.920]   And there's no criticisms on Jimmy Wells' page since this whole thing blew up.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   Isn't that incredible?
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.760]   Like the rest of us who have Wikipedia pages, like the criticism section becomes twice as
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.080]   long as your regular bio.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.280]   And everybody with an axe to grind.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:29.200]   And then they basically are whitewashing his whole, you know, all this stuff is just whitewashed.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   It's unbelievable.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   Jerry, you defended Dave Weiner.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.920]   You want to defend Jimmy Wales?
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.920]   Not a bit.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:41.080]   I actually pay very little attention to my Wikipedia page because people are always putting
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.520]   things on there that just don't happen to be true.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.400]   You were supposed to, Jason, weren't you supposed to put that I dated?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   Who was it?
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.400]   Somebody hot.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   Sharon Stone.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.400]   Sharon Stone.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400]   Yeah, that was the ongoing joke.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.400]   It keeps getting bad and stuff.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   Take it off.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400]   It keeps getting bad and stuff.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400]   Take it off.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400]   It keeps on and off.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   Take it off.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   Take it off.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.120]   But it's, you know, the guy has got an ethics problem, I think.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.720]   And you know, because I know that he, he basically, I had to run in with him as well.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:17.480]   And he basically like had dinner with the guy at the Wikipedia conference and we talked
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.960]   for an hour about how to like put advertising and stuff like that on sites and how to make
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   money.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.920]   And he knew exactly who I was and he came and sat down next to me and talked to me about
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.160]   web logs, Inc. and everything.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.720]   And then he wrote a blog post about how he had no idea that he'd ever met me and I must
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.120]   have been a really boring person or whatever.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.440]   And so he sort of like uses his really dismissive tone.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.520]   I think what you're seeing is like all this pent up like anger towards him because of
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.320]   the sort of disingenuous stuff.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   Well, I think that's what happened with Danny Wool, who's a former board member.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.120]   And a really nice guy.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.600]   I've met him a bunch of times.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.320]   Sweetheart of a guy who worked really hard and he got driven out of the foundation.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.920]   I mean, the whole place is a mess.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.640]   It's too bad too because Wikipedia has a very great potential.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   It's very valuable in many ways.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.320]   I think we can save Wikipedia.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.080]   Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.320]   Well, that's what they're trying to do.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.960]   I mean, the people who are the real Wikipedia and are basically trying to distance themselves
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   from Jimmy Wells.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.280]   And Danny Wool said there was a whole conversation about trying to get the board was trying to
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.120]   get Jimmy off the board and get him just away from Wikipedia.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.960]   And there's a whole Jimmy, Jimmy, Danny Wool has been putting all the stuff at all's world
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.480]   up vlogspot.com and like the stuff coming out is crazy.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.520]   It does feel like there's a bunch of people with a lot of bad feelings that have been
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.080]   pent up who are now just letting it out.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.040]   And Danny's one of them.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.240]   So did we ever decide for Jimmy Wells is far more interesting than anything to come out
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240]   of mix this week?
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.800]   Well, OK, I'm going to change the subject mix.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.200]   I'll tell you what, I'll summarize what I think happened at mix and you tell me where
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   I'm wrong.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   OK.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.560]   Microsoft freaking out because they look, stay, they look old, they look out of touch.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.880]   They look like people's eating their lunch.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.280]   They say, we've got to, we've got to, the thing is designed to reach out to developers.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.760]   We've got to reach out to developers.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.360]   Show them, A, we know that the internet is happening.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.920]   The web 2.0 is happening.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.520]   We have a strategy.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.800]   We are, we're here to play.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.040]   They, you know, a lot of cool demos.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.840]   Steve Ballmer took, I think, a big risk and came off very well by letting Guy Kawasaki,
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.480]   the former Apple Dude, interview him.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.080]   And I think Ballmer showed himself pretty capable of much better than Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.600]   And we'll get to that in a second of handling and interview.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.120]   But ultimately, when it comes out of it is Silverlight 2.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.160]   You know, Silverlight, which was essentially a flat, originally Silverlight 1 was a flash
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.680]   video clone.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.000]   Silverlight 2 now brings .net to the web.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.240]   It is real.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.080]   They've got NBC, you know, it was going to do the Olympics site in it.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.160]   They've got that great demo at Hard Rock Cafe.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.560]   Other than that, what else do you have?
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.480]   Is there anything coming out of that that makes you think Microsoft really does get it?
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.680]   Wait, well, we had IE8, right?
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.680]   So, so what the...
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.440]   Credit to that IE8 and it's going to be standard space, too.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.240]   Yeah, there's three modes of IE8.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.240]   There's an IE6 mode.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.600]   There's an IE7 mode and there's a standards-based.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.240]   They decided, contrary to what they previously decided, to make the standards mode be the
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.240]   default mode.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.240]   That's good.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.840]   So, that's absolutely quite a big thing, although arguably it's about five years too late.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   No, I agree with that.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.600]   Do you think Silverlight is...
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   People are going to download Silverlight.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.120]   Do you think Silverlight's going to get the attention it deserves?
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.760]   Well, Nokia said they were going to put it on some of their new phones.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.680]   So, that's something.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   If Nokia is sort of trying to make a play for much more, you know, with the N80 and the
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   Uno Jason, you've got a Nokia that you stream with, right?
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.160]   Yeah, I have the N95.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:01.520]   So, I mean, listen, the fact that, you know, Apple won't run Flash on their machines is,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.680]   I think, a big part of this story as well.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   You bet.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   Everybody's fighting to have some platform for the interactive web, you know, something
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.200]   that takes, you know, because Ajax was basically a hack, right?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.400]   So now, like, what can we do next?
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:21.360]   Seems like Silverlight, Silverlight, Flash, which is the incumbent, and I guess the iPhone
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.280]   SDK are all going to try to be the place where developers make apps.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.680]   And then you also have OpenSocial and all the apps being made on Facebook.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.720]   So it's sort of back to the future for development platforms.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.920]   Is there, clearly, Apple's not going to adopt Silverlight, I don't think.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.920]   Of course, wait a minute.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.160]   I shouldn't say that because they're using ActiveSync and they're supporting Exchange.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.360]   So maybe they will, I don't know.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.040]   But I have to say, it sounds like if Apple's not going to do Silverlight, they're not going
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   to do Flash.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   What are they going to do?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.800]   Are they going to do SVG or some sort of open source?
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.360]   You know, SVG is scalable vector graphics.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.360]   It's a worldwide web consortium open standard.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.480]   Surely they want everyone just to use QuickTime.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.640]   I mean, nobody's particularly bothered.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.600]   I mean, I say no, he's strictly bothered.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.880]   The major application for Flash on the web is video.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.520]   But QuickTime doesn't have the interactive features of either Flash or Silverlight.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.120]   I mean, yeah, that's what I think.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.720]   Yeah, well, I mean, QuickTime, you can do some interactive.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.600]   It used to, but Apple abandoned it.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   That's the funny thing.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.680]   They were way ahead of the game and early QuickTime had all sorts of interactivity.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   And they had--
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.960]   Does that mean that their Apple is killing Flash because it will compete on a video level
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   with QuickTime?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.360]   But they basically are throwing the baby out with the bathwater because it has all these
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.080]   other great features and interactive and it's got this massive penetration.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.480]   And is it Adobe the company that really helped Mac get massive penetration?
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.160]   I mean, it seems like they're sort of stabbing them in the back.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.920]   That's a good one.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   What?
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.920]   Why would that be new?
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.920]   Well, I mean, yeah.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.320]   Have you noticed what's going on here?
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:08.280]   There was a time when Microsoft was essentially in the standard setting business, but their
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:15.040]   formidable marketing team has become so bureaucratized, they can't even figure out that infinite
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.440]   numbers of the editions of Vista is a stupid idea.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.720]   Why would they be able to figure out how to set standards anymore?
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.320]   They've become such a bureaucracy in what used to be the most powerful marketing outfit
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:36.440]   in the world that is just deteriorating as you watch.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.040]   Well, also, at the same time, I think the world's moved away from Microsoft.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.920]   Does anybody want Microsoft to set a standard?
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.080]   I mean, the things that are when I have open standards.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.720]   People want standards.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   I don't care who sets them.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:56.440]   I guess the problem is the problem is there is no one with the power to make a standard
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.040]   happen anymore.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.320]   It used to be Microsoft could do that.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.240]   They got the default standard just by doing it by making windows, by making it 99% of
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.440]   the market, that's the standard.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   Same thing with I.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.440]   Yes.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.480]   But we at the case now where in actual fact, the standards that went out then are not
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:19.280]   the ones that are trumpeted by any particular major player, but the best standards.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.280]   Is that a danger?
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   Is that a can we think that?
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.400]   That's what it's supposed to be, right?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.000]   I mean, HTML, RSS, OPML, let the market choose.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.480]   I mean, the open source.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.600]   The problem is there's no equality in the market.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.240]   You have people buying the vote.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.800]   Hey, I want to we're going to interrupt this conversation because Robert Scobull has just
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   come on the line.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.200]   Hey, how are you doing?
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.680]   Doing very well.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680]   Everybody.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.480]   Can you hear Robert Scobull?
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.880]   I can hear Robert Scobull.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   Yes.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.960]   You can probably hear him from Austin without any electronic intervention.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:00.360]   Robert just, you know, Robert said, South by Southwest, he just got out of a gossip panel
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   on gossip.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.720]   Yeah, with Valley Way and the New York Times, the whole bunch of people.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:11.440]   We do think session because we talked further about the Mark Zuckerberg interview by Terry
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.840]   and by Jimmy Wales.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.560]   And you know, what we started this show about Robert, and I won't keep you because you probably
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.080]   want to move on somewhere.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.360]   There's probably a party with your name on it somewhere.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   There's like 15.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.440]   So we won't we won't keep you for more than 10 minutes.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.200]   But what we did start this show was saying that Valley Wagg alone has really changed the
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.440]   landscape in technology news.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.520]   All of a sudden we have to talk about Jimmy Wales.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.320]   We have to talk about, well, let's talk about this Sarah Lacey thing.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.880]   So as Mark Zuckerberg does not give a lot of speeches, does not come out in public a
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.280]   lot, certainly doesn't give any interviews.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.120]   He gave what was billed as a keynote, but it was really an interview with a business
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.160]   week reporter Sarah Lacey who's written a book on Web 2.0.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160]   She's also done a Newsweek cover story.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.640]   She's ostensibly a good journalist.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.000]   What you were in the room, Robert, what happened?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.720]   She was hard to explain because there's some body language stuff that you sort of have
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   to watch the video to get the nuance of her body language.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.600]   But a lot of people I've talked to since then, they had seemed like she was flirting
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.240]   with him and that was the body language part of it.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.160]   So let's leave that aside.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.000]   She asked a lot of questions that have already been covered in the media.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Let's back up.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.480]   The South by audience is different than any other audience that you'll ever speak.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.960]   That's the first thing to say is these guys are interactive.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   They talk about-
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   Well, first of all, they're interactive.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   They're on Twitter.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.440]   I mean, I walk into a party and everybody's like talking to me about what's going on in
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.720]   Twitter in the last five minutes.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.000]   And who's giving you this or who's this or what's going on with that?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.560]   And it's all Twitter conversation.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.440]   In fact, the parties here are being planned in live time on Twitter.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.840]   I have a video of how we got tired of waiting in the Google line and we just started a
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   party within eight minutes.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   That's fun.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.560]   And with an hour, there were 60 people at the party.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.360]   Mike, I think it's been bitching about the fact that Twitter's taken-
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.080]   South by Southwest has taken over Twitter.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.640]   And I did in fact dump some people who were going-
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.160]   were kind of meaningless.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.280]   But I have kept a lot of people.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.160]   It is kind of fun to watch this at a distance.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.600]   This is where Twitter had a coming out party last year.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:26.720]   And it is the place to see what's going on in Southwest, at least in 140-byte-care.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:33.600]   So you get a little bite, but not much of it.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.960]   So I think she- I don't know that she's ever been to Southwest.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.520]   And I guess that's a lesson for future speakers.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.200]   You shouldn't accept this job unless you've been to.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:47.440]   Because you need to understand this audience is a very heavy web developer audience.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   It's a very creative audience.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.800]   A lot of- there's filmmakers walk around.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.360]   There's musicians walk around.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:58.240]   But it's a very technical audience and a very tied in to the hardcore audience.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.160]   In fact, I bet most of your audience, you know, most of the people in-
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.640]   South by Southwest live in the Twit.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:11.560]   I bet if you ask in a session how many people know who Leo Laporte is, I bet all the hands
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   would go up.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.440]   Let me read- I'm going to read some of your Twitter posts as this thing developed.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.720]   So you started- I'm not at the Zuckerberg speech.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   I'm leaving Hilton now.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.560]   I'll solder over there to find out if he said anything interesting.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.760]   Then you say he's giving a lot of PR answers.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.800]   Lacey's asking too many business questions.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   Twitter.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   And Lacey.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.920]   Sarah Lacey lost control of the interview.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.600]   Twitter's going crazy with Twitter critiques.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.000]   She's getting defensive now.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.560]   Poor empathy for the audience.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.600]   The audience is asking better questions.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.320]   I've never seen such a bad interview of anyone on the stage here totally disappointing.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.680]   I mean, it's just- it's- is she mad at you?
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.800]   Well, she said, yeah, on her Twitter.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.400]   She actually Twittered toward me and I just put her in a apology store.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.040]   Is she blaming you for what happened?
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.200]   I think she's very defensive.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.280]   She doesn't- I don't think she understood what was going on on stage.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.160]   I think she just didn't understand what this audience was expecting.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.360]   You said it was even worse in the overflow room.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.360]   What were people saying?
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.800]   Well, people were saying exactly that.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.360]   Where's the hard question?
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.440]   Where's the- why are you asking about being a billionaire or why are you asking such softball
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.600]   questions and not forcing them to answer the PR speak that-
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.480]   But is it possible-
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.840]   Is it possible that's why she was interviewing him because he knew her-
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.400]   I don't think so.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.040]   I don't- the reason she was interviewing him is-
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.840]   I have the inside line on this, by the way.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   All right.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   Jason Calicanis with her story.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840]   Go ahead.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   Okay.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.400]   She wrote a book about like Kevin Rose and Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.160]   And I had dinner with her in France and a bunch of people.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.080]   And she is really into Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.680]   I mean, she calls him like Zuck.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.000]   And she was like dropping his name.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.640]   Like, oh, Zuck this and Zuck that.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.440]   I'm gonna throw up in my mouth.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   Excuse me.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   I would just-
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.440]   Oh, God.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.840]   I think she really likes the guy.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   She's married.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.840]   She's got her husband.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   I had dinner with her husband.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   It's very cool.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840]   I don't think it's that kind of thing.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.400]   But as a journalist, I've watched her operate.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.720]   She flirts with people to get information.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.240]   It's how she does what she does.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.640]   And she was in front about that.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   We were talking-
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.960]   The South by Southwest audience would hate that.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   Oh, of course.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.920]   You have- And then she- I don't think that she's a particularly good interview because
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.680]   I certainly do another interview.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.920]   And so being- What makes for a good journalist in print versus what makes for a good host
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.880]   on a show like Twit or whatever, it's two very different things.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.320]   And on stage and being able to ask hard questions and shut up and let the person answer.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.800]   Very, very different skill set.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.960]   I don't think she has that skill set.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.320]   And she's developed a personal relationship with him, which is really annoying if you're
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.440]   in the audience because nobody knows what you're talking about.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.120]   And if you're a fanboy, then it's even worse.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   Go ahead.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.120]   And she brought several of that.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.760]   She made the story about her.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.920]   She talked about hanging out with him last night at parties.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.160]   And I do that on my blog all the time, but people give me a shit about it.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.800]   And I know I'm sensitive to it when I'm on stage.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.680]   I know that that's- That's not good journalism.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:59.440]   And I get beat up all the time for doing softball interviews because I don't want to- I understand
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.560]   how she feels and I'm sympathetic for her.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.400]   But I also think it's really interesting to see an audience at a conference stand up
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400]   like this.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   You don't see that.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.920]   Well, she just built up- The motion you're seeing in my Twitter was what the audience
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.520]   was feeling and what- This is like the matter.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   It doesn't revolve.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.920]   They're about the pitch- Pitchforks and torches here.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.920]   Burn the monster.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.960]   It got worse because at one point she made a flip answer to Zuckerberg.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.800]   Zuckerberg said something like, "Ask me a question."
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.520]   And the whole audience just erupted.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.400]   I've never seen it for 20 seconds.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   They applauded.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   Like, thank you.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:44.920]   Somebody's asking her to ask a question, not just, you know, go on about herself.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.640]   And then she got defensive.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.160]   And that was absolutely the wrong thing to do because she didn't understand where that
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.560]   feedback- that fervor was coming from.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:58.160]   And she got defensive and then she felt that she lost control of the interview at that
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.400]   point and the audience basically took it over.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.920]   And then everybody was cringing.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:09.800]   It was not a comfortable interview at that point to be in the audience of.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   Interesting.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.960]   I've been there.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:17.440]   I mean, I think, you know, there's some analogy here too, like when Dave Weiner heckled me
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.440]   at NOMEDEX.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.040]   Yeah, Dave, it really gave you a hard time for being too commercial in your speech at
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   NOMEDEX.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.040]   Right.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.040]   And I, you know, I basically give the same talk.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.800]   I talk for one-third about an industry issue.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.200]   I talk for a third about what I'm doing.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.720]   And then one-third I have the audience ask questions.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.120]   I'm doing it for over a decade.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.120]   It works fine.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.880]   But he felt compelled to yell at me from the back row, like you're spamming us and he didn't
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.480]   want to hear about Mahalo even though I was there to talk about Mahalo, whatever.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.400]   But the point is these events in our industry has changed and blogging is what did it.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.520]   The people in the audience, because they're bloggers and Twitter is a level playing field
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.200]   and you can tell Scoble, he's an ass or you can tell me I'm an ass and you can get direct
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.360]   contact with us.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.280]   And because blogs, you know, Alan Stern from Center Networks is like, and Matt Ingram,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   like these two nobodies.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.960]   I'm putting my, you know, air quotes on nobodies.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.440]   Two nobodies are in the top five, ten links on tech meme every day.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.280]   You know, they have equal share of voice now.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.800]   And so people are sitting there in the audience and they believe I have equal share of voice.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.680]   It's my right to stop the person on the audience on the stage because I'm as important as
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   them.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   It's my time to.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.680]   And it's just a different vibe now.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.160]   And in some ways it's better.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.160]   And then in some ways it gets really ugly like this.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.680]   It's got a terrifying nose to it.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:30.600]   I've seen audiences in the early 90s do this.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.880]   I was in a Shelby Steel Beach one time and audience did exactly the same thing.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.320]   So it's happened in audiences before.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.120]   It's this one because everybody's so tied in.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.600]   I don't know if Twitter is making a mob mentality.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.840]   Yeah, the back channel, the back channel means that people can, you know, it's, it's
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.720]   I've been in mobs before.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.160]   Things happen in mobs.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.120]   You do things you would never do because the mob acquires a personality of its own.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.040]   I've never, it's interesting to see something like Twitter become that, that medium for
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   that.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.160]   It happened at the web like three, four years ago.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.520]   I remember when Mina Trot was on stage and the back channel and crazy.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.200]   And I told Le Week, I was like, I don't really want to speak at Le Web.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.280]   I'll, I'll take a pass.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.000]   I'll just be an audience member or something.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.920]   If you're going to put a big IRC behind me.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.680]   So people can be like, Hey, you know, jerk off.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.200]   You know, it's like, if somebody wants to be, you know, confrontational, step up to the
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.680]   microphone, right?
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   Tell me your name.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.680]   Tell me what company you're with.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.680]   Ask me a question.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.200]   You know, that's the way I feel about it.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.080]   Let's have, let's, let's go at it.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   I'll mix it.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.640]   No, it's funny, Robert, because you used to be a regular in my chat room of the radio
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.880]   show and I always used to call you guys, the wise ass kids in the back of the room.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.800]   And I actually enjoyed it, but I could see what you were saying.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.120]   I actually want to give a talk with Twitter both in front of me so I can see the feedback
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.920]   as well as in back of me.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:05.000]   Because I, I find that to be challenging as a speaker, but not, it's not for every speaker.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It's unfortunate that Sir just didn't know why the audience turned on her at that point.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.800]   And then she got defensive about it and, and, and couldn't save it, couldn't make a joke
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.440]   to pull it back or, or, you know, get, get control of the situation again.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.160]   That's just lack of experience that, and that can happen to anybody.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.040]   It's, you know, I wouldn't do it.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   I believe me.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   I would not do as well.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.640]   That's a tough thing to.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   Okay.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.640]   Let's take audience questions.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.000]   I just, I, you know, walk off the stage at that point.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.840]   By the way, I just got a Twitter from Kevin Rose.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.920]   He's heading with Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   Zuck.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.520]   Because that's what Kevin calls him to apparently to the Shakespeare's come out.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.320]   I know you want to get there, Robert.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.520]   Real quickly though, before you go, how's a South by Southwest?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.520]   It's a great conference.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.520]   I got it.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.880]   It's not so much that you're going to learn a lot in the, in the sessions.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.160]   Although sessions have been very good.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   It almost feels like a gathering of some kind.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.640]   It's a gathering of the tribe of the Twitter tribe.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   It feels like Woodstock.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.000]   It felt like that last two years ago, more so last year, but this year really, it seems
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   like everybody is there.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Well, it's bigger.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.840]   I think they added a thousand to two thousand people to the interactive this year.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   And it's definitely bigger.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.440]   You don't really care because if you can't get into one party, you go to the next one.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.560]   If you can't get into that one, you find a bar that's empty in your Twitter and within
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.200]   an hour, 60 people show up.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   I mean, it's just incredible the way that you can organize things here.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.640]   And in certain cases, organize against her at the same speed.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.040]   Well, so I'm sorry for my part.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.240]   It's tough to be at the middle of a firestorm.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.200]   I've been in the middle of a firestorm.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.880]   I've been on Valley Web 25 times.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:59.360]   I'm sorry that Sarah had a bad day and hopefully at some point we can sit down and I'll discuss
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.320]   with her what went wrong if she wants to learn what went wrong.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   Wow.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.160]   Sounds like Larry Niven's Flashcrowds in action.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   It is, isn't it?
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.400]   Exactly what it is.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.400]   It's the Flashcrowd.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.800]   Well, Kevin Zucker had in a Shakespeare scope.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.600]   You got to get over there.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.600]   The scope.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   The scope.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   The bubble.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.040]   I really appreciate your calling and writing.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   Take care.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   Robert Scobel.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   There you go.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   I thought we'd get a...
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.120]   I love this.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.720]   Breaking news.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.600]   Direct from the scene, Robert Scobel.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.920]   Back to you.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.680]   So, and by the way, Jimmy Wales, he's having dinner with friends and I know that because
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.560]   I'm on his following him on Twitter.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.560]   So, should I...
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.320]   He's supposedly on Necra Island this weekend.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.040]   So, the direct message, Jim, Jimmy, the stakes on me, I don't know.
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.080]   I think he's on Necra Island.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.080]   What's Necra Island?
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.440]   Necra Island is what's his name's island.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   Richard Branson's.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:59.640]   There's some summit going on there this weekend for global warming.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.440]   But there's a really interesting post up on Danny Willsding that he just posted like
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   in the last hour.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.160]   Basically saying there's an inside...
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.520]   This is the first anybody's going to hear about this because his post literally got
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.280]   out like a minute or two ago.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.640]   He emailed me.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   There's some...
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.520]   He's got some conspiracy there going that...
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.280]   Because Danny was involved with the board and worked there.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:26.240]   That elevation partners is trying to basically commercialize and move the Wikipedia from
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.680]   a nonprofit into a for-profit.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   Well, that's really interesting.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.400]   I was at a meeting on Monday with...
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.520]   That Robert McMe happened to be at.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.920]   And he was talking about...
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.720]   How much can I talk about this?
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.600]   Well, he's mentioned in this post, I think.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.000]   He was talking about the notion of exactly that.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.240]   And he said something, kind of my jaw dropped.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.480]   He said, "Oh, Google's dead.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   Google's history.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.560]   You can't index the web."
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.000]   He sees these kinds of privatized Wikipedia as the future of search.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   In a way, that's what you're doing.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   No, no, I...
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   It's an expert search.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.160]   I think people see it.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.840]   I mean, the writing's on the wall.
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.880]   But this is really interesting.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.680]   He says here, "Jimmy informs Sue, and Sue is somebody who works there.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.160]   This is in June of last year.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.880]   She must meet with Roger McNamee of elevation partners in San Francisco that Monday before
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   the holiday.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.720]   But this must be kept discreet.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.840]   She flies there, flies back the same day.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.360]   Then they put this guy, Eric Reson is from the board, then becomes a full-time person.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.360]   Then he goes and meets with Roger McNamee of the elevation partners, which is Bono's investment
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.040]   firm.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   Very interesting.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.080]   I think what they're trying to do, I mean, this is really interesting.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:50.320]   If they're trying to take the nonprofit and then convert it into a for-profit, I mean,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.960]   this could be a couple of billionaires come out of this.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.080]   It's really sketchy what's going on here.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.760]   It's almost a little bit of a coup, isn't it, at this point, where...
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:06.120]   I mean, the same thing happened remember to the CD service, what was that called?
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.920]   We don't know what you're talking about.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:12.320]   We looked up the CD where basically the community had developed this...
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   CDDB.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.680]   CDDB had developed this database and then went private.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.600]   I wonder if the same thing happened with Wikipedia.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.000]   There'd be a hell of an outroar.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.200]   Isn't that impossible?
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.200]   I mean, isn't all...
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.680]   Well, here's what happens.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.200]   Isn't the particular license that Wikipedia is licensed under...
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.320]   You are correct, you are correct.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.520]   But then look at this.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.520]   December 1st, Sue assumes role of executive director.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.400]   Jimbo announces that the Wikimedia Foundation will adopt a creative comments compatible
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   license.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.680]   And this is what they've been trying to do for a while.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.160]   Even insiders like David Girard seem surprised.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.520]   The decision was announced at the San Francisco party hosted by elevation partners.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.760]   So it seems like what they're trying to do is the inside board members are trying to
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:05.960]   restructure the license of Wikipedia in order to basically steal it or leverage it in some
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.120]   way.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.360]   And make Jimmy a lot of money.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   It's basically what it is.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.960]   I mean, from what I heard from the insiders, Jimmy Wells is extremely frustrated by the
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:22.400]   fact that he basically turned the new PDF into Wikipedia, made it a non-profit.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.360]   And it was like the reason he made it a non-profit was it had like $3,000, $4,000 a month in bills
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.040]   did he want to pay.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.640]   And so spent it all of a sudden, he makes it a non-profit.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.320]   He doesn't pay much attention to it and explodes.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.560]   And it would be worth $5 billion today easily.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.640]   That's the conversation you had with him.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   He's just add ads.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.280]   And it would be worth $100 million in advertising a year and it would pay for everything.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   And so...
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   And he produced that.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.840]   He said, "No, I'm going to stay pure."
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.320]   Adding ads would corrupt it.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.320]   Right.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.800]   So here's the email that he posted to the Wikipedia list on October 15th in 2006.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.960]   "I would like to gather for the communities of some examples of works you would like
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.680]   to see made free Dream Big.
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.800]   Imagine there existed a budget of 100 million to purchase cop rights to be available under
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   a free license.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.240]   What would you like to see purchased and released under a free license?"
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   Photo libraries, textbooks.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.640]   I was recently asked this question by someone who was potentially in a position to make
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.640]   this happen.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.880]   And he wanted to know what we need, what we dream of, that we can't accomplish on our
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.280]   own or what we expect to take a long time to accomplish on our own.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.280]   So basically, there's some sort of...
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.000]   I mean, this is like three days of a condo or something like that.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.760]   There's some deep French connection stuff going on here.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.920]   And Danny Wool was the guy who was there who was like Jimmy's assistant during the time.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.400]   And he's got all the emails.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.200]   So obviously he knows the story.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.840]   Jerry, you've been covering this industry for 30 years.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.120]   Is this the kind of stuff that's always gone on and it just wasn't as public?
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.680]   Or are we in a very interesting Wild West phase here?
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.920]   I think we're in a Wild West phase.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:59.760]   I think back in Dave Winters' Day, there was a lot more social responsibility.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.160]   And nobody thought they would become billionaires out of this stuff.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.840]   Millionaires maybe, but not billions.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:13.040]   Now there is so much money out there that it's the usual.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:19.720]   The free market will eventually drive itself to selling children in the marketplace.
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.200]   Slavery, human meat.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.120]   I mean, without regulation, the market will do anything.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.720]   And so because so much money has gotten into this, it's just completely gotten out of hand.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.440]   There is so much money.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:40.320]   If you offer a billion dollars, there is nothing that somebody won't do.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   And by nothing, I mean...
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.320]   Adam bombs, poison.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   Now that's so much money that you and I would not do some terrible things for it, but someone
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.320]   would.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:37:00.160]   Now, my sense of your politics is that you are not a big government guy.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   You're not interventionist, but this and this where government comes in?
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   Of course, look, I made no secret.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:20.960]   I am conservative with a libertarian vector, but you must have government.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.440]   Otherwise, the market will just drive itself to the least common denominator.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   Jason, you're the ultimate capitalist and entrepreneur.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   You agree?
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.440]   Is that what we're seeing here?
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.440]   Is there so much money that Jimmy Wales and the board would just go, "Who cares?
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.440]   It's billions.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.440]   There's...
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.320]   I think there's two things that are colliding that's different than before.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.840]   You have this open source movement.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:46.360]   I mean, there's always been people who are in technology and typically they love technology,
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.560]   which is myself included.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.760]   And the fact that it's a growing space so you can make a lot of money.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.720]   But I didn't get into computers because I could make a lot of money.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.600]   I got into it because I had a passion for it, which is basically, I think, majority of people.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.840]   If you came into it just for the money, you're probably going to fail.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.520]   You have to love what you do, obviously.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.280]   Because you've got to do it for seven days a week, ten hours a day.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:12.440]   But what's different now is there was this whole nonprofit, goody-touchews, open source
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.680]   space.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.720]   We're all going to build these nonprofit, open source companies and we're just doing
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.040]   it for the good of the community.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.960]   And it was all very lovey-dovey like Wikipedia.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.680]   And then all of a sudden people say, "Oh, my SQL's selling for a billion dollars."
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.320]   You can actually make open source.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.480]   It's just a marketing tool in some ways.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   It's a marketing program.
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.320]   So if you have a creative--
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.880]   That's depressing.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880]   It's true, though.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.000]   If you think about it, an open source license, basically, if you-- or creative commons license,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.920]   creative commons is a better way to say it.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.680]   Creative commons is a marketing tool, maybe not open source as much.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.120]   But creative commons is saying, "Oh, well, anybody can take my content.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.960]   As long as they link back to me, what is the currency of the web?"
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.760]   Links, right, according to Google.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.400]   So it's just basically syndication without getting paid and getting paid by the link.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.120]   And so what you see happening here is, "Okay, let's take all this content.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.120]   We'll make it free.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.280]   Maybe we'll move it over to Jimmy's Wiki, and get the people from-- and Jimmy hired a
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.360]   bunch of people from Wikipedia to come work on Wikipedia.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.320]   And there's massive confusion in the market as to are they separate companies.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:17.520]   Most people think Wikipedia search is a part of Wikipedia.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.520]   Right.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.760]   And that's the for-profit arm of it, Wikia.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.440]   Wikia is Jimmy Wells' company, background metric capitalist, that he's basically-- and
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.080]   the real inside track there is, they basically won't allow certain types of content on Wikipedia.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   Right?
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.600]   If you try to put episode guides or the 15th or 20th Jedi Knight in Star Wars, they tell
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.560]   you, "No, go put that on Wikipedia."
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.560]   Right.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.560]   "Oh, who owns Wikipedia?"
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.560]   Oh, Jimmy Wells does.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560]   Yep.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.560]   So they're basically anchoring the Wikipedia.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.840]   Not-- they basically-- and this is the huge conflict of interests that I think could get
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.800]   them into a lot of trouble.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.880]   Perhaps even financial trouble is if you're saying, "Take the assets off of this site
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.880]   and go put them onto this for-profit one."
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   Oh, man.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.120]   There's something funky going on there.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.760]   Now, what they can fall back on is, "Oh, well, the license says, you know, there's a
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   lot of gray here."
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   You know, like, "Oh, there's a license.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.920]   It's-- anybody can go take this work.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.920]   It's free."
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.080]   So, you know, Leo, you can make Wikipedia to and take it and whatever.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.080]   Go wrong with it.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.160]   But it's all pretty shady in my mind.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.360]   Will, you got any thoughts on this?
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.760]   I'm just absolutely amazed by the phrase "Wookie-Pee."
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.760]   [laughter]
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.680]   And put it to anything that--
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.840]   It's actually the busiest Wikisite-- oh, Wikia-- Wikia site of all.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.440]   It's huge page views.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.880]   Man, that is just that blazed my mind.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.880]   [laughter]
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.120]   But you know what I mean?
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.480]   It's so weird, this whole becoming such a ridiculous, you know, web celebrity.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.360]   Because remember, we had web celebrities in Web 1.0?
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.040]   And, you know, it sort of didn't mean much.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.440]   It meant you got some press on TV.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:59.160]   But now it's like, it means that people are, like, obsessing over you and, you know, getting
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.760]   your chats of your five or six different affairs.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.560]   I mean, Baliwag feeds into that.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:10.400]   But I wonder if we slightly overstate its importance.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:17.440]   Because fundamentally, you know, web celebs are an easy way into a story there.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.680]   And it's also an echo chamber.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.240]   I mean, we all hear this because we're in the, you know, in the mix.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.880]   But does the jet-- I mean, you go out on the street.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.520]   Does anybody know what's going on?
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.520]   Well, I mean, that's it.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:32.200]   I mean, web celebs are an easy way for the man on the street to get a story about technology
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.480]   and about the internet.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   And as the internet and technology gets more and more important, so these stories become
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.080]   a little bit more high profile, you know, whether it's Zuckerberg and his, you know,
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.680]   girlfriend or whether it's Wales and his activities.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:57.200]   And I think-- I think that the collaboration in Gossip, or sorry, the correlation in web
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:05.120]   Gossip, web-celebrities and time is going up in-- based on how important the internet
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   and technology is.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.400]   Well, I think that's exactly what Jason was saying is that now it's mainstream.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:15.000]   On Baliwag or something, you know, which is sort of picking up on the trend but isn't
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.640]   necessarily driving it.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   Wow.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:22.640]   I just-- it feels like it all changed on this show.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.840]   I mean, I know this is something that's been building up for a long time, but we're watching
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.040]   it happen right now, almost in real time.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:39.080]   I mean, the funny thing is that-- I was here to talk about mix and Apple's SDK and what
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.080]   happens.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.600]   It's about Sarah Lacey and Wikipedia.
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.280]   So we are an echo shot.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.280]   This weekend Gossip, yeah.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.160]   Yeah, there's an underestimate.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:54.320]   This weekend Gossip, indeed, but how much of this gets beyond that conference?
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:00.720]   I mean, I can remember big crises when we used to go to the hackers' conference, but
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.840]   nobody ever heard of them outside of our talking to each other.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.840]   Good point.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   Good point.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.840]   I mean, that's the-- I guess that's the ultimate thing.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.560]   I mean, in a way, if you'd want to talk about Silverlight, you want to talk about the SDK,
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.880]   these are things that are going to make a difference.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.240]   These are things that change people's lives.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:23.160]   I think the iPhone SDK is going to change very many lives.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:29.240]   I've just recently started playing with an iPhone, which was oddly enough, bought for
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:35.000]   me by a consulting group because they wanted my opinions on it.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.800]   So they sent me an iPhone to play with.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.480]   And it's a lot of fun, but I think that SDK is going to just change the world.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.040]   It's what the iPhone needed.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.680]   I mean, the iPhone's a great platform, but it's a platform.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.080]   And without apps, what do you got?
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:59.200]   You may remember that in the mode in God's eye in 1974, I described the pocket computer,
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:06.080]   which in those days was just that pulled it out of my fingernails, or somewhere.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:14.440]   But the fact is that I described a utility tool, something that if you had one, you would
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.080]   really love it.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.000]   And we put that in the story.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.960]   Well, I have one in my pocket now.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   It's an iPhone.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.880]   It's a little crippled.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.600]   It doesn't do a lot of the things, but it has a lot of memory.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.440]   It has a lot of computing power.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.280]   It has a lot of potential.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.600]   There is no reason it can't do many of those things.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   The developers are complaining about a couple of things.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.960]   First of all, of course, the initial complaint is that the only way to put an app on the
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.840]   iPhone is to go through Apple.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.920]   You can make free apps, but if you want to charge for it, Apple takes 30%.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.560]   Now they're going to put an app store on iPhone 2.0.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.840]   It'll be available right there on your iPhone, and that's got to be of some value developers.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:00.000]   But some developers are saying, "I don't want to give Apple 30%.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.160]   There's no choice."
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.840]   The other one that's maybe even more significant, and that people are determining this from
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:11.960]   reading the EULA and reading the SDK, is that you cannot multitask on the iPhone, that
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.920]   if your application is running and the phone rings, your application will quit.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.600]   There is no state from application to application.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.300]   Nothing can run in the background, and some developers are saying, "Whoa, that really
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.000]   limits what we can do."
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.080]   Of course it does, but this is the first edition of the iPhone 2.
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:36.080]   And EULA's changed, SDK's changed, nothing fixed in stone.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.280]   This is not 1.0.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.280]   This is like 0.75.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.280]   That's a good point.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   It's a good point.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.600]   A couple of really interesting things on that with the SDK.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:52.640]   Number one is that Apple caved to the pressure to let people run their own apps or how it
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.640]   is.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.440]   But they're obviously still very, very keen to make sure that whatever anybody else does,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:06.040]   like, "Okay, you can have your apps," but nothing is going to alter or impinge or detract
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.000]   from our iPhone experience.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.240]   Everything you can put on this phone is going to hinder anything on the iPhone.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.840]   So as soon as the phone rings, your app is going to get dumped and we're going to go
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:19.680]   back to Apple's iPhone experience.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.560]   We can't afford for any kind of memory-hogging application.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.120]   And I have to say, on Windows Mobile, that's one of the problems on Windows.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   That's the major problem.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:37.040]   Do you not think this is the right idea that Apple is doing the right thing by making it
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.520]   it is after all a telephone?
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.520]   Right.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:41.520]   And you want it to be?
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   Yeah, I absolutely agree.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.680]   I think it's exactly the right thing to do.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:51.640]   And the other thing is that the major problem, Apple's biggest nightmare has got to be that
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.920]   someone writes a program for the iPhone and it's a virus.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:00.160]   And suddenly the headlines everywhere are major iPhone virus breaks out.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:01.160]   Everybody's screwed.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:05.640]   And that is such bad PR and that just makes Apple see every other platform out there.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.800]   So by restricting it to, you know, you've got to sign your code, you can only go through
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.440]   our platform, et cetera.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.800]   I think they're doing the right thing because there is no, you know, there is not going
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.240]   to be any malicious code getting through there.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.000]   And that is a better user experience.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.600]   The trade-off is some freedom for a developer versus an awesome user experience.
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.120]   And if you're Apple, you can see why you'd go for the awesome user experience because
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.720]   your entire reputation is built on an awesome user experience.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   Here, here.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.840]   Two things, one, they plan this all along.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.520]   So it's not like they bow to, you know, people say we have to allow applications.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.520]   They plan this all along.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:47.320]   Just Steve Jobs is not going to, you know, even discuss with any of us mere mortals,
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.880]   you know, when he's going to put applications on there.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.560]   If he's going to do it, he just said, you know, he just didn't answer questions about
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:54.560]   application.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.560]   We'll do it.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.560]   We'll do it when we do it.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.560]   And so he planned it all along.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.200]   Before somebody writes an application that like records your phone call and like streams
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.680]   onto the web somewhere and like makes a, or turns on your, you know, turns on your phone
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.720]   and automatically dials and like, you know, it lets you eavesdrop on it.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.600]   I mean, it's a really dangerous thing to develop on these things.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.720]   So of course they have to make it closed.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.840]   But I think that there are kinks in Apple's armor, you know, like we always say on this
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.520]   show and other ones, like when you're, when you're winning, you can be closed when you're
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.520]   losing.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.520]   You go for open, right?
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.280]   So Google searches, you know, sort of a black box because they're winning there.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.080]   But you know, on the phone, they're totally open.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:42.400]   And you know, if you look at Apple, they have massive, you know, market share and itunes
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.680]   and mp3s and whatever and selling songs.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.960]   So they're closed and the iPhone, they're going to have massive market share.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   They're going to be closed until people like Amazon come along and Amazon's been selling
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.360]   these non DRM mp3s.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.960]   And I'm hearing more and more every week.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.120]   It tells me, Hey, I'm buying mp3s on Amazon.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   Because I don't, you're doing it too.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   Right.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.360]   I went to the site and I actually looked at it.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.360]   It was a little clugee, you know, that it wasn't as elegant as itunes.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.120]   But I was like, but they're 256 kilobits.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.200]   They're cheaper and they're unprotected.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   And yeah.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.280]   And so who wants to have to take, you know, if I have to go to iTunes, buy a song, rip
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.480]   it to a CD and re rip it back to get it, you know, or use some hacking software.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   It's obvious choice.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.640]   So now that that and all the music companies are like, yeah, let's sell on DRM music.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:30.120]   And if Amazon lets us set the price, which Steve Jobs won't, people are going to go
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.120]   to it.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.120]   I mean, Steve is very,
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.920]   What happens when Amazon comes along and says, Mr. Jobs, we'd like to do an application
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.360]   on the iPhone.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.480]   He'll probably come up with some way to block him.
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.080]   I mean, he's not selling them, right?
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.400]   Yeah, they won't let people.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.280]   But doesn't that then open him to antitrust?
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   Exactly.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.320]   I mean, that's going to happen at some point with the iTunes.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.280]   I mean, you know, Microsoft is getting, you know, their butts kicked all the time about
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.280]   antitrust stuff.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:56.520]   You know, the fact that I can't plug another MP3 player into iTunes and download my music
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   is kind of weird.
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:02.720]   I mean, nobody ever brings it up because no other MP3 player is anywhere near as good
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.240]   as, you know, your iPod except now I have this Nokia phone.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.800]   I would like to sing podcasts onto it through iTunes.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.040]   I would like to plug my blackberry into iTunes.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.200]   And so he's going to be closed until it makes business sense to be open or the government
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   gets involved.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.720]   If you're a chess player, if you're a chess player, and I would never want to play chess
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.680]   against Steve Jobs because he clearly looks many more moves ahead than I do.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.960]   But if you're a chess player, you might say this is a blunder because he's made a move
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:33.000]   that inevitably leads to antitrust regulation because the next step is Amazon says, great
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.400]   Steve, an SDK.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.800]   Here's our application so you can buy music on the iTunes store and put it on your iPhone.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   And then Steve has to say no.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Leo.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   Yes, Jerry.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   Yeah, inevitable.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:50.640]   It's a long time when you're dealing antitrust and you can afford the lawyer.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.400]   It's the job is going to afford.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.280]   You are not talking about something that happened within the next couple of years.
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   So he's saying, you can make a lot of money.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.280]   You can make a lot of money during the inevitability.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.280]   All right.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.280]   I think we're no.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   That's the problem.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   Bring it on.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.280]   That boy.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:17.000]   Microsoft thing was that no amount of antitrust, you know, fine now can undo Microsoft's complete
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.440]   market dominance.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.440]   Right.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:25.840]   So you can't penalize really in the amount that they have now won, which is 99% or whatever
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.920]   it is of the PC market.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.520]   And now having won, they're dismantling themselves.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.960]   Here's an interesting another announcement at Apple's.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.560]   We shouldn't overlook at Apple's event is that they are now supporting exchange and
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.800]   they are now adding active sync.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.720]   I mean, Apple a long time ago gave up on the business market.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.760]   Are they are they aiming at the business market?
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.280]   Is the iPhone a wedge into the business market for?
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.640]   I think they are creeping towards it.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   Yes.
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:59.480]   But I think their approach is they are going to make sure the user experience is fabulous.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.240]   That way the business guy will say, why should my kids have a better experience on the phone
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.240]   than I did?
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:08.240]   Yes.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.640]   And at that point, you start getting business saying, look, let's us be able to do some
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.440]   of this stuff.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   Very interesting.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.520]   I think it becomes very interesting because as we all know, the iPod with the lever by
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:27.720]   which Mac adoption has been driven in the consumer marketplace for the last few years.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.040]   If executives are starting to get to the point where they've got iPhones, they've got
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.240]   exchange and they're thinking, here's a really great user experience.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:41.560]   Does that become the same kind of Trojan horse for getting business adoption of Macs that
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.280]   iPod's worth of consumer adoption?
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.600]   Meanwhile, I'll give you another one.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.000]   The air.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   It is so cool that a lot of people...
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.600]   That's an executive computer, isn't it?
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   Yep.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   You've got it.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.640]   That's the kind of thing that the CEO would carry.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.040]   It is just so cool.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.040]   You know what?
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.040]   That's Jason.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.960]   That's what we missed on the air is it's part of their business strategy.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   I mean, I...
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   There's you, Jason, Bob.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   There's so many of them.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.760]   You have, well, this consulting group bought me one too.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   Oh, I like this consulting group, Jerry.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   You've got some good friends now.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   I do indeed.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.760]   I do indeed.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.160]   You haven't got the air yet, though.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.160]   Tomorrow.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.160]   It comes tomorrow.
[00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.160]   We'll get you a review.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.840]   I know, I wish you'd mentioned that Jerry, while he hasn't written Chaos Manor for Biden
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:33.680]   sometime, in fact, I don't know what happened to Biden, but Chaos Manor lives on at JerryPornell.com.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.960]   And at Chaos Manor Reviews.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.200]   And I tell you, I have to say I cut my teeth on your reviews.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.400]   I'm not going to say I grew up to you, Jerry, because I was an adult, but that was what
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.440]   inspired me to want to get into this kind of journalism where you represent the end
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:51.320]   user and their experience in the real world.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.320]   And I just...
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.320]   I still love reading it.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.840]   JerryPornell.com or ChaosMannersReviews.com.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.760]   And I'm sure I'll look forward to the air review because you've got that touch.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.560]   You've got the human touch.
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:04.320]   We're going to take a break for our Audible commercial.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.400]   Jerry, do you have a sci-fi book you'd like to pick for our Audible?
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.960]   Your friend Larry Niven's all over it, but you only have Star Swarm on Audible.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.360]   I have to look into it.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:22.400]   I've been spending too much time in medical waiting rooms lately to pay too much attention.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   We're going to...
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.800]   I'll tell you what, I'm going to recommend Ringworld because...
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   Yes.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.240]   Well, I would absolutely love to recommend MotenGod's Eye.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.440]   And you should read it in paper.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.080]   There's no audio version of it.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:35.840]   But Ringworld is, I think, considered by many to be one of the seminal sci-fi books by
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.600]   your buddy Larry Niven.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.400]   He's a co-author, a guy who works with you, Larry Niven.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:50.200]   And just a fascinating, I think, hard science book that really raises some interesting issues.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.960]   And it's just great reading.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   Highly recommend it.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:59.080]   Ringworld won this 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 1970 Nebula Award for Best Novel.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.120]   It is one of the great sci-fi books.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.040]   Now, if you've never read it, please, by all means, get it.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.440]   And that's how I read it.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.720]   Tom Parker does a great job narrating it.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.920]   If you have read it and you haven't read it recently, read it again.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.320]   It's one of many great books, a lot of great sci-fi.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.160]   We're going to get more pornell on audible.com.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:23.080]   It Audible is a great way to read when you're driving, when you're working out, when you're
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.720]   doing other things, your hands aren't free.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.360]   You can't look at a book, but you can get reading done.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.360]   And I'll tell you, if it weren't for Audible, I think Audible is a cure for road rage.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.680]   I've been doing a lot of driving lately.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.400]   I had to drive to San Francisco the last couple of days.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.000]   I'm driving down to San Jose the next couple of days.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.880]   And Audible cures my road rage.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.440]   I don't care if the traffic's bad.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:45.640]   I'll tell you, when I love it, I love it when I'm on a plane and my eyes are a little
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   tired.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.240]   I can't read a book, but I don't want to go to bed.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.800]   And so I got an hour between that.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.720]   And I just pop on.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:55.040]   I got the Blade Runner off of Audible.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   They have Blade Runner.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:56:00.240]   It's just so pleasant to actually listen to it, you know, to do Android Stream, to lecture
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:06.800]   sleep, you really can get a lot more when you work backwards from your favorite films
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.880]   to the books.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:13.000]   You can just get so much more color, obviously, and get side the head to the characters.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.520]   I mean, that Philip K. Dick novel to Android's dream of electric sheep.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.520]   What a great time.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.520]   Can I just throw in one more recommendation?
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.520]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.520]   We're having a book fest.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.080]   Do you know what?
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.440]   The whole Wikipedia inspired me.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:34.800]   So Audible has the Timothy Zahn air to the Empire trilogy, which is generally considered
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.720]   to be the best three books.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.920]   I never read it.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.080]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   That's word.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.280]   So if you imagine a return to the Jedi, so it's three books by this guy, Timothy Zahn,
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.240]   chronicling the post-Jetta return.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.320]   I stay away from books about based on movies.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   I have a show.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.320]   I read the Star Wars.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:56.400]   These three are considered the best Star Wars books.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.600]   They are absolutely fantastic.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   They have read them all.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:02.040]   And Audible has them narrated by Anthony Daniels, the guy that plays.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   Oh, see, three-beow writes the reason.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   Here you are.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.040]   You want to hear a little bit of some three-beow?
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   He's just an England to Reg.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.720]   Actually, this is a Deni Lawson is reading this.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.520]   But Jerry, you know these books, Jerry?
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.520]   Yes, I do.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.280]   I'm not the world's biggest Star Trek fan.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.320]   I only wrote one episode.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   But Star Trek, you wrote an episode of Star Trek?
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.720]   Long time ago.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.960]   I used to be pretty good friends with Gene Rodden.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:28.960]   I didn't know that.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.440]   Which episode did you write?
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.440]   Oh, no.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.440]   Don't worry about it.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.640]   I'm sure it's on Wikipedia if it's not moving to Wikipedia.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.160]   You probably won't find it.
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.560]   It was in collaboration with some other people.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.840]   But don't worry about it.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.680]   Rodden, Barry, and I used to.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:51.480]   We were at the Library of Congress Conference on Science and Science Fiction and Literature
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:58.560]   about 20 years ago there was a big conference with Sir Fred, Hoi, and Gene, and me and a
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.720]   bunch of other people.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.680]   We had this big, big literary conference and I got to know Gene pretty well, Fraser, and
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   all to that.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.280]   But that was a long time ago.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.720]   Every of you been listening to books on the Kindle.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.840]   You know, I haven't put them on the Kindle, but you can put Audible books on the Kindle.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.080]   Do you have a Kindle?
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.080]   I have a Kindle.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:18.920]   I take it with me everywhere.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.120]   I have about 20 books on it.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.600]   I have Audible books.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.080]   I can listen to them.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.920]   I can read them.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.760]   It is awkward at first because you hit buttons.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   I know.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   I know.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:36.960]   But once you're getting used to it, it is really very pleasant experience.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:42.120]   Well now that Amazon owns ours buying Audible, maybe we could start doing Amazon commercials.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:44.080]   Well, I think you're right.
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.480]   Well, we already did for the MP3.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.080]   He's the, I mean, half of us right now.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   Ray company.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   Leo.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:55.960]   I think Amazon, see, what's great about the Kindle is not so much the technology of the
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   Kindle.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.960]   The library.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:01.120]   It's the integrated marketing you're doing.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:07.160]   I can sit there in a waiting room and think, I want to read an old neural wolf novel.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.160]   Yep.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:12.080]   And in two minutes for five bucks, I've got it.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.360]   I've done the same thing.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:19.160]   And once everything, once I would like every book in the world to be on Audible and Amazon,
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.080]   then you would never, you could read anything or listen anything you want.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.080]   That's the way it should be.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:27.240]   And let me wrap this commercial up and then we can talk some more Jerry because I've already
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.800]   got to charge up three times as much for this commercial.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.320]   Audible, you get a free book by going to audible.com/twit.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:38.760]   Look, there's no question this is the way to read, to listen and get that Star Wars,
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.760]   the Thrawn Trilogy.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.440]   They've got all three books on there by Timothy Zahn or Larry Niven Ringworld or get all four.
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   I don't care.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.880]   I'm going to put the Thrawn Trilogy on my wish list now.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.800]   It's just a great way to listen to what you read.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.120]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.120]   We thank you for their support.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:56.840]   Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, Jerry.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   This is getting too good.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.760]   And I'll tell you the problem.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:07.160]   The Audible ad has to be cut out of the stuff that we give to an AOL for AOL radio.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.240]   So if there's too much good meat in there, then I lose too much.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   Why do they cut it out?
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240]   Why do they cut it out?
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   AOL radio has a deal.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.800]   They have a podcast channel.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.240]   They provide us bandwidth in return for us on the podcast channel.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.400]   But the deal is that they're commercial free for the subscribers.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.280]   So we have to cut ads out for the stuff that runs on the AOL podcast channel.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   Right.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.280]   But if this is...
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.280]   Okay, so we're back to the content portion of the show.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.920]   Yes, we are now done with the commercial.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.800]   This will appear on AOL radio.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:38.560]   And if I just said as one of the members of the Twit Crew that I love Audible and I'm
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.120]   not getting paid, it's not an ad anymore.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]   No, it's not an ad.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120]   I don't care.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.000]   I'm just saying for the record that Jason Calicanis endorses Audible.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   And Jerry Pournell endorses Kindle.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.600]   Yes, I'm very fond of my Kindle.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:55.240]   As I say, it takes a little while to get used to the mechanics of it.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.040]   But once you do, it's automatic.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.320]   And it is just so terribly convenient to you.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.160]   I've been reading Nightstawn Trilogy, which is Peter F Hamilton book, which if I were
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.760]   carrying that around, my arm would be three inches longer because it's a huge book and
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.760]   I have it on the Kindle and it's great.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.760]   Free.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   Exactly.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.000]   And then McCauley's history of England.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Oh my gosh.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.880]   Which is five volumes.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   That's what they got to do.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.160]   They got to put things like Gibbon, the Oxford English Dictionary.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.560]   They got to put that really big stuff.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.560]   They got to put that on.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:32.720]   I have an eight gigabyte card from Kingston.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.760]   They sent me this SD card, eight gigabytes.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.880]   You would be amazed at how many books you can put on eight gigabytes.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.440]   We forget because we have all this heavy media that the text in.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.920]   That's not very heavy, is it?
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.920]   Not much to it.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.240]   Even, let's see, even as honorable books, it's a lot of books.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.760]   No, it's about, honorable books are about a hundred megabytes typically.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.120]   That's about seven or eight hours.
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.120]   So, yeah, that's a lot.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.200]   That's quite a few books in there.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.600]   I almost don't want to talk about news anymore.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.080]   We're just having way too much fun.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.440]   I just want to say about, you know, when we talk about innovation in the space and
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:15.520]   Steve Jobs gets a ton of credit, you have to give a lot of credit to Bezos because for
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:19.320]   a company that started as, you know, just selling books, right?
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.880]   It was like a retail retailer, which is a pretty basic business.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.200]   I mean, the guy has really innovated, like, between one click and then going on to like
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.960]   this no DRM and then he's doing EC3 and the Kindle and buying audible.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.520]   S3, let's not forget.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.400]   I mean, S3, I mean, all that stuff is just like, it's brilliant stuff.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:47.240]   And he doesn't get like the same fan base as, like, say, Apple products, but I mean, am
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.560]   I the only one who works on Amazon every week?
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.560]   Every week.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560]   Every week.
[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560]   Every home is on fan.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.320]   You know, I buy toilet paper from Amazon.
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.920]   Yeah, it's probably every day.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.760]   Once your Amazon Prime, you don't go anywhere else.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.480]   And the store is always, yeah.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.320]   And the store is always open.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.840]   I noticed that because I went there like two in the morning the other day and the website
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.840]   was actually open, Jeremy.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840]   It was crazy.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.840]   I was like, I can't believe it.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.160]   Who's working on my faith at two of the more things you want?
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.880]   I ordered this, get this.
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.960]   You know, Amazon has a subscription thing, which I don't think a lot of people know about,
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.400]   but you can buy toilet paper and every two months you set the set the frequency.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.560]   It just automatically sends you more toilet paper, razor blades, cereal, the stuff that
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:29.560]   I buy every day.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.560]   I just get it from Amazon.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.280]   I probably will unload $10,000 a year on Amazon.com.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.680]   It's a really good model.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.400]   And do you do it through your own associate account so you get a rebate?
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.960]   You know, you know, Jerry, I am so stupid.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.800]   I just realized the other day I'm not doing that.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:54.400]   I get a good discount on everything I buy by just buying it through my own associate account.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.400]   Now, what do you do?
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:58.880]   Because I was trying to like make the Amazon.com homepage be an associate page.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.880]   You can't.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   You have to link it to an item, right?
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:08.160]   Yes, I just paste in my account designation at the end of the item.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.480]   This is the modern way to cut coupons.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.200]   You know, so if you're an Amazon associate, so my Amazon associate account, anybody wants
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.720]   to send me money, this is the way to do it.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.960]   When you're buying on Amazon, add Leoville zero f dash 20 to the URL.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   And I will get what is it?
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.440]   Like 4% I get a huge amount.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.440]   Something like that.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:33.280]   A lot of my readers order books through my associate account and I get, oh, I don't know.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.560]   It's fair amount.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:35.560]   You get more.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.560]   I think you get more.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.760]   I don't know about your deals with the publishers, but I got more from Amazon than I ever got
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   from my publisher.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.720]   Well, no, you're in computer books.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.960]   I get real money.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   Oh, good.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.960]   I'm glad you're here.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.640]   Offers of real books get like 10% of the cover price.
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640]   Oh, that's good.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:00.080]   So, I mean, just on the same topic, just to go back to the iTunes thing, do you see Paul
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.080]   McCartney has finally got the Beatles on iTunes?
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.480]   After the divorce, though, let's not rush things.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.120]   No, $400 million to do it.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.200]   And it won't go on Amazon, will it?
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.160]   No, it's just going to be on iTunes.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.160]   That's pretty, yeah.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.600]   I mean, that's been supposed to be happening for ages, right?
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.600]   Thank you.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   Hallelujah.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:27.200]   I'm not mired in this bitter divorce, but as soon as the divorce is over, so she didn't
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200]   have any.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.120]   She's going to get like she was married to the guy for two years.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.200]   She's going to get $30 million out of this.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.000]   It's not a bad rate return, right?
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.240]   Forget entrepreneurship.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.160]   Just just marry up.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.320]   Good wages for what she must have paid.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.280]   Heather Mills.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.200]   I don't know what if she's a gold digger or what, but it's a bitter divorce, but I don't
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.560]   blame Paul for saying, we're going to wait until after the year.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.560]   We divorce.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.200]   Then you're going to have my record because that's a lot of money.
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.600]   He doesn't want to split it with her.
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.800]   Now, but it's not just Paul, right?
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.800]   I mean, Ringo's going to get some and the estates of George Harrison and John Lennon
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:01.800]   will get some.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.320]   But not as much as Paul gets so much.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.840]   Well, because he's listed as the primary songwriter.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.080]   Oh, Lennon would get some.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.520]   Lennon would share equally then.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:16.520]   So a few years ago, there was a bit of a stink because McCartney petitioned to have
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:24.520]   legally a lot of the songs changed from Lennon, McCartney to McCartney, Lennon.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.560]   And that gives you like a massive hike on the royalties on the backhand.
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.520]   Jerry, you're right.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.760]   People will do anything for money.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.120]   It does get a little crazy.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   I'm shocked.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.720]   Leo, I didn't quite say that.
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.520]   What I said is someone will do anything for money.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.200]   Yeah, there's one in every crowd.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.200]   I agree with that.
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.840]   Well, apparently Paul's one of them.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.240]   Hey, can I just tell you something?
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.360]   I think this podcasting thing is actually going to work.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.440]   I know he said a couple of years ago, I didn't think it was going to work.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.840]   Actually, I was wrong.
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.640]   I think this podcasting thing is good and this vlogging thing because the band.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.960]   You know, I actually know.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   Come on.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.960]   Not everybody's Twitter.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   What's changed?
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   What's changed?
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:10.680]   I think that the production value of these shows is getting better and people are doing
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.200]   consistent publishing, which they weren't in the beginning.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.200]   That's very important.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.520]   The quality and the tools are getting so much better that like I met this guy Gary from
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.280]   Wine Library TV when I was at.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.040]   He's like a star.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:27.720]   And he is like, I could care less about wine.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:28.720]   I don't drink really.
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.360]   I have a Scotch once in a while.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.360]   And now I'm like watching a show.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.720]   I'm like, I want to hang out with this guy and drink some wine.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.400]   Apparently it's South by Southwest.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   Everybody is.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400]   Apparently.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:43.840]   And then you watching just the appearances I have on Twitch, I am getting the day after
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.480]   Twitch, Mahalo gets probably another 1000 people typing the word Mahalo into search
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   engines.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.520]   I watch it every, you know, the Google Analytics.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.160]   And then I must get 100 to 200 people adding me on Facebook, like within 24 hours of the
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.040]   mp3 file coming out.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.040]   It's insane.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.760]   Like how well here's let me tell you what I'm doing next and I'm just curious what you
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.240]   guys will think of this.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.080]   I haven't really gone public with this, but we've just rented the downstairs.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:14.960]   I'm in an old Victorian, I'm in a cottage that was part of a bed and breakfast converted
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   back to offices, but it was built at the turn of the century by a lumber baron.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   It's beautiful.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.520]   Mahogany paneling downstairs, mahogany ceiling, mahogany floors.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.600]   I've just rented that.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.600]   We've got the cameras.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.400]   We're setting up lights.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.080]   My wife went to an auction.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   Just bought a bunch of furniture.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.200]   Dan, I didn't tell you this, but you've got a desk.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.440]   We've got ash trays and old rain.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.680]   Anyway, our annual carpets.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.880]   We're furnishing it as a Victorian.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880]   We're going to set up the cameras.
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.960]   We are going to stream everything we do like this live, but we're also going to start doing
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.920]   and I hope you guys will come to come up to Petaluma.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   We'll have wine.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.480]   We'll have food every Saturday night.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.160]   We're going to do kind of Saturday Night Live with the tech industry.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.000]   I'm hoping this is going to take off.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.320]   I want to re-envelope television.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.400]   I think television needs to go away.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.680]   I think the idea of episodic and limited time needs to go away.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.240]   Leo, is there any way to have remote video?
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   Yes.
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.640]   Like we do remote by telephone.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.560]   The same technology we're using right now will do Skype.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.360]   I'm going to have a plasma screen behind me.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.720]   I'm going to dedicate a T1 for Skype so that you can be on that screen big and bright
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.720]   and beautiful and it'll be just like you're there.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.720]   But I'm hoping that-
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:29.720]   I think it's going to work.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:30.960]   I'll tell you why.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.800]   I have now with this Nokia N95 and quick.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.800]   You've done a lot of good things.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:39.160]   I had 100 people in the room within 15 minutes.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.640]   I watched you drive.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.280]   I watched you drive a car, Jason.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.760]   What I do is on the way home from Mahalo, I open it up, I put it in the cup holder.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.760]   It's crazy.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.360]   And then I drive when I get to a stoplight because I drive home on the streets, I like
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360]   taking the streets.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   You're talking back to the chatters.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.960]   I look at the chat room and I talk to them.
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.040]   So I was talking to them about the controversy of the day, whatever.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.360]   And it's building up this audience.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.400]   And then I went on, I was in a cafe, you know, when I was on my flight back from the secret
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.960]   conference I was at.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.720]   And I had the Nokia running and somebody said, Oh, you should check out Yahoo Live.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.120]   I put on Yahoo Live.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.080]   I had Yahoo Live looking at me.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.320]   I had the Nokia looking out at the Starbucks.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320]   You're crossing the street.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.320]   I had people on Twitter now.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.560]   Tell us exactly what you're using, what telephone is.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.640]   It's a Nokia N95 with 3G.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.720]   But I also, this is the other crazy thing.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.720]   I got this little box that I plugged my Evdocard in that makes my own little Wi-Fi network.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   Oh, you got the cradle.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.720]   You got the cradle.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   I got the cradle.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.720]   Oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.720]   I put that on the desk.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.720]   It's battery powered.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.720]   I got the, I got.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.160]   So what this does is it takes an EVDO card and makes it into Wi-Fi.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.160]   Exactly.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.760]   So now I've got my air on the, the Evdoc.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.960]   I'm doing Yahoo Live.
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.920]   I used my Jason Calicana, say Yahoo.com email address.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.360]   So I was basically up and running in seven seconds as long as I took to log in.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.040]   I had like 50 people in that room.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.800]   I had 100 people in the other room.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:00.600]   And there, and then some people were in both watching me and my view on two different
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.560]   services and I'm just saying it to myself and then I, you watch, um, uh, Parello, he
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.200]   has 500 people there.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.200]   Watching him do nothing.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.200]   Right.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.000]   I mean, he's the most boring person in the world.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   And he has 500 people.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.600]   I'm going to do the same thing Parello is doing with, with people like you.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.760]   And I hope people will come visit.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.160]   I know I'm in Petaluma, which is at least it's in the San Francisco Bay area, but it's a
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.000]   little, a little harder to get to, but I'm hoping it'll be worthwhile.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   It's a wine country.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   It's beautiful.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.400]   We'll have a spe, we'll have a guest bedroom.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.880]   The room we're in now is our new green room, by the way, painted green.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   You're going to have a bedroom in here.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.040]   It's got a shower.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.400]   You could spend the night.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.200]   You're in the wine country.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200]   You're all invited.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.920]   Will the next time you're out here with your lovely wife.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.480]   Do you know what?
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.480]   I'm looking to make a little, my, my wife wants to make a little road trip.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.480]   Maybe we'll do that.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.480]   I'll be fun.
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.480]   You're welcome.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   Bring the bulldogs.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   Oh, really?
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.480]   Can we bring that to the big gray?
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.480]   So we're going to start doing that in the next couple of months.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.020]   You know, we have, we have some bandwidth to acquire and so forth, but I, I'm excited
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.320]   by the opportunity that presents.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.320]   It's something I've actually wanted to do for years.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   Well, how is your business going and podcasting?
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.880]   Because I know you were, you know, you're taking this slow, steady approach.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880]   How's it going?
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   How's viewership?
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.120]   Yeah, it's been really, really good.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:12.360]   I mean, we, you know, we launched the channel flip, you know, with all the channels in,
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.440]   uh, in October, channel flip.com.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:17.400]   It's been, uh, it's been, it's been going up.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.480]   You know, we launched it from nothing out of my living room.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:25.640]   We, uh, we slowly acquired, we got a small space that we worked out of.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:31.080]   And now moving to some bigger space, uh, taking some money to do that.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:37.560]   And, uh, we're up now serving, uh, about just over half a million videos a month.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.640]   I think this is going to be big.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.360]   I'm excited, which is, uh, which, which to start from nothing.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.760]   And there are any of these kind of like little five minute videos we haven't spent, you know,
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.280]   the whole thing up until now to get to half a million videos a month, we funded out of,
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.360]   out of my back pocket.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:53.960]   And believe me, I don't have a very big back pocket, right?
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.480]   So we don't need one.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.640]   That's the beauty of this now.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.800]   You know, the next stage for us is, uh, get to a million videos served every month, which
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.600]   we're hoping to do in the next few months.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.600]   Wow.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.880]   We just, uh, land our first biggest, uh, we've hopefully got one large advertising lined
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.000]   up as a line up a few of those and then get to two million.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.120]   That's another thing that's changing is the advertisers are coming along for the ride.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.160]   They're slowly, but surely getting it.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.920]   You're not going to, I mean, look at the, look at the value that we're getting.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.960]   That audible gets from being the main sponsor of Twitter.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   I mean, it's chief.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.400]   It's, I was at the double secret conference and I was hanging out with Don Katz, the CEO
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400]   of audible.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.160]   Oh, first thing he says when it comes up to me, I love your ads on Twitter.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.160]   You're not even doing ads.
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.600]   And then he's like, then he's like, and, uh, I really can't stand that guy.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:48.000]   Corey, because he did the whole DRM right in the middle of the ad.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.680]   And so I said to him, I said, well, why don't you go on Twitter?
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.000]   And he's like, yeah, I want to do that.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.880]   And I was like, you and Corey Doctorow should be on Twitter talking about audibles, DRM
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   issues.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.400]   And I was like, think about that.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:05.040]   Now the conversation has grown, you know, out of the commercial into, you know, it's
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   just crazy.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.040]   I mean, it's like the Clutre manifesto has manifested itself.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:16.360]   And the resulting product is so compelling that it, you know, we do have to walk a tight
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.360]   rope though.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:22.160]   And I have to say that is one thing I'm, that is always a challenge is preserving that
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.280]   independence of editorial.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.160]   And you know, we never have vendors on to it.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.240]   And that is going to, that is challenging because you, you love your sponsors.
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.080]   They're making it possible, but you also have to make it clear to the audience that they're
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.080]   not buying you.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.080]   Right.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.840]   But Corey was, is not part of the sponsorship.
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.120]   He dragged it out of the sponsorship box and pulled it into the show.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.120]   I agree.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.960]   And I did not cut it out for that reason.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.280]   And what it makes it fair game.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.160]   So then you could have him on and just have him do his five minute debate with him.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.840]   Anyway, the point is, you know, the advertising works incredible.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.640]   I mean, remember Adam Curry with the Splendous stuff?
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.080]   I mean, that flavor is good stuff.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.080]   I mean, I can't get flavors planned out of my head.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.800]   I've never seen in the United States, but I'm like, I want to get some of that raspberry,
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:13.280]   you know, I'm like, where's my, well, I'm, I'm very, I'm hopeful.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.960]   And I want to do long form video.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.920]   Everybody's doing short form and I understand why people don't have the patience.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.360]   I want to do long form streaming as well as a download.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.120]   And I just think this is a chance for everybody to experiment, to try stuff.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:28.040]   And, and really, I think changed the world of media.
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.040]   It's very exciting.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   It's very interesting.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040]   By the way, Veronica just Twitter'd.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.120]   I just, if anybody's at the web awards, she needs an Advil.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.240]   So anybody at the web awards.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240]   Okay.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.240]   Wait a second.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.240]   That's not a good use of Twitter.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.600]   You cannot use it like the bath phone or for medical alert, non medical emergency.
[01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.600]   I don't know.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.600]   Shit.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.240]   She's getting a million down, Mahalo Daily is getting a million downloads a month.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.120]   It's, it's broken a million a month.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.240]   I set them the goal of, you know, two million a month, 25 million a year, because I think
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.720]   we're probably wind up spending a quarter million dollars a year on the show with, you
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.280]   know, five people working on it or whatever.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.600]   And I'm, we're doing it five days a week.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:10.480]   And if it gets to 25 million views a year and I can sell it for $10 CPM, you know, on
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.560]   average, and I could probably get more for that at some times, 20 at some times, zero
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.760]   at others.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   It's going to break even.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.120]   If it breaks even, I have a two million people watching it a month.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.960]   And it sort of, it doesn't promote Mahalo, but it does.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.960]   It is called Mahalo Daily.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:24.960]   It dries pages.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.360]   It's called Mahalo Daily and we're covering like the most interesting things.
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:31.360]   I sort of consider it like the new corporate blog is a vlog.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.360]   Right.
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:33.360]   Jerry.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:40.920]   I wonder if I'm in Guget, the, I'm pretty proud of having 150 to 200,000 unique visits a
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   month.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   That's pretty good.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.320]   As a circulation for my columns.
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.480]   I think that's excellent.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.440]   What was the circulation of bite?
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.920]   About that.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.920]   There you go.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.640]   As big as bigger than bite.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.400]   That was the fake circulation.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   That was the circulation.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.000]   You know that's true because when somebody comes to a white head, you know, they're reading
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.120]   it as opposed to subscribing to a magazine that ends up in the, you know, bottom of
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.120]   the pile.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.080]   Of course, bite was really big in the McGraw hill days.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   Oh, I love it.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:16.280]   Bite used to solve the problem of editorial versus advertising McGraw hill was wonderful
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   that way.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.400]   It's one reason I don't take ads.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.800]   I just use public radio subscription.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.800]   Right.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.800]   Right.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:31.280]   And that usually if I'm on Twitter, I'll usually get another 20 subscribers as a result of
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.280]   being here.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280]   So good.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.280]   Jerry Purnell back on.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   What do you know?
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.520]   What your subscription rate is like the percentage of readers who subscribe.
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.920]   Yeah, it's down in the low.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.200]   Well, you do it under five percent.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.200]   That's the same for us.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.760]   And that, you know, I think I remember public radio saying four percent was common on their
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.000]   pledge drives.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.960]   They seem to and I don't get that much.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.680]   I mean, I don't, I don't nag people as much as they do.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:58.680]   I never nag people.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.800]   Whatever I nag people.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.800]   I get a lot.
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.960]   So we should nag people.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:11.200]   Well, I'm very careful how I nag and I, you know, I make sure I tell people I am not after
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.440]   your rent money.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.440]   I don't want your eating money.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.880]   I just want your beer money.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.240]   It's a health thing.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.520]   Actually, we, we ask for two dollars a month recurring.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.400]   I like the recurring because then I know have a revenue stream and you know, rent is recurring.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.960]   Dane is recurring, you know, server space is recurring.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.760]   So we ask two dollars, which I feel is pretty, I mean, that's less than a latte a month.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.360]   And I, you know, I don't want more than that from people.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.800]   I just want people who don't contribute to, you know, to just do that.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.080]   And if I could get the percentage up to even four percent, I wouldn't need to be honest.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.800]   I wouldn't need to run ads.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.760]   But because it is only one or two percent, we have to run ads.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.280]   We just, there's no other way to do it.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.120]   I'm a little better than that.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.120]   But I'm not up to four.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.120]   I'd like to get to four or five.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:06.040]   On the other hand, there is now, I didn't start this, but some of my readers have started
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:12.840]   a campaign to get me 1000 subscribers and 100 dollars a year.
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:13.840]   Let's do it.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:15.500]   JerryPornell.com.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.000]   Go there now, subscribe now.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   Hey, I want to thank everybody for being here.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.280]   What a fun, uh, tweet this has been, especially with the new gossip format.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.840]   I think we're going to do that from now on.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.560]   I think that's half the show.
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.000]   Basically we just get Valley Wegout and we'll just run down the headlines.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   No, please don't.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   I'll kill myself.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.680]   This has to be the one and only time we bring up anything gossipy.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.680]   You got it.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:40.440]   Jason Calakanis, he's, he's the founder of MahaloMAHALO.com and of course has a great
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   blog, which is a must read.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.680]   And one of the things we wanted to talk about was your story.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:48.920]   It was very controversial where you said if you're a startup, hire a workaholics, we're
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.920]   going to talk about that.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.920]   When you come back, we'll talk about it next time.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.560]   Or if you maybe want, you do, don't you do like a daily show too?
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.240]   I noticed today you were on that, um, that's my radio show.
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.760]   I do a weekly weekend, uh, Saturday and Sunday radio show.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.600]   That's the actual mainstream media stuff.
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.240]   I think what I'm going to do is I'm just going to tweet you and we'll both get on like
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.280]   Yahoo and we'll just talk about it.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.280]   Absolutely.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.280]   Like we should do like an intro to it.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   Like we should do a mid-week.
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.280]   Mid-week.
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   We'd do it Wednesday.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.280]   You, me, we'll talk about it.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.360]   On a video.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   And that's kind of the idea.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.480]   I want to do this kind of almost constant streaming video and just have these conversations.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.800]   They're always ongoing because look, you know, the great thing about Twit is we know there's
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.840]   so many great people who are part of it.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:30.040]   And I just love to get you guys on and talk.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.080]   It's like a mini Twit, you know, it's like, and it could be ad hoc.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.000]   You could just be like, you should actually call it that mini Twit 01, mini Twit 02.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.400]   And people could subscribe to a different RSS feed if they want that, you know, granularity.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.880]   This is why he's Jason Calicanis.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:44.880]   Mini Twit.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   Mini Twit.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.680]   Oh wait, before you publish this, you better go buy that domain name.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.680]   Cause I'm going to go buy right now.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.200]   Oh, I can't run.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:57.480]   I have a, we're going to do a lot of this stuff under the Twitlive.tv banner.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.680]   What's what live Jason Calicanis.
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:01.640]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   Mr. Will Harris, of course, channel flip.com.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.360]   I'm so glad to hear it's going well.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.760]   When's the wedding?
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.760]   September.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.640]   Oh, you got a little time left.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.640]   Go a little time.
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:14.640]   Yes.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.640]   Not too late to get into Valley Wag.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.680]   Do you want the secret?
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.960]   Do you want the secrets of a long and happy marriage?
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   Yes.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960]   So please, Jerry, please.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.440]   For the man, learn to grovel.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:32.360]   And for the woman.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:36.440]   Any of those women have to do anything while we're groveling?
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.000]   It doesn't matter.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.160]   Learn to grovel.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.400]   You know, it's two simple words.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.480]   Yes, dear.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480]   That's it.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.680]   Yes, dear, whatever you say, dear.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.680]   Will is going to do great.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.400]   No, no, it's more complicated than that.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400]   Grovel.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.400]   Learn to grovel.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:59.960]   Well, Harris, I do know a Canadian right-wing lovely lady.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.960]   She's a commentator.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.960]   You might have seen her on Fox News.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.960]   It's just beautiful.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:03.760]   And I think she's looking for a date.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.360]   So it's not too late to get into Valley Wag.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.440]   Well, not too late.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.040]   Channel flip.com.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:16.080]   And Jerry Pournell, we're going to get a thousand new subscribers at 100 pop so that
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.960]   Jerry can rest easy and play with his air and his iPhone.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:25.880]   All you have to do is go to JerryPournell.com, P-O-U-R-N-E-L-L-E.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.200]   And of course, the great books like "The Moten Gods Eye."
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.520]   Jerry, I always love having you on.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.920]   You're a breath of sanity in this insane, insane tech world.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.560]   And I hope you're feeling better soon.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:38.560]   Thank you.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.800]   It's great to have you.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:40.800]   Another twit.
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.800]   This is amazing.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.800]   Is in the can.
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:23:06.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.520]   I should have paid attention.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.520]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.520]   Too much work.
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.080]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.840]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.040]   So here's the deal.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.840]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:19.840]   Like forget it.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.000]   I'm killing you.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   [LAUGHING]
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   Round the board.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   I'm on the twit.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000]   Do it on the twit.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   All right.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   We're doing the twit, baby.
