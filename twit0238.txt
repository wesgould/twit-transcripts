[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:21.060]   This week in tech, the show that covers the technology stories
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.580]   of the day.
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.860]   And we've got a great panel with us.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.780]   As always, Kevin Rose is here fresh from his bungee jump
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.620]   in New Zealand.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.180]   14-- no, 43 stories.
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.980]   Scariest thing I've ever done in my life.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.060]   Wow.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.400]   Wow.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.180]   We'll show video at the end of the show.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060]   Everybody can watch you jump off the--
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.860]   it's not even a bridge.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.700]   It's like they suspend something in the air.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940]   A platform suspended 43 stories in the air.
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.140]   It was pretty nuts.
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.780]   Crazy.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.060]   I was scared to death.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.060]   We're glad you made it back.
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.420]   Also with us from Fox and Friends, Mr. Clayton Morris.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.580]   Also does that great gadget.
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.660]   What's the name of the gadget podcast?
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.620]   It's called Gadgets in Games.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.620]   StreamsLive on FoxNews.com.
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.140]   And thank you so much for having me on.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.980]   And my apologies.
[00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.860]   I'm actually in my childhood bedroom right now,
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.820]   my parents' house.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.820]   I'm so inappropriate.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.220]   You move back in.
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.660]   I move back in.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.340]   Its times are tough.
[00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.300]   I'm visiting.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.900]   I left New York this morning.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.940]   And I'm in my old bedroom, which I didn't realize
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.500]   until I was sitting in here doing a show.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.060]   It's the size of a shoebox.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.900]   Well, it looks like Dad's turned it into a little mini office
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   as well.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.980]   Unless you had the--
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.500]   Were the Steelcase file cabinets yours?
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.020]   No.
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.420]   There's so much crap in here right now.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.580]   I'm surprised.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.740]   And I look through the closet.
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.180]   Do you see the closet doors back over?
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.460]   That's where all my comic books are still stored.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.820]   And I was looking for my old Sega.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.020]   I think my Nintendo NES.
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.220]   I think my mom threw out my NES.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.300]   But you got the comic books?
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.580]   That's even more valuable.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.140]   I know.
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.820]   That's all I care about.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.860]   If you got the NES, you'd probably
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.740]   pull it out and start playing Zelda or something, right?
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.540]   Yeah, I get that out in Dragon Warrior.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.460]   Those were the days, huh?
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.020]   John C. de Vorax, here.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.740]   When he was a kid, he used to play with rocks.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.220]   So that's--
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.900]   Rocks and sticks.
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.900]   And sticks in the mud.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.140]   ChanneldeVorax.com.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.860]   Great to have all three of you here.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.340]   Actually, you're following in Kevin's footsteps, Clayton.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.940]   The last time you were on Kevin, you were in your parents' house.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.780]   That's right.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.300]   Now--
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.220]   To the mom and dad.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.020]   You got to do it.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.580]   You got to go back to home.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.460]   Did you ever fix that smoke alarm?
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.340]   I know.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.940]   So many people were complaining that it was beeping non-dada.
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.700]   Sorry about that.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.580]   No, it's really funny.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.060]   It was in the battery dead thing.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.260]   And that's-- isn't it nowadays when you go home to mom and dads?
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.260]   That's the kind of thing.
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.940]   They go, what?
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.260]   I don't hear anything.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.900]   No, they saved chores up for you.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.460]   I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.100]   When I go back, I have a list of things
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.540]   I have to do for my parents.
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.060]   For years.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.940]   Like, you get a computer.
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.380]   There's a whole slew of things.
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.700]   For years, I'd go home and mom would
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.820]   want me to climb into the attic.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.740]   Oh, that's the worst.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.100]   She wants you to stay in the attic?
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.140]   No, she said, go up in the attic.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.020]   There's crap up there.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.980]   You got to move around.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.300]   And it was the worst.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.860]   It was awful.
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.300]   Then she locked the door.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.620]   That's what you wrote to the doctor.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.860]   I think your mom likes me better.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.300]   She does, doesn't she?
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.780]   I forgot about that.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.220]   Mom, I was talking to mom yesterday.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.660]   She says, son, you need to have a special line
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.460]   that I can call in any time when you're doing shows.
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.340]   And mom, that's the last thing I need.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.140]   I said, mom, if you have something to say on a show,
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.300]   send it text me, and I'll decide whether to call you.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.500]   She says, you'll have to show me how to do that.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.700]   I said, OK, she's right now.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.420]   She's-- see if she had the line, she'd be calling right now.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.740]   I think it's fine the way you've turned your mom into David
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.060]   Letterman's mom.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.900]   You know, Letterman wasn't the first to do that.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.420]   You know, he's not really a fan of his mom, by the way.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.740]   Really?
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.940]   Like, they don't really like each other?
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.940]   Yeah, that's the real story with that whole thing,
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.340]   is it was only after a producer had suggested the situation
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.300]   with him doing that that he ended up doing it.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.100]   He's not very close with that, with the family.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.340]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.420]   He's kind of a bitter sour kind of a guy.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.740]   Well, he doesn't leave the house.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.380]   He just listens to shortwave radio in his basement every night.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.460]   He never uses--
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.300]   Is it true?
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.940]   Just like you used to be Leo?
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.860]   Well, here's what I do.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.380]   I didn't know.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.660]   Maybe I could listen for David.
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.820]   We could talk.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.020]   You guys are dialing up and listening to radio Moscow together.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.180]   I used to do that when I was a kid all the time.
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.660]   But I don't think-- now there's this thing called the internet.
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.260]   You really don't have to use the shortwave anymore.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.780]   But he literally doesn't leave the house,
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.540]   and he sits inside, and he listens to shortwave radio.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.940]   He dials in all sorts of stations,
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.740]   because he's such a broadcast aficionado.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.580]   That's one of the things.
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.700]   But he's such a loner, too, and he never leaves.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.940]   He just never goes outside.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.540]   I can identify with that.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.140]   What do you do in your basement, John?
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.500]   I can only imagine.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.900]   Look at you.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.700]   You've got wine.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.900]   You've got Alfred E. Newman.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.180]   Hey, by the way, thank you for the tip.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.900]   I went to Costco in Nevada, and I stocked up
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.860]   on some great bordos there.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.740]   Yeah, they're loaded up.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.100]   And if there's a couple of people out there
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.700]   who want a quick wine tip from Costco, there's two wines,
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.380]   I think, are really good deals.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.860]   There's a 2006 Lucente, which is an Italian wine
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.020]   from the Tuscan area, which is essentially a San Gio vase,
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.820]   but it's quite delicious.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.380]   And then for 19 bucks-- and then for 19 bucks,
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:08.340]   they're dumping boat loads of the 2006 BV Rutherford Cabernet.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.260]   That's a good cab.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.060]   I've had beautiful.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.900]   Yeah, that's a great cab.
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.180]   2006.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.540]   It's Costco sponsoring you guys.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.380]   This is like the third time you guys are going to get--
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.380]   They're out of stuff.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.180]   They should.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.780]   We're trying to sell it for a sponsor.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:19.300]   I have to leave it.
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.940]   I'm running out of money.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.180]   You give a lot of crap away.
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.660]   You know, we just give it away.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.100]   I want to thank Costco for their fantastic selection
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.700]   of part-tiers.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.980]   You know, I see that on 30 Rocks.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.260]   30 Rocks got it figured out.
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.180]   They will do these blatant product things.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.700]   They'll say, "Snapal" with anybody
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.180]   like a "Snapal" right in the middle of the show.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.740]   And then at the end, it says, "Promotional
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.020]   consideration provided by Snapal."
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.660]   I got to figure out a way to do that.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.700]   So, John, what happened to your Twitter account?
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.940]   You got hacked, dude.
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.980]   Yeah, but it was only lasted for about five minutes
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.700]   because I have a bunch of minions who are producers
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.900]   of no agenda show.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.580]   And they got on me real quick in every way they could.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.900]   Just told me it was hacked.
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.380]   I didn't know.
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.460]   I mean, there were 200 things hacked.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.740]   Somebody thinks somebody-- they got to one of the base
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.300]   accounts.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.540]   So you didn't fall for some phishing scam
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.060]   and give somebody your credentials?
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.860]   No, I didn't.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.460]   And the fact is, I'm fairly aware of those things.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.620]   And A, and my Twitter account on all my machines,
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.580]   including every machine that I use is auto load.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.900]   So it just basically goes on.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.020]   I don't really type in anything.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.580]   And so--
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.020]   The only problem your password is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:26.540]   That could do it.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.900]   My password is not a great password.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.500]   It's a skeleton key because I didn't take it too seriously.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.300]   But I changed it once I changed it.
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.220]   The spamming stopped.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.060]   They only got three messages in.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.580]   And I want to thank the people who told me about it, by the way.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.500]   Told me you got it.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.420]   Do you guys get hack attempts on your different accounts?
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.100]   Because I get those little--
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.500]   you know when so many people try and hack your Gmail,
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.060]   that you get like little notifications in your cell phone.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.460]   Oh, I get that all the time.
[00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.420]   At least three times a week.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.500]   That's a really good tip.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.140]   If you have a Google account, make sure you tie a SMS
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.620]   cellphone to it.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.420]   Because in some cases, it's the only way
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.740]   you can get it back if you lose it.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.380]   And they are.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.540]   They're always trying to break into it.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.980]   My Gmail account is my last name.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.020]   And there's some French guy who keeps trying to get it.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.660]   He thinks it's his account.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:18.660]   So I get all these password-detempt reminders in French.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.020]   By the way, I think I'm going to have a Snapple right now.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.380]   Anybody want to Snapple?
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.540]   It's precious.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.900]   It's delicious.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.380]   You know, we--
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.140]   Make it pop.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.220]   You know, it's funny.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.580]   I was doing a podcast that I do with my best friend called
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.420]   the Grizzly Barret Cafe, cheap plug.
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.060]   And we loved You Who.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.900]   We grew up loving You Who.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.620]   And we started talking about You Who every episode.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.820]   And finally, we got a call from You Who.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.780]   And they were interested.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.180]   We started talking about-- we haven't really
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.700]   worked it out yet.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.620]   But we still started talking about it when advertising.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.980]   We just started talking about You Who.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.860]   And we weren't shilling for it.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.380]   We just--
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.540]   I've tried that and tried it.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.500]   It's never worked for me.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   We tried it for a long time with Tatino's pizza rolls.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.180]   Because I was just really wanted pizza rolls.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.860]   And then we had a guy inside who said, oh,
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.020]   I'll get you the sponsorship.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.900]   But they just--
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:06.740]   I don't think Tatino's--
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.740]   We used to get a lot of free food over at K&BR.
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.380]   Oh, you remember that when you and I did the show?
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.220]   We had Max's deli.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.180]   Can't ever load-- nope, stuff.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.220]   By the way, isn't You Who, Yahoo, You Who?
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.020]   What's the thing that chocolate drink?
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.980]   It hasn't-- that didn't they switch to high fructose corn
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.500]   syrup and kind of ruin the beverage?
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.940]   You know what, first of all, there's
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.940]   no dairy products in You Who at All.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.940]   There's not--
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:27.940]   No.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:28.780]   There's not milk.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.220]   It's not chocolate milk?
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.660]   No, it's not-- there's actually no dairy product in You Who
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:34.860]   at All.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.380]   In fact, I went through and was spent some quite a time.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.220]   I spent like an afternoon, one afternoon--
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.980]   At the You Who, in the--
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.060]   No, I almost wanted to.
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.500]   But David Byrne talks about hanging outside the You Who
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.500]   plant when he was back in the '60s.
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.580]   And he was high on Isaac Kite.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.980]   And he wrote a couple of talking head songs about that.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.140]   You know what, through the Wikipedia page of You Who?
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.380]   And they do like Halloween You Who's.
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.260]   They do like Dracula's drink.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.420]   They do all kinds of weird stuff.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.180]   There's no milk products at All in Any You Who Beverage.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.460]   I don't know what it is.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.100]   Well, it means it's healthful.
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.100]   What is it?
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.860]   What is it?
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.100]   It's chocolate flavored something?
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.540]   Like a high fructose corn syrup doesn't mean that much, then.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.820]   Are you really-- is this a no-agenda subject, the high fructose?
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.180]   No, this is a devorex subject.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.140]   This is a family matter.
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.740]   We don't use a high fructose anything.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:22.180]   Really?
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:22.740]   And--
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.540]   Why is that?
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.500]   --the best way it is.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.860]   Because the stuff is, if you look at all the research
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.260]   that keeps coming out and then getting pulled back,
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.620]   it indicates it's really bad for your liver.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.060]   Really?
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.260]   Just a nasty product.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.340]   It's not a good thing to take.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.580]   And I don't care what anybody thinks.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.060]   They can send me a memo if they don't like these comments.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.140]   Well, I guess that's it for the Snapple endorsement.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.060]   But they don't use high fructose corn syrup, do they?
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.580]   Kevin, you're a tea guy.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.500]   Is there any real tea in Snapple?
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.980]   They sometimes have little trace amounts of tea
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.660]   and a lot of these tea drinks.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.300]   As long as we're mentioning companies,
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.580]   I finally went to Samovar, which you highly recommended, Kevin.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.820]   And that is a great place.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:04.420]   I really enjoy--
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.500]   It's just me and Jesse or no.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.500]   And I saw-- I said hi to Jesse.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.820]   In fact, I'm trying to get it so that we could do a joint
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.060]   dignation twit thing there or something.
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.380]   Or maybe just you and me talking tea.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:14.940]   Let's do it.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.140]   It would be really fun.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.740]   He's such a nice guy.
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.860]   Sure.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.100]   All right, let's get to some news.
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.820]   We got stories.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.300]   We got so many stories to talk about.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.380]   How about the porn detection, USB stick?
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.980]   Don't want it.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.340]   Paraben has made a USB stick.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.620]   You could plug into your computer.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.980]   And it's about $100 if you're a porn investigator
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.820]   or maybe just lost your porn.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.420]   You plug it into the USB drive of any Windows-based PC
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.180]   and run the porn detector.
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.980]   It searches the hard drive using advanced image analyzing
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.460]   algorithms.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.160]   Characterizing images is potentially
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.180]   harmful by identifying facial features,
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.600]   flesh tone colors, image backgrounds, body part shapes,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.200]   and more.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.360]   I don't know what the more would be after that.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.920]   More.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.800]   More and more.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.120]   Audio recognition probably.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.520]   Oh, maybe.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   That sounds like a--
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.280]   I'm coming out there.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.080]   I don't buy this thing.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.040]   First of all, it sounds to me like it's stuff.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.160]   And I could be completely wrong.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.320]   But the way it sounded to me when I saw this earlier this week
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.400]   is that it was recognizing stuff you had stored locally.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:19.880]   Right?
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.760]   Right.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.520]   So who's storing porn locally?
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.120]   I don't know.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.160]   Why bother, right?
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.680]   You just--
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   You're the correcter.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.960]   If you're collecting it, maybe.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.480]   Well, I think I believe the people up in Canada
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:39.240]   that do the very great program called SpyCop that
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.000]   looks for really deep--
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.760]   the deep sort of Trojans and key collectors.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.760]   You know, what do they call them?
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.960]   Keyboard, whatever.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.960]   They call it deep throat.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   What's called--
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.000]   They're called deep throat Trojans.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.840]   Well, I'm talking about the keyboard capture program too.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.160]   Oh, the key loggers.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.160]   Those hardware loggers.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.480]   Those are very hard to detect.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.280]   Yeah, these guys do all that.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   And they came out with a program like this.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.360]   It wasn't a key.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.200]   It was just software.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.680]   And I think it was like three years ago or five years ago.
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.720]   I don't see how--
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.240]   I don't know.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.400]   I never caught on.
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   The same company-- I'm looking at the website--
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.880]   paraben-sticks.com makes a chat stick and a SIM card seizure.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.600]   This is digital forensic software.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.800]   The chat stick scans your computer for chat logs.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.920]   So this is really for cops who could just come in.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.400]   Is it cops or is it parents?
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.360]   It might be like, you think your son or daughter
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.800]   is doing some crazy things.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.920]   And you buy one of these little sticks
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.440]   and hopefully gives you peace of mind or something.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.040]   Stay away from-- keep your stick away from my computer.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.320]   That's all I can say.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.480]   But I mean, this seems to me--
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:46.840]   I don't know.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.000]   It seems to me weird because if you've got-- first of all,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.200]   kids aren't-- well, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.000]   But kids aren't savvy enough to be deleting all of this stuff.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.280]   So all you need to do is just go check their browser history.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.840]   You don't need to buy some stick.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.400]   I put it in the folder called porn.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.880]   That's true.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.600]   Just look for the porn folder.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.360]   Don't kids know how to do all that?
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.960]   I mean, browsing now.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.160]   I mean, it's like two plates.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.200]   You knew how to do that.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.680]   You know, Kevin, there's still some issues
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.640]   with certain programs like the IRC, for example,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.480]   which depending on which version you're running,
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.600]   but various versions of Merck will go in.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.160]   And they open up an applications folder
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.880]   that's buried under your documents and settings.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.760]   And you can't even find it with a Microsoft search
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.880]   on the operating system.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.440]   You actually have to go by hand.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.120]   You have to kind of march all your way
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.080]   into through all these folders that do it--
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.920]   to delete the stuff.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.360]   And essentially, it logs everything you do.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.560]   Yeah, but I don't think--
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.600]   I don't know.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.840]   Most consumers aren't going to use IRC.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   They're just going to go straight to a website,
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.680]   play on the video, sit back and watch it.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.240]   They're not going to use Merck, for sure.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.280]   It's not that hard.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.440]   So what about this?
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.920]   Apple has now announced that the iPad will be available.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.200]   We think available for order this week.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.400]   And then we'll come out.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   April 3 is now the iPad ship date.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.840]   And I don't think this is a coincidence.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.000]   Microsoft announces this week that, in fact, that video we
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.640]   saw of the courier was real.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.320]   And they're going to ship it at some point,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.160]   at some unknown time, and at some unknown price.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.800]   It kind of reminds me when they came out
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.440]   with a surface announcement, right when iPhone was announced.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.000]   What's going on with the service?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.480]   I've never seen a service that was--
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.560]   I've seen one in real life.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   Yeah, they have a face.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.320]   They have one on the metric for a long time.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.120]   Yeah, it's kind of-- it's 10 grand.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.040]   It's a table.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.000]   Although, I have to say that some of the software and technologies
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.440]   did make it into Windows 7.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.600]   So some of those surface programs are in Windows 7.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.440]   I mean, it was cool.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.360]   You could pop bubbles with your finger,
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.520]   and then you set your drink down.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.920]   And it's like, there's a drink on the table.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.880]   But other than that, I don't know,
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.960]   what was the real practical application for the service?
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.400]   I never watched CNN.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.200]   They do all that.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   Yeah, all that.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.360]   Yeah, with all their minority reports stuff up on the screen,
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.560]   which ends up--
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.240]   it was a novel thing a few years ago.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.320]   And then everyone was sort of scrambling to figure out,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.280]   how can we get these great giant screens
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.080]   that Wolf Blitzer stands in front of and--
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.800]   you know, it spacks this, and this slides over here.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.360]   And then it ends up becoming more gimmicky
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.880]   than it becomes new, disseminating.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   You know, you end up finding--
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.080]   You could also watch that track.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.760]   He's way for the blue screen.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   You know who does all that for them?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   Is David Borman, who's their Washington bureau chief,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.520]   but he was our executive producer on the site.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.480]   Remember that, John?
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   And--
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.200]   Yeah, and he worked at-- he came in as a consultant over at Tech
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.080]   TV, too, for a while.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.640]   Did he?
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.480]   And I saw him at CES, and he's doing that for CNN.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.480]   He did the holographic--
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.240]   That was cool.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.840]   Correspondent.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.200]   Sorry.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.920]   That was awesome.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.920]   That's awesome.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.520]   I thought it was-- I thought that was the worst
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.640]   of the worst gimmicks.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.040]   It's so hard for--
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.400]   David told me-- yeah, help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.640]   David told me that that wasn't working minutes
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.000]   before they had to go live.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.240]   It was like the last-- you know, there--
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.120]   I think it was 27, 29 cameras all around her.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.840]   And I mean, what did they get?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.040]   It looked like there was somebody standing--
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:16:59.920]   And what was the point?
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.120]   Yeah, there was somebody standing in the studio.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.880]   Just get him a limo and bring him in.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.600]   It's cheaper.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.240]   And it's not 3D.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.040]   It was still 2D to us.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.960]   Right.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.480]   Maybe the demo is 3D.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.280]   Anyway, there's a--
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:13.960]   They could see it.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.160]   Right?
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:14.800]   They couldn't see it.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.240]   It was just blue-screened in.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:16.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.040]   It was like when Soledad was looking at me on the site.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.200]   When I was a Dev Nol the virtual reality character,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.000]   she wasn't looking at me.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.280]   She was looking at a blue dot on the wall.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.880]   They put a little piece of painter's tape.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.960]   They said, look at that.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.520]   Hey, can you believe Avatar is nominated?
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.840]   By the time you hear this show, you'll
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.040]   know whether they want it or not.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.840]   Avatar nominated for Best Picture.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.480]   Yeah, well, look.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.440]   I mean, it was a crowd--
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.560]   first of all, the whole reason they have 10 movies now
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   is because the Dark Knight got bumped out,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.800]   and these sci-fi films weren't making it into--
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.360]   Star Wars never nominated.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.200]   Now, I guess it was Titanic must have been nominated, right?
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.120]   It won Best Picture, yeah.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:53.760]   Did it, it won.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.240]   OK, so Cameron hasn't--
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.400]   Remember, he stood up there and he did his thing.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:57.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.840]   Top of the world.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.360]   I think he should have done that again.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.240]   Maybe he will.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.740]   We'll see.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.240]   We'll see.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.520]   We'll find out tonight.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.680]   Well, he's up against his ex-wife.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.880]   Well, now, I heard an interview with him about that,
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.760]   and he was kind of--
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.600]   Catherine Bigelow, who did the Hurt Locker,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.000]   is nominated for Best Director as his James Cameron.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.240]   He said, we were married for two years, 20 years ago.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.040]   We've worked together ever since.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.520]   She's much more a collaborator and a colleague
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:24.720]   than she has ever been my ex-wife.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.040]   But it's a more entertaining story.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.560]   It is.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.240]   It's a better story.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.680]   Watch the floor of the roses.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.240]   You know, you know, the camera's
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.560]   going to hover over both of them, you know.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.200]   Exactly.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.800]   And the winner is--
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   He's got a little story there.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.520]   So back to this career.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:38.720]   What?
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.480]   Go ahead, John.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.160]   No, no, nothing.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.560]   I just wanted to say that.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.400]   They're trying to create drama between the two of them
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.520]   as bogus.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.680]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.160]   That's called television.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.200]   Yeah, the courier, I think, is they're going to roll it out
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.040]   before they even see--
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.800]   I don't know why Microsoft doesn't wait
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.560]   and see what the numbers are for the iPad.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.640]   Well, I think they will.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.080]   They're not going to get it out soon.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.320]   It's five by seven.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.000]   It's got two screens left and right.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.560]   And you remember seeing some really cool pictures and video
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.080]   of dragging stuff from one screen to the other,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.640]   according to Engadget and Gizmodo that had this story.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.720]   It's going to run on the Tegra 2, which is--
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.120]   and the same OS is on the Zoom HD.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.240]   To Tegra 2 is also supposed to power
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.800]   that little pad out of India called the Atom.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.840]   Tegra is actually--
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.240]   Tegra 2 is actually pretty powerful.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.120]   It wouldn't be a bad thing to have something on Tegra 2.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.000]   But can they get this down to $4.99?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.080]   Is it a question with two screens?
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.200]   It's also a little big.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   It's got a pen instead of touch.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   It's got a handwriting.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.200]   I haven't seen this running.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.600]   I have a feeling this is vaporware.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.840]   Their response is they want to put people and let people know
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.080]   that, hey, we have an answer too,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.520]   but this most likely won't be off for another couple of years.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.840]   When you're right, Kevin, they had vaporware at CES
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.360]   showing off the HP slate.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.280]   That was vaporware.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.600]   And yet Steve Ballmer didn't even know how to use it.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.120]   I'm pretty proud.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.720]   He was touching it.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.520]   And the only thing he could show off was that book app.
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.520]   I'm Marcel, and I'm a trend reader.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.920]   So this is that video of the--
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.440]   I think the video is pretty compelling, actually.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.240]   Yeah, but it is compelling.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.600]   But again, I think it's fake.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.120]   It's fake.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.600]   It's fake.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   Right.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.840]   I think the video is amazing.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.720]   I think this is what had a lot of people salivating.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.840]   And it's one of those devices.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.800]   Yeah, if they could do this, that's great.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.440]   Right.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:34.000]   It has that pinch multi-touch, which apparently Apple
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.680]   has a patent on.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.280]   Although interesting, when Apple sued HTC,
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.600]   those 20 patents did not include the multi-touch patent.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.080]   I don't think--
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.960]   I think Apple even knows that that's not defensible.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.800]   But this is cool.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.560]   I want this.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.840]   But this is more of a computer.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.800]   It has a camera, multi-tasks.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.960]   It's going to be running Windows 7.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.960]   What do they call it?
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.360]   Windows Series 7.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.280]   Windows Phone.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   Good luck.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.520]   Yeah, that thing.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.320]   Windows 7 is in HD.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.320]   By the way, did you see that video, though?
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.960]   You know, Kevin brings up the point again.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.320]   But that video that was rolling around the past few days
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.000]   about the one game I think Engadget had it,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.640]   the one game played across all three platforms.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.480]   You could be using-- playing it on a Windows 7 machine
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.400]   with a mouse.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:18.800]   Oh, that's new.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.320]   Stop where you are in the game.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.600]   Then pick up your Windows 7, the Series Mobile,
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.880]   Series 7, Series Phone.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.360]   Play the game there with touch.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.120]   Finish the game or not.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.080]   Leave off where you are.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.960]   And then jump on Xbox Live and play it
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.240]   from where you left off.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.600]   That's the first time it was some Indiana Jones platform game.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   That's interesting.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.840]   It's about time.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.800]   Is that enough to sell it?
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.280]   I don't know.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.080]   It's kind of-- I mean, again, none of this is real.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.160]   Although the Gizmodo documents kind of make you think maybe
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.440]   it's a little closer to reality than--
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.080]   I don't know.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.680]   Well, I'm not buying these articles that have been floating
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.640]   around, too, saying that Apple delayed
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.840]   now the launch of the iPad or the release of the iPad
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.200]   because of this.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.920]   No, come on.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.320]   Apple says, bring it on, baby.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.880]   Well, I don't think Apple does that either.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.160]   They just don't care.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.920]   What do you think of the Apple losses?
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.720]   Did we talk-- I can't remember if we talked about this last week.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.000]   I guess we didn't.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.600]   20 losses against HTC.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   I feel like Apple's kind of litigating instead of innovating.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.000]   Instead of competing.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.680]   They're going after the little guy.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.800]   If they succeed and they keep HTC off the market,
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.720]   that's going to piss a lot of people off.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.880]   I mean, the reason they're not going after Nokia
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.640]   is because they know that Nokia has a whole handful of patents
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.240]   that they could fire right back at Apple.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:42.760]   Well, they did.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.080]   And that's exactly what happened.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.280]   They're going back and forth shooting at each other.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.760]   In fact, there was a Crank New York Times bits blog that had a map--
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.920]   let me see if I can find it-- of all of the lawsuits
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.880]   in the mobile space.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:03.720]   And it was the most convoluted diagram.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.720]   It just shows you everybody's suing everybody else.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.360]   It was crazy.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.680]   Yeah, but doesn't Palm own the bulk of these patents?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.160]   Like, you had a lot of this stuff.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.960]   Palm had this stuff going way back, right?
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.800]   To the original pilot.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.320]   There was a bunch of stuff I remember they--
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.640]   that's true.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.200]   Let's see if Palm's not in here.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:25.400]   We've got Apple suing HTC, but Cisco, Elon, and let's see,
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.560]   Kodak are suing Apple, but Nokia's suing Apple,
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.520]   and Apple suing Kodak back, then Sharps getting sued
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.480]   by Research in Motion, Nokia, and LG groups.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.400]   This is Tevo all over again.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:34.880]   Look at it.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.080]   For the DVR Wars.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.360]   How that happens?
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.600]   It's crazy.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.040]   All of these--
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.600]   And Leo, you're suing me.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.080]   Uh-huh.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.160]   I don't even know what that's--
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.520]   What that's about.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   Well, I don't know.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.640]   It was a preemptive suit, because I
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.280]   thought you might want to sue me.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.200]   Because of touch.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.280]   Because of touch.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:50.920]   Well, you touch?
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.040]   That wasn't a good touch.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.600]   That was a bad touch.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.240]   That's what they tell me.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.960]   Did you see that Conan O'Brien added a random woman
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.280]   to his Twitter account?
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.920]   She says, "I've decided to follow someone at random.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.600]   She likes peanut butter and gummy dinosaurs.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.280]   Sarah killing your life.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.360]   It's about to change."
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.800]   How many followers does she have now?
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.300]   I don't know.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.240]   We got to check.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.040]   I just want to put her on the recomment.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.080]   I was clicking Refresh on her page,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.040]   and she was going up hundreds of followers per second.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.920]   She's got 15,500--
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.960]   her Twitter account.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.320]   Let's see.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.040]   Wait a minute now.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.120]   Let's see if we can get her even more followers.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:29.620]   Her--
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.720]   She can break Conan's record here.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.800]   She can take another person at random
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.600]   and see if we can overtake that account.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.000]   Oh, really?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.800]   I got an idea.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.280]   How about you guys?
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:36.840]   That's a good idea.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.320]   That's a good idea.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:37.840]   This random guy.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.320]   Try Clayton Morris.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.920]   Nobody never followed him.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.800]   So do you want to pick somebody at random?
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.240]   Let's do it.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.160]   Who wants to pick--
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.440]   Kevin, I'm going to put you in charge.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.600]   Pick somebody completely random.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.120]   Complete random.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.240]   I'll do a search for something on Twitter.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.040]   So Conan--
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.360]   So Conan is three followers before Conan found her.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.200]   So you got to have somebody with three followers.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   Because very free--
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:00.700]   No.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.680]   She was into what peanut butter or something like that?
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.720]   Peanut butter.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.240]   OK, so what can we search for that we would want?
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.120]   I think the only other person that has three followers
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.520]   is Sebastian Rupley.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.200]   I don't want to make it be a tech guy.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.120]   It should be somebody completely random.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.160]   She's now got 15,500 followers.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.360]   She's on 284 lists.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.680]   She's really become somebody famous, thanks to Conan.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.920]   Yeah, out of Michigan.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.420]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.400]   I think it's because her name is--
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.400]   to handle his lovely button.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.280]   How adorable.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.720]   Is that cute or what?
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.800]   It's probably a setup.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.880]   Conan probably owns that one.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.400]   Maybe it is.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:35.960]   Yeah, maybe it is.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.400]   I don't know.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.960]   Why would he do that?
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.520]   Kevin, you got to find somebody.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.320]   It's just to create controversy.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.120]   Who knows?
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.200]   It sounds like a good idea.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.080]   Why don't we create a person, put them on Twitter,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.480]   give them three followers.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.400]   You, me, and Kevin.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.360]   And then boom, let's do it.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.080]   She likes peanut butter and jelly and all that.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.720]   No we could do.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.960]   Is we could create this account and not tell anybody what it is,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.040]   but just drop some hints throughout the show
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.000]   and see if people could find it and follow it.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Like an Easter egg hunt.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.880]   Like an Easter egg hunt.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:07.400]   And then one of those followers would get an Apple iPad.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.360]   Now you're talking.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.720]   Like a good gimmick.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.400]   Hold on.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.000]   I think I may have found a user.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.480]   OK.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.840]   Lisa Tickled Pink says I hate technology.
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.680]   Oh, that's it.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.800]   Oh, perfect.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.640]   And her handle is Lisa Tickled Pink.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.120]   And her last feat was I hate technology.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.720]   That sounds like the right person for us.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.440]   She's got two followers.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.360]   Two followers, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.960]   All right, let's see what we can do.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.680]   That means we even had--
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.200]   Oh, wait a second.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.720]   We gave them a handicap.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.320]   But yeah.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   She's a New Zealand.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.640]   Perfect.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.840]   Do you know her, Kevin?
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.600]   I do not know her.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.480]   Kevin, what's up?
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.240]   All right.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.240]   All right.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.320]   I want everybody who's watching this show right now.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.600]   This is the woman who gave you bot worms.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.560]   That's seriously.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.120]   All right.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.720]   I'm going to give her three followers.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.880]   I'm going to follow her right now.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.240]   She now has three followers.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.480]   It's got 59 now.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.240]   73.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.920]   What?
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.800]   You're kidding?
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.600]   Yeah, refresh.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.720]   Oh, man.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   All right, this is good.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.360]   So everybody followed Lisa Tickled Pink.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:03.720]   And we'll--
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.920]   She has 163.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:05.600]   201.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.240]   Let's see how high we can get her before next week's episode.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.600]   We'll check at the end of the episode
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.000]   and see how Lisa Tickled Pink is doing.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.960]   Oh my gosh.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.840]   But this does not the iPad one.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.560]   Because that one would have to be an account that we created
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.600]   so we'd know who all the people were and stuff.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.760]   Or should we?
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.560]   Like, women, I could see who's following her.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.720]   I could pick her random from her followers.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.520]   That's good, yeah.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.280]   All right.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.040]   So this is the deal.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.240]   I will pick on--
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   What is the-- what is the ship--
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:38.960]   Oh, my God.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.240]   April 3rd is the ship.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.960]   Has email notifications turned on?
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.960]   Oh, no.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.960]   Oh, no.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.160]   Would you get a new follow-up?
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.960]   Oh, no.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.760]   Oh, no.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.720]   I'm sorry, Lisa.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.360]   Oh, no.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.840]   What do you guys do?
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.000]   Kevin, you're going to prison.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Do you know what in New Zealand this is a federal offense?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.200]   I did nothing.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.280]   You guys are enablers.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.480]   She has-- John, just to explain,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.840]   she has email notifications on turned on.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.280]   GE.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.240]   So she's going to get an email for each and every one
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.080]   of these new followers.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   Yes, you get thousands of emails thanks to you guys.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.840]   So far, 1,122.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.920]   I was against it.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.120]   The best thing is that she's underage.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.000]   No, she's not.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.680]   Look at that.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   She's underage.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.120]   I told you not to do it.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.080]   No, she looks like a very nice lady who
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.800]   hates technology, has tweeted twice,
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.040]   and is really puzzled right about now.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.360]   She says, why?
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.080]   Why, Lord?
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.440]   What did I do?
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.040]   I really hate technology now.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.840]   He has no idea what's happening right now.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.640]   Why am I getting all this email?
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   She's--
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.800]   Is this illegal?
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.240]   It feels vaguely wrong.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.640]   It feels like a feeling wrong.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.000]   But I don't think it's illegal.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.520]   No, it feels so right.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.000]   So let's pause.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.480]   Let's take a look at the news.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.040]   Let's take a look at the news when we come back.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   How about that, John C. DeBouc?
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.720]   I'm going to let you pick the next story.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.800]   What about that?
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.480]   OK, it's going to be the Google gesture search.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.840]   I love that.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.240]   By the way, I'm using it, and I love it.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.160]   Before we get to that, though, I want to mention our friends.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.320]   They're good friends at Citrix.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.400]   The folks who do go to meeting, go to my PC.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.560]   They do enterprise remote access.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.960]   They do go to assist.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.400]   Go to meeting is a program we use all the time here at Twit
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.960]   to save travel.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.560]   So instead of going to a client's cross town,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.360]   or flying across a country, I did that.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.440]   And I'll tell you, for a red eye and then one day meeting
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.240]   that came back, just exhausting.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.160]   Instead, now we just say, look, go to gotomeeting.com,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:34.880]   join our meeting.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.920]   They'll see my computer.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.640]   I could show them the PowerPoint, the spreadsheets
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.160]   we can collaborate together.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.200]   If you go to gotomeeting.com/twit right now,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.360]   you could sign up for 30 days of go to meeting--
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.640]   an unlimited account.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.320]   That means as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.040]   But you know what?
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.680]   Every account's unlimited.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.560]   $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.280]   And that includes free voice and phone teleconferencing.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.080]   G-O-T-O, meeting.com/twit.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.040]   It's secure, it's fast, it's easy to use,
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.200]   and it is a real lifesaver in business.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.960]   Please give it a try.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.960]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.720]   We're thanking so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.640]   How's Lisa doing?
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.360]   Let's just refresh here and see how much email has--
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:19.920]   poor Lisa--
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.120]   She just tweeted.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.360]   She just tweeted that she loves technology.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.080]   I'm not sure what that's about.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.000]   I love it now, she says.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.840]   I loves it now.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.880]   Up to 1,621 followers.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:31.840]   Thank you all.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.400]   Those are just the live viewers and, of course,
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.920]   says people come and listen to the show.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.600]   We could get her-- I think we could easily get her over $15,000.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:40.640]   So just--
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.840]   Just a campaign like this.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.160]   Oh, man, it's strong.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.800]   And one of the new followers, or even the two followers,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.960]   previously, somebody will be picked at random from her followers
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.280]   and will win an iPad.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:51.560]   You know what?
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.800]   To make it up to Lisa, I'm going to give her an iPad too.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.840]   She's in New Zealand.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.640]   I could just send her one.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   Yeah, that'll work.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.120]   She might not know how to use it because she hates technology,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.240]   but in theory, you can send her one.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:03.720]   OK.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   So that'd be-- and actually be more hilarious
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.120]   if you send her one of the 3G ones.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.400]   That doesn't work at all.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.080]   That doesn't work in her country at all.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.320]   No, I'll send her a Wi-Fi.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.240]   We'll give away the low-end iPad, because I
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.560]   think that's all you need.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.960]   Are you guys going to buy the Wi--
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.040]   here's what I can't figure out.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.480]   I can't decide whether or not--
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.480]   because I know you're going to Leo.
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   I know you're going to buy one.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.160]   I'm going to buy all six.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.320]   Yeah, I'm debating whether or not
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.280]   to get the Wi-Fi one or hold out and get the 3G one.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.240]   I'm getting Wi-Fi.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.680]   Or you can wait six months and get the iPad Pro.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.240]   With multitasking on the camera.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.040]   I don't want that.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.400]   Do you really think, Kevin, that that's--
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.040]   do you think that that's something needed?
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.440]   The camera on the multitasking.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.880]   Both.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.320]   I mean, there was elite rumors that they're
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.960]   coming out with the camera on the back of one of these
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.880]   in the future version.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.680]   No way.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.120]   No way.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.000]   Yeah, totally.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.800]   It's been talked about--
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.720]   No way.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   No way.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.920]   Do I think so?
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.560]   What, to what, to hold it up and take a picture with it?
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.280]   Oh, I was good.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.960]   There's more for video conferencing.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.320]   Well, OK, think about that.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.800]   Now, what are you going to have to do to video?
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.440]   You're going to have to lean on something.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.560]   Otherwise, it's shooting up your nose.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560]   That's true.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.600]   That's the ticket for the shooting up your nose video
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.920]   conferencing.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.640]   Well, it's a fantastic conferencing.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.520]   People want to see that.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   I wrote up a piece the same day at the announcement.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.200]   I said, I don't really care about that.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.880]   I mean, the camera, because you're
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.280]   going to have to-- it's not a device.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.160]   It's a device you don't want to have to hold out like this
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   the entire time.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.640]   And it'd be shooting up your nose
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.080]   if you have it down on a table.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.560]   Right.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.200]   I mean, it's a--
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.360]   Flip it over and be more fun.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.920]   Huh?
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.360]   Upside down nose?
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.440]   No, no, you never mind.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.120]   So to me, I think that the--
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.360]   I am ignoring you.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.240]   Right now.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.840]   I think Kevin may have gotten the camera there.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.360]   I got it.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   I got it, John.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.280]   See you guys, you're too hip for me.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.840]   Leo, flip the device over.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   Where's the camera pointing?
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.560]   At your feet?
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.600]   Hey, what can we say?
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.760]   At your porn stick.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.200]   Thanks, I got it.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.920]   All right, that's enough of that.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.480]   So--
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.320]   I thought you were suddenly on chat roulette?
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.080]   We did that last week.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.000]   And by the way, it only took us two clicks.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.560]   Can I tell you, I was listening.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.560]   I was in Germany this past week.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.840]   And I was driving down the Autobahn
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.680]   listening to last week's episode.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.880]   And it takes a lot to get me to laugh like that.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.240]   I was laughing because I knew what was about to happen.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.760]   You knew.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:38.440]   I didn't know.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.000]   I didn't know.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.600]   I fell right into it.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.240]   Well, I was on the daily show the other night
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.240]   because I was one of those jackasses that
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.640]   was one of the people doing a segment.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.920]   Oh, he did a great bit.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.440]   He did a great bit.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.680]   At Natalie Del Connie was on it.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.320]   You were on it?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.160]   Yeah, that was a funny bit.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   And yeah, and we--
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.680]   I mean, it's a concern for kids because kids
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.280]   are on this thing, to be honest with you.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.120]   Look, kids are using this thing.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.480]   That's who's honest.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.080]   Right.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.280]   So I knew because we had already been testing it
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.800]   and playing around with it.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.600]   And within one or two clicks, you're
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.160]   getting some guy doing that.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.800]   And I knew-- your second click, you guys.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.720]   It's about two clicks.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.000]   Two clicks to a dick.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.840]   Bays, sorry?
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.680]   Nothing.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.040]   You missed a great show, John.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.360]   That's all I could say.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.040]   Sounds lewd.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.560]   Very--
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.040]   Nothing to do with this sort of thing.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.200]   Very, very, very, very, very.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:33.480]   ABC News says, three-month-old starves to death
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.200]   while parents spend hours in internet cafe, South Korea
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.640]   in shock today after police arrested a couple of Wednesday
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.160]   for child neglect.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.480]   The husband, 45, the wife, 41, the wife, 25,
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.560]   addicted to online games spend 12 hours
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.680]   in night internet cafes.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.760]   Why do we keep getting stories like this out of Korea?
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.680]   Do they really do this, or is there just a--
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.240]   Can I tell you something about my experiences in Korea?
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.320]   For one thing, I don't think that the general speed is
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.960]   necessarily as fast as they claim.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.120]   But I'll tell you this.
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.560]   I don't care what store you go into.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.520]   The person that's working the store
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.320]   is on the computer either doing chat or they're playing some
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:11.880]   game.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.040]   Everybody in the country is on a computer all the time.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.280]   And they don't wait on you.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.240]   It's like they roll their eyes when they actually
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.400]   have to take a sale or something because they have to get
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.680]   away from the computer for a minute.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.760]   This is like idiocracy.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.720]   How long before we're like that in this country?
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.160]   It's not too far behind.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.720]   They really like it.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.800]   The BBC-- and like I said, I was just in Germany this week
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.320]   and I was watching a BBC special on South Korea
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.440]   in their internet usage.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.600]   And it's ground zero.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.400]   It is the most consumptive country for internet usage
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.720]   in the world.
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.800]   And they have addiction problems now
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:48.000]   to the point where they're talking about people being so
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   disconnected from society.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.320]   And they have all kinds of depressive problems
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.360]   for these kids that it's becoming a cultural issue.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.080]   In fact, there's a new BBC show launching
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.240]   in the next few weeks where they're actually taking two countries
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:06.600]   and two case studies where they're taking one family from South
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.760]   Korea and they're going to force them to turn off the internet
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.800]   completely, no internet connection.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.360]   And they're going to Nigeria and they're teaching them how
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.160]   to use the internet.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.000]   They've never touched the internet before.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.560]   And they're going to see how these two families
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.080]   fare in these two different countries
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.600]   on how they use the internet.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.800]   South Korea is the worst.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.720]   And I tell you, the Nigerian couple
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.520]   is going to make a lot of money.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.800]   What'd you say, Kevin?
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.960]   You've heard about the TV shows.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.600]   They have dedicated to StarCraft.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.280]   Like they see this as a sport.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.760]   There's commentary and people watching other people
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.600]   play StarCraft on TV.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.800]   I just got my StarCraft 2 beta and vitamin 2.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   Did you?
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   I'm so excited.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800]   I'm so excited.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   You suck.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.920]   You didn't get it, Kevin?
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.200]   No, I didn't get it.
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.960]   Of all people.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.840]   Wait, we can get you one.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.600]   We can get you one.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.440]   You know people?
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.400]   Battle net.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.280]   Hey, we need Kevin at a StarCraft 2 invite.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.760]   So you can both be disconnected and not wait on John.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.960]   Exactly.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.480]   He has an answer as email anyway.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.080]   I love StarCraft.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:07.960]   I was a Diablo.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.120]   I bet you love Diablo 2, Kevin, right?
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.880]   Yeah, I can't wait till Diablo 2 comes out.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.560]   Or three comes out.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.240]   I'm a big fan.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.720]   So I didn't actually have a Battle Net account, because I
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.200]   played in the days when it was a single-person game, right?
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.600]   Actually, StarCraft was online.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.680]   StarCraft was online.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.360]   Yeah, but before that, it was a single player.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:26.880]   I love--
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.400]   Yeah, single player.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.120]   Yeah, great game, right?
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.360]   Yeah, the original.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.240]   Is that the game too?
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.520]   And forget me.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.800]   Was that the one that had the Mighty Spathy?
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   Do you remember the Spathy?
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.160]   It was like the little space.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.280]   Is that the one?
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.240]   I don't know.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.160]   I don't know.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.320]   It was like the weakest of--
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   How do you spell Spathy?
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.880]   I don't know.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.400]   My friend that wrote a song called the Mighty Spathy back
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.920]   in the day, back in high school.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.480]   Because it was the weakest ship, but it made this little--
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.040]   Do-do-do-do-do-do sound effect.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.320]   And it would get blown up within one hit.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.200]   And I got a swarm that was from a start.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.840]   One hit.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.040]   What kind of a spaceship is that?
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.480]   It was extremely agile.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.520]   That was the benefit of it.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.000]   It was extremely agile.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.920]   But if you hit it, it exploded.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.440]   And that's why you didn't want to use it.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.960]   But you could zip around like a mosquito.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.240]   How do you-- I'm kind of finding--
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.000]   They were scout ships.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.240]   They were for exploring quickly.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.040]   So you could--
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.540]   Right.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.200]   --see the rest of that.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.320]   So what's the next news story we got here?
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.560]   Oh, John, how about this one?
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.040]   Mark Andreessen, the guy who created Netscape.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.600]   I think you're--
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.200]   I think you're a friend.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.520]   I think you're a friend of his.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.680]   Aren't you, Kevin?
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   Yeah, he sits on our board.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.200]   He was in New York City talking to Eric Schonfeld
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.520]   of Tech Crunch about how media companies are handling
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.360]   the digital disruption of the internet.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.720]   And he brought up his advice for old media companies.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.600]   Burn the boats.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.520]   You got to commit, referring, of course,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:58.160]   to Cortez's burning of the boats when they arrived
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.240]   in the New World so that basically they couldn't go home.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   Wasn't that the bike?
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.880]   That wasn't such a good idea.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.560]   Turned out not.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.160]   Well, no, not so well.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.240]   Yeah, because they brought malaria with them.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:18.040]   Do you think that old media companies are not committed?
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.400]   I have met with a lot of media companies
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.560]   when it comes to news and their strategy going forward.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.760]   Sure, because of dig, of course.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   Because of dig.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.640]   And I don't think it's just burning the boats,
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.080]   but it's also kind of a change in the guard
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.160]   that needs to take place internally
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.960]   within these organizations, right?
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.640]   Because you have a lot of people that have no idea how
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.200]   to build really compelling good websites
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.240]   or web experiences online.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.720]   So the New York Times is doing a really good job.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.600]   I know a bunch of people that run their digital division,
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.240]   but it's still two separate organizations inside--
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:49.680]   Right.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.840]   --just big company.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.800]   In fact, there's reasons to say and get rid of print.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.720]   There's a battle between the print guys who say,
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.920]   we got to charge $30 a month for the iPad and subscription.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.800]   The digital guys say, you can't charge $30.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.320]   Nobody's going to pay that.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.640]   He says, yeah, shut down.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.080]   He says, shut down your print editions.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.720]   That's the equivalent of burning the boats.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.320]   Just shut them down and say, it is true.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.040]   I think it is true that--
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.520]   and you see this in the network television and other places--
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.440]   that as long as your business is based on the old way
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.160]   of doing things, you're just not going
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.680]   to commit to the new way of doing things
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.280]   because it cannibalizes that old business.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.120]   You have to be willing to say, we're
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.720]   going to lose the old business.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.000]   We just got to go full ahead.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.200]   But if you're a publicly held company,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.240]   I mean, it's going to be a tough thing to do.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.400]   That's going to be a very tough thing to do.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.000]   That's not something you can do on your own.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:36.400]   No.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.120]   Or an approval and a bunch of other crap
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.160]   that you have to go through.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.760]   Breaking news, breaking news.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.560]   This just happened.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.120]   The girl now has 2,000 followers.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.800]   Her email is toast.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:50.200]   But wait, wait.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.400]   The best part is, what time and night is it over there right now?
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.920]   It's got to be late at night, right?
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.040]   She's told us-- she's told us--
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.040]   she gets up in the morning.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.200]   It's one in the morning, right?
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.800]   Nice going, guys.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.760]   We're three hours ahead.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.800]   I hope she's got her phone on vibrate.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.240]   If she's got an SMS--
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.080]   She'll be a nervous wreck if she does
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.800]   for a lot of different reasons.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.040]   How did you find her, Kevin?
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.120]   I just said, Twitter is for I hate technology,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:14.920]   because I wanted to get--
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.280]   Perfect.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.120]   She hates it now.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.360]   Yeah, that's what we do to everyone who hates technology.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   We use technology to bring you down more.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:26.400]   We just-- this is a little 4channy, actually.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.760]   I think we're verging into 4chan territory.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.440]   No, but they do it so anonymously.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.960]   This could not have been more public.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.720]   No, geez.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.080]   Hey, I could use a few more followers.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.560]   The real Devorak.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   No, no, no.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.400]   See, we're not allowed to do it for ourselves.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.600]   No, I just did it.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.720]   Mark Zuckerberg-- interesting article in the--
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.880]   I don't know-- the mail.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.520]   Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook,
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.880]   another friend of yours, Kevin, I apologize for bringing in.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   But you just know all the big--
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.000]   It's all Kevin's friends.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.960]   He knows everyone.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.240]   This is actually-- the Harvard Crimson was planning
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.960]   on running an article on him in 2004, when he was still--
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.400]   I guess it's still a Harvard student back then.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   Apparently, according to this article,
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.600]   he used the reporter's Facebook logins
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.080]   to hack into their Crimson accounts
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:21.440]   to check and see what they were going to write about him.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.040]   In the second instance, the magazine claims
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.840]   Zuckerberg hacked into the accounts of rivals
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.080]   at Harvard accused him of stealing their idea
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.000]   for a social network.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.920]   There's even quotes of chat dialogues about this.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.880]   The Vinkle Voss twins-- I love saying the Winkle Voss twins--
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.800]   accused Zuckerberg of misleading them about his willingness
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.360]   to help them build their website.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.200]   They had a website called harvardconnection.com.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.880]   In fact, there was a famous lawsuit,
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.080]   and we'll never know what really happened, of course,
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.640]   because as this suit was settled, everything was sealed.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.200]   Why do you-- Kevin, you didn't buy it.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.120]   You thought this was not credible.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.280]   Well, I mean, I was reading through the article
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.080]   and it was describing how they hacked a place.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:06.240]   And it just doesn't even sound like possible.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.480]   I mean, it said that basically Zuckerberg, what he was--
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.920]   he looked up all the accounts, the accounts
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.480]   that he wanted to hack.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.840]   And then he would search to see if they had ever
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.560]   mistyped a different password into Facebook.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.040]   Where would he find that?
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.960]   Like if you're running-- and someone mistypes a password.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:30.800]   It doesn't match your MB5 back on your site.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.520]   You don't save the mistyped password locally or anywhere
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.800]   in a database.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.360]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.960]   I just can't see that happening.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.800]   But the other side of this was the email.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.360]   So if they were using an alternative email to sign up
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.440]   and he wouldn't have to use an alternative password, right?
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.040]   I mean, he could use the same password.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.840]   And typically back then, we weren't
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.160]   so worried about passwords that we are now
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.360]   that they just might have been the same one, right?
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.320]   Oh, that could be.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.240]   That's been a--
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.960]   nobody really stores passwords and plain text anymore.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.460]   Right?
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.000]   I can't imagine Facebook would have done that.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.960]   It would just--
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.360]   Yeah, it does have a dubious aspect to it.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.800]   But there is-- it's a known fact
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.760]   that there's some battle going on between these Harvard kids
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.520]   who supposedly invented the idea.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:15.960]   And--
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.880]   The Vinkle Voss twins sued him.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.560]   They're good looking twins, by the way.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.320]   There's a picture from-- this is from the businessinsider.com,
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.760]   the Silicon Alley.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.400]   I'm sure they had other--
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.760]   being twins, I'm sure they had other activities to attend to.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.640]   They were rowers.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.000]   They were rowers.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.480]   That's what you call it, Leo.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.680]   Oh, stop it, John.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.400]   Well, Calicannus was talking about it last week.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.080]   And Kevin, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.200]   Calicannus, no.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:47.760]   No, no.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.720]   He thinks the worst of Zuckerberg.
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.120]   He was really-- as you pointed out, Clayton, last week,
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.240]   he was really dismissive.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.120]   It said Zuckerberg was dishonest and untrustworthy.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.160]   And then he sent me the link to this article saying,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.080]   see, I told you so.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.160]   He has a history of stealing.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.240]   Was his larger point too, is that he--
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.760]   this doesn't seem like it's outside of the grounds of that.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.760]   But I mean, I--
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.080]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.240]   Every time I hung out with Mark a few times,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.480]   and he's always just come off as really legit and nice guy.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.400]   And I don't know.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.000]   He didn't rub me the wrong way ever that we've hung out.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.160]   I don't know if that well.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:25.600]   But--
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600]   That's why we're under the bridge.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   I don't know.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.440]   There's a lot of people-- when it comes to ideas, really,
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.240]   there's a ton of people that will come up and give you ideas.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.040]   It's like even our ignations that we do, like, hey,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.680]   you should do this feature.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.480]   You should do that.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.080]   And then they say, I did it.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.880]   They say, I did it.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.320]   And they say, well, you built this.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.400]   And in reality, it's the person that goes and builds it.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.600]   Anyone can have an idea.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   You have to execute on that idea and actually go out
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.440]   and make it happen.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.040]   Right.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:48.540]   You know?
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.960]   And then that's what it did.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.600]   One of the things you run into is that most ideas are kind
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.960]   of in the ether.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.040]   And it's because of whatever it is on--
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.000]   I mean, it's a combination of what's on television,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.560]   the time of day, the time of year, other ideas that
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.080]   are out there.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.480]   Because when I'm working for some magazine,
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:07.200]   and I'll get somebody--
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.640]   I've got this idea I've got to tell you about.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.800]   But you have to sign this.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.160]   So I'm not even going to sign anything.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.960]   Because whatever idea you have, I guarantee
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.720]   there's five other guys working on it.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.800]   And you see that.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.880]   The whole bunch of the exact same idea
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.120]   hits the market at the exact same time
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.680]   from all kinds of different dimensions or directions.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.560]   And it's just the ideas are out there.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.920]   And they're always synchronous.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.600]   This is the reason that venture capitalists, if you ever
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.720]   go to raise money or to pitch them on an idea,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.960]   they'll never sign an NDA.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.560]   They just want it.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.760]   They say we don't sign NDA's.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.600]   Because we hear so many different ideas.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.600]   We probably are a heard of them.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.000]   And you're going to come and try and sue us.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.680]   And they don't sign them.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.600]   It was the reason tech TV that we had a special person who
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.000]   entertained pitches for TV shows.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.720]   We weren't allowed to entertain them.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.040]   And I had the same policy here.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.720]   People pitched me on a new podcast
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.400]   ideas all the time.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.600]   I said, I don't want to hear it.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.720]   Because I might come up with the same idea.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.400]   And I want you to come back and say, oh, it was my idea.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.920]   There's only a few ideas from--
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.200]   It's a serious problem.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.080]   So here's this--
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:06.580]   Really?
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:07.480]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.640]   So you're back on tech TV days.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.880]   You didn't field pitches for--
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.800]   They had a special person who was, I think,
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.520]   in one of the legal councils, who's--
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.440]   not for stories, for shows.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.680]   So if you were on the pitches show to tech TV,
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.760]   you would pitch it to this one person.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.680]   And the program director, nobody else,
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.800]   was allowed to hear pitches.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.800]   And I certainly wasn't, because they didn't want a lawsuit.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.920]   So this is now--
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.320]   by the way, this is from businessinsider.com,
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.680]   how Facebook was founded.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.280]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.040]   You could fake an IM exchange.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.240]   There's no way to verify that IM exchange was real.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.280]   But this is the IM exchange they published.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.520]   Zuckerberg says, so you know how I'm making that dating site.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.640]   I wonder how similar that is to the Facebook thing,
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.120]   because they're probably going to be released about the same time.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.360]   And here's the kind of smoking gun.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.320]   Unless I screw--
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.640]   I'll use a different word-- the dating site people over
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   and quit on them right before I told them I'd done it.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:05.360]   Daniel who is the other person says, ha, ha.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.880]   Like, I don't think people would sign up for the Facebook
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.080]   thing if they knew it was for dating.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.080]   When you read it, it's like, yeah, that could be real.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.880]   But how do you verify it?
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.400]   And I think that when you're on top, people do aim for you.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.960]   You know, that just puts you in the--
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.480]   did you, John, on no agenda cover the fact
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.760]   that the Arctic seabed methane stores are destabilizing?
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.600]   That methane story stinks.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.360]   Because you know, I could see the whole climate thing
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.920]   flipping on Adam, because I know he's a debunker now.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:41.440]   But this would be a--
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:41.920]   This is skeptic.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.000]   This is skeptic.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.160]   But this would be a great conspiracy theory.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.840]   Because apparently, the seafloor at the Arctic
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.520]   holds vast stores of frozen methane, which is now
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.840]   starting to vent.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.960]   It's a much worse greenhouse gas.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:00.760]   And it could cause catastrophic overnight climate change.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.520]   Oh, that would be cool.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.240]   That's like all the cow flatulence.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.640]   Now we've got the cow flatulence.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.800]   By land in Canada, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.320]   Well, somewhere high in Canada.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.600]   Two, because we're going to have all flooding.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.200]   This is from--
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.120]   Well, it's going to be terrible.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.920]   This is from an article in fizzorg.com.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.720]   It's a study of the universe.
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.920]   No, we did not discuss this.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.320]   Well, you've got to bring this up.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.520]   University of Alaska Fairbanks scientists.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   We've actually have really--
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.360]   Yeah, I love to because--
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.960]   the climate stuff for a while.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:29.800]   Really?
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:30.280]   All right.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.600]   I thought you guys would have been all over that.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.440]   The ice, they said, because of this area,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.520]   was so impermeable that they never thought
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.640]   they'd have to worry about it.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.640]   Right.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.800]   Stuck there, but now it's melting.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.720]   What is the methane doing there?
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.920]   It has a time share.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.320]   I'm just asking.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.360]   Where all this methane in this ice come from?
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.720]   I don't think there's any dispute that it's there.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.000]   Was it a bunch of cough?
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.040]   Were they sequestering a cow farts?
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.280]   Or what was the deal?
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.960]   They were storing it like the seed storage unit up
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.600]   in the Arctic.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.120]   Bill Gates has got something to do with that.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.680]   I'm telling you, they're trying to kill us all.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.360]   That's what it is.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:13.000]   I mean, it doesn't say where the methane came from.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.160]   Merely that it's there and it's leaking.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.360]   Can I ask you guys a question?
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.280]   Leah, you brought this up about the old media thing.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.920]   And I think you have to talk about it,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.360]   because I think it's so fascinating this idea
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.720]   and these sort of future platforms.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.640]   And we're like a month away now from the iPad.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.720]   And I'm curious, Kevin, you said you've
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.280]   been talking to a number of these media companies
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:38.200]   about their platforms and moving forward.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.760]   Have they addressed, are they talking about the tablet space?
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.240]   I mean, how are they addressing that?
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.800]   Because I just see this wide open area right now
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.080]   where the New Yorker's going to have one app that's
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.320]   going to look completely different.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:55.200]   Who knows if they're people are going to pay $12 or whatever
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:55.800]   they're going to pay.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.360]   And then somebody else is going to have a $60 app.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.120]   And I'm just curious where this marketplace is unfolding
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.920]   over the next month.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.840]   It strikes me that--
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.080]   I haven't had a lot of meetings since the iPad announcement.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.120]   But the stuff that I've read is that there's a bunch of magazines
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.520]   that are preparing their digital versions for the iPad.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.720]   So you can subscribe to the magazine.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.600]   And newspapers.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.480]   Yeah, I'm sure the time's 11.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.320]   It's weird.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.440]   When you think about subscribing, OK, do I subscribe to the Times
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.000]   and get an ad-free version?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.400]   Or do I just go to New York Times.com?
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.120]   Well, maybe they shut that down.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.360]   But see, it seems to me this is kind of a step backwards
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.160]   from the free and open web to these silos again,
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.800]   these kind of closed things.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.480]   I love the iPad, and I'll buy one,
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.920]   and I'll probably subscribe to all of those things.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:39.480]   But isn't that--
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.320]   Is this really--
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.280]   Yeah, but is this really-- well, no, I think a lot of people
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.480]   will, but is this really direction, the right direction
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:44.960]   to go in?
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.840]   It's kind of the contrary to where we were going.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.640]   I'm just working on a piece that'll probably be published
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.520]   tomorrow for FoxNews.com about why I'm--
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.680]   it took me a little while to figure out
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.600]   how I wanted this device.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.520]   Where in this-- my sort of space, I'm going to see this device.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.120]   And I found myself sitting in bed the other night.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.520]   And I didn't want to--
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.360]   I was getting ready for Fox and Friends,
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:08.320]   and I just didn't want to browse all the headlines
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.920]   and go through my feed, sitting there with my laptop,
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.360]   propped up there.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.800]   And I also didn't want to then hop up and jump on a desktop.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.680]   I wanted a simple device I could just grab,
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.000]   and I could just skim.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.760]   Because I don't like being in Google Reader.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.520]   It just feels like an industrial way of consuming news.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.640]   And to have this device where I could see my mom sitting
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.960]   there on her recliner on the couch at home,
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.760]   jumping on this device to just grab a few headlines
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   and see what's going on.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.840]   It's going to break.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.520]   It's very sturdy.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.160]   And she could also use it as a coaster or a cheese plate.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.000]   You know what she could use it as?
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.200]   And I think that actually this might sell a few of them.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.400]   Is it makes a pretty good digital--
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.880]   Cheese plate ideas could.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.480]   It makes a pretty good digital photo frame.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.320]   There you go.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.880]   That's where they're going to end up as.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.200]   I did verify, though, that you could use a cheese
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:03.680]   stick to--
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.960]   Did you really-- now, is this a fact?
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.160]   This is a fact.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.480]   They were by accident.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:09.360]   No, intentionally.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.920]   There was a story that Koreans were using sausages.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.960]   I think so.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.000]   You remember that?
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.520]   We're in the frozen together.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.560]   They were using frozen because their fingers were frozen.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:21.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.760]   So it makes their right kind of sausage
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.560]   we're talking about.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.120]   Like Jimmy Dean links.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.160]   And yeah, it was too cold.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.400]   They didn't want to take their gloves off.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.720]   So they're sitting in the subway in Korea,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.360]   and they're using sausages on their iPhones,
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.320]   because it's capacitance.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.560]   So you need-- I don't know what.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.520]   You need something meaty.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.560]   I don't know.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.480]   So I didn't buy it.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.160]   I thought that can't be.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:41.600]   That can't be--
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.040]   It would get all grimy.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   Well, no, but that gets so nasty.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.440]   Well, yeah, but--
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:46.520]   I just--
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:46.520]   I just--
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.120]   Lift Jim on the front of your iPad?
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.160]   I didn't think it would work.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.080]   So we didn't--
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.160]   Have you tried licking the thing to see what would happen?
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.560]   Yeah, let me try it.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.680]   Try and unlock your iPhone right now with your tongue,
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.280]   so I got to see this.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.240]   All right.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.600]   So John, I just--
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.480]   John just provokes.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.000]   All right.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.520]   So--
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:04.520]   So--
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.520]   So you try licking a socket to see if you--
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.040]   Here we go.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:07.720]   OK, ready?
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.440]   Why are you ready?
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:08.960]   We're ready.
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.760]   OK, ready.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.600]   You want a close-up?
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.120]   OK.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   We got to slide a slide.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.720]   We don't want to really see a close-up.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.360]   Well, I won't touch it.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.160]   That's part of the HTC patent.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.120]   Lick to unlock.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.440]   No, it doesn't work.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:22.400]   It's not working.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.240]   Oh, it did.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:23.760]   It did.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.960]   It worked.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.120]   Now just dial a number with your tongue.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:27.880]   I can't dial it.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.280]   Well, all right.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.400]   Call me.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.800]   So many germs on that thing.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.680]   Oh.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.680]   No, wrong pass code.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.960]   This is the chat room that will be going overtime.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.280]   And--
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.640]   So the deal is, I thought, well, let's try it.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.240]   But we didn't have any sausages in the fridge,
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.040]   but we had cheese sticks.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:46.840]   And it works.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.720]   That's the best marketing.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.240]   This episode brought to you by Polio String Cheese.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.360]   If it's too cold to use your iPhone.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.680]   Well, that's fascinating, Leo.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.160]   Why I could amuse.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.280]   You wrote an article in PC Magazine this week, John,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.800]   in which you think that Microsoft is behind Google's woes
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.520]   in Italy.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:18.280]   And I have a story that was kind of left out of that
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.000]   because nobody wants to talk about the situation.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.200]   Microsoft is seriously in Italy.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.120]   I mean, Italy is the only country that never
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:36.320]   licensed the Dvorak columns from PC Magazine in its heyday.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:39.360]   And that was because the Microsoft Italy guy basically
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.840]   just told me, can't run my stuff there because I'm not
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.760]   amenable.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.640]   Wow.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.760]   I'm not playing ball.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.360]   You were on Ballmer's enemy list, as I remember.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.440]   Well, I don't know if I was really on an enemy's list,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.520]   but I was definitely not going to be in Italy.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.320]   And there's a history of Microsoft in Italy.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.480]   I mean, that is extremely--
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.320]   their tentacles are really strong in there.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:04.960]   So now we're having this crazy stuff happening.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:11.920]   And so I said, well, maybe it's Microsoft cause and trouble
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.600]   because they have a lot of influence in Italy.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.440]   So just to recap, Google executives
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.000]   were indicted for privacy violations in a video that
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.360]   was on YouTube for--
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.840]   no, I'm sorry, Google video for a couple of months.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.880]   They pulled it down when the Italian police told them to,
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.360]   but the Italian judge felt that they should have noticed
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.800]   and pulled it down sooner.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.080]   And you think Microsoft put them up to it?
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.040]   Yeah, I do.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.280]   I don't have any proof whatsoever.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.760]   I'm just going by anecdotal information
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.320]   and the fact that they have a lot of influence in Italy.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.000]   And they throw their weight around when they can.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.040]   And Microsoft is on the attack against Google right now
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.320]   in a big way because I don't think
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.960]   Microsoft appreciated Google jumping on the bandwagon
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.160]   against Microsoft in the EU.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.960]   I mean, I don't blame him in some ways.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   And by the way, Schmidt and Microsoft
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.880]   have always had these little battles
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.440]   between the two companies because when he was at Sun,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.600]   obviously there was a--
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   you had Scott McNeely who was out and out,
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.320]   Microsoft basher.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.320]   And so you have a lot of history here.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.160]   And it just seems to me that this wouldn't have happened
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.360]   if it wasn't for Microsoft.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.200]   So I'm just putting two and two together.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.320]   It's just one of my subjective columns
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   where I suggest this or that may be the case.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:29.640]   I'm not being insincere about this.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.720]   No, no.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.000]   This isn't link bait you're saying.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.840]   This is something you think might actually be the case.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.480]   Well, that's an interesting thought.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.280]   Microsoft, remember, there's a history of Microsoft
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.280]   being kind of this way.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.640]   Remember, Windows ain't done till Lotus won't run.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.600]   Right.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.040]   And I'm surprised actually they're not--
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.520]   I mean, I think they still are that way,
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.200]   but I don't think they're as aggressive as they used to be.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.400]   But the situation in Europe right now,
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:59.320]   they're picking on American companies generally speaking
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.680]   because they can gouge us for huge fines.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:08.400]   And Microsoft got stung big time and both Sun and a lesser
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.440]   extent Google were in on the deal,
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.040]   kind of snickering in the background.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.760]   So Microsoft issues on the other foot now,
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:16.960]   so they're doing whatever they can to harass Google.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.760]   And we'll see where it ends up.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.760]   I mean, this whole thing is becoming hilarious.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.920]   I got a story that is verifiable and not conspiracy theory.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:32.960]   And I'm really annoying about DRM and Ubisoft.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.800]   But we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.200]   Right now, I'd like to mention our friends at audible.com,
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.120]   the folks who do those great audio books.
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.520]   And you can get two free books right now.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.160]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, you'll
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.000]   sign up for the platinum account.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.320]   You can get Audible Books a la carte one by one.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.040]   A lot of people do that.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.320]   In fact, you see some great deals.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.120]   This is a house rules.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.160]   It's $9.95 right now.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.080]   They always have half off sales and stuff.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.960]   But if you are a regular Audible reader,
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.840]   the subscription is the best deal.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.360]   I am a platinum subscriber.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.680]   That's two books a week--
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.680]   or sorry, a month.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.840]   I wish they had two books a week.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.200]   I probably could read it.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.400]   And if you sign up right now, the first two books are yours free.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.480]   And you get to keep them.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.720]   Maybe you can't cancel it any time.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.280]   So basically, we can give you two books here.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.720]   audible.com/twit2.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.360]   Audible is a great kind of bookstore of audio selection.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.800]   70,000 titles.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.880]   I read them all the time.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.120]   I'm reading-- just love this book.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.240]   But we've recommended it before.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.000]   But I'm going to recommend it again.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.200]   Daniel Suarez-Deman-- any of you guys read this book?
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.200]   Oh, is this good?
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.560]   No, it's not good.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.400]   It is-- so the story is--
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:45.200]   I don't want to give away too much because it's full of twists.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:53.240]   But the story is essentially a kind of John Romero type,
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:57.040]   famous, famous game programmer dies.
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:04.960]   But leaves behind a demon, a computer program that is demonic.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.200]   And it is a great murder mystery story.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.400]   Can you have a murder mystery where
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.160]   the guy who's doing the murders is dead?
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.000]   Yes, you can.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.840]   And Daniel Suarez knows tech.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.120]   So this isn't one of those books where you read.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:21.080]   It's got a lot of bogus technical jargon and stuff.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.800]   It's clear the guy's a complete nut or geek.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.960]   It's as if one of us wrote it, which makes it so much.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:27.800]   Finally, we play a little bit of--
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.880]   this is Jeff Gurner reading.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.200]   Daniel Suarez is demon.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.400]   This is right at the beginning.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.960]   Penguin Audio presents "Demon" by Daniel Suarez,
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.520]   read by Jeff Gurner with Garrett Scott.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:52.520]   D-A-E-M-O-N, "Demon," "Noun," a computer program that runs
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.560]   continuously in the background and performs specified
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:01.400]   operations at predefined times or in response
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.680]   to certain events.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.400]   When the remote control hummer goes crazy,
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.600]   that just gets exciting.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.560]   I'll tell you, this is really, really one
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.840]   of those great page turners with a lot of--
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.840]   It's a carry.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.480]   What am I saying?
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.360]   What's the car?
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.680]   The bulldozer.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.680]   Don't worry, the challenge will tell.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.880]   I'm posting the machine or something like that.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.400]   You're talking about the Stephen King book with the car.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.680]   Yeah, I want the Stephen King because--
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.080]   well, I have to admit, a few years ago,
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.480]   whenever Audible first started the car.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.000]   Killdozer.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.520]   First killdozer?
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.840]   No, that's not-- That was my first Audible book I ever bought
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.280]   a few years ago from Twit.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.200]   And I've been a subscriber ever since.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.640]   And I'm reading Under the Dome right now.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.280]   Yeah, how's that?
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.200]   Oh, it's fantastic.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.680]   Raul Sparsa.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.320]   And someone just in the chat room mentioned it as well.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.640]   You get your money's worth out of that puppy too.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.240]   Under the dome.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.880]   I think it's like-- 30 or 4 and 1/2 hours.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.400]   Right, I mean, you will age an entire year by the time
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.720]   you're done listening to this book.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.880]   Now, where do you get to the end?
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.440]   Because who was reading it?
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.320]   I think Andy and Akhorson, they said, oh, man,
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   the ending's kind of weak.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.480]   Oh, really?
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.200]   Well, maybe not.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200]   Nice way to ruin it.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.720]   God, I'm just--
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.720]   I'm just sorry.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.120]   And it's into it.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.080]   You know, the first 34 hours are great.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.480]   The last half hour--
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.400]   OK.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   Not so hot.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.080]   But you know, it's a great journey.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.640]   And that's the-- this would be a good one too.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.320]   Journey.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.920]   That's what people say to people at graduation.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.520]   Right.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.760]   It's the journey that you want to remember.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:31.960]   Not for lots of--
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.720]   Not for lots of--
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.240]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.480]   Some of the people in the chat room
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.600]   are denying the weak ending.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.000]   OK, good.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.920]   All right, good.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.880]   Paul didn't like the ending.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.560]   But you know what?
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.040]   Yeah, your times give it a great quality.
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:42.960]   It was great to write.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.800]   It was great to write.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.520]   I cannot wait to read it.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.000]   It has 4.15 stars out of 1600 ratings.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.440]   So that's a possible five stars.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.640]   That's an excellent rarity.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.280]   That's fewer followers, though, than Lisa.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.000]   What's going to read to that right now?
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.240]   Let's check real quickly.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.160]   But anyway, audible.com/twit2.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:01.840]   Sign up today.

[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:04.840]   We're giving you a couple of great ones.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.240]   But there's tons to choose from.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.000]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.360]   And we thank them so much for their support of this week
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:11.760]   in tech.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.960]   Lisa tickled pink.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.240]   Can I have a little drum roll, please?
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.520]   As the tote board goes around and around 2,131 followers,
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.760]   let's keep those followers going.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.680]   Remember, one of you will win an Apple iPad.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680]   And Lisa--
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.760]   How are you going to figure out who wins?
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.680]   I'm just going to look at her list of followers.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.000]   And I'm going to pick it random from that list of followers.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.760]   That calicamps is that we'll go and select a person--
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:36.920]   I'll have to get that from Jason.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.200]   I think you should be Leo.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.880]   You should give her the iPad.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.720]   No, I am.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.680]   You weren't paying attention.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.720]   She's getting one and one of her followers is getting one.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.120]   And Lisa is in the New Zealand.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.080]   So she's going to be one of the few New Zealanders
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.680]   who will actually have an iPad.
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.080]   And you don't have a great customer.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.760]   You could also be like Doug Llewellyn,
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.080]   because if she doesn't know, you pick a guy on her list,
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.040]   and she's single, and she hates technology,
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.360]   and then you bring these two people together,
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.840]   they end up getting married.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.360]   Boy, there's a guy from Fox.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.200]   That's how Rupert would do it.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.320]   It's Fox.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.000]   And then we'll put them on an island and have them duke it out.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.520]   And by the way, we're rising to the top of Digg.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.880]   So quickly go to a Digg and dig this story.
[01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.760]   And poor Lisa is her picture is now on the front.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.400]   She's going to be--
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.600]   Lisa, you're queen for a day.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.000]   Let me just say, you're queen for a day.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.440]   Here's what's happening in the chat room, says,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.800]   does Leo know that Conan asked permission
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.560]   before he friended his random person?
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.520]   Well, that's the difference between me and the network superstar.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.440]   That's what I'm asking.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.240]   Is it illegal?
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:45.880]   Is it immoral?
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:46.480]   Is it wrong?
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.520]   No, I don't think so.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.080]   I think I'm making her a star.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.760]   Famous.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.840]   Famous.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.440]   Yeah, I think she wants to.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.840]   Whether she wants to or not.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.280]   Holy crap, Leo, you got a huge story on Dig the other day.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.760]   Best tech I call her ever.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.360]   Yeah, we were on the front page for a while.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.480]   What was that all about?
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.280]   You know, I had a good week last week.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:08.880]   I had two viral videos that made it to the front page of Dig.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.160]   And I've had several hundred thousand.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.760]   Nothing like your Barney.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.160]   You didn't get to 1.3 million yet to get it.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.480]   Nothing like this stupid Barney video that John--
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:21.720]   I will never, ever understand John has 1.3 million hits
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.160]   on a video of Barney singing "I Love You" in his bathroom.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.160]   There's nothing else.
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:27.720]   It's just it.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.160]   That's it.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.320]   It's the whole video.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320]   Hey, I'm a genius.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.760]   That's in a weird place.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.920]   I guess it does.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.920]   So no, I'm only at 300,000.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.440]   It was a woman called the radio show.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.280]   I didn't even put it up.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.360]   Somebody watching said this is funny.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.640]   She called the radio show and she said, my Wi-Fi's down.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.000]   I bought a Wi-Fi extender and I can't get it anymore.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.120]   I said, oh, well, that's too bad.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.120]   And she said, yeah, I mean, there's no signal.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.320]   I said, well, that's--
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.240]   let me ask you a dumb question.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.480]   Did that call ever end, by the way?
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.040]   It was like--
[01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:57.120]   It's pretty long.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.680]   I said, let me ask you a dumb question.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.200]   You do have internet access, right?
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.760]   She says, no, no, no.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:02.680]   I said, you have an access point.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.400]   She says, no, no, no.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.040]   It's Link-Sis.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:06.920]   I said, what?
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.920]   She says, it's Link-Sis.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.400]   I said, you mean you're stealing it?
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.920]   Well, it's so expensive to get internet access.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.720]   And I said, and you're mad because it stopped?
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:25.160]   The person probably moved or just turned it off or passed away.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.760]   And she said, well, I've been getting it for a year and a half.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.120]   Oh, that's great.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.200]   Awesome.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.600]   There's another woman I've made famous, Jennifer.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.960]   And I don't know, similar in Southern California.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.040]   Anyway, so yeah, that kind of front of the dig.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.680]   And then I'm on a horse, old spice.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.640]   We got the--
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.080]   Oh, everyone's talking about that interview you did.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.200]   I love that commercial.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.760]   I was shocked.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.320]   So much.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.480]   So well, we just called the agency and said,
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.680]   would you explain how this is done?
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.920]   And so we walked through it and they explained how it was--
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.880]   it was all one shot.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.160]   They actually-- OK, you've seen the commercial, right?
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.400]   This is good-looking guy.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.360]   He says, ladies, look at me.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.080]   Now look at your man.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:04.880]   Now look at me.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.360]   Your man doesn't look as good as me.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.520]   But he could smell like me if he used old spice.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.440]   And he's in a shower.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.560]   But then the shower disappears.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.080]   And now he's on a boat.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:14.440]   And a shirt comes on and he's dressed.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.160]   And he continues to talk.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.920]   And eventually, at the end of the commercial,
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.240]   he somehow he's on a horse.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.520]   And he says, I'm on a horse.
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.760]   So I thought, oh, there's a lot of CG or editing or cutting
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:26.960]   here.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.200]   It's all one shot.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:33.360]   And the final scene, he's actually standing on this boat.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.280]   But he's on a gurney that without--
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.600]   he stands completely upright.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:39.680]   But you don't see below his waist.
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.320]   And his slides him onto this horse physically.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.680]   So it was amazing.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.160]   Anyway, so both of those got viral.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.000]   I was very happy about that.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.160]   You know, they do that.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.800]   So the other breaking news.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.920]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.040]   Like Clayton said, what is it?
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.160]   I was going to riff on what you were just saying.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.200]   On the hornet, we had a guy on a show.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.080]   You know the guy was in the train spotting?
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:03.840]   One of the guys.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.320]   Ethan--
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   Something.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.000]   Scottish fella.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.880]   And they do this entire--
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.240]   they do these over in England where they have four minutes
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.360]   to do a commercial instead of 30 seconds.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.640]   And all in like--
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.040]   they did it like in 30 takes.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:22.240]   But he starts at like the top of this mountain in Scotland.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.960]   And it was all for some sort of whiskey or something.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.120]   And he ends up on the bottom?
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.160]   Yeah, he walks for like four and a half minutes.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.240]   And all of these things along the journey,
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.280]   like he grabs something from someone.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.720]   So when he hands him a sword, a woman walks into frame,
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.800]   he makes out whether he has this bottle of whiskey.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.800]   He does this and that.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.680]   It was like a Scorsese shot through the bar.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.680]   Oh, I love that.
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.120]   Everyone's good fellas, yeah.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.280]   Yeah, there's no cuts at all.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:46.880]   And they do this.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.720]   They can get away with that because they got 40 seconds.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.960]   Well, you've seen the new OK Go video.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.840]   Oh my god.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.600]   The Rube Goldberg thing.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.560]   That's great.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.080]   They've got to be some edits in that though.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.160]   Well, Johnny Walker, Ed.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   Johnny Walker.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:02.640]   Johnny Walker.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.520]   I'm coming down from the mountain.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.160]   So the breaking news is Steve Jobs apparently
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.240]   has just shown up at the Oscars.
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.720]   No.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.640]   Get out of here.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.560]   Is he wearing a top hat?
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.160]   Is he wearing a weird hat that I saw on the other day?
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.600]   Somebody who's one of our maniacs here,
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:22.440]   I guess who is at the Oscars and also on the chat room,
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.200]   took a picture of him in the apparently
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.560]   over by the red carpet.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.240]   Oh, you're kidding.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.080]   Let's take a look.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   Is it the chat room?
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.040]   Yeah, it's in the chat room.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.360]   No, did you see the weird hat Clayton was-- did you actually see it?
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.400]   No, he put it on when he got--
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.760]   I didn't see him with the hat on.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.440]   He walks in and I run into him.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:41.000]   And I tweeted this the other day.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.920]   It's not every day you walk into work
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.200]   and you just run into Steve Jobs.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.560]   So he's coming through the one door at News Corp.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.160]   And I just walk right there.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.720]   And there he is with a contingent.
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.680]   And he was going upstairs because now the Wall Street Journal
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.080]   moved into our building.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.360]   And so he was going upstairs to show off the iPad.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.960]   But then I heard these reports of him in this funky hat.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.160]   And I didn't see him in the hat.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:05.720]   So I was so disappointed.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.880]   I didn't know if it was some sort of like jester
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.200]   hat with bells hanging off of it or what.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.280]   They said it was just a strange hat.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.760]   So here's the picture.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.000]   This is somebody who's posted this on his posturist.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.840]   It says, oh my god, Steve Jobs, I'm the only one yelling at him.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.520]   But I'm looking-- now Steve, of course, there he is.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.320]   He is, of course, on the board of Pixar,
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.880]   founder of Pixar.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.920]   And Pixar is nominated.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.640]   So I could see he'd be there.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.040]   And there he is.
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.320]   There's the security contingent, obviously, unless--
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.720]   So there's--
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.560]   Stuges.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.160]   You could see the Stuges in front and back.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.920]   I guess that's one event he would actually leave the house for.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.840]   I think that's great.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.520]   He's obviously--
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.160]   I think it's great.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.920]   He's healthy enough that he's going to the Oscars.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.480]   That's fantastic.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.480]   Well, I'm just going to think--
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.480]   He's like cameras.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.880]   If they're doing their job, somebody's
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.440]   going to have to throw a camera on him during the presentation.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:00.960]   No.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.160]   See, this is Hollywood.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:02.880]   This is Hollywood.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.120]   He's Steve Jobs.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.920]   I guess they would know who he is.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.880]   Well, they had this--
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.880]   There's one guy--
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.640]   I guess he's the only guy yelling it.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.680]   Maybe nobody knows what he looks like in Hollywood.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.040]   I mean, who knows?
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.200]   It could be.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.080]   I mean, if I had a choice between a shot of, let's say,
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.600]   Anne Hathaway and Steve Jobs, I pushed the button halfway.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:20.640]   Anne Hathaway.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.920]   Anne Hathaway.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.440]   Wow.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.680]   Well, they had this looser-- they had this looser policy this year.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:28.800]   Loser for speeches?
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.800]   What?
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.160]   They have a looser policy now.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.080]   So they have a looser policy now for speeches.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.880]   And every person who is nominated has been told to prepare
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.840]   two speeches for tonight's performance.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.000]   One long one short.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.280]   You're kidding.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.480]   One for the stage, if they win.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.680]   And then one, because they're going
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.640]   to have separate cameras now out in the hallway
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.520]   to speed up the feeling of the show.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.200]   So they're going to be out in the hallway for quick interviews
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.560]   or sort of like the, I don't know,
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.000]   Cinna Baverte interviews.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.320]   Hey, we just-- hey, here's Steven Spielberg.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.480]   What do you have to say?
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:04.240]   And they're just going to randomly grab--
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.800]   You're telling me those speeches are rigged?
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.840]   No, they don't know who's going to win.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.200]   So I found the Johnny Walker.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.240]   Two speeches, in other words, you give your canned speech
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.880]   in front of the microphone, in front of the public.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.320]   And then you go in the back and you give another canned speech.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   Give me a break.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   Why can't these people ad lib one line in their life?
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:22.520]   You think they're actors.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.480]   You know, they're actors.
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.000]   They could.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:24.560]   Well, that's the point.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.040]   They're actors.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.680]   They have to re-descript.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.560]   I'm suddenly thirsty for Johnny Walker, I can't.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.320]   I don't know why.
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.760]   This is the ad you were talking about, Clayton?
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.560]   Yeah, this is the one.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.160]   We had-- what's his name again?
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:35.640]   I don't know.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.080]   He's-- you recognize that guy?
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.360]   I'm from Train Spotting.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.200]   Yeah, I can't think of his name on top of my head.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.880]   But yeah, so this thing goes on.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.360]   And this is all one take.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.280]   There's a cow.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.280]   There's a cow.
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.480]   There was a grave.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.160]   So he's telling the story of Johnny Walker.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:49.800]   Yeah, the history of the--
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.960]   As he's walking.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   Now he goes on the grocery.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:53.560]   This is good.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.360]   Which is the door in the middle of the road.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.840]   It's like a grocery, but it's just a door.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.720]   So let me talk about some tech news.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.880]   We'll play the rest of this at some other point.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.800]   Can we do a side track this?
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.600]   We did do a little bit on Hollywood there.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.080]   Yes.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.800]   I went to the Dolby screening of the Alice in Wonderland movie.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.080]   What did you think of that?
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:12.800]   I liked it.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.520]   To be honest about it.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.200]   But I'm a big Tim Burton fan.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.280]   So as far as I'm concerned, he gets a pass on everything.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.480]   I really enjoyed the movie.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.600]   And I thought the whole thing was well done.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.720]   But did you ever explain on this show
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.240]   what those glasses are that Dolby uses and how they work?
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:28.880]   Yeah, we did.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.960]   Actually, Ray Maxwell did a whole--
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.720]   He's from the full Monty, by the way.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.600]   I have it on a Post-It note.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.520]   Not full Monty.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.560]   He's the full Monty.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:36.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.960]   He's not in train spotting?
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   No, he's the guy.
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.560]   Ah.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:41.560]   I think you're right.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.640]   I know he's in full Monty, too.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.800]   But you're the one who wants to check.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.960]   Post-It notes never lie.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:46.920]   Anyway.
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.360]   Anyway.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.320]   So we did, Ray Maxwell did a whole thing on 3D.
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.080]   Those glasses, there's three different kinds of 3D movies.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.360]   There's the real D. There's Dolby 3D.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.320]   And there's the iMac's 3D.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.440]   The only one that's active is the iMac's.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.240]   No, it's not active.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.520]   None of them are active.
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.800]   Which is the stuff that you can buy for your home now?
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.280]   Well--
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.480]   Let's see, yes.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.120]   They have a variety of different ones.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.560]   And those are active, because they need batteries in those.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.360]   Those are shut--
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.760]   Those are bad for you.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:18.400]   I think the real D is polarized, essentially polarized.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.760]   There's a circular polarized one.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.200]   I can't remember the details.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.400]   There's a notch filter.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.760]   No, there's one that's frequency.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.080]   Maybe that's the Dolby.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.760]   No, no, that's the notch filter one from Dolby.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.120]   It's a notch filter glass.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:29.620]   Right.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.080]   And the notch filters are angle at different--
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:31.880]   Right, frequency.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   Or they're slightly notches.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.720]   Yep.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.560]   And so when you get--
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.360]   Jesus, I can't figure out why they can't sell this crap.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.840]   No, it's a notch filter.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:41.360]   And apparently, they're just not slightly differently.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.760]   So they can shoot the whole thing through one lens,
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.520]   because it's the way the mirror spins around.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.120]   It has to be done on one of those DLP projectors.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.840]   And so you get this notch filter thing,
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.680]   which gives you the 3D effect, which is actually
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.360]   quite good for anybody who wants to see it.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.200]   But it's a little muddy.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.840]   And the real problem is because the notch filters
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.360]   take out half of what you're seeing.
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:14:59.880]   That's right.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.760]   On each eye, it's kind of jerky jerk in a funny way.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.880]   So the real fast action doesn't seem to be that great.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.360]   But that's the reason they're--
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.880]   I think those glasses that Dolby has--
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.280]   I didn't ask them about this because they're
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.000]   giving us a big presentation.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.320]   I think those lenses probably cost about $100 a piece.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:16.920]   Really?
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.920]   No.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.880]   In fact, one of the reasons--
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:23.520]   One of the reasons the notch filter one is a real thick lens.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:23.760]   Right.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.080]   One of the reasons the real D is very popular in theaters.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.680]   The glasses are four bucks each.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.440]   Or they're cheap.
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:32.800]   And the process doesn't require any special projector.
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.360]   They just--
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.520]   No, but it requires a silver screen.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.240]   It does require a modification of the screen.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.680]   But that screen can continue to be used for other movies.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.000]   Yeah, it has hot spots all over it.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.400]   I'm just giving you the third propaganda.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.400]   This is interesting.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.040]   So how was the Alice was it three--
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:48.720]   I liked it.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.240]   I enjoyed it.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:49.760]   It was great.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.880]   The 3D was outstanding.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.520]   It was fine.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.600]   There's a little muddy.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.120]   They claim it's-- they got better colors.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.440]   I'm not seeing that.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.360]   But I thought it was a good film.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.800]   I would recommend it.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.520]   So now every film is going to be coming out in 3D.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.920]   We've just got word that Spider-Man 4 is going to be in 3D.
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.440]   So such.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.120]   Shrek, the next Shrek film is going to be in 3D.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.400]   Every film coming down the pike is now--
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.720]   Go be people that--
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.080]   I was talking to spend most of the time
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.280]   with one of the senior VPs.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.080]   They believe that it's going to boil down on a year to year
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.640]   basis of 25 films in 3D no more.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.720]   Really?
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.640]   Why do they say that?
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.800]   I mean, I can imagine if you're a Christopher Nolan sitting
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.720]   there thinking about doing the next Batman film.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.440]   You want to do it in 3D, right?
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.560]   Yeah, I mean, or if you're a--
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:33.000]   There are unicorn movies, probably.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.880]   But I think-- well, I don't see Woody Allen doing a 3D movie.
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.760]   No.
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.120]   By the way, Robert Carlisle was in both the full money
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.640]   and train spotting, speaking of tent poles.
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.560]   Now we go, finally.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.000]   The facts come out.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.720]   Yes, thanks to the chat room.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:52.040]   So the text story I was going to mention--
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.760]   a lot of heat on Ubisoft when they announced
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:57.400]   that they were going to require that you authenticate
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:01.800]   before you play their games online.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.560]   In other words, you couldn't play Assassin Creed 2 even
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.520]   if you were playing the single player
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.840]   unless you were connected to the internet
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.800]   so that their DRM could authenticate this.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.400]   And they really pissed a lot of people off.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400]   Silent 105, same thing.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.120]   So what happens today?
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:21.840]   Ubisoft's DRM servers go down and you cannot play the game.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.400]   Yeah, the cloud strikes again.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.960]   You cannot play the game.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.240]   So if you're trying--
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.160]   What do they expect people that don't have internet access?
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.400]   They can't play.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.240]   They can't play.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.840]   There's one single player mode.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:35.920]   Yep.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.440]   That sucks.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.880]   But this is something that you always try to hit home on, Leo,
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.320]   which is-- the DRM hurts.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.120]   Honest users.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:43.720]   The cursor buys it.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.200]   Because it hurts the honest user.
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.280]   I want to point out that the Ubisoft DRM
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.560]   was cracked within 24 hours of its release.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.200]   So the pirates, they're playing.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:54.800]   They're fine.
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.440]   They're fine.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.360]   The pirates are the only one having a good time right now.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:57.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.800]   They'll be able to screw it.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.080]   Yeah, but those of you who bought Assassin's Creed 2
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:05.480]   for the PC, I guess you won't be playing that game today.
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.080]   Well, not your internet access.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.360]   Their internet access down.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.320]   That sucks.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.440]   Now, what's this DRM for the iBook store?
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.400]   I thought Apple had abandoned that.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.640]   But now, what is it that there's going
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.000]   to be DRM with the iBooks that you purchase through the iBooks
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:23.000]   store?
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.960]   They're using ePub, but they're using-- which is kind of open
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:30.680]   and not DRM, but they're using a DRM version of ePub.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.240]   But the publishers make them, do that, I'm sure.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.080]   What you think?
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.200]   Yeah, but I don't know.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.200]   I mean, if you buy an ePub book, can you
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.360]   buy an ePub book from a publisher on Sony eReader
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.480]   and have it be DRM?
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.560]   Yes, Sony stuff's DRM.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.280]   I think so.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:53.840]   Kindle certainly is.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:54.800]   No, I don't think--
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.680]   Kindle certainly is.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.360]   But I think the publishers demand that.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:58.720]   I know you--
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.960]   It's something with audio books, too.
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.480]   Yeah, Audible is DRM.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.080]   I'm telling you, look at this product coming out of India
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.800]   called the ADAM.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.360]   ADAM.
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.880]   And it's a-- what?
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.600]   It's a pad?
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.160]   It's an iPad killer.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:14.480]   And I hate to use that term since the iPad's probably dead
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:15.480]   anyway.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.560]   I don't think it's--
[01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.440]   Oh, I disagree.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.640]   I think that's going to be huge.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.600]   So this is from Notion Inc.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.200]   And it will have Flash.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.600]   It will have 1080p.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.400]   It will have twice the battery life.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.480]   And it will run Android.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.360]   And by the way, yes, there's a camera on it.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.160]   And it's 350.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.360]   OK, that's great.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.880]   OK, that's great that it'll run Android.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:37.920]   But the problem, again, with these devices is they
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.560]   run a version of the operating system that's not optimized
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.760]   for the device that they're on.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.400]   I agree.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.200]   And you know, you have the iPad that comes out
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:50.520]   with a version of OS X that looks beautiful on this device,
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:54.040]   optimized for that device instead of having to scale.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.560]   I mean, this is a problem that Microsoft had with Windows
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.640]   mobile.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.320]   You know, they stick a version of it on there that doesn't really
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:03.120]   work for the device that it's on.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.600]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.480]   I agree with you 100%.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.600]   I mean, the hard idea of a start button on a phone
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.040]   was just ludicrous.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.680]   And Apple has designed this really for a small device.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.440]   It worked on the iPhone.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.720]   I think it's going to be a hit.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.960]   But we could have a bet, John.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.320]   Not a little bet.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.280]   What would you like to bet?
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:26.720]   I already have a bottle wine.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.400]   A bottle wine from Costco.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.560]   From Costco.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.240]   Leo, Leo is a very good Bordeaux.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.600]   There's three of them, actually.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.720]   And which one do you want?
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:39.280]   Well, if I have a choice, the Leo Villaschos.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.320]   The Schos.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.200]   And what are you going to give me?
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.000]   And what is the criteria?
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.880]   I'm going to say they will sell a million iPads in the first year.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:48.920]   How about that?
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.880]   That's kind of low.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.480]   Isn't that kind of a low ball?
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.840]   Five million.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.480]   OK.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.080]   Five million.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:54.640]   I mean.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.600]   All right.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.840]   And what do you give them now?
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.320]   They use that as well.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.040]   Yeah, you don't believe that either?
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:20:59.800]   All right.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.280]   I believe they're going to sell five million.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:01.600]   Easy.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:02.080]   Absolutely.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.600]   They're going to sell more than that.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.800]   But I'm low balled.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.760]   We'll see.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.160]   And what do I get if they do?
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:10.160]   I get you to buy a fantastic wine.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.160]   1999 at Costco.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.440]   I've had that wine.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.320]   By the way, those wines are good.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.320]   I know.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.320]   They're fantastic.
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   I'm better.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.320]   They're fantastic.
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.320]   All right.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:30.360]   One more check to see how our queen for a day, Lisa Tickled Pink is doing.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.520]   And remember, you've got to follow her.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.400]   You've got to follow Lisa Tickled Pink.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.800]   And I will pick from one of those followers they will win an iPad and to compensate her
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.320]   for what will be undoubtedly a day of horror tomorrow.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.120]   We will give Lisa an iPad drum roll.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:54.400]   Please, Lisa Tickled Pink is now up to 2,467 followers that she's never heard of, has
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.400]   no idea.
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.960]   She's on 88 lists all of a sudden.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.280]   You just hit the front page of Dig 2.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.800]   And she's now on the front page of Dig.
[01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:04.800]   Thank you.
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.800]   She's famous.
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.800]   Thank you, Kevin Rose.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.800]   You did it.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.040]   This story had like 250 digs in no time.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.520]   Wow.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.280]   It's really shameful when we use our power in this...
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.760]   The power.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   The power.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.720]   Kevin Rose is the man at dig.com.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.880]   Of course, the host of Dig Nation.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   And I'm really excited.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.880]   I'm going to be in Austin.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   Can I come see you?
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   Are you serious?
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.880]   Yes.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.880]   Oh, dude.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.880]   We'll get you to VIP.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:30.880]   Come on on stage and say hi to you.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.880]   I will say hi.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.360]   I'm going to be there covering South by Southwest.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.360]   We arrived Thursday.
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.560]   We'll cover Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night, which is a big Dig Nation party.
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.200]   So it's Stubbs.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.200]   Where is it?
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.200]   Yes.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.640]   Leo, you should come out and do a story with us.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.640]   I will.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   I'm going to bring a big birthday.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.640]   I have a big birthday.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   It's a deal.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.840]   I have my camera on a stick and I got one of those live streamers.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.000]   There's a 20 pound backpack.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.200]   I've got a light, a camera and a microphone and I'm just going to wander like Gandalf
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200]   with my six.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   I even have a hat.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.080]   Is the camera on the staff itself?
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.080]   Yes.
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080]   That's starting to sound like scobble.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.320]   It was scobble's idea.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.560]   I saw you at CES with that thing.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.720]   You had like a Sherpa carrying that.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.880]   This time it's all me.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.320]   We wanted to see.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:19.880]   Colleen said, you know, we spent a lot of money because we flew, I think, eight people
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.360]   down to CES, put them up and it was very expensive.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.160]   She said, you know, you really could just do this by yourself.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.160]   So we're going to try that.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.960]   I'm going to South by Southwest, by myself.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.320]   I have, I think five or six hours of battery life.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320]   So I will turn that.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320]   Hello?
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   Huh?
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.040]   Please don't tell me AT&T like to read here or something.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.400]   No, the live streamer does them all.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:44.600]   So it has eight 3G cards for each of AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon.
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.560]   And then it load balances across them depending on who's got the bandwidth.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.160]   And we believe it will give us, no matter how bad the circumstances are, enough.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.840]   We only need three or 400 kilobits to stream a decent picture out of there.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.280]   So what I was thinking of doing, you're, of course, you're going to do a live stream
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280]   of the dignity.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.280]   Ignatian, right?
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   I know we don't do live streams.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.600]   Oh, well.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.920]   I won't be doing like a high quality live stream, but I'll show you what it's like to
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:07.920]   be in the audience.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.920]   Sounds cool.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:09.920]   Well, come on.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:10.920]   Come on stage.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   I will.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.920]   I will deal.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.920]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.760]   The worst part, the worst part is that you're going to be on Linksis.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:22.960]   Yeah, I get an extender because I'm counting on Linksis.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.360]   Clayton Morris is on Fox and Friends and his podcast.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.880]   You got, you got a number of podcasts.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.000]   I didn't realize you have more than just the gadgets and games podcast.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.520]   Yeah, you know, you dig yourself that whole, I've been doing this one podcast, Grizzly
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.760]   Buried Cafe with my best friend, Mike.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.400]   We grew up together, Catacorna right across the street over there.
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.880]   And we just talk about nerd stuff.
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.320]   We've been doing it almost two years now.
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.840]   We just talk about Batman 60s Batman.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.840]   We talk about comic books.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.800]   We've had, you know, we talk comic books.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.800]   We've had Andy and not go on the show because he's a big nerd.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.160]   Yeah, he's a great comic book fan.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.160]   So yeah, we just random random.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.800]   If you go to Clayton Morris.com, all of that stuff will be there, right?
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:01.800]   It's all, it's all housed there.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   Really great.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.800]   Finally, to get you on the show.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.360]   I really, I'm flattered to be here.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.680]   So I really appreciate it.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.680]   Kevin, of course, dig.com.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.520]   And as I mentioned that where can they, it's probably sold, is it sold out yet?
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:20.200]   There is a Facebook page that I will tweet out shortly at Twitter.com/C
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.000]   because that you had more than 2000 people.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   The line was around the block last year.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.080]   It's pretty crazy.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.080]   It's amazing.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.280]   I mean, this is, if you've never gone to a live dig nation, you've got to go.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:33.360]   Kevin and Alex, and it's just a blast and the people are there and everybody's in a
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.480]   great mood and it's just a party.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.760]   And that'll be it's, oh, do some crowds surfing with us.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.840]   We're going to do crowds surfing this year.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.840]   Okay.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.840]   Can I bring my staff?
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:41.840]   Have you ever done that before?
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.840]   No, what is it?
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.720]   You can jump out into the crowd and the crowd supports you up with their hands.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.440]   Okay, but I have to have my staff with us.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:53.680]   I'll wear my Google Slank it.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:54.680]   It's going to be fun.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.840]   I just, if you yell out, if you yell out Frodo in the middle of dig nation, that'll
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   be me.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:05.320]   That'll be me dig.com and revision three.com is where dignity lives.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.360]   And of course, John C. Devorak is at channel devorak.com.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.080]   There I am on the top of dig.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.560]   Look at that.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   Leo LaPorte takes a stranger to the top of Twitter and the top of dig.
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.560]   Amazing.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.880]   Well, you guys are at South by Southwest.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   I'll be weeding.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.400]   Is that a, is that a code?
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.400]   I just weeding.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.120]   No, I'm going to be digging up weeds.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.080]   You know, they're cropping up all over the place after all these rains.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.680]   I got a, I got to clear them out of the backyard.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:33.680]   Watch out for those blunts.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.680]   You have the weed wacker.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.680]   Yeah.

[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.280]   No agenda show.com the whole nine yards.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.280]   Johnny Walker.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.080]   I say something about John's blog, by the way.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.080]   Yes.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.080]   Please do.

[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.800]   Good man.

[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   I love it.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.840]   You know, because, and I, I got to say, I do, you know, a pitch meetings for Fox and
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.080]   friends and I, I always try to find irreverence stories because we're always going to be
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.080]   going to have the healthcare stories.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.080]   We're always going to have this.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.080]   We're always going to have this.
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.360]   We're always going to, I always try to find the stuff that makes me laugh.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:06.200]   And I swear to God, the stuff that you have on your blog ends up making me laugh and it,
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.520]   it hits my sense of humor.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.160]   So I end up pitching.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   Thank you.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:14.280]   Because just like Leo ends up taking a lot of stories from Dwight for shows, I end up
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.160]   taking a lot of stories from you from your blog for, for awesome.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.160]   That's great.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.320]   We are a source.
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.640]   Thank you very much.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   Devorak.org/blog.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.600]   Let's real quickly check one more time.
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.200]   Let's see how poor Lisa is.
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.200]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.200]   I've lost her.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.200]   I think she's flattened out.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.200]   She's flatlined.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.040]   No, no, let's keep her alive, kids.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.040]   Tickled pink.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.280]   I hate technology.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:41.560]   2,796 followers.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.800]   And when we come back next week, we want to beat Conan.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:48.760]   He only has 15,500 for his, for his victim.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.880]   We want more for our victim.
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.320]   And one of you is going to win an iPad and Lisa, you get an iPad too, my deepest apologies
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:59.480]   for selecting you without asking your father's permission.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.480]   Another twit.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.560]   He's in the can.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:08.560]   Do the twit.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:17.560]   Do the twit.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560]   All right.
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.560]   Do the twit.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.560]   All right.

[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.560]   All right.
