[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.120]   We also talk about Facebook's graph search and a guy
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.880]   in Las Vegas who does not have your iPhone.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.680]   He swears it.

[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.160]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.080]   Leo LePort here with a great panel
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.640]   to help us discuss the week's tech news,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.720]   including from the Houston Chronicle, Dwight Silverman,
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.400]   blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.160]   Hello, Dwight.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.880]   Actually, it's blogssingular.cron.com.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.520]   Blogsingular.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.760]   Yes, we dropped the S in a fit of modernism.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.680]   It's a simple--
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.840]   Foxborough, Foxborough.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.520]   Foxborough.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.440]   We were talking about that.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.960]   It's spelled differently for the stadium than the town.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.400]   That's right.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.840]   And so we're just one blog now.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.640]   It's going to be crazy at Foxborough at a minute.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040]   Nandy Inako is nearby.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.520]   So the crowds-- can you hear the crowds?
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.280]   The cheers, the roars?
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.720]   Oh, I've been charging people $30 to park in my front yard,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.360]   even though I'm actually about 60 miles away.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.360]   Hey, there's--
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.040]   Yeah, sometimes--
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.240]   --here.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's a long walk, but it might be a nice day.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.160]   And he's with the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.720]   Great to have you, also a regular on Mac break weekly,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.040]   and slumming a little bit on the Sunday show.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.640]   Nice to--
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.680]   It is the Lord's Day, but I'll make an exception for you, Leo.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.440]   Yeah, and it's also a Patriots game,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   which is very nice of you.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.000]   And, of course, from ABC News, Joanna Stern is here.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.560]   So nice to have you once again, Joanna.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.720]   I know we've been trying to--
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.360]   I don't think I've been on for like maybe a year.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.320]   Oh, that's horrible, and I apologize.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.480]   It is way too long.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.080]   No, it's been my fault.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.400]   I think we've asked you.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.080]   Don't make people think I'm a jerk.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.880]   I think, you know, I don't know, you being in the studio alone
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.120]   is what's going on.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.080]   Sad, sad.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920]   Well, somehow nobody will come here.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.960]   I think there was a football game on.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.720]   I might be wrong.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.760]   I think there was a football game on.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.400]   Bad football game.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.880]   That's not the--
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.640]   Can't wait to talk about it.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.240]   Yeah, I know.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.720]   I'm sure you're dying.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.520]   We'll get into all of that in a little bit.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.440]   But first, we want to go to New Zealand,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.720]   because that's where Paul Spain is.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.560]   He is on the NZ podcast.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.280]   He also is writing this up for Mashable,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.880]   because he's covering the biggest website
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.000]   launch in some time.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.320]   Kim.com's mega launched yesterday.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.720]   Hi, Paul.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.000]   Hi, how you doing?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   It was exactly one year ago that mega upload was shut down.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.080]   The servers were confiscated by the feds.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.040]   And Kim.com was arrested.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.680]   He still has not been extradited, right?
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.640]   He's still in New Zealand, I think.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.680]   What's the latest on his case?
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.760]   So his extradition has been pushed out
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.600]   to later in the year, probably September at this stage.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.280]   So he's got plenty of time to kill before any chance
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.120]   that he has to face his accusers in the US, which, I guess,
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.880]   is the reason why he's started a new business.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.680]   Why not?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.760]   The United States Department of Justice, of course,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.440]   shut down mega upload claiming it was a haven for piracy.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.080]   The DOJ's statement in the case a year ago
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.360]   was that this action is among the largest criminal copyright
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.120]   cases ever brought by the United States
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.520]   and directly targets the misuse of a public content storage
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.080]   and distribution site to commit and facilitate
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.320]   intellectual property crime.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.560]   Kim.com didn't help the case much because he was somewhat
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.520]   of a flamboyant character.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.080]   Doesn't he have a car with a license plate gangster?
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.880]   Yeah, he's got a number of license plates
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.240]   like that, evil.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.960]   He had one which said police on it.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.880]   So yeah, he's a bit of a character.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.400]   But I guess it's sort of unclear, really,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.200]   how people feel about him.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.480]   There seem to be really sort of mixed opinions here
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.400]   in New Zealand.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.280]   I imagine it's the same all around the world.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.000]   Yeah, well, there were a lot of people
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.160]   upset about mega upload shutdown because they
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.640]   had legitimate files on the site.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   It was a file sharing site.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.240]   It wasn't intended to be a piracy.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.920]   So maybe it was.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.000]   But people treated it like a drop box
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.720]   or another file sharing site and had legitimate stuff there,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.400]   which they lost access to because the feds took all the servers.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.600]   So Kim has launched a new business.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.720]   Tell us about mega.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.160]   It launched like it was like it was
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.120]   de-dossed practically by people trying to sign up.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.880]   Yeah, they had within the first two hours,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.760]   there was a quarter of a million signups, as what we're told.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.320]   And by the time of the press conference in the evening,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:56.200]   there were some 500,000 members to the new mega.co.nz website.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.920]   But it's been very patchy in terms of access to the site.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.280]   And even today, trying to access it, many people
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.040]   have found that they just can't reach the site.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.080]   You know, he's a showman, obviously.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.160]   Instead of calling this--
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.120]   well, a mega is called the privacy company, which
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.360]   is kind of obviously a play on piracy.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.600]   Bigger, better, faster, stronger, safer.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.200]   I'm surprised he doesn't say sexier.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.840]   Who's signing up?
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.400]   And is it because they are desperate to become members
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:33.920]   of this or because they just want to participate?
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.800]   And what is obviously a pretty big show?
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.880]   Well, it is a big show.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.320]   And Kim has a huge following around the world.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.880]   And he's had a massive amount of media attention, really,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.760]   in the last few months.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.960]   And in fact, he said yesterday that New Zealand is probably
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.200]   sick of all the media attention he's had.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.320]   And following this launch, he's going
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.920]   to be pretty quiet up until his extradition hearing.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.600]   But he's certainly been playing on the notoriety
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.040]   that he's gained through his arrest last year
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.240]   and the raid on the dot com mansion, which, in fact,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.360]   they played out a dramatized version of that raid
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.480]   last night for the launch.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.520]   So there was a helicopter that swelled in.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.880]   There were men cloaked in black with automatic weapons
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.400]   that abseiled off the roof of the house
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.160]   and then circled around the audience.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.000]   So it was a pretty entertaining spectacle, I've got to say.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.880]   Did you go?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.760]   Yeah, we had a smaller time.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.600]   We were the small group session that they had for a few media
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.400]   in the afternoon.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.840]   There were about 10 of us that got to spend some time directly
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.960]   with him asking him a range of questions.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.640]   And then they had the broader event in the evening
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.200]   where there were probably 200 or 300 people in attendance.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.800]   I don't want to monopolize Paul Soandie or Joanna or Dwight,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.920]   if you have questions, you'd like to ask.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.480]   We've got a man on the ground at the dot com mansion.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.960]   He's not in custody right now.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.840]   Is he just walking about?
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.160]   Yeah, he's been producing music.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.720]   He's been obviously working on this new business venture
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.440]   with a number of partners, including his three co-accused.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.040]   And he's found a number of people to fund this
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.000]   because most of his funds have been locked up.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.480]   Due to what's going on, most of his assets were seized,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.120]   apparently some $100 plus million worth of assets.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.240]   So he's had to get outside investors.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.880]   And he seems to have a few friends about the place
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.120]   that helped him pay his rent whilst he was in jail.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.360]   And some of those people have come to the party
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.160]   and are supporting this new endeavor.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.360]   Paul, have either the US authorities or the New Zealand
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.080]   authorities had anything to say about mega?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.040]   Have they basically said, you better watch your step pal
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.840]   or had anything at all where they've since he said,
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   you look like you're doing the exact same thing you did before?
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.640]   They haven't heard any comment at all.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.560]   It's possibly too soon for that.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.480]   But what's come from his legal team
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.840]   is that this has been the most scrutinized tech launch
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.800]   in history from a legal perspective.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.480]   And they believe that their squeaky clean
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:52.040]   as far as stepping over any legal lines.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.760]   Now, is this guy part of the pantheon of the cast of characters
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.160]   we all know who are tech CEOs and do things?
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.280]   Or is he just like, oh, in New Zealand,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.920]   is this just thought of, oh, well, people who are in detect
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.560]   know of this thing that's happening on their soil.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.320]   And otherwise, regular people don't care.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.600]   Is he a personality over there?
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   Is it?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.400]   Yeah, he is.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.960]   I mean, he's had just so much media coverage
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.320]   over the last few months that everyone knows who he is.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.120]   To the point where there are certainly people
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.920]   that have been saying, we are sick of seeing and hearing
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.760]   about Kevin Talkom.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.800]   He's had enough time in the limelight.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.200]   But there's another group that are just very excited
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.640]   about anything that he does.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.960]   And we're very, very quick to sign up for the site,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.120]   obviously, with those others around the world.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.320]   Of course, 50 gigabytes of free storage is one reason to sign up.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.960]   And that's a good deal.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.520]   Go ahead, Joanne.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.560]   Right.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.080]   That's my question is, do you really
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.920]   think this service has a real shot,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.720]   given-- I mean, it's a very compelling deal, right?
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.160]   50 gigs free, 999 or 9 euros a month for 500 gigs.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.280]   I mean, crazy deal.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.040]   And I assume consumers would be interested.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.160]   But given the history, why would anyone
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.400]   trust their files on this kind of service?
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.800]   Well, I think they trust their files on the service,
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.200]   because they first and foremost, they love Kim.com.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   They love what he stands for in terms of internet freedom
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.520]   and free file sharing and so on.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.920]   So there's that audience that I think
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.400]   will sign up straight away.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.920]   And I guess we have to just wait and see
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.600]   to how the service performs, how long it takes
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.480]   for the downloadable apps to appear on smartphones,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.120]   on Windows and Mac and Linux and so on.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.600]   There's a lot that's been promised down the track.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.160]   He also showed off yesterday on Twitter
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.280]   the Mega Movie Service, which they'd
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.160]   started developing ahead of his arrest.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.280]   And they detailed the Mega Key, which itself
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.240]   is somewhat controversial.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.040]   You know, I've been trying to sign up since we began the show.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.600]   And I still have a rotating ball.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.920]   It's not easy to get an account at this point.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.320]   The servers are well overwhelmed.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.800]   And it's interesting.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.360]   He really is-- you're right.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:13.840]   He's opposed to--
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.520]   Go back to that screen.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.560]   I need to get Leo's password.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.640]   It's eight dots just right at that.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.840]   You're just uploading your entire hard drive there, right?
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.600]   50 gigs?
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.200]   I'm happy.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.680]   I'm there.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.180]   I'm in.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.360]   You know, what could possibly go wrong?
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.880]   Let me ask--
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.440]   I'm just spending the rest of the show doing this.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.400]   Yeah, you probably will.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.960]   I mean, I'm still waiting.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.200]   What is the nozillion government's attitude
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.840]   in the record, kim.com, Paul?
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.040]   Well, there's been some controversy there, too.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:49.800]   And because the New Zealand spy agency, the GCSB,
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.920]   was actually spying on kim.com.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.640]   And they're by law only allowed to spy on people that
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.000]   are not citizens.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.560]   And as it happened, your head already
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.840]   become a resident at the stage that they were spying.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.760]   So they had well overstepped their mark.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:21.760]   And the prime minister had been alerted to some of this activity.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.120]   I don't think anyone maybe joined the dots and realized
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.560]   that he was a resident at the time.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.960]   But yeah, there's certainly been some comments
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.800]   that the prime minister is forgetful around some of the things
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.360]   that he heard and has made some statements that have probably
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.320]   got him into a little bit of hot water around the situation.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.160]   Kim.com's career is somewhat chakered.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.440]   He's actually German citizen, a young internet tycoon who
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.240]   is later convicted of embezzlement, went to New Zealand
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.800]   and the mega mansion is, in fact, a mega mansion.
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.840]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.160]   So he's obviously made some money.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.320]   The CNN says the assets that were served
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.160]   as probably seized in this action,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.640]   including the servers in Virginia and Washington
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   to see were worth $50 million.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.840]   Was this money all made legitimately through mega upload?
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.320]   Well, I guess that comes down to with you
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320]   the point of view.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   You're up low.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   Is legitimate or not?
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:33.680]   I don't think there's any question that there was a lot of
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.960]   sharing of copyrighted content.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.680]   You could probably say that on Dropbox.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.280]   And any other site is whether they encouraged it
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.840]   and what they did about it, I guess, right?
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.320]   Well, I guess from the encouragement side,
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.240]   what they did was they incentivized
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.480]   people to have their content downloaded.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.000]   So if you uploaded something and it was downloaded a lot,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.120]   then there were some incentives.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.600]   Now, interestingly, one of the limitations around that
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.440]   was that the files had to be under 100 megs for you
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.520]   to receive that incentive.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.080]   So kim.com made it made a point of that from the stage yesterday
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.680]   and saying, well, it's ridiculous that people would
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.240]   accuse us of using this to distribute movies.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.040]   And incentivizing that because the files were too small.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.320]   But actually what happened is that the files were broken down
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.960]   and people would break them down to be under that 100 megs
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.320]   into a few pieces.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.440]   And those files would be, you know, rard.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.920]   And so then they would join those files up together
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.600]   after downloading them.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.040]   So yeah, that particular statement probably
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.680]   doesn't put you know, kim.com in a particularly good light
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:17:00.880]   because those that use the service knew that he wasn't really
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.960]   sharing the full story, shall we say?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.640]   You may remember just shortly before they were shut down,
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.000]   the controversy over the song, the megalupload.com,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.360]   a song that had P Diddy and Chris Brown and a lot of celebrities,
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.920]   a lot of musicians performing on the song.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.320]   And then their record labels complained saying,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.160]   we didn't give them permission.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.760]   The song got pulled down and put back up and pulled down
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   and put back up.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.200]   It's currently up right now.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.160]   It sounds like artists like megalupload
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.440]   because it was a great distribution facility for them.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.360]   But the record labels didn't look at so much
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.400]   because they feared they were losing revenue.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   Well, would you use it to distribute podcasts?
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:43.920]   Sure.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.560]   If the price is right, yeah.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.600]   Why not?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.000]   And that's the point is that they're just as maybe there
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.040]   is piracy, maybe even encourage it.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.360]   But it's also used for legitimate files as well.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.000]   Did he say anything yesterday about attempting
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.680]   to make the new mega more copyright friendly?
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.200]   No.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.960]   I think he said all the right things,
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.160]   that they were legal.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.640]   He said that there were takedown processes and so on.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.480]   So yeah, he said the right things.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:24.440]   But he didn't, I guess, suggest that they would be any more
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.920]   restrictive on copyrighted content than what
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.920]   megaupload.com was.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.360]   Now, the other point I'm not sure we've discussed yet
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.760]   is that the big differentiator for this site from his perspective
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.800]   is that it encrypts all the content that goes online.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.640]   So they can't actually look--
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.080]   the files that sit on the servers are encrypted.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.960]   So somebody that would have direct access to the servers
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.320]   does not have access to the content without the encryption
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.960]   keys.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.880]   All right.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.040]   Paul Spain is a podcaster tech journalist.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.000]   You can look for his coverage of this unmasheable.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.160]   And on the NZ podcast, where can we find that podcast, Paul?
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.920]   NZtechpodcast.com.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.960]   Thank you so much for joining us from New Zealand.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.400]   Thank you.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:10.920]   Appreciate it.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.880]   What a fascinating story.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.320]   So Leo, I was able to get on while--
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.760]   You got an account?
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.720]   I got an account.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.480]   I got an account.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:24.360]   But it has hung up on generating my 2048-bit encryption
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.280]   key.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.400]   So I've just got some gears turning,
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.560]   and I'm waiting for my key.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.160]   But I was able to get in, and I do have an account.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.080]   Well, start sharing some movies, music, both of you.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.640]   I've got all these old Twitch podcasts.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.760]   Hey, that you can.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.760]   That's legit.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.560]   We're creative moments.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.920]   So one of the interesting things about this
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.560]   is the bandwidth sufficient.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.160]   I mean, yeah, he's got--
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.320]   is this a rush?
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.920]   But if he's offering 50 gigabytes free and $500
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.880]   for a relatively low price, and it's doing this right now,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.800]   is he going to have the bandwidth
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.640]   to handle the size of the content that's
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.240]   going to be uploaded and downloaded from here?
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.300]   There's so many weak points here that they could pinch them off
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.220]   in as money supply.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.420]   They could pinch them off in bandwidth.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.420]   They can pinch them off in server location.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.380]   I'm wondering how long it's going to be before people
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.900]   think that people will have confidence that meg uploads
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.100]   going to be here or year from now.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.100]   Because one of the great things about SkyDrive, Dropbox,
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.660]   and all those other services is that you
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.220]   know that if you put a file there,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.900]   Amazon is probably not going away.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.380]   Google also likely not going away any time
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.300]   the next two or three years.
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.380]   And you won't find yourself with 40, 50 gigabytes
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.180]   worth of data that suddenly is now locked up
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.580]   in the Justice Department.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:41.460]   We're going to take a break.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:41.980]   Totally.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.580]   When we come back, we'll talk more about the tech news.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.780]   But that story-- you know, one thing we can agree on,
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.820]   I think, kim.com is a mega showman.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.140]   And it makes it fun to cover the story when you've
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:57.060]   got somebody like kim.com stirring up interest.
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.180]   Joanna Stern is with us from ABC News
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.180]   from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.260]   Dwight Silverman and from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.820]   It's Andy and I go, we've got like real journalists
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.980]   on the show today.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:09.900]   Holy cow.
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.660]   Let's just take the pressure off by saying that two of us
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.580]   are real journalists.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.340]   The third one is a fake who's hoping not to be found out.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.860]   And you figure out what this is.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:20.860]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.580]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.700]   Adam Inks at Macquarie.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.460]   Actually, guys, I am a Mantiteo's girlfriend.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:28.980]   So--
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.620]   Oh, we found her!
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.180]   You said you didn't know anything about football.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.020]   I--
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.180]   True.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.980]   That's true.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.820]   She lives.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.380]   Good luck.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.060]   Thank you, Joanna Stern.
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.420]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.020]   Just call me Lene.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.580]   What was her name?
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.580]   Lene.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.580]   Lene.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.580]   Lene Kakua.
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.140]   Ladies and gentlemen, ABCNews.com.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:54.940]   In the flesh.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.500]   In the flesh.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.980]   And we're brought to you today by our friends at stamps.com.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.740]   You don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.340]   I give you permission to stay home and print your own postage.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.340]   Sounds like something Kim.com might have thought up.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.860]   But no, in fact, it's completely legal.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.420]   It's stamps.com.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.020]   All you need is your printer, your computer,
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.580]   and a count with stamps.com.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.380]   You print the postage you need.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.300]   I didn't know this, but the poster rates are going up.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.180]   It's like they need more money.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:23.620]   What?
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.900]   So anyway, no, it's not that.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.900]   But you don't have to get new stamps now.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.620]   You just stamps.com automatically updates, unlike a postage
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.340]   meter, automatically updates the rates.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.060]   In fact, our free trial gives you a nice little scale
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.380]   that you could plop your letter or package on.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.580]   It's a USB scale that tells the software how much it weighs.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.340]   And you always have exactly the right postage.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.140]   Never a penny more than you need to spend never a penny less.
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.060]   And one of the things I love about stamps.com
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.860]   is you get discounts on a priority mail and express mail.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.780]   You just can't get it to post office.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.140]   And then of course, the mail carrier comes, picks up the package.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.100]   You never have to get up from your desk.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:57.860]   Try it today.
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.780]   Absolutely free.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.460]   Go to stamps.com and you see that $80 value.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.500]   That's a great special offer.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.140]   But don't do that.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.460]   Click the radio microphone for a little bit of a better deal
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.620]   we've got for you here.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.700]   Enter the offer code TWIT.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.980]   And that $80 offer turns into a $110 bonus offer.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.620]   $55 in postage.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.500]   You can use over the next few months.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.100]   The digital scale is yours for free.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.660]   You just pay postage and handling.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.740]   I think it's $5.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.740]   You get a $5 supply kit to make up for that.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.780]   And a four week trial of stamps.com.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.100]   This is a pro tip for anybody who does a lot of mailing.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.820]   Takes the data right from the page
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.700]   if you're PayPal, Amazon, Etsy, eBay, all of those.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.420]   Or from your address book, if you use QuickBooks,
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.460]   it takes them there.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.420]   Automatically prints it'll print right on the envelope
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.340]   if you're mailing out bills.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:39.940]   It's great because your logo's on at the stamps
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.940]   and your return address plus the recipient's address.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.060]   Automatic, fast, easy to use.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.500]   Stamps.com.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.900]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.820]   That $110 bonus offer when we thank stamps.com.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.780]   For supporting our podcast.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.700]   So you didn't get the beach ball.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.500]   I got the beach ball still on the mega beta.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.340]   That's all right.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.420]   I didn't really want an account.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.460]   It would be fun to be able to--
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.900]   Look at this mansion.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.900]   This is a nice house.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.820]   The beach ball lasted for quite a while.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:13.980]   And then it cleared and sent me a confirmation to my email.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.180]   And then when I clicked the confirmation,
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.420]   it didn't accept the password that I had actually put in,
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.980]   refreshed the screen, and then it started generating my keys.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.140]   There's a lot of glitches to it.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.740]   Now, it's still generating the keys.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.220]   It's probably traffic, right?
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:28.700]   Right.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.620]   Hopefully.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.500]   Hopefully it's not uploading all my stuff now.
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.300]   You don't know, do you?
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:35.940]   No.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.900]   You do not.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.420]   So Facebook had a little bit of an event this week on Tuesday
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.060]   at M.A. Go.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.260]   Anybody go over to the Facebook headquarters?
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.100]   No.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.540]   No.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.020]   No.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.260]   You missed out.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.460]   They announced social graph search.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.140]   What about the worst name?
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.580]   You could give anything.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.540]   There's no human besides those of us in the industry
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.020]   know what a social graph is.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.700]   Andy, what is Facebook's social graph search?
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.660]   I'll let you define it.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.060]   Well, we're asked before they had sort of a lame search
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.940]   feature that was about as full-featured as what you'd
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.500]   find on a word processor in 1991.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.980]   Now the idea is to make sure that no matter what's happening,
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.980]   no matter what's been posted publicly,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.260]   anywhere in the Facebook world, not only
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.340]   is it searchable and findable, but also
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.140]   it's a search method that will also
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.060]   understand connections between all that data.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.140]   So it's not just for seeing what happened in last week's
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.660]   issue, a fantastic forum, what are people talking about it.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.820]   It's also good for things like show me--
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:40.580]   and this is almost the natural language input of this--
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.660]   show me restaurants in New York City that
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.300]   have been liked by friends or friends of my friends.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.060]   So if you're in the city, you don't know where to eat,
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.420]   you can find someplace that's not just a random location.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.820]   But here's a restaurant that some of my friends have actually
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.260]   liked and you can access the information.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.260]   And it's very, very wide and broad
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.100]   because you might immediately start thinking about it
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.100]   as I want to be able to get valuable information from all
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.740]   the data that my friends are putting in.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.180]   But it's also things like give me a list of alumni
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.380]   of University of Massachusetts who now work for Pixar.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.180]   And that will give you a list of people that say, hey,
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.260]   I'm full of alumni, give me a job.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:15.900]   And hit people badly.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.220]   That could be good.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.900]   And I think it's very telling, though,
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.020]   that so much of Zuckerberg's pitch during this event
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.900]   was saying that it's not going to be whatever you--
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.020]   we will obey.
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.420]   The search feature is going to obey whatever privacy controls
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.220]   you've already said.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.540]   So it's not as though a picture or a like or something
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.860]   you've written that is only supposed to be available
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.660]   to your friends will be visible to people
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.580]   outside of your circle of friends or outside of your family.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.300]   On the other hand, it really does open things up
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.580]   to a much wider potential for exploitation now.
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:54.420]   Because if it's-- even if Facebook's claims of their user
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.660]   base is halfway true, that would be one person for every--
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.180]   one Facebook user for every 14 human beings on this planet.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.100]   And if you were trying to sell anything to anybody, oh, boy,
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.860]   you just got a cat--
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.500]   up to an 8-pound catheter, a cream egg,
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.460]   just delivered right to your doorstep from Facebook.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.580]   So I think that my own opinion is
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.980]   that if this were Apple, we'd think this is OK.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.820]   Interesting feature, a long time coming.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.500]   If it were Google, we'd think, obviously,
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.940]   they're going to make a lot of money out of this,
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:23.620]   but they're probably going to deliver a service that's
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.340]   going to be profoundly useful because they
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.820]   like to integrate things from all the internet at once.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.420]   With Facebook, you're like, oh, man,
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.820]   how are they going to turn this into a way
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.700]   to make sure that they take more and more data from us
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.900]   than we ever intend to give up?
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.940]   And how is this going to wind up being something bad that
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.700]   makes me regret being a member of Facebook?
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.500]   And we're going to have to find out what that's going to be.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.540]   Like Elgin said in his "Datimation" column,
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.500]   if you love Facebook, you'll love graph search.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.300]   If you hate Facebook, you'll hate graph search.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.740]   Is that what it comes down to, Joanna?
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.020]   I'll let Joanna talk for a minute.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.060]   Let me tell you.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.980]   Andy said pretty much everything I was going to say.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.140]   I actually think the service is really useful.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.820]   I've got it.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.540]   And it's so much more powerful than the old search
[00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.540]   crap that they had.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.100]   So I'm able to find people faster,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.580]   able to find-- I was working on a story last week.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.620]   It's just easier to find information on there.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.380]   Of course, I think there's so much distrust in Facebook
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.100]   that people's reactions to this were, oh my god,
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:25.140]   how are they going to start making money off of me?
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.500]   Oh, I have to go back and check all my information.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.420]   And I wrote a story this week, just basic stuff.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.780]   Go back and check what you've liked,
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.180]   because you might have liked stuff 10 years ago on Facebook
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:36.860]   or ever long.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.660]   You started on Facebook.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.660]   For me, it was in college.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.940]   You liked something.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.420]   Even I said in my article, like, let's say
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.300]   you liked something weed back in college.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.260]   Now that you're able to surface that information,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.860]   that information is somebody goes search for people who
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.540]   like weed, and your name comes up.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.060]   So I think there's a lot of--
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.860]   yes, Dr. Berg said this respects all of the privacy concerns
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.780]   that anyone can have.
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.780]   It respects all the privacy settings that we have.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.540]   But it also opens it up so much more, as Andy said.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.980]   One thing I think they changed-- Lisa Chatham saying--
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.500]   is that a few weeks ago they disabled the ability
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.740]   to say, I'm opting out of search.
[00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:18.180]   So you are now automatically required to participate.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.660]   That happened about a month ago, and they turned it off.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.620]   And this is before anybody knew that social--
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.140]   in the hand--
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.900]   --and graph search was coming.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.420]   And so now you simply can't walk away from it.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.980]   But I don't recall if they said when they stopped that feature,
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:38.580]   if you had had disabled search, are you grandfathered in?
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.420]   So those people who had said, I don't want to be part of search,
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.020]   do they get to stay?
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.580]   What certainly the case is that everybody
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.180]   should start looking at their settings,
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.620]   their privacy settings in Facebook,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.180]   and make sure that you are blocking.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.940]   Because it does at least obey those, right?
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.420]   So if--
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:56.860]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.100]   But any like is--
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.020]   Joanna, are all likes inherently public?
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.220]   Yes.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.820]   I'm pretty sure all likes are public.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.580]   I think you can go back.
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.420]   And I mean, if you--
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.860]   I don't know if you go to a-- when you go to that like page,
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.940]   if you can share that just with your friends, I think--
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.940]   I think it's public.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.540]   It depends on--
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.020]   I think that's also going to depend on who can see your profile,
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.580]   to adjust your friends, if it's public.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.220]   So that's all part of that.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.220]   But you see the problem?
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.620]   I mean, even Randy Zuckerberg's Mark's sister--
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.180]   Oh, totally.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.660]   --doesn't understand how this stuff works.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.500]   Mark doesn't understand.
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.460]   So there's going to be leakage.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.780]   There's also a question of just how good the data
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.100]   that the graph search will have to work with.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.860]   So for example, a lot of people will like a brand
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.740]   or like a page in order to be entered into a contest.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.780]   They don't necessarily actually like it.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.260]   But they want to get something from that brand.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.300]   And then they are stuck indicating
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.740]   that they like this page.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.220]   So you--
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.460]   Well, you're not stuck because you can unlike anything you've
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.020]   liked.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:30:59.540]   Right.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.100]   But how many people go back and do that?
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   Right.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.740]   Nobody.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.100]   You know, if the stuff doesn't constantly
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.980]   show up at your feet and you're not annoyed by it,
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.620]   and that can happen, then suddenly,
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.780]   the information that you have as to what you like
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.940]   doesn't actually reflect what you really like
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.260]   or what you really endorse.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.700]   So you should go to your timeline, go to your likes.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.420]   I do this kind of fairly frequently.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.660]   And now they organize them by year.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.740]   So you can go back in time and see
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.180]   what you liked in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.100]   And I like Amazon.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.020]   I don't even know who this is.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.660]   I don't know who they are.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.620]   Washington Post's social reader doesn't exist anymore.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.220]   Apparently, there's a page called Leo LaPorte's Shirts.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.940]   I do like that.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.660]   So yeah, I don't remember liking a lot of this stuff.
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.100]   It might be really a good idea to go through these
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.300]   and take them off because this is part of the search, right?
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:52.660]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.780]   That's exactly what I suggested.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.100]   Because Moto actually had a really funny article.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.660]   They did some stuff where it was like search for--
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.660]   I actually won't even say it with some of the search
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.260]   for--
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.180]   Well, it's Gizmodo.
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:05.740]   It's Gawker.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.420]   So we got a idea.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.860]   People might have done it as a joke.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.980]   But then someone goes and searches,
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.260]   let's say you're looking for a job or whatever the case may be.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.420]   And you come up in that search.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.660]   It's not a very good thing.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.260]   So one of my suggestions is definitely
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.260]   go through your likes.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.060]   Also make sure to set your preferences to only friends.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.780]   When you have that little box, when you share your status,
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.780]   it defaults to friends.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.460]   But make sure you haven't switched to public.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.220]   And then you're sharing everything public.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.860]   But definitely go through your likes.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.660]   Yeah, good luck.
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.380]   I spent time doing that this week.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.540]   Good luck keeping that up to date.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.780]   That's a full-time job.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.540]   Because they keep changing things.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.260]   I mean, it's--
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:49.980]   Well, I think as with the advent of this feature,
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.620]   people, if they're smart, will pay attention when they like
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.140]   something.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.260]   I think it could change the behavior of what people do
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.660]   on Facebook, which I think is what Facebook wants.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.780]   I mean, they ultimately want the data that's being pulled into
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.660]   this graph search to be of higher quality.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.460]   So you're apt to now click on things that you actually like
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.020]   if you know that they're going to show up in one of these searches.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.060]   What it sure is telling.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:15.980]   This shows the two stories we just did,
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.660]   mega and Facebook, show how reputation, how important it is.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.140]   So kim.com, who is--
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.700]   I mean, really, let's face it, a shady character.
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.620]   People love him.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.140]   And so they're signing up by the hundreds of thousands for a
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.100]   service that-- who knows how reliable or safe it is at all.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.740]   Meanwhile, Facebook, people are very wary of.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.900]   And the most immediate reaction to a social graph search is,
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:47.060]   oh, my God, what kind of-- what fresh privacy invasion is
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.540]   this?
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.780]   Just shows you how your reputation really colors everything.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.820]   And now it seems with Facebook becoming so important to
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.700]   marketing and to profiling that.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.900]   Now, even those of us who decide that I don't want to have a
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.540]   presence on Facebook, I don't want to be active on Facebook,
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.660]   that too is being taken by some people as here is a sign of
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.260]   how we know-- here's how we know who Andy Naco is.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.540]   He doesn't want to post anything on Facebook.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.580]   And the worry-- and this might be getting uncomfortably close
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.020]   to the margin of paranoia.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.420]   But if you are competing very, very aggressively with three
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   or four other candidates for a job, and whoever's doing the
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.300]   screening can feel as though they can get a very complete
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.220]   picture from three of them because of their Facebook
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:27.940]   activity.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.740]   And you're more of a cipher.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.620]   Maybe they're-- that's at least going to take five points
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:33.580]   off of your final score.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.100]   And if that's enough to deny you a job, that's kind of a
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:37.980]   little bit worrisome.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.860]   I'm ashamed to admit it, but if somebody doesn't have a
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.700]   Facebook page, I probably would be less likely to consider
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.580]   hiring them here.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.020]   Well, you're a special case.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.820]   That would indicate that someone who is supposed to be
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.500]   working for a really seriously tech-oriented company
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.740]   doesn't have a Facebook account.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.900]   As opposed to having it like me, I have a Facebook account,
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.180]   and I use-- I access it maybe every week or two, chiefly just
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.860]   to read the status updates of my nieces and my nephews.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.980]   All this-- I talk to my family, but it's not as though I'm
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.340]   going to call them every other day to find out, hey, did you
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:11.620]   do it?
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.380]   Do you happen to do a half marathon last week?
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.260]   If so, how did you do?
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.980]   And is there a picture that you can send me?
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.660]   But Facebook is good for stuff like that.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:21.260]   But really, for what do I like, what one am I interested in?
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.420]   My Facebook activity pretty much leads me as a cipher.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.420]   And so that's where we know who I'm--
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.140]   That's suspicious, frankly.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:27.500]   I think that's--
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.340]   What do you like?
[00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:28.820]   Yeah, what is--
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.980]   Well, who is this Andy and not go anywhere?
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.420]   Who are you?
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.660]   I'm the wind, baby.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.780]   You're not supposed to do it.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.140]   So Leo, one of my main jobs--
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.220]   I want to be the Kaiser Sosey of the Tech World.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.980]   OK, I said it.
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.380]   So my main job now at the Chronicle--
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.620]   I'm the social media manager.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.140]   Are you?
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:47.980]   I-- yes, I--
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.860]   --restive.
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.420]   I run the Facebook page.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.660]   I oversee our Twitter account.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:58.180]   I work with our journalists who use social media both in reporting
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.060]   and in pushing out our news.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:05.580]   And when the graph search was announced,
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.260]   I sent a note to the staff as soon as I kind of got what it was
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.700]   and said this is a great reporter's tool.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.620]   And it really is.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.740]   I mean, in terms of like Facebook,
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.700]   probably should have done something like this years ago.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.660]   You mean for finding sources or--
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.260]   For finding out information about people you're writing about.
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.660]   I mean, Joanna mentioned that she had done a story
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.700]   and used it as part of a story.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.900]   And I think every journalist would be interested in that.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.620]   I also am active at the Chronicle
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:37.540]   in terms of our marketing and our promotion
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.180]   of some of the things that we do.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.980]   And I can see it on that end being very useful in terms of targeting.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.700]   I think that'll take a while to kind of sort out for that.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.540]   But for journalists, this is a gold mine, I think.
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.780]   Yeah, I was doing a story on the Aretha Franklin Hat meme
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.100]   from the 2009 inauguration.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.020]   And I wanted to see if I could find the first picture that was on there.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.100]   And I actually couldn't.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.780]   But I wanted to see how many shares it had or how many likes it had.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.860]   But I was able to find so much more information about that.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.340]   Wow.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.860]   Then I probably could have last week.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.020]   So you--
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.540]   For me, it just took less time.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.060]   You have this.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.300]   I don't have the search.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.780]   Dwight, do you have it?
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.860]   Yes, I got it yesterday.
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.900]   And Andy, well, Andy doesn't use Facebook.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:27.220]   So I didn't have it as of day two of the feature I should check against.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:31.140]   So OK, so I haven't had a chance to play with it.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.180]   So that puts me a little bit of a disadvantage.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.580]   If you go look in my Twitter feed from yesterday,
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:41.100]   I took a screen grab of-- there's a little box that you'll see at the top of your screen.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.060]   And if you go look in my Twitter feed, you can find the link to the image
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.260]   that shows what it looks like.
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.220]   It basically says you have it.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.500]   You want to take a tour, and it gives you some examples.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.460]   None of them are like the gizmodo examples, but it does give you some examples.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.300]   Let me look at you.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.540]   I posted one later in my feed.
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.100]   I did Asian restaurants that my friends like.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.780]   And it pulled up several Asian restaurants that are near me,
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.540]   some of which I was unaware of.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.380]   And so now I have some more to try.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.340]   But is that more useful to you than going on Yelp or going on Urban Spoon
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.660]   or something like that?
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.020]   It's another source of information.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.620]   I probably right now, because of my habits, I would use Yelp.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.660]   I don't know what this looks like in mobile yet.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.180]   They don't have mobile yet.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.260]   Yeah, they don't have mobile.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.140]   So I would say probably that the mobile is the big play,
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.940]   because what you want to be able to say is show me Asian restaurants,
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.860]   my friends like, that are near where I am now.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.100]   That's the plug.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.460]   You can be sure that's coming.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:45.860]   Yeah, I thought it was interesting.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.420]   They didn't talk about mobile at all.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.260]   We all thought, or I think most of us thought, that event
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.300]   was going to be about mobile.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.500]   And even if I actually did think it might have something to do with search,
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.220]   we were all talking about this at CES last week or two weeks ago.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.620]   What is this event going to be?
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.780]   And said, well, maybe search.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.700]   But I definitely thought it was going to have a mobile tie in.
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.220]   And there were some really interesting pieces written last week,
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.420]   one written by Tim Carmody at the Verge.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.740]   They didn't talk about mobile at the event.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:15.500]   But you absolutely can see that that is really the big push with this.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.020]   I think.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.980]   And it's written, it's totally going to have a much bigger mobile tie in,
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.380]   I think, than even what you get on the web right now.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:30.460]   Now, Dwight, I'm looking at your Twittered Asian restaurant search.
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:35.060]   And I see stars, four star restaurant.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.140]   What are those stars based on?
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.340]   I am not sure.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.820]   And it's good.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.140]   I mean, you get hours.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.540]   They've ranked it by stars.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.980]   And you've had the number of people who checked in.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.820]   They doesn't say how many of your friends liked it.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.500]   No, it just brings as the search.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.060]   And I imagine you could-- you might be able to say,
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.940]   how many of my friends like Jenny's Noodle House,
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.420]   and then you would see those friends.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.980]   You might be able to come back and see who it was.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.860]   So what's the stars we don't know?
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.540]   And the other issue is maybe your friends
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.180]   like a lot of Asian restaurants.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:14.940]   But I don't go around liking most of the kind of day-to-day
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:15.940]   enterprises.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.980]   How many people like their plumber or dentist?
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.260]   That's not going to be useful.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.780]   I think it's going to be limited.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.300]   I don't know.
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.620]   It's going to be limited.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.060]   I shouldn't be quite so harsh against it,
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.980]   because I think the main problem is
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.500]   that I just don't see what problem that this solves.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.420]   I see the problems that this solves for Facebook employees
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.420]   who want to make sure they can get their bonuses
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.420]   at the end of the year.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.540]   I just don't see how this helps regular people
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.860]   who, even if this were available on mobile,
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.940]   if you have an iPhone, Siri can get
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.620]   that kind of information much faster.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:54.220]   If you've got Android, Google Search, and voice search,
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.300]   you can get to that information much faster.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.980]   Independent apps that have two, three, four, five years
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:03.180]   of pedigree now for giving you not only just reviews
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.340]   and information, but really fine-grained information
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.500]   about these places that you want to go.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.540]   So I think that I feel as though I have to write about it
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.260]   again, like six months to a year from now,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.180]   when people figure out how to use it
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.820]   and when that unique graph search flavor
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.620]   starts to make itself more known.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.340]   Speaking of flavors, is this Joanna a threat to Google
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.820]   or just the flavor of the month?
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.740]   Sorry, I'm still trying to figure out where those stars are
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.740]   from.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.540]   I mean, really, is Google be worried about this?
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.140]   I mean, Google clearly wanted some of these kinds of signals.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:40.420]   That's why they created Google+.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:43.420]   By the way, I think these stars are from Microsoft.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.460]   Because they're using Microsoft.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.380]   They're using the--
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.700]   Yeah, there's big Bing integration here.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.300]   I don't think people really talk so much about how Bing
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.340]   is integrated into this, but I think it's a big part of it.
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:54.180]   So well, I mean--
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:54.980]   Or vice versa.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.460]   --of Google stuff, right?
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.100]   I think that answers the question you're
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:41:59.060]   answering right now.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:04.060]   I mean, Facebook and Microsoft have clearly a close alliance.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.140]   If you look at some of the Bing social search stuff,
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.620]   Facebook is really integrated into that.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.660]   And now, them using Bing as a platform here.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.780]   So Microsoft is definitely a big winner.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.980]   I think there were some harsh words, right?
[00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.940]   Last week with Eric Schmidt talking about how--
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:23.180]   I think it was Larry Page who mocked Facebook, even
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.180]   before the social graph announcement.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.340]   And of course, you've got to think
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.460]   that Larry is not merely saying Facebook sucks.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:34.460]   Saying Facebook is a feared competitor, and I hope they suck.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.820]   But I actually think, I mean, like I was saying back
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.380]   to the mobile stuff, I thought it was really
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.900]   interesting they didn't talk about it.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.300]   And then the next day, they had this announcement
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.980]   that you can make these free calls in the Messenger app.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.380]   So you look at Facebook and you're thinking, OK,
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.540]   this was a really big desktop web push.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.940]   But I do think there's something really big.
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.260]   They are going on with the mobile.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.540]   I think all the rumors of the Facebook phone--
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.020]   I've been saying I wrote an editorial last week saying,
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.900]   they're building this phone right in front of our face.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.860]   And it might not even be a hardware phone.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.980]   I think we all kind of feel like it's not.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.260]   But they are building the software and they're turning our phones
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.740]   into Facebook phones.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.700]   And I think this is just another push in that direction.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.460]   And that in itself is going to be competition for Google
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.460]   as they continue to try and push their social services
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:20.940]   on the phone.
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.740]   I mean, it's the war of the services.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.980]   I like Google's strategy.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.980]   And this Google doesn't--
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.540]   I mean, Google does build phones.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.900]   But Google also gets on every other platform,
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.380]   except maybe Windows Phone.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.860]   But on the iOS platform, by making great apps that iOS users
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.860]   use in preference in many cases to the Apple apps that
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.860]   come with their phone.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.140]   Right.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:43.140]   Facebook is doing exactly what Google is doing on iOS.
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.220]   They don't need to make a phone.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.900]   But what I like about Google's approach
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.620]   is that Facebook's part of their strategy
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:53.700]   is to keep you inside Facebook as long as possible.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.020]   They are like the casinos that make sure you can't
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.460]   see outside the windows, make sure there's a steak house,
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.700]   make sure there's a hotel, make sure there's Celine Dion
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.300]   so that you never have a reason to leave the facility
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.660]   so that you stay there losing money to the casino,
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.340]   not to somebody else, at least of all cab driver.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.300]   Rest, Google's strategy is more like,
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.100]   we want to make sure that wherever you're going to congregate
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:16.220]   anyway, we're in a position to help you in a way
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.820]   that you're going to want to give us some of your money
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.580]   and hear money as translates into user data
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.780]   and the social graph.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:27.700]   So it really depends on which one of these points of view
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.580]   is more clicked into how people want to use their services.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.020]   Facebook is great because it is really all there.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.620]   They're people who don't really want to manage multiple apps.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.580]   They don't want to learn about a new service
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.620]   I just launched four months ago.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.500]   They just want to go to Facebook every single day
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.940]   to find out about the grandchildren,
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:46.820]   find out about who they went to high school with,
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.140]   find out about their coworkers,
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.700]   and so long as they're going to go there anyway,
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.220]   why not just stay here and again,
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.540]   eat at the steakhouse and see Celine Dion.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.300]   - I like Gerocco's suggestion.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.900]   He says, "Facebook needs to take a page out of the Vegas hotels
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.500]   "and start pumping pure oxygen into their page."
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.500]   (laughing)
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.420]   People just stay there forever.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.140]   It was Steven Levy of Wired Magazine interviewing Larry Page.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.260]   He asked him, he said, "One place where people say
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.340]   "Google is motivated by competition is a social realm.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:14.860]   "In the past two years you've been working hard
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.500]   "in a field dominated by a single rival Facebook."
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.620]   That's not the case.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.100]   Page says, "It's not the way I think about it.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.900]   "We had real issues with how our users share information,
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.700]   "how they express their identity and so on."
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.220]   That's true, Google+ really struggled with that.
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.540]   And yeah, Facebook as a company is strong in that space,
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:33.580]   but they're also doing a really bad job on their products.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:37.420]   I don't know, is that true?
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.420]   Is Facebook doing a really bad job on their products?
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.020]   Or is that-- - I think Facebook's been spending
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.620]   a lot of time cleaning up their products.
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.420]   I don't think any of us would say that Facebook
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.500]   had beautiful products or had beautiful products now.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.140]   I think we would say that about some of Google's recent releases.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.140]   But I think Facebook's spending some time
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:58.780]   at least focusing on that.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.940]   - I think Facebook's, however you feel about Facebook,
[00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.740]   they're clearly doing something right.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.140]   They've got a lot of users.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:08.020]   - Well, if that's where all your friends are,
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.580]   it really doesn't matter how clean the software is
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.900]   and how easy it is to use.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.660]   If that's where all your family is,
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.580]   all your friends are, all your coworkers are,
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.060]   that makes it instantly attractive.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.340]   And all they can do is make this grease those rails
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.620]   a little better.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.780]   I don't think that Facebook is easy to use.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.380]   I'm not totally an expert in technology.
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.740]   And yet, I'm still just routinely baffled by,
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:29.740]   I have a simple thing.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.460]   I want to find out what my niece is up to last week
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.700]   'cause I know she had a game.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.420]   And finding that one piece of information
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.900]   is amongst the huge scrum of data that it wants to throw me
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.620]   at me to distract me is just really, really difficult.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.540]   Maybe social craft search will make it easier
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.100]   to find this sort of information.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.380]   But no, I would agree that they aren't very good
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.340]   at crystallizing what you're supposed to be here for.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.820]   The message from Facebook is that you're here to stay here.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.540]   That's the purpose of you coming here.
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.860]   But don't try to come here with any targeted global,
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.220]   I don't think.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:04.700]   - Well, and if you look at Facebook, Facebook just looks,
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:06.780]   it's cluttered, it looks awful,
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.620]   trying to find out how to do anything in it,
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.980]   as Andy said, is really difficult.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:16.900]   And Google lately has paid much more attention to design.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.700]   Remember for years, we talked about Google being a company
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.380]   that was purely engineer driven
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.060]   and design was secondary.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.980]   In fact, reports out of Google were that designers
[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.260]   were kind of scorned.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.540]   That's clearly changed with a lot of the apps.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.260]   - If you're an iOS designer.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.140]   - If you're an iOS designer, right.
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.620]   And so I think that Larry may be looking at what they're doing
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:43.860]   and thinking, this is a mess, this is a cluttered mess.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.980]   But again, if you look at Facebook's mobile apps,
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:52.500]   they were horrible, largely because of the HTML5 lag
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.260]   that they had, and now they're quite snappy
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.060]   and they look pretty good too.
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.580]   And so I think that your mobile is driving design
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.740]   over to the desktop and everything from operating systems
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.780]   to websites to mobile apps.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.940]   And I think that, I mean, you just look at what's going on
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.100]   with responsive design and website design.
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.700]   That's driven by a desire to look good in mobile
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:16.900]   and at the desktop.
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.660]   And so I think that's kind of what he's thinking about
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.940]   is that their kind of Facebook is now where Google was
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.020]   maybe a year, year and a half ago.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.940]   - Speaking of Wired, Kate Metz has a really interesting
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.260]   article in the Wired Enterprise section on Facebook
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.020]   wanting a new kind of flash memory for storing old pictures.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.260]   This is how far they've come in.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.860]   They have many hundreds of billions of images.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.780]   Are they storing, and they're storing them all right now
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:47.620]   on spinning hard drives using a lot of power
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.300]   for images that you might not look at,
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   but once a year, once every five years.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.980]   So they want to weigh an online storage obviously
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:58.540]   'cause Facebook's Director of Infrastructure, Jay Perique,
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.620]   says, we can't say, hey, you want to look at that picture
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:02.900]   from Halloween five years ago, we'll go grab the tape,
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.860]   put it on the drive and send it to you in a week.
[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.660]   It needs to be there right away.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.940]   So they're looking for storage that doesn't use power.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.820]   That just sits there, but that you can basically flash storage
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.340]   that you can give some low power to,
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:18.180]   but still have those pictures available.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.140]   That is, it's just amazing.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:24.900]   Just mind-boggling, the amount of data Facebook already
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.820]   is storing.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:32.260]   In that story, he talks about having something that
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:34.900]   is very powerful in terms of storing it for long-term
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.980]   and for writing its low tolerance.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.060]   And the thing I would worry about is all you need
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:45.380]   is that one bad burp where the tolerance rate
[00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:46.620]   and you lose data.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.500]   So that would be the concern I have.
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.500]   They also want to put flash in a cold storage facility.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.580]   I guess it wears better, I don't know.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:56.820]   And they're using, it's interesting,
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.940]   they're using Fusion I/O's cards for their database software
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.020]   and their interesting tie-in, that's Waz's company.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.700]   He took a job with Fusion I/O a couple of years ago.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:11.220]   They're a enterprise-grade flash drive company.
[00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.700]   We're gonna take a break, I'm still waiting to get
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.060]   into mega.co.nz.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:20.220]   Spinning the beach ball.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.540]   They must have known it was you.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.180]   I also am still waiting to get into Facebook's graph search.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.060]   So there.
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:30.660]   And I'll probably be waiting to get in the apples next event.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:31.500]   So there.
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.260]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   We got a great panel.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.340]   Real journalists, Dwight Silverman
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.340]   from the Houston Chronicle, Joanna Stern from ABC News.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.140]   And my friend Andy Inako from Mac Break Weekly
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.940]   and the Chicago Sun Times
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.500]   are shown today brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.540]   If you want to build a site that never goes down,
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.100]   you want Squarespace.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:55.740]   Their web hosting plus the best content management system
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:59.060]   and that tight integration means that they can throw server,
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:01.540]   bandwidth and storage at you whenever you need it,
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:04.980]   that you always secure because they keep the software up to date.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.900]   And the current version of Squarespace Squarespace 6
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.820]   is really groundbreaking in so many ways.
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.860]   Things like mobile responsive design,
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.300]   which mean you go to, in fact, you could try it right now.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.900]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.860]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.740]   Just click get started and you can start setting up a site.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.340]   And any template that you use,
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.180]   customize it as you will,
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.140]   will automatically be mobile responsive.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.660]   That means it will look great no matter how big the screen is.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.660]   Anything from a three and a half inch iPhone 3GS,
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.220]   all the way up to a 27 inch Dell display,
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.300]   it's going to look fantastic.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.260]   When you upload images, for instance,
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:44.460]   they automatically make seven thumbnail sizes
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.660]   to make sure that they can display that image
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.660]   in exactly the most effective way.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.420]   You don't have to worry about designing your columns
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.660]   or creating a mobile design
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:58.140]   because these all resize perfectly depending on the size.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.980]   I know that's a little thing, but it's just,
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.540]   the fact that they could do this
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:03.180]   and still give you the kind of flexibility
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.900]   that gives you is really amazing.
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.580]   If you're doing a portfolio,
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.660]   if you're a graphic artist,
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.460]   if you're someone who wants a site to look as good as,
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:13.540]   your stuff looks, Squarespace is the place to go.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:15.900]   squarespace.com, click the try it button
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.220]   and you can try it for two weeks, absolutely free.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:21.140]   No credit card, no offer code, nothing.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.300]   Just your address, your email address,
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.140]   a password and a name of a site.
[00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.380]   It's kind of great if you need just a site for two weeks,
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.700]   just create it.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.300]   If you decide you want to keep that site around
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.500]   for a little bit longer,
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.500]   maybe I think as a baby gift,
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.500]   design a site for a kid with it.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.300]   And when you get the kid's name,
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.580]   register it for a year, the name comes along with it
[00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:42.980]   and then give it to the parents, that's an awesome gift.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.980]   Something like that.
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:46.940]   Or for a wedding, for your business,
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.180]   just for a blog.
[00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.900]   They've got great iPad and iPhone and Android software.
[00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.740]   Really, they do nice iOS design.
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:55.940]   I must have, I must say, really gorgeous.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.860]   Amazing stats, of course, widgets that link you
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.660]   into all the social networks, everything you need.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.860]   And by the way, you can automatically import and export
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.780]   into all of the main sites.
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.540]   So you're never trapped at Squarespace.
[00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:10.580]   For example, you can automatically pull in your photos
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.620]   from Instagram, boom, right there.
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:16.460]   Create galleries, instantly sync pages to Facebook,
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.660]   auto published new blog entries on Twitter.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.260]   It really is wired.
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:21.580]   Beautiful design.
[00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.700]   If you're a developer, you do have access to a developer
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.460]   platform that gives you a syntax coloring in the editor
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.380]   and a whole lot more great for JavaScript or CSS.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.740]   Over 300 fonts that are using the Google Fonts library.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.460]   Try it free.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   And if you decide to buy, look at the pricing.
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:35.980]   Great deal.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:38.180]   $8 for the basic account.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.660]   $16 a month for the unlimited account.
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.060]   And then that's when you buy a year plan.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.260]   You're going to want to buy a year plan,
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.380]   because I'm going to show you how to get 10% off your first
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.820]   purchase for the most savings.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:47.260]   But look at that.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:48.700]   $16 a month.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:51.460]   With the year registrations, you get the custom domain name
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.020]   and all the hookup free.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.780]   You get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.580]   Great for a photographer.
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:57.700]   If you're wedding photography, you're
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.980]   going to have a gallery for each client.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.940]   Free.
[00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.060]   It's part of the deal.
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.020]   Unlimited bandwidth.
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.580]   One of your clients is Kim Kardashian.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.180]   Don't worry about it.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.460]   You'll never run out of bandwidth.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:11.580]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors,
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.740]   and a whole lot more $16 a month.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:16.700]   That's hosting and the software.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:17.780]   You can't beat that.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.140]   Now, I do want you to use the offer code TWIT1.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.140]   And you could 10% off that first purchase on new accounts.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.180]   TWIT1-- that's how they know you saw it on TWIT
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.660]   and it helps us to squarespace.com.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.300]   Your exceptional website is waiting.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:36.700]   Squarespace.com.
[00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:37.460]   All right.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.060]   Number of people-- it's interesting.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.060]   Facebook is for unloved.
[00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:43.580]   Number of people in the chat room said,
[00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.180]   I don't want to hear anymore about Facebook.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:45.900]   It's like, I'm done with Facebook.
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.740]   I don't care about Facebook.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:48.420]   All right.
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:48.980]   How about Apple?
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.220]   What the hell's going on there?
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.380]   Here's another company people love.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.460]   It's not doing so well.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.740]   Apple's the price per share is slipping now, now,
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.820]   to $500, down $200 from their peak.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:08.420]   Some say it's because iPhone demand is slipping.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.260]   Different ways to interpret that story.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.620]   And I guess we'll find out-- is it this coming week
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:13.180]   that we're going to get--
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:13.980]   Wednesday.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.380]   Wednesday, we get the quarterly.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.340]   Now, that won't be the most recent quarter, right?
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.500]   That'll be--
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.940]   It'll be the holiday quarter.
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.740]   The holiday quarter.
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.420]   So I guess that'll tell us how the iPhones--
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.460]   I'm trying to figure out what date it actually ends on.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.580]   I know that it will include some holiday sales.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.020]   I'm trying to remember what that is.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.740]   But yes, it's-- that's why a lot of the speculation
[00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:38.140]   about the health of Apple is kind of, I don't know, interesting.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.860]   It's sort of like speculating about what the next iPhone
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.780]   is going to be like two days before the launch event for it.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.300]   And find out.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.500]   Because Apple is always very, very clear and upfront
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:49.980]   about numbers when they have things that they feel as though they
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.020]   have reason to be proud about.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.940]   So if things are going great, they'll
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.340]   show us the numbers to show everybody
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.540]   that things are going great.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.060]   If they are suspiciously absent of details
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.220]   on exactly how--
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:05.540]   on breaking down exactly how many units sold, exactly how much
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:09.500]   the iPad mini is affecting, regular iPad sales, how well--
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.540]   how well the iPhone 5 did, especially given
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:16.940]   this the accelerated holiday purchases compared
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.780]   to other Android phones that are on the market today.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.700]   I mean, the numbers are going to tell that.
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.340]   So it's fun to speculate.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.820]   But we're going to have all the numbers that we need to crunch
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.540]   on on Wednesday.
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.780]   By the way, kind of interesting.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.260]   I don't know how they did this.
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.620]   But they're exactly $500 at the close of the stock market
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.580]   on Friday.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.140]   $500 in no sense.
[00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:38.900]   Let's just stop.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.060]   Let's just stop right here.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:40.820]   It's perfect.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:46.140]   I read a story about that.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.740]   And I was still a little bit confused.
[00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.940]   But it has to do with put and sell options
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.020]   and then kind of coming at each other
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.260]   so that it balances at $500.
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:58.260]   Oh, really?
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.180]   So that's how they did it?
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.300]   I mean, it's not--
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.180]   It's an automated-- it's a series of automated routines
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:06.020]   where when it hits this amount buy, when it hits this amount
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:09.140]   sell, and they kind of hit and stick
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.580]   because so many are selling at exactly buying
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:13.100]   and selling at that price.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:17.740]   One more thing I don't understand about the stock market.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.500]   One more complete mystery to me.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.780]   And yet, you've got to think there's
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.340]   a little wisdom of the crowds going on with the stock market.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.860]   I mean, admittedly, any given investor
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:30.100]   is speculating and has no idea.
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:34.260]   But as a group, it often seems to reflect pretty well
[00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:36.260]   what the prospects are for a company.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.780]   No.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:41.100]   Well, the stock price is really a faith index, more than anything
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:41.860]   else.
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:43.740]   So it's how much do people believe
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:45.420]   that the valuation of this company
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.300]   is right where it should be too high or too low?
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.300]   So that's why-- and when you're talking about it on a company
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:55.380]   like Apple, that for so many periods before that,
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:58.660]   just rising, rising, rising, is it reasonable and rational
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:00.820]   to expect that at some point, inevitably,
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.500]   the stock price should be 1,000 points.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.500]   Now, there's 1,000 points.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.500]   The next step is it should be 1,200 points.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.700]   And once it doesn't make 1,200 points, that's-- oh, wait.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.140]   There must be something wrong with this company
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.420]   if it's not absurdly valued per share.
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:18.020]   So this is one area in which I have to humbly admit
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.660]   that understanding exactly why the stock moves
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.460]   is totally above my pay grade.
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.820]   And, and, encouragingly enough, when
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:29.900]   I talk to an analyst who manages a staggering amount
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:32.980]   of other people's money for a living, and they said, yep,
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:34.140]   nope, you're exactly--
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.700]   I don't really know what happens either.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.940]   You just have to react to the numbers you're seeing in front
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.940]   of you and hope that it doesn't hit you in the butt too hard.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:43.020]   Well, let's get the Real People Index.
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.460]   Joanna Stern, ABC News, technology editor.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.380]   You talk to real people.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.300]   I talk to real people.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.940]   What is interest in the iPhone waning?
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:59.660]   I mean, the initial sales we saw did not indicate that at all.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:00.180]   Absolutely not.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:02.020]   But I will actually point out, I was thinking about it
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.820]   last night when I was out with a bunch of my friends.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:10.260]   I saw a lot more Galaxy S3 than I really have cared to see.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.260]   And I just--
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:16.620]   If I see another Galaxy S3--
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.500]   I saw them all over the place last night.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.260]   And I don't know, maybe I was just
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.700]   hanging out with different people.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:25.420]   But I'm definitely seeing a lot more of those.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:29.060]   And I think everyone says even a lot of the people
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.220]   that work at ABC will come to me and ask, what is the best
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:31.740]   phone to get?
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.140]   What's the best laptop to get?
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.740]   Constantly when they're asking the best phone to get, now they go,
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.500]   I heard about the Galaxy S3, and then there's the iPhone.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:39.980]   Which is it between these two?
[00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:42.740]   Let's do a poll of our audience, our studio audience.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:47.580]   This is a perfect sampling, completely random.
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:53.180]   How many of you are holding iPhones 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Android
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.380]   phones?
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:58.580]   1, 2, 3-- what do you guys don't have phones?
[00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.900]   4, it's about even.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.780]   We've got a lot of votes in the chat room.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.300]   It's evenly split.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.980]   But I have to say, we were looking for an iPhone earlier.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.380]   We had a hard time finding one in the studio.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:08.740]   Right?
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:13.860]   Remember that Android has a whole outsells iPhone.
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:17.060]   But the question is to whom and why and where, right?
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.660]   Is it a low-end thing?
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.500]   Is it not in the US?
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.020]   I think iPhone's still dominant in the US, is it not?
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.540]   Yes.
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.340]   In terms of just the individual brand, it is dominant in the US.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:33.780]   But in the overall universe of platforms for smartphones,
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.620]   Android is dominant over.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.580]   And I see a lot of-- I agree with Joanna.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.940]   I see a lot of S3s.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.300]   You know what else I see a lot of?
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.060]   I see more and more Galaxy nodes.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.060]   Me too.
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:43.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.380]   I'm a no lover, so I notice them.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.980]   So I don't know if it's--
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.300]   you know how when you get a new car,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.020]   everybody's driving that car?
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.820]   I feel like I see a lot of Galaxy nodes,
[01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.140]   but you're seeing that too.
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:53.500]   Yes.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.220]   And I love the Galaxy node.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.740]   Depending on whether it may be like 40 inches by the time
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.100]   I buy my own phone.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:01.900]   I have a theory.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:02.820]   I shared this before.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.460]   I think the next iPhone should be an iPad Mini.
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.100]   I agree with you.
[01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:09.700]   I mean, that's--
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.180]   You should put a phone in the Mini.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.180]   Mini.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.140]   7 inch phone.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:17.100]   I think Apple's definitely missing the boat on phone size.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.500]   I think that the iPhone--
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.940]   I'm certain that the iPhone 5 sales numbers they're going
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.980]   to give us this week are going to be phenomenal.
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:24.100]   They're going to be wonderful.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.220]   However, I do think that leaving money on the table
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.420]   by not reacting to the popularity of these larger screen
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.060]   phones.
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.820]   And I mean, let me add my-- make it a complete--
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:33.820]   this were American Idol.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.180]   We'd be all screaming at the same time.
[01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.980]   You're going to Hollywood only saying that phone in your pocket
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.660]   is probably not an iPhone at this point in life.
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.740]   Because over the past-- I think it was this time last year
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.460]   that I really started noticing that I'm seeing fewer.
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:49.020]   And the people that I would expect to be carrying iPhones
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.340]   and using iPhones are now using not just Galaxy S3s,
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.380]   but any other kind of Android device.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.140]   I think 2012 was the year that the iPhone really
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:02.020]   became, even in America, just another phone among many
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.780]   that people tend to like for whatever reason,
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.740]   they tend to like phones.
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.700]   Joanna, you said you hated the idea of a Mini phone.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.740]   iPad Mini phone.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.300]   And I find the note just too big to use.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.300]   But I mean--
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.380]   What do you carry?
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:20.740]   I have a Galaxy Nexus.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.340]   Interesting.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.860]   And is that by choice or do you feel
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:26.420]   that you have to cover Android or--
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.020]   No, this was the phone I got last year of.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.780]   Actually, I carry around an iPhone as well.
[01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:35.060]   And then I was always a longtime BlackBerry fan.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.100]   And when I made the switch from BlackBerry,
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.380]   I really wanted a phone with a hardware keyboard.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.820]   And I still really yearn for a really good phone
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.100]   with the hardware keyboard.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.620]   And so I somehow got sucked into Android that way,
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.100]   because there was no choice.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.900]   Obviously, the iPhone never had one.
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.740]   And I got hooked on Android.
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.020]   And now I'm actually considering getting an iPhone
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.100]   as my main phone, because I've been really frustrated
[01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:57.620]   with Android.
[01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:00.020]   So really, to me, there's no perfect phone yet.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.820]   And I would carry-- I carry around three phones every day.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.420]   OK.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:05.220]   So you're the wrong person.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.660]   I don't want a bigger phone.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.420]   I want to carry three phones.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.220]   I carry three phones every day, I think.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.500]   It's crazy, but this is what I do.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.060]   I don't have my iPhone here, but this is the--
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.700]   ABC gives us BlackBerrys.
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.900]   Really?
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:21.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:24.460]   And you can get your email on your other phones.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.260]   But I've really stuck to this, because I can email so fast.
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:28.940]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.220]   Email is one of the main communications.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.820]   I mean, it's the only communication way at ABC.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:36.220]   They'll be really do-i-n, or anything like that.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.340]   Yeah, ready, because I think BlackBerry's back, baby.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.900]   I think I'm very excited about BlackBerry 10.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.220]   I'm really excited about it.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.140]   I tweeted about it this week, and everyone was--
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.260]   I tweeted-- I said, who else is really excited about BlackBerry
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.740]   10 launching at the end of the month?
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:52.700]   And I got a range of responses, but I'm actually really excited.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.260]   I think we may be surprised.
[01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.780]   This is a dark horse that may surprise a lot of people.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:57.980]   I think there-- first of all, there's
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:02.140]   a lot of people like you and ABC and federal government
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:05.500]   that are still using BlackBerrys, and kind of love them,
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.540]   and wish that BlackBerry had something competitive,
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.260]   and BB10 might be it.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:11.780]   Totally.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.340]   I mean, I think we all know what the problems are going to be,
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.780]   but I think it'll be interesting to see what they come up with
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.540]   in terms of the design and how it all works together.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.140]   I just want to say, I have an open mind,
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.140]   and I'm hoping I'm rooting for BlackBerry, or for Rimm.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.620]   What I love about BB10 is the idea that--
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.460]   I don't know anybody who has a BlackBerry who
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.900]   has just one phone on them in all times.
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.620]   It's usually people who have the--
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:35.620]   they have the one that their company issued to them,
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.220]   then they also have their iPhone or their Android phone.
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.460]   That's their personal stuff.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.460]   And the idea that they've really made
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.620]   a fundamental personality aspect of this operating system,
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.500]   the idea that here is one phone that
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.340]   keeps your personal life and your business life completely
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.780]   separate, so that the IT department gets access
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.780]   to some areas of the phone.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:55.980]   You personally have access to other parts of the phone,
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.900]   and that's kept safe and secure.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.540]   So for people who don't particularly care about phones--
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.740]   and that sounds like I'm saying something mean-spirited
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.100]   about these people.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.020]   I'm saying that normal people who really just
[01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:10.140]   want a functional device that has a narrow list of things
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.420]   that help them get them through the day,
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.180]   they might get their company issued BlackBerry 10 phone
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.540]   and then realize that, well, I don't really
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:18.820]   need to now have a contract for a second phone,
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.460]   especially if my IT department will let
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.980]   me use it for personal stuff, as well as for the business
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.380]   stuff.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.060]   Dwight, you're the only one who hasn't weighed in.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.260]   What do you think?
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:32.380]   I-- BlackBerry 10, from what I've seen, if it still leaves me cold,
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.580]   I think the train is left.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.940]   And I don't think that they have enough momentum
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.140]   to continue going on much longer.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.580]   I don't have much faith in it.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.700]   I do understand now, though, why Joanna
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:49.500]   went to ABC News because she could get a free BlackBerry.
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.660]   Free BlackBerry.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.860]   That's right.
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.700]   I think it's too late.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.580]   I think you can look and see what's
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.860]   kind of how Microsoft is struggling with Windows Phone.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.420]   I think that they're just now--
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.220]   And Windows Phone, by the way, we should say it.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:03.380]   I think everybody agrees.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:03.740]   It's great.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.020]   But it's too late.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:05.700]   It's too late.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.660]   It's just too late.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.980]   Well, OK, I have to disagree with the words too late.
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.780]   That indicates that the race is over
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.180]   and they're now winners and losers.
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.700]   It's an ongoing process.
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.940]   And all that has to happen for Windows Phone
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.660]   to become completely competitive or BlackBerry 10
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.940]   to be completely competitive is for iPhone
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:25.540]   to tread water for a year or two.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.980]   All that has to happen is for Android 2--
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.660]   But it is.
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.100]   It has been treading water for a year or two.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.860]   No, the numbers do not show that it's treading water.
[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.540]   Oh, but no, sales is a lagging indicator.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.540]   It doesn't mean that they haven't been innovated.
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.660]   It just takes a while for people to catch on.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:41.860]   And that's why you're starting to see the ramp of the S3.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.580]   But it's a lagging indicator, which means it's even
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.900]   if Apple turned it around tomorrow,
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.820]   it wouldn't necessarily turn around sales tomorrow.
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:51.260]   I think you're going to see a deterioration of Apple's sales
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.180]   for a while.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.020]   You won't see--
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.940]   I think it really depends on what they're
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.180]   going to do later this year with the next version.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.260]   I think they've been--
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.220]   They've got to be careful.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.220]   Oh, they've got to be careful.
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:00.740]   I think--
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:03.060]   But they also got to do something different.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.220]   I do think that they--
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.300]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:11.260]   The next version will be the 5S if history follows.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.500]   It'll be a tweaked version of the file.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.260]   That will not be enough.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:21.180]   That will not be enough unless the tweaks are done in software.
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.500]   So it's very possible.
[01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.300]   And the software is what needs to update.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.500]   I think you see a lot of writing.
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:25.980]   Exactly.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.020]   It's the oldest mobile form platform still out there.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:32.060]   Phone, it's older than anything else except Blackberry.
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.180]   Except Blackberry.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:39.500]   And so I think the problem is that Apple has all these developers
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.420]   who have a huge investment in the current design
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.700]   and the API of the software.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.220]   They're going to have the problem Microsoft has,
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.020]   have to support legacy.
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.180]   And so what will probably happen is
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.940]   you'll see something similar to what Mountain Line is,
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:02.220]   I think, which is kind of a hybrid of iOS and OS X.
[01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.420]   You'll see that come in one of these phones.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:07.260]   And then they'll make a big leap and a big change.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.420]   And they'll have to-- you're right.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:10.420]   They'll have to have something that will support legacy
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.500]   over time.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.860]   But the other thing they could do is with the 6,
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:19.780]   go big screen and do away with the current iOS design
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:20.860]   and start over.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.300]   And then you support it on the older phones.
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.780]   You continue to have iOS on these older phones.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.780]   But you have to say iOS 2 or whatever they want to call it
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.900]   on the new larger phone.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.340]   I'm telling you, if Apple--
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.220]   Apple, listen to me, Apple.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.980]   iPad mini phone.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.500]   Huge.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.340]   If they did that, I would say they're going to turn it around.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.300]   If they do a 5S--
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.420]   I don't know.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.420]   I don't know.
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:46.820]   I mean--
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.540]   Things that these things are just not going to happen.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.060]   By the way, my track record predicting stuff for Apple
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.820]   is zero.
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:54.460]   I'm not sure if somebody--
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.940]   Nobody does that anyway.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:57.860]   They said that about the Galaxy Note 2.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:58.900]   It looks dorky.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:00.780]   But nobody puts a Hershey bar.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.540]   It looks like a family-sized Hershey bar.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.340]   Smack on your head.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.220]   I understand that.
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.060]   But nobody really does that in any more anyway.
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:06.820]   We use Bluetooth.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.020]   We use wireless.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.380]   We don't-- who even talks on the phone?
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.380]   I don't talk on the phone.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.260]   I hate the phone.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.260]   I text.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.180]   I play the Simpsons game.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.740]   That's all I do.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.060]   I do just think that Apple's starting
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.580]   to fall a little bit out of step.
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.980]   The fact that when the iPhone 5 came out
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.300]   and they just stretched the screen longer instead of--
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.500]   Such a mistake.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.700]   That people want to use a phone not just to get email,
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.860]   but also as a book reader, as a game device,
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.020]   as all this sort of stuff.
[01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.260]   All of those things are enhanced by having a real larger screen
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.940]   instead of just a nominally larger screen.
[01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.420]   The fact that they missed that is kind of surprising to me.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.420]   When you compare it to every other operating system that's
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.980]   on the market right now, we're talking
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:49.140]   about some basic, wonderful features that are evident to anybody
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.380]   who uses it on day one or day two,
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.220]   like the way that on Android and Windows Phone,
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.540]   that applications can talk to each other
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.300]   and share information with each other,
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.140]   the way that keyboards work a lot more effectively,
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:04.020]   the way that the customizability that lets you--
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   it's important for the iPhone to be really easy to use
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.660]   for people who, again, just don't care
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.820]   and people who are intimidated by technology.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.660]   But there are--
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.620]   It's your grandma's phone.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.780]   Oh, I wouldn't say that.
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:16.740]   But what I'm saying, what I'm getting at is that there
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.340]   are two different kinds of categories
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.580]   of ways you make technology easier.
[01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:23.820]   One category is the stuff that makes it easier to use
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.780]   once you get out of the box and you're learning it.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.380]   But all of those advantages kind of end after two or three
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:29.620]   weeks once you've learned it.
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:32.460]   The other category of stuff that makes technology easier
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.700]   to use is the stuff where six months from now, eight months
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:38.540]   from now, a year from now, when you get to sort of dial it
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:40.980]   in the way that you hope this device to work,
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.740]   and that actually winds up making it much, much easier.
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.660]   The iPhone has a lot of that first kind of stuff,
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.500]   very little of that second kind of stuff.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.620]   And I think that now that they have real competition
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:53.540]   in the form of alternatives that are just as elegantly
[01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:57.340]   designed, just as beautiful, and have these additional features
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.340]   that Apple doesn't seem to have any interest in,
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.540]   here's where Apple's going to have to make that decision.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:06.580]   Do they want to continue to be that major, overwhelmingly
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.060]   competitive platform?
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.500]   Or are they going to be happy with being more like Mac OS,
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.660]   where they certainly don't have the majority
[01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.540]   of the installations out there, but they don't care
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.820]   since they're making so much money off of every one of these
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.420]   things that they sell?
[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.260]   I think you're right.
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.980]   I think Apple is a boutique company.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.300]   Probably is their future.
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.140]   Go ahead, Jon.
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.140]   That may have been my zenola, but--
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:24.620]   No, no.
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:25.660]   I totally agree.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:29.860]   I think that is the next place that they really--
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:34.020]   all the services that they offer on the phone,
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.740]   I think we've seen this push of people
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.540]   starting to replace those core apps with apps from the App Store,
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.660]   whether it's Calendar or Address Book,
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.700]   any of the main apps, because they just haven't been updated.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.140]   They don't work, and they're not as robust as what Android
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.220]   offers in some ways.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.340]   And the customization is, well, not as robust.
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.500]   So I think--
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.300]   Just look at the Share menu.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.500]   Just a perfect example.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.540]   Just share a menu.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:01.660]   On the iPhone, it's who Apple lets you share with Twitter
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.940]   and now Facebook.
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.580]   On Android, it's any app you install,
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.060]   and it can get a very ungainly long list.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:11.420]   But at least you have the choice of who you want to share with.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.300]   Honestly, there's--
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.260]   I think hopefully we see more--
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:19.340]   like the next version, iOS 7, that is just a change.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.060]   It is a real change, and I'm hoping--
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:21.540]   You're not.
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:21.940]   --this is a change we see.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.260]   It's not the Apple culture.
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:25.260]   The Apple culture is control, and I think that people--
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:26.260]   starting to grade on people.
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.500]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.100]   Well, I was just about to say, as it happens,
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.340]   I'm running a piece for TechHive.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.500]   I'm going to file on Tuesday.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:35.260]   I don't know when they're going to be putting it out maybe
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:35.620]   next week.
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.820]   That really is all about how I'm sort of moving away
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.380]   from the iPhone and towards Android.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:42.300]   And one of the main reasons is that it's so much easier
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.140]   to manage information on the Android device.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.820]   I love the fact that I'm driving to a friend's house.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.020]   I pull up their names in a dress book.
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:53.020]   And then the Android address says, oh,
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.500]   do you want to send this to Waze?
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.580]   So you can navigate there, or do you
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.420]   want to send it to Twist so that you can notify this person
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:00.420]   or your status?
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.020]   So easy.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:04.340]   You don't have to keep ducking out of multiple things.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:05.780]   And that's what I'm talking about.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.820]   That day-to-day stuff that Android makes so much easier
[01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:12.180]   to operate than on an iPhone.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.980]   And that's what worries me that I just--
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:19.940]   when you identify yourself as someone who uses Apple stuff,
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:23.380]   I've had-- unfortunately, I shot my mouth off so many times
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.980]   since the iPhone came out, saying that the only reason why
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.380]   I use the iPhone is because it's the best thing out there
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.420]   for what I like to do.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.300]   And as soon as something else comes out that's better,
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:34.580]   oh, I'm going to switch to that and I'm not an Apple fanboy.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:36.140]   And I was like, well, no, damn it.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.820]   Now I do have to switch to Android because it does work better
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.300]   for me.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.020]   Andy, Andy, Andy, I've been working on you for a whole year.
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.820]   I've finally got to you.
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.660]   I'm not a fanboy of any company.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.420]   I am a fan of technology.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:50.260]   And I think you should use the best technology.
[01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.100]   And if something's better, it's better.
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.660]   Apple's not down and out.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.500]   I'm telling you, there's still opportunity.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.820]   But I really wonder about the iPhone 5.
[01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.380]   To me, this encapsulates the whole thing.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.940]   127 pixels taller.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.500]   It was either dumb or cynical.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.420]   It was either dumb.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.780]   They kind of missed the boat on what people wanted.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.260]   Or it was a little bit cynical.
[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:13.220]   Let's eat a little bit more out of this ecosystem
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.260]   before we move on.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.140]   And either way, I think it was an error.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.820]   And I think this year we'll tell, a 5S is not going to do it.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.300]   It's not going to do it.
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.340]   Leo, I think that as Steve Ballmer once said,
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.420]   it's developers, developers, developers.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.620]   And that's why they take this platform.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:31.940]   Because they have this ecosystem.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.300]   So here's a little bit--
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.780]   But look, there will be more apps now.
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.380]   There will be, by June, more apps on Android than on iOS.
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.260]   Well, except, except.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.580]   I made the decision to go with the iPhone 5
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.420]   after almost crossing over to the Galaxy S3.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:49.260]   The reason I did not do it had to do with carriers
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:52.180]   and also had to do with the ecosystem.
[01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:55.540]   My family all uses iPhones.
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.180]   I have a lot invested in this.
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.100]   And a lot of the things that I do when I stay in communication
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.700]   with people involve things like find my friends.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.260]   And that type of--
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.100]   And inertia is not a marketing plan.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.900]   But it locked me in.
[01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:16.060]   And so when I saw what was going on with the iPhone 5,
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:19.540]   and I made my decision right after the announcement,
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.580]   I also like the ergonomics of the size of it in my hand.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.500]   I thought at the time that the S3 was too big,
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.460]   I do a lot of things one-handed with my phone.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:29.820]   I do a lot of things one-handed too,
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.180]   but it doesn't usually involve a phone.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.180]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.180]   Oh, hey!
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:35.700]   Oh, god.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:38.140]   I'm sorry, Joanna, that wasn't what you thought it was.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:41.340]   I'm playing Simpsons tapped out, and it's one-handed.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.340]   Right.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.180]   I know you were talking about your Galaxy Note.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.180]   So--
[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:48.980]   See, now I walk into the joke about a stylus,
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.260]   and I'm just going to--
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:53.220]   You know, I actually like the stylus on the note.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.540]   I like the same.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.020]   Let me finish this tale.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:56.860]   Go ahead, sorry.
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:57.380]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.420]   I did really well to completely.
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:15:59.540]   I apologize.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:00.780]   So I didn't get the S3.
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.940]   And one of the reasons was it was too big,
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:05.340]   because I couldn't do things one-handed with it.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.980]   But then I have been reviewing the note, and I love the note.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.860]   Because you can't do something one-handed with it.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.860]   You have to use two hands, and you make peace with that.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:16.020]   You do.
[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.900]   And it makes it worthwhile.
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:20.100]   And so I'm really--
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.820]   I have a wait another two--
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.260]   year and a half or so of my contract to come up.
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:29.060]   But if Apple hasn't come up with anything that improves
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.780]   the size of the phone, or a much better, a much more
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.900]   innovative operating system, I too
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:35.860]   will probably jump.
[01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:38.860]   I submit that this really has more to do with how
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.340]   we are changing use habits.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:43.140]   This used to be a phone.
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.420]   And as it moves more towards a computer, real estate
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.820]   becomes more and more important.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:49.340]   And how big it is against your ear
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:52.620]   is really becomes less important.
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:54.220]   Although you still do pick up the phone--
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:54.980]   with the phone range.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:55.500]   Yeah, I know.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:56.420]   I just get over it.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.740]   Pick it up, and you hold it.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:58.140]   But I--
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.540]   I'm used to people mocking me.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.900]   It's OK.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.860]   The Galaxy Note is big, but it's--
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.420]   you're not going to--
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:05.020]   It's not that big.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.460]   You can still put it in your--
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:08.260]   I mean, it fits to my--
[01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:11.140]   sure, when I first started holding this up to my ear,
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.260]   people laughed.
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.660]   Now it doesn't look that weird.
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:15.100]   You just get used to it.
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:18.580]   Same thing as people taking a picture with their iPad.
[01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.780]   At first, people got--
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:20.780]   That still looks weird, too.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.380]   Still looks weird.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.180]   You live in New York.
[01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:25.620]   You're just not exactly a trendsetter.
[01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:26.380]   But I--
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.860]   Oh, no.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.900]   I will say that that's one area in which I had--
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.380]   I really was humbled because when I first saw that they're
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:37.180]   putting good cameras onto tablets, my--
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.580]   of course, I said that, oh, that's silly.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.900]   No one's going to do that that way.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:40.580]   And then you know what?
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:41.100]   I was wrong.
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:44.220]   Every time I walk through the Boston tourist spots,
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.780]   I will see someone holding up an app, an iPad.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:47.380]   I saw--
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:49.740]   I saw-- you're not going to believe this.
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.980]   You're going to say, Andy, you're a lying liar who's lying.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:53.300]   Mouth is full of lies.
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:57.500]   I saw somebody in Copley Square taking a picture of Trinity
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.620]   Church with a Blackberry Playbook tablet.
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:01.860]   Oh, dear.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:02.860]   I was--
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:03.860]   I know--
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:04.700]   Oh, gosh.
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:05.860]   That's how wrong I was.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.820]   And even if you have this awful, awful tablet,
[01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:09.500]   you will still use it as a camera.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.180]   OK.
[01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.340]   I was wrong.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.180]   I'm about to ask if it was like a homeless person or something.
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.900]   This is what they give us at the shelter.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:23.900]   We get surplus cheese and playbooks.
[01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:24.540]   We're going to take--
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:27.060]   Maybe I shouldn't be a representative of ABC.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.020]   Yes, you should.
[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:30.020]   You're so great.
[01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.060]   We love you.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.660]   Let's speak of which we're going to all slams--
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:33.820]   I remember every representative of so places.
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:38.060]   I'm going to give you a chance to slam CBS because already the Exodus
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:39.060]   has begun.
[01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.060]   Yeah, I know.
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.020]   You can recuse yourself if you choose.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.220]   Before we do that, though, let's see what the score is
[01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:45.620]   in the football game here.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.500]   Oh, the Patriots.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:50.020]   We might be seeing your team, Andy, in New Orleans.
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:50.620]   There you go.
[01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:51.420]   I'm excited.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:55.620]   We've got an insurmountable three-point lead in the first quarter.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:56.620]   So it's over.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:57.980]   I may as well turn this TV back on.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.860]   You know, Padre as J. Father Robert Ballis
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.300]   or host of this week in Enterprise Tech,
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:04.460]   I think he's going to be one of the chaplains for the Super Bowl.
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.660]   So we might be--
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.900]   Does he need a co-chapeline?
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.060]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.660]   I've already got the black sweater.
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.060]   You'd look good in the casick, my friend.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:12.580]   There you go.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.980]   It's not too late.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.380]   You could take the cloth.
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:16.900]   All right, now--
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.900]   I do have my own coin if you need it for the coin.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:23.060]   Those are pretty of those coins, commemorative coins.
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:27.340]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, Tom Merritt, with a look
[01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.220]   at the week ahead.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:30.380]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:31.500]   Here's a look at some of the stories
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.620]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:34.460]   today.
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.060]   Tuesday, January 22nd.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:39.220]   It's earnings day for a bunch of companies, IBM, Google,
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.540]   and Verizon.
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.860]   And then the next day, Wednesday, January 23rd,
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:46.100]   Apple will have its Q1 2013 earnings.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.740]   Also on Wednesday, the Pebble Watch is supposed to ship.
[01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.860]   Thursday, January 24th, more earnings.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.660]   Microsoft has their report.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.580]   And then Nokia has theirs as well.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:59.780]   And Friday, January 25th, the SimCity Beta kicks off.
[01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:01.060]   Very excited about that.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.260]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.900]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.980]   This is TWET, Tech News Today.
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:10.900]   I don't think Apple does what they do because of shareholders,
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.860]   but you certainly don't see shareholders criticizing
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.540]   Apple for taking unnecessary risks.
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.060]   You see them criticizing them for not paying out dividends
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.500]   because they have a big pile of cash.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.580]   Ham Nation.
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:24.340]   Just microphone, which is in phase.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:27.300]   And this microphone is out of phase.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.820]   But watch what happens when I take these two signals
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:36.180]   and put them together if I want to get rid of my carrier.
[01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.220]   They both work, but together, it's gone.
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:41.220]   Home.
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.980]   This weekend, Enterprise Tech.
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:47.700]   I brought home a lot of gadgets and gizmos from CES.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:48.660]   It's kind of--
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:49.700]   Tabor knows this.
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.260]   When I'm at CES, I don't go by the name of Audrey or Father
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:52.940]   Robert.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:57.820]   I actually have a badge that says PRYZEWHOR.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.540]   It's kind of what I do.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:01.620]   Giz wins.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:06.420]   The 512 gig is available now with a MSRP of roughly $17.50.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.500]   He fell.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.620]   He's on the floor.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.900]   By the way, they actually thought he died.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.460]   They got a CPR kit.
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:23.460]   They basically had a heart attack.
[01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:24.460]   To it.
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:27.460]   Now, where did I put my eyeball?
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.540]   Did you go to CES-- oh, Joanna's--
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.020]   are you there?
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:32.420]   I'm here.
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.460]   Sorry.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.380]   She fell over too.
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.540]   Just playing with my blackberry.
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.260]   Oh, I know how that is.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.860]   Gotta get a-- can you tweet from that?
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.140]   I-- no, I mean, I refuse to tweet from it.
[01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.740]   But you could.
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:49.420]   If you wanted to, you could tweet from it.
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:52.140]   There is a Twitter app, but it hardly--
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:52.660]   It's hard.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.580]   --it takes a lot of effort to have an update.
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:57.860]   So-- you know, I can--
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:21:59.020]   no, I don't tweet from it.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.180]   I used to have a blackberry--
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:00.740]   I just read email.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:02.140]   Just read email.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.940]   I had a curve, and I'm--
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:08.220]   I was a Twitter user in 2007, so I'm pretty sure
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:10.740]   that I tweeted from the blackberry.
[01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:11.580]   That was my phone before--
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.180]   Yeah, I mean, it does.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.780]   It has an app, but it's just terrible.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:17.180]   I just-- I really want--
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.860]   I really want blackberry to survive.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.420]   I just-- I love-- I just loved my own blackberry.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.180]   I miss it.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.620]   I know, I think a lot of us out there think--
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:27.700]   Yeah, it'd be nice if they did all right.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.580]   So did you go to CES, Joanna?
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.820]   I also did a-- I did.
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.820]   I did.
[01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.580]   It was a crazy, exhausting week,
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.820]   and I think I've maybe just started recovering.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.260]   Yeah, I know.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:41.740]   Did you see anything that at all intrigued you?
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:44.460]   I saw a lot of stuff.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.260]   How do you feel about the dish hopper?
[01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.740]   Oh, right, right.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.220]   I didn't even really see it.
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:51.740]   I didn't see it.
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.740]   You too?
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.740]   I didn't see it either.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:55.860]   Did you go--
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.740]   I got press release about it.
[01:22:57.740 --> 01:22:59.740]   I mean, I don't really cover a lot of that stuff,
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.300]   but it seemed like a good product for--
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.740]   It is actually cool.
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:06.660]   It is a DVR that records all the major networks.
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.740]   ABC would like it because it records--
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.740]   but it's not a good product.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.740]   ABC would like it because it records--
[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:13.380]   but then it lets you skip the commercials,
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.740]   which is awesome for users.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.820]   So everybody should be happy, except the major networks,
[01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:21.140]   which are all suing dish for the hopper.
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:21.660]   Yeah.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:27.020]   And of course, CNET-- we now have learned CNET lied.
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.900]   The first press release from CNET
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:33.220]   said the hopper was a nominee in the best of CES,
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.020]   but due to ongoing litigation between our parent company,
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:41.300]   CBS, and Hopper and Dish over the hopper,
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:44.100]   we are going to remove all dish products from the list.
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.420]   And then later, it turned out that not only had it
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:48.820]   been nominated, but it in fact had
[01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:52.820]   won best of show that information got back
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:57.220]   to the executive suite at CBS who immediately said,
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:01.020]   no freaking way.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.380]   This story from Joshua Topolsky in The Verge,
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.180]   who was probably rubbing his hands with a glee.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.340]   I could just see him doing that.
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.060]   Wow.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:18.140]   And apparently, it was very emotional for the folks--
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:21.900]   the CNET editorial staff.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.740]   CBS Interactive News, senior vice president and general manager,
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:29.580]   Mark Larkin, was the guy who had to tell the staff
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:32.540]   that the hopper cannot win, that it would
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:36.140]   be removed from consideration, and that you have to re-vote
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.380]   and pick a new winner.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:41.660]   Sources say Larkin was distraught while delivering the news.
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.540]   At one point in tears, as he told the team,
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:48.740]   he had fought CBS executives who had made the decision.
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:51.540]   And according to Topolsky in The Verge,
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:59.060]   the word was passed from Leslie Moonves, the CEO of CBS.
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.300]   In fact, Moonves once told of investors,
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.740]   Hopper cannot exist.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.260]   If Hopper exists, we will not be in business with Dish.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.060]   Greg Sandoval, to his credit, who
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.180]   is one of the editors at CNET, has quit.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:14.540]   As far as I know, he's the only CNET editorial member who
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:15.060]   has quit.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:20.580]   I'll let you off the hook, Joanna, because you work for ABC.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.500]   It's in a direct competition and so forth.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.740]   What do you think, Dwight?
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.260]   Well, I think that it's something probably
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.820]   that every journalist who works for a big company,
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:35.780]   dreads happening, the head of the parent company coming down
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:38.660]   and essentially saying, no, you can't cover that or deal
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.780]   with that in that way.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:42.860]   I think it was a mistake by CBS.
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:45.020]   And the ultimate question you have to ask
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:49.180]   is, was there credibility--
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:51.660]   is it worth the cost from their credibility
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:53.940]   to not have given the award to the Hopper?
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:57.300]   And I think probably it was more of an emotional and less
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:26:00.620]   of a rational decision on the part of MoonVest to do that.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:04.820]   One interesting thing about the Hopper with sling,
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:10.740]   it automatically skips in 30-second increments
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.100]   when it finds commercials.
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:14.780]   But the very first DVR--
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:15.500]   Replay.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:17.620]   --replay did that as well.
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.460]   And got sued out of existence.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.900]   And got sued out of existence.
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:25.180]   So and all of the DVRs let you fast forward to commercial.
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.820]   You just have to do it manually.
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.180]   Whether it does it for you, to me,
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:31.460]   seems like a minor aspect of it.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.660]   But it's something that the networks are very much afraid of.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:39.100]   You know, it's akin to four websites.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:43.100]   It's akin to having ad blockers on your website.
[01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:45.860]   CBS had the nerve to release the following statement.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:52.620]   "CNET maintains 100% editorial independence and always will."
[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:57.580]   And they never doped either.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:00.540]   They never failed the doping test.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:03.140]   CBS has nothing but the highest regard
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.860]   for the editors and writers at CNET.
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.300]   And has managed that business with respect
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.420]   as part of its interactive division since it was acquired in 2008.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:15.540]   This has been an isolated and unique incident
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:18.220]   in which a product that has been challenged as illegal--
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.860]   well, that's a little bit of a broad stroke--
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.060]   was removed consideration for the award.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.380]   The product and question is not only
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.860]   the subject of a lawsuit between Dish and CBS,
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.980]   but between Dish and nearly every other major media company as well.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.500]   And that's why it must be illegal.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:35.220]   CBS has been consistent on this situation in the beginning
[01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.540]   in terms of covering actual news CNET maintains--
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.100]   oh, they say it's not actual news.
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:44.340]   How can CBS say CNET maintains 100% editorial independence
[01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.540]   if they were told not--
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:47.980]   you know what?
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:54.220]   Both companies have lost utterly lost any respect whatsoever.
[01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:57.980]   If I were-- I mean, Mr. Larkin, I'll give you a job here.
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.020]   Mark Larkin, but you should quit.
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:02.380]   If you were in tears, you don't have to take it.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.020]   You should quit.
[01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.060]   Greg Sandoval, nice job.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.100]   I don't understand why anybody stays at CNET.
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:09.900]   Get another job.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:12.340]   Go to work with somebody where you have some respect for you,
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:14.740]   because CBS clearly does not.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.460]   Shocking.
[01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.740]   Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely clear.
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:23.580]   The role of a parent company to the news organizations
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:29.020]   that they own, that's a carefully worked out relationship.
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:33.020]   If CBS simply wanted to give itself some coverage
[01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.580]   against a future or an ongoing lawsuit,
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.340]   if they wanted to make sure that they weren't essentially
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:41.460]   handing a dish network a weapon that could then
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.100]   beat them over the head with if they're
[01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:46.860]   when litigation ensues, that's the sort of thing
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.300]   where lawyers get together from both these branches
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:52.300]   and agree on wording that should be inserted inside the piece
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:54.540]   to make it absolutely clear to give them that sort of cover
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.100]   so that it won't affect any ongoing litigation.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:00.500]   I don't-- I mean, obviously, CBS is not
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:03.220]   going to be point for point explaining exactly why
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:04.180]   they made this decision.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:07.220]   But it's very, very curious that they
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:09.220]   made these sort of quasi explanations,
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.420]   because I think anybody who's worked in the media
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:14.900]   knows that CBS had many options available to them,
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:18.500]   far, far short of telling CNET supposedly
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.860]   a journalistic enterprise, not to cover a certain thing
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.180]   or not to talk about a certain thing.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.820]   So that's why their explanation is absolutely ring hollow.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:30.900]   Didn't CBS also say that in another statement
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:34.540]   that reviews are not journalism?
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:36.980]   Didn't they say that this was an exception because it had
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:40.580]   to do with product reviews as opposed to news?
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:44.660]   And I would strongly disagree with the notion
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.900]   that product reviews, particularly at the level
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:50.220]   it would see that operates because they are-- people
[01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.820]   rely on them for fair, detailed reviews,
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:54.900]   but that's not journalism.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:56.300]   It is journalism.
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:58.660]   And so that's just-- that's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:04.100]   I just hope that none of this really
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:07.260]   applies towards the people who actually work for CNET,
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:09.700]   because it's hard to-- I'm sure that this took most of them
[01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:10.980]   by surprise.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.980]   It's very, very difficult to make really that decision where
[01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:15.900]   they're going to say, moving forward, am I
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.300]   going to quit this job?
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.700]   I'm going to say goodbye to this.
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.700]   You have to.
[01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:26.420]   I'm saying that I wouldn't-- personally,
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:29.260]   I wouldn't presume to say what I would do in that sort
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.180]   of situation.
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:32.660]   I believe that I would say that unless I
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:34.900]   want to define myself as an entertainer who
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:38.100]   works for the entertainment site CNET, I can't go forward.
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.500]   But I--
[01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:41.500]   That's fair.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.020]   What's difficult for so many of these writers
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.740]   is that I feel for them because there are times when
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:49.780]   I did a couple of things, made a couple appearances
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:52.180]   appearing on tech panels on Fox News.
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.500]   Boy, did I get a lot of my followers and all my friends.
[01:30:54.500 --> 01:30:55.260]   Oh, come on.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:57.500]   You're going on Fox News Channel.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.220]   And I say, well, Clayton is a very, very nice person.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.260]   We don't have to talk about Karl Rove while discussing
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:05.580]   the iPhone 4.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.980]   I think it's going to work out OK.
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.140]   So I just hate to think that all these people who
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:13.580]   work for CNET who have been doing very, very good work
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.340]   and doing good things for the benefit of their readers,
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.620]   now they're-- I hope they don't get
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:19.140]   tired with the brush of, oh, well, of course,
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.500]   you're just the tools of the corporate puppet at this point.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.540]   And I'm going to disregard everything you say.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:25.180]   So I don't know.
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.060]   How can they not?
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.340]   How can they not?
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:30.780]   Because it was one thing last week we covered this story.
[01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.980]   We didn't know about the lies.
[01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:35.940]   But now if they're lying and CBS says they're 100%
[01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:39.220]   editorial independence, which is apparently not obviously,
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:39.940]   not the case.
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.580]   Only 80%.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.980]   Yeah, there's 73% editorially independent.
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:48.660]   And then the CNET is their own release
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.260]   lied saying it was in consideration when, in fact, it
[01:31:52.260 --> 01:31:54.900]   had won, presuming that Joshua's story is correct.
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:58.500]   And I have no reason not to believe that.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.620]   I think that they've done irreparable damage to the brand.
[01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.380]   And that's absolutely true.
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:07.500]   I don't think they have to do serious damage control
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.380]   right now by putting in firm policies in place.
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:12.940]   If they're claiming this was an unusual circumstance
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:15.900]   and a one-off thing, the only way that they can really
[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.100]   move forward after this is to say,
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:21.700]   we have spent the next two weeks following that incident coming
[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:24.420]   up with a very, very clear line of here's
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:25.700]   what the protocol is going to be,
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:28.100]   where if corporate has an issue with something,
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:34.820]   here is the protocol they have to follow, not to spike a piece
[01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:38.580]   who are running for CNET, but at least to give them
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:42.020]   the opportunity to include whatever disclaimer,
[01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:46.740]   whatever separate sidebar, corporate controlled content
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:48.540]   that they feel as though they have to do in order to give
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.540]   themselves coverage at the corporate level.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:52.700]   But yeah, as soon as they, as soon as seen it,
[01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:55.700]   defines themselves as something that as a company that
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.140]   an outlet that only writes things that are approved
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.060]   by their corporate overlords, that's when they,
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:02.660]   they truly do become an entertainment site.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.180]   They may as well become TMZ.
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:05.900]   All right, I'm sorry.
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.860]   I just got a little head up over all of this.
[01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:09.900]   No, you're absolutely correct.
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.300]   I mean, it reflects badly on us too in a way,
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.260]   because then everybody starts to wonder,
[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:16.100]   well, you know, what don't we know?
[01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:22.140]   Well, so that's, is that, is that, is that dish took the
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:26.780]   opportunity and accepted the award and won ads saying,
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:27.780]   we won this award.
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:31.220]   That was, that's great.
[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:32.300]   That's ballsy.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.980]   No, no, that's brilliant, because they know that if CNET
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:38.140]   wants to say that no, you didn't win this award,
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:40.380]   all they have to do is, oh, why do you, because here's this
[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:42.660]   press release, why are you saying we didn't win this award?
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.420]   Oh, because we're just corporate stooges who you have to
[01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.220]   rescind with, I'm sorry.
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:49.260]   Oh, yeah, congratulations on the, that's okay.
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.580]   You can still say that you win the award, please,
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:51.420]   let us go home now.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:53.780]   It's really what, and the reason it's a hot button for me is
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:55.940]   why I stopped working for mainstream media, because I
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.020]   don't want, I don't want that.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.020]   You're right.
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:00.380]   Dwight, this is everybody's greatest fear is that the
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:03.900]   CEO is on the line, let's move this is on the line,
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:05.860]   and he wants you to kill that story.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.820]   You have no choice.
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.380]   You either kill the story and lose all self-respect,
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.900]   or you walk out the door.
[01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:14.300]   And it's not a, obviously it's not a good choice,
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.220]   especially if you have bills in a family and you got, I mean,
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:18.340]   yeah, I don't know.
[01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:20.340]   That's why I worry.
[01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.700]   I mean, it's easy for me to say that I'm going to be
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.460]   raising the Red Banner Revolution and leading the
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.260]   crusade for successful journalism.
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:30.460]   That's okay because I don't have kids, and I don't,
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.540]   you know, I don't have kids who are not going to be able
[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:34.300]   to get braces, not going to be able to get medical care,
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.300]   not going to have medical coverage, because I decided to
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:37.940]   make a principled stand.
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:41.020]   The, the, what you have to do remains what you have to do,
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:44.900]   but I just hope this doesn't extend towards people saying
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:46.980]   really mean and ugly and nasty things about people who
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:50.020]   write for CNET because that they decided that, okay,
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:51.660]   I'm going to have to eat a little crap because I really
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:54.380]   like this job and I really like the fact that my,
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.900]   my kids can get medical treatment.
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:56.860]   - I love this turf.
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:59.740]   This is the dish, the dish ad on the website.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:01.500]   Thank you to the chair for passing this on.
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:04.260]   Dish Hopper named best in show, asterisk.
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:06.500]   (laughing)
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.980]   That's the way to play it.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:13.260]   Nice, nicely playing.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:14.100]   All right, we're gonna-
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:15.100]   - Oh god, that's, that's it.
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:19.540]   I'm sorry, I just, I just had to say that if CBS corporate
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.700]   could have given them something even better than the idea
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:24.860]   that this thing has been named best in show,
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:26.940]   not only they're giving them, not only are they being
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:30.740]   best in show, but the company, the network hates this product
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:33.420]   so much that they tried to suppress it.
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:35.260]   - Oh man, that's like-
[01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:37.020]   - Lines are on the block to get this thing
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:38.580]   before the network bans it.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.340]   - That's right, that's right.
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:40.180]   - Holy cow.
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:41.020]   - It becomes the-
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:41.860]   - It becomes the-
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:42.260]   - The great crisis man-
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:43.180]   - The product crisis.
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:46.060]   - Unbelievable story.
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:49.260]   You know, it's interesting 'cause the guy who invented replay
[01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:51.820]   and was put out of business by the networks
[01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:53.500]   who sued replay until they died.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:56.660]   Now, you know what his company is now?
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:57.540]   - It's Roku, isn't it?
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.700]   - Roku.
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.140]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.900]   - So there could be a second act.
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:05.460]   - Just, you gotta understand.
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.780]   - Let's say here, moving along.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:10.500]   (laughing)
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.420]   All right, we're gonna take a break.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:15.620]   Then we're gonna tell you why Wayne Dobson
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:16.900]   has a sign on his door that says,
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.860]   I don't have your cell phone, go away.
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:20.180]   - That's a great story.
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:22.260]   - I love that story.
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:23.100]   - Stay tuned.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:25.620]   But first a word for my friends at Citrix

[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.060]   It is the way to have meetings.
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.700]   I just had to go, we do go to meetings all the time here.
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:25.860]   Just had one on Friday.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.780]   Go to meeting, let's you stay connected, it lets you train,
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:30.780]   it lets you work with colleagues,
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:32.820]   it lets you present to clients.

[01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.420]   but you don't wanna make a client jump through hoops,
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:41.180]   join a sign up for an account, do all sorts of stuff.
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:42.260]   All you wanna do is just say,

[01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:05.700]   So who is Wayne Dobson?
[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:08.820]   And why do people keep knocking on his door?
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.500]   What's the story, Joanna Stern?
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:15.180]   - The story is that this innocent man
[01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.780]   who lives in Las Vegas keeps getting people
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:21.180]   who have lost their phone and are using either find my iPhone
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:24.460]   or another, I believe actually just the find my iPhone
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:27.340]   according to the original report.
[01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:29.060]   And they are ending up at his house
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.340]   because it is putting their phone there.
[01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:32.180]   (laughing)
[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:34.340]   But he doesn't have their phones,
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:36.300]   and this is a glitch in this system.
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:39.980]   I believe it's Sprint's network that this keeps happening on.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.580]   And Sprint doesn't even really understand what's going on,
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:45.060]   and they say they've been looking into it.
[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.580]   I know that was the last we had heard
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:48.780]   when ABC reached out to them.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:50.860]   But this poor guy, just,
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:52.980]   then people are knocking on his door and he says,
[01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:53.980]   "I think that there's a quote."
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.420]   He's like, "I understand."
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:57.860]   But I don't have your phone.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:38:59.980]   - Police have twice been wrongly directed
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:02.460]   to his house on domestic violence calls as well.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:03.300]   - Right.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.460]   - So what happens, he must be,
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.260]   what I'm thinking is he's near the cell tower.
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:10.340]   Because if a phone doesn't have a good GPS lock,
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:14.660]   it locates you in the general area of the cell tower.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:17.340]   And so he must be right under a cell tower.
[01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.940]   - Or he's at the triangulation.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.420]   - Or the triangulation three.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.260]   - Right.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:25.940]   - It happens, like, it's happened many times.
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:27.740]   Started in 2011.
[01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:29.380]   He said there was a knock on the door
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.540]   on a weekend about midnight.
[01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:32.820]   He opened the door and found an upset young couple
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:35.100]   demanding a turn over their phone.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:35.940]   He says, "I'm standing there
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.540]   "and thinking what are they talking about?"
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:40.260]   They might as well have said, "Give me my horse back."
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:43.740]   After debating back and forth, they called the police.
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:45.620]   He's 59 year old guy.
[01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:47.540]   He says, "I don't know these people.
[01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:48.780]   "I don't go where they go.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:51.060]   "I don't care about the technology."
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:54.780]   He says, "These technology pets they have."
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:55.940]   He never heard from him again,
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.580]   but then a woman's wandering through his backyard.
[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:02.060]   Before he could talk to her, she jumped over the wall.
[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:03.300]   A few minutes later here, knock on the door.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.700]   She says, "Give me my phone.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.020]   "I've got pictures of my grandkids.
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:07.100]   "I can't replace them.
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:07.940]   "I need them.
[01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.460]   "All I want is my pictures."
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:12.500]   Wow, so ABC's trying to get this guy.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:14.540]   I mean, what a story he must have.
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:15.380]   Now he's got a--
[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:18.940]   - Yeah, no, I mean, we were mostly trying to get sprint.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:19.940]   - Yeah, like what's going on?
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:20.940]   - Why is this happening?
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:24.500]   I mean, it seems to be just the sprint phones,
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.060]   and I think they are iPhones.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:26.900]   I'm trying to come over.
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:27.740]   - It's gotta be, I'm telling you,
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.780]   the sprint tower is over his head.
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.620]   That's gotta be it.
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:32.460]   - That's sprinting.
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.820]   Yeah, but--
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.260]   - This is the sign on his front door.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:39.100]   It says, "No lost cell phones.
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:42.420]   "This location gives a false phone locator position
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:44.620]   "that a cell tower is behind this home."
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:47.420]   Oh yeah, there is, to a cell tower behind this home.
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:49.220]   Please contact the North Las Vegas Police
[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:50.100]   and Firewall Report.
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.300]   No lost cell phones.
[01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:58.180]   So the moral is, do not buy a house underneath a cell tower,
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.620]   'cause it's gonna happen more.
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.940]   We're actually, aren't the,
[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:04.100]   Chad, aren't the cell towers right across the street
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.780]   on top of the Petaluma Hotel?
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:08.780]   - Yeah, you can see them on the corner of them.
[01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:11.100]   - So if you lost your phone, you can come here.
[01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:13.100]   - We don't have it either.
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.420]   I'm starting to read stories about the US attorney,
[01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:18.100]   Carmen Ortiz, who was prosecuting Aaron Schwartz,
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:20.060]   and apparently she's fairly upset.
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:24.380]   The statement they gave was pretty bland,
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:28.300]   and they said, "We offered him a plea bargain
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:31.420]   "of six months in a low security setting."
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.780]   But at Aaron Schwartz's funeral, his family said,
[01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:36.860]   "The feds killed our son."
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:41.980]   There's a petition to unseat her now
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:46.260]   that has crossed 25,000 signatures.
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:51.540]   She has really become the poster boy,
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:53.940]   or poster girl for all of this.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:42:01.820]   No official comments, but a very sad story,
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:04.500]   a very sad story, a tragic story.
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:10.940]   MIT is investigating why they weren't more
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:15.460]   forthright in saying drop of prosecution.
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:19.300]   You're also starting to have legislators get involved.
[01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:23.820]   Texas Senator John Cornyn has inserted himself into it
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:26.460]   and said he wants answers from the Justice Department
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:29.260]   as to why this investigation,
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:33.580]   and this prosecution was so intense given the crime.
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.380]   - The crime is essentially a terms of service violation.
[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:38.660]   That's why Zollofgren, who is a member of Congress
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:42.540]   from this area, has proposed what she calls Aaron's law
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:48.220]   to change this so it decriminalizes terms of service violations.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:51.700]   I mean, you shouldn't be threatened with 35 years in jail
[01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:54.300]   and a $4 million fine because you violated
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:55.980]   JSTOR's terms of service.
[01:42:55.980 --> 01:43:02.900]   He broke the law and even admitted to breaking the law,
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:07.900]   but to pursue him this vigorously really was inappropriate.
[01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:12.540]   And we have lost somebody who was, I think, fairly important.
[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:18.540]   Somebody said, don't blame Kim.com for piracy.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:21.300]   Go after the real pirates and somebody in the chow,
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:22.140]   I'm Glee.
[01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:24.860]   Those are the pirates.
[01:43:24.860 --> 01:43:28.500]   Our good friend Jonathan Colton, who has a wonderful cover,
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:30.740]   we played it when we interviewed Jonathan not so long ago
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:33.820]   for triangulation of baby got back.
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:36.820]   He just tweeted, he said, look,
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:41.380]   Leon Fox ripped off my cover of baby got back,
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:43.620]   never even contacted me.
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:47.580]   He says they even sampled after listening,
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.020]   they even sampled my recording that duck quack
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:52.700]   was in the recording.
[01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.260]   So since they stole it from Jonathan,
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:56.940]   let's steal it back from them.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:00.540]   This does sound a lot like his arrangement.
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:03.980]   Even down to the banjo.
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.340]   I like big butts and I cannot lie,
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:12.340]   you other brothers can't deny when a girl walks in
[01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:16.140]   with a nitty-bitty waist and a round thing in your face.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.180]   You get strong, you want to know.
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:20.180]   I got to play the Colton version now.
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:22.020]   It sounds just like it.
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:25.260]   Deep in the juice she's wearing, I'm hooked.
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.940]   I have it ready if you want to pause.
[01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:27.820]   All right, let me pause that.
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.980]   That's the Glee version.
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:30.460]   This is the original.
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:33.460]   ♪ Faced with the open booty ♪
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:39.140]   - Exactly, the same.
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:42.780]   ♪ I like big butts and I cannot lie ♪
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:46.860]   ♪ You other brothers can't deny when a girl walks in with a man ♪
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:48.420]   - Now I got to tell you, say.
[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:53.220]   We've done this since day one.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:55.660]   In fact, I know the guy who does this.
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:58.580]   And he told me, he said, no, no, we just take the song.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.660]   And then we wait for the season to sift order
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:02.900]   and then we say, well, how much?
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.580]   That's how they work.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:06.700]   So Johnny, Johnny C baby,
[01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.900]   go after him, they'll send you a check.
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:13.260]   - So you can even hear, the quack is the same.
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.660]   Are you gonna find the quack?
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:17.420]   - Well, this is them played right on top of each other.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:20.000]   (upbeat music)
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.740]   (laughing)
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.420]   ♪ I like my thoughts and I cannot lie ♪
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:25.140]   - Can you tell?
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:26.060]   - Sounds like one song.
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:27.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:30.020]   The other funny thing is that Glee
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:34.540]   did not change the lyric, Johnny C's in trouble.
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.980]   (laughing)
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:36.980]   - Oh, wow.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:40.860]   - Which is not, now I wanna hear the Sir Mix a lot version.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:41.800]   Will you play that?
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:44.860]   - I don't have that one cued.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:45.700]   - Well, I'll find it.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.220]   - Okay.
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:49.140]   - And I just, I'll point out
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:52.620]   that this is a little bit different.
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:54.460]   This is the original version of the song.
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.860]   I mean, I gotta skip the, hold on,
[01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:58.820]   I gotta skip the commercial from KitchenAid.
[01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:00.980]   KitchenAid apparently likes big butts just as much.
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:01.820]   (laughing)
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:03.180]   As Sir Mix a lot.
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.660]   I don't know if we could play that.
[01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:07.180]   We can't play that beginning part with the girls
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:10.420]   talking probably because it's kind of inappropriate.
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:13.060]   Not that the rest of the song is not inappropriate.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:14.380]   (laughing)
[01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:16.100]   But I was taking any excuse.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:16.940]   Here we go.
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:17.860]   - 'Cause she looks like that.
[01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:20.260]   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:22.500]   Okay, don't show the video either.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:23.340]   Okay, now you can play.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.220]   - Right, you don't wanna get,
[01:46:24.220 --> 01:46:25.300]   you don't wanna be pulled.
[01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:26.900]   - It's a round, it's a out there.
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:27.980]   (laughing)
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:28.820]   - Whoa.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:29.660]   - What?
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:30.660]   (laughing)
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:31.500]   - Here we go.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:32.340]   Sir Mix a lot.
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.180]   Hit it.
[01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:35.260]   ♪ I like big butts and I cannot lie ♪
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:36.260]   ♪ You other brothers can't do it ♪
[01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:38.020]   - Now why didn't Glee do this version?
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:40.340]   ♪ When the 80-bitty waist and a round thing in your face ♪
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:41.500]   - You get strong.
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:42.500]   ♪ Look at you pop blood ♪
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:43.780]   ♪ 'Cause you know this bad butts ♪
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.860]   ♪ You're stuck deep in a G-style ♪
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:48.060]   - That sounds just like the Glee version.
[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:48.900]   (laughing)
[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:50.420]   Thanks for blinking the lights.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:52.060]   (laughing)
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.180]   He left the Johnny C in.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:54.660]   - He's in our butt surf.
[01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:55.860]   - Holy cow.
[01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.140]   - We're having a light switch rave.
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:59.140]   (laughing)
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:00.140]   That's the best we could do.
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:03.180]   We flipped the lights which really fast.
[01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.460]   - Didn't Colton say that basically
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:08.660]   there's not much he could do because an arrangement
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:10.260]   isn't something you can copyright?
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:11.100]   - It's not his song.
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:11.940]   - It's belong.
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:12.780]   - Right, it's not his song.
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:13.620]   He can cover it.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.140]   - So it's kind of disingenuous.
[01:47:15.140 --> 01:47:18.460]   I doubt he's called Sir Mix a lot in the first place, right?
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:21.220]   Yo, Mix, I like to record your song.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:23.380]   Can I add banjo?
[01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:26.660]   - Well, he did get a license to record and release that.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.500]   - Oh, okay.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.620]   - So, I mean, 'cause there's been so much really
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:31.260]   like Nile Patel, of course.
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:32.700]   And anything involving the law,
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:33.540]   you get sick guys.
[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:34.380]   - He's on.
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:35.220]   - He's also a former lawyer.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.060]   - Right, exactly.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.180]   And so there's so many different opinions being written
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:39.820]   about this that there is very little he can do
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:42.700]   because, excuse me, early opinion is that
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:45.060]   because it is an arrangement and not the original song,
[01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.300]   they can essentially copy his arrangement verbatim.
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:50.380]   However, the fact that if they take his actual
[01:47:50.380 --> 01:47:52.780]   master recordings, that's something else entirely.
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:56.060]   And if Colton actually added something to it,
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:58.900]   like something as simple as saying Johnny C's in trouble,
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:00.980]   that essentially that content, exactly.
[01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:04.460]   That essentially is something that he owns
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:05.700]   that they couldn't take.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:08.700]   But once again, we're in the misty realm of lawyers
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:11.580]   in which all the, we're in a maze of misty passages
[01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:14.860]   all alike and all legal, in which we just simply sit back,
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:16.260]   find out who writes a check to whom
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:18.220]   or if someone just gets disgruntled.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:20.700]   Although, as I have to cap it off though,
[01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:24.220]   the musical coordinator for Glee after this started
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:26.300]   to really become a firestorm on Twitter,
[01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:27.820]   didn't he tweet back something like,
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:30.420]   I guess some people don't know how to make,
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.460]   make advantage of an opportunity when it's presented
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:36.060]   to them, like, ooh, ooh.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:38.860]   - Ooh, thank you, Mr. Glee.
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:39.700]   (laughing)
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.460]   I'm so glad you stole my wig.
[01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:45.700]   Please have a basket of Nipi muffins.
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:47.780]   No, no, full-sized muffins, I think.
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.860]   Good head.
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:52.700]   That's definitely doubling down on being a,
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:56.020]   I don't know what the hell you talking about, girlfriend.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:57.860]   (laughing)
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:01.740]   - Oh yes, indeed Leo, I did, gone, went there.
[01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:03.060]   - You gone there.
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:03.900]   - Yes.
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:05.660]   - And I don't think you're getting back.
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.920]   You are stuck there, Andy, and not go.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:13.780]   - Actually, apparently, "Escapeist" magazine
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.460]   published the timeline of tweets,
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:18.500]   and we're really overdoing this story.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:22.180]   - But it gave me an excuse to play Sir Mix a lot,
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:24.820]   and that's legitimately, I think,
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:27.500]   and that's my defense if they try to take us down.
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:29.340]   - Well, it's Colton, every geek loves Colton.
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:30.860]   - We love Colton, Johnny Cote.
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:33.500]   Johnny C is a friend of mine.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.460]   So Colton asked Michelle TGP, music is life,
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:39.260]   "Hey, can I ask, where did you get that recording?
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:40.660]   "Are you certain it's from Glee?"
[01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:42.020]   She says, "No, I'm just a Glee fan
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:43.180]   "who uploads Glee songs.
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:44.660]   "I'm sorry for what they did."
[01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:47.780]   It's from a Tumblr, which links back
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:50.660]   to a Brazilian fan site that also links,
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.940]   lists Baby got back as appearing
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:53.860]   in the 11th episode of season four.
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:57.500]   - Swedish iTunes Store lists the Glee version
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:59.500]   of Baby got back as a single.
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.900]   (laughs)
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.180]   - And apparently was available on other editions
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:05.420]   of the iTunes Store before it was pulled down.
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.380]   - So is there an issue?
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:08.540]   Is it, did it maybe not appear on Glee?
[01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:12.780]   - What I have read is that it was scheduled,
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:15.020]   it was gonna be part of an upcoming episode.
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:18.260]   The producers have not said one thing,
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:20.260]   one way or another, whether it is,
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.780]   is not will or will not be.
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:24.580]   However, it's also being reported that it was available
[01:50:24.580 --> 01:50:28.300]   for download as an official Glee track on the iTunes Store.
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:29.140]   Got it.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.380]   Got it.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:34.180]   - Mr. Jardier.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:36.620]   (laughs)
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:39.100]   ♪ I like big butts and I cannot lie ♪
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.700]   - It's amazing that it's, that they would do so,
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:44.260]   even if they ran it past the lawyers and said,
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.540]   "Nope, we can't, we're just,
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:48.220]   "make sure you're rerecorded, don't copy as master tracks,
[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.300]   "but yes, you can steal it that blatantly."
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:52.500]   It's just amazing to me that,
[01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:55.660]   that they don't understand that this isn't just some guy,
[01:50:55.660 --> 01:50:57.660]   a street performer that they decided to copy of,
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:00.900]   this is somebody who has a very large following,
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.300]   he's not Elton John playing Las Vegas,
[01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:04.740]   but he has a very serious following,
[01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.220]   this is going to be found,
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.980]   and these people are connected very much to social media
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:11.140]   and they can make this look very, very bad for them.
[01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:12.940]   - Like I say, I think this is the,
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:15.820]   this is the MO for Glee, frankly, this is what they do.
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:20.180]   And I know this for fact, I've known this for years,
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.020]   this is what they do, and it's probably well known
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:24.020]   in the music industry as well,
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:27.460]   and they forgot to send the memo to Johnny.
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:29.020]   To Johnny C.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:31.500]   - Yeah, I wonder, could they have fixed this
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:34.300]   by simply saying, "Hey, we're fans of your stuff,
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:35.660]   "we really want to use this arrangement."
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.700]   Our lawyers say that we can actually just use it
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:40.740]   without compensating you, we would like to at least notify you
[01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:42.620]   and see if we can give you, you know,
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:45.420]   can see this fine, find yourself a pretty dress in a shop
[01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:47.500]   window, we'll have it sent to your apartment.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.340]   (laughing)
[01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:53.140]   Sometimes people are not necessarily saying,
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:54.900]   "Oh boy, Glee's gonna use one of my songs,
[01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:57.100]   "I never have to work again a day of my life
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.180]   "because they're gonna be paying me so much money."
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:01.060]   They just want acknowledgement that the work
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:04.020]   that they do has value and can't simply be copied.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:07.340]   And also, I mean, what really bugged me the most is that
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:10.460]   Glee has a larger audience than Jonathan Colton does.
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:11.980]   And now maybe there's a certain amount of money.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:12.860]   - It's good for Johnny.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:14.260]   - Well, no, not necessarily.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:15.420]   Well, it's, yes, but also--
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:16.700]   - 'Cause they had Robert Credit.
[01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:17.540]   - Yeah.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.100]   - But what I'm saying is that now,
[01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.460]   if he plays his or 'cause his arrangement
[01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:23.420]   of Baby Got Back in concert now,
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:25.140]   are people gonna say, "Oh, look, he's doing the,"
[01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.740]   he decided to do that track that was on Glee last season.
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:28.860]   Oh, isn't that cute?
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.140]   Without knowing that, no, he created this arrangement.
[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:34.180]   Now it belongs to him less than it would have
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:35.580]   if Glee had not copied this.
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:37.700]   I mean, if this actually goes out on the air that way.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.540]   - Yeah.
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:40.820]   - Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've,
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:42.700]   you know what I think if Johnny Colton is smart,
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:45.380]   he'll ask for an appearance on Glee.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:48.500]   That would be the way to do it.
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:49.340]   - That's a guy.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:53.220]   - He could be the hip music teacher who comes in
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:56.220]   and teaches the whole Glee group how to play the banjo.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.100]   - He should be the job comes in.
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.420]   - If you don't know an opportunity when you see it,
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:02.980]   you know, he should contact him,
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:05.180]   ask for some money and ask for an appearance.
[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:06.300]   And-- - Forget the money.
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:07.220]   - Just an appearance.
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.540]   He can give him, you know, sag after points.
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:14.100]   They're good at major US retailers everywhere.
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:15.260]   - Let's come on in the code.
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:16.100]   - Let's come on in the code.
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.620]   - Let's see the Glee version of Code Bucky.
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:22.140]   - They can do an entire Colton episode.
[01:53:22.140 --> 01:53:23.500]   It would be huge.
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:28.500]   The same people watch Glee watch our Geeksin who love Colton.
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:29.700]   - It's a good idea.
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:30.540]   - They probably did.
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:33.020]   Maybe this is like the all Jonathan Colton episode
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.620]   where they start hoping of Mr. Fancy Pants.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:36.780]   - I love you, I see you.
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:37.620]   - Fancy Pants.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:38.460]   - How much was content?
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.620]   How much was content can we use without giving him
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:43.580]   as much as like one diet Dr. Pepper in compensation for it?
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:45.900]   - They could do a whole Fancy Pants parade.
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:46.980]   - Exactly.
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:48.140]   And afterwards, afterwards,
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:51.380]   the teens could have a Fancy Pants dance at the high school.
[01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.060]   You see, it all comes together.
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:53.900]   Let's take a break.
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.060]   When we come back,
[01:53:55.060 --> 01:54:00.100]   how to communicate your displeasure with neighbors using wifi?
[01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:02.780]   I wish I'd thought of this years ago.
[01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:05.100]   But first a word from audible.com.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:07.420]   Audible is the place where you can get those great audio books.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:09.260]   100,000 plus books.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:12.060]   I am such an, oh, I am such an Audible fan.
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:15.660]   I am now on book two of the King Killer Chronicles
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:16.940]   started with the name of the wind.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:18.980]   Now the new one, I can't put this thing down.
[01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:21.260]   I don't have to 'cause it's in my car.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:22.420]   It's in my gym.
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:25.300]   When I walk the dog, when I clean the house,
[01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.420]   I'm listening to great books.
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:32.020]   All sorts of great literature from audible.com.
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:38.100]   I'm a big fan and every time I go here,
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:39.260]   I want like this new book,
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:40.820]   this controversy about Scientology.
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:44.340]   This is the book everybody's talking about Scientology.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.620]   And it's already on Audible.
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:47.500]   Lawrence Wright's going clear.
[01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.500]   Scientology, Hollywood and the prison of belief.
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.500]   I can't wait to read that.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.220]   Gotta put that on my list.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.060]   What do you listen?
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:55.140]   Andy's a big audible fan.
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.100]   What are you listening to today?
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:00.180]   - The Scientology book has been on my radar since they ran
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:04.140]   a very, very long excerpt and was the hard reporter.
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:07.620]   But I'm sure they're putting experts everywhere.
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:10.300]   And it's like, okay, this could be interesting.
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:11.900]   There might be a book that I would want to like go
[01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:13.460]   into a real bookstore and pay cash for.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:15.780]   So there's no digital trail that I own this book.
[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:17.180]   I'm a credit.
[01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.580]   - Too late, I've already looked on the web.
[01:55:18.580 --> 01:55:19.620]   They know I'm looking at it.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:20.460]   Yeah.
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:21.300]   - Damn it, this is damn it.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.780]   I'm in the social graph already.
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:23.620]   Damn it.
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:27.860]   - That's called friction free sharing, Andy.
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:29.060]   We think you'll like it.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:30.540]   - Thanks for the lack of friction.
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:32.540]   I feel very lubed up by you, Mr.
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:34.260]   Thank you very much.
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:38.660]   But the other book that's on my wish list is,
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:41.940]   I'm trying to figure out which David Rakoff book
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:43.220]   that I want to get.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:47.660]   He's done, he did three or four collections of essays
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:49.180]   before he died.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:52.020]   And each one of them, what attracts me is the,
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:56.940]   I read the essay he did about the movie and the play Rent.
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:55:58.660]   - Which kind of hit.
[01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:02.340]   - Yeah, it's, well, I've always had the same opinion
[01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:06.380]   about that musical, which is that you're turning a terrible
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:08.940]   disease, I felt as though it turned a terrible disease
[01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:11.940]   into the same sort of thing that tuberculosis got turned
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.780]   into, you know, with the source material of it.
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:19.940]   - Well, but he's Lobo Em, so that's exactly right.
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:21.980]   - But I thought that we've already,
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:26.980]   just like W.S. Gilbert famously mocked the idea
[01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:29.940]   of high-brow art by saying, well,
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:32.220]   we have prostitutes dying of consumption,
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:34.140]   freezing carrots that will make it sufficiently
[01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:36.020]   physically heavy for you.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:37.900]   And also you had this, I don't know.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:39.260]   I was also affected by the movie,
[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:41.900]   which you have once again, one of those documentary
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:44.020]   filmmakers whose documentary style is sort of like
[01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:46.620]   wave a camera in the general direction of people moving
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:48.540]   without any idea of point of view.
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.420]   Anyway, so it was a really cool,
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:56.060]   cynicism is not a great aspect for life,
[01:56:56.060 --> 01:56:57.540]   but it is a wonderful way to write an essay
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.540]   and I really enjoy that.
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:00.780]   So I don't have a particular book I'm choosing it,
[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:02.060]   but it's definitely on my list.
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:05.380]   - He's got, half empty is one of them.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:07.940]   Don't get too comfortable and fraud.
[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:10.180]   Boy, they all sound good.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:12.060]   And now this is tough.
[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:13.180]   And then of course Audible says,
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:15.660]   people who bought half empty also bought,
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.420]   I don't care about your band.
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:18.820]   What I learned from indie rockers,
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:20.780]   trust funders, pornographers, felons,
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:23.300]   faux sensitive hipsters and other guys I've dated.
[01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:25.860]   Now I wanna get that book.
[01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:28.220]   It's an endless chain of great books.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:29.740]   I'm not gonna say literature.
[01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:31.300]   I don't know if this is literature,
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:32.340]   (laughs)
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:34.300]   but I kinda wanna read it.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:36.260]   And that's what's fun about going to Audible.com.
[01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:38.660]   So here we go, I'm gonna get you two books.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.500]   That's a great start.
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:42.820]   Free, go to Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:45.740]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.820]   The first, that's the two books a monthly,
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:48.740]   but your first month is free,
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:51.140]   your first two books are free.
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:52.780]   You cancel at any time, pay nothing if you want
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.580]   and you still get to keep the books.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:58.380]   The trick is always, which two books?
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:00.580]   There's so many great ones.
[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:02.820]   As with other plans, you also get a free subscription
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:05.660]   to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times Daily Audio.
[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:07.540]   And I gotta say, that's fantastic.
[01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:09.140]   I mean, if you don't have time to read the paper,
[01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:10.620]   listen to the New York Times Daily Audio
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:12.780]   and you're already up to date or Wall Street Journal,
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:13.620]   that's part of the deal.
[01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:18.620]   Audible.com/Twit, the number two, Audible to me,
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:20.980]   it changed my life.
[01:58:20.980 --> 01:58:23.460]   And that's why I'm really happy to share it with you.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:27.540]   Audible.com/Twit2, give it a try today.
[01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:29.580]   So have you ever done this?
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:30.940]   Has anybody ever done this?
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:35.860]   Use in the name of your Wi-Fi access spot,
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:38.740]   something like, your music is annoying.
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:41.900]   And then the response, 'cause they misspelled your,
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:44.180]   is your grammar's more annoying.
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:45.020]   (laughing)
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:48.780]   In the SSID, brilliant.
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:51.420]   So I live around the corner from a bar.
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:56.460]   And it's called the flat.
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:59:00.700]   And one of the people who live around me one day
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:05.260]   came up with an SSID that just said the flat sucks.
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:07.460]   'Cause the people come out of there too in the morning,
[01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:10.260]   they're loud, they leave beer bottles on people's lawns.
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:12.060]   And everybody who lives around here was cheering going,
[01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:13.980]   "Yeah, who is that guy?"
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:15.740]   You know, he was kind of saying what we all think.
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:17.500]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:18.540]   Pump up the volume.
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.380]   Have you ever done that?
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:22.180]   I'm looking at the ones in my apartment.
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:23.460]   They're not very interesting.
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:25.140]   You bet, so you live in a apartment in New York City,
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:27.580]   you've probably got 20 access points, right?
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:29.060]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:31.820]   Yeah, that's even more here, probably.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:33.180]   Not very interesting.
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:34.500]   Nothing good.
[01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:36.180]   Why don't you start something, Joanna?
[01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:37.540]   Barbara's wife, I know where--
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.940]   Mine is actually not welcome.
[01:59:39.940 --> 01:59:41.140]   Good?
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.300]   You could do FBI honey pot.
[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:45.740]   You could--
[01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:48.460]   Mine is FBI truck four.
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:49.380]   Like it.
[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:50.780]   Surveillance van 63.
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:52.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.580]   I like that one.
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:55.420]   Yeah, these are boring.
[01:59:55.420 --> 01:59:58.860]   Get off of my land, be tree suggest.
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:00.460]   That's good, I like that.
[02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:02.460]   Good, I'm a model man.
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:05.660]   Ed says my neighbor's name is Guido
[02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:08.580]   and his Wi-Fi access point is called the G-spot.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:13.220]   Not for you, virus ridden network,
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:15.580]   somebody has pretty fly for Wi-Fi.
[02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:19.100]   Gosh, our chat room has better Wi-Fi names than anybody.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:20.220]   Definitely the rhyme.
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:23.780]   Yeah, there's free internet is the one you see
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:24.620]   at the airports and stuff.
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:26.540]   And that's just a bug, a Windows bug.
[02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:28.940]   Virus.exe, that would be a good name.
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:30.900]   Yep, yeah.
[02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.420]   I promise not to hack you, says beef.
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:35.260]   That's good.
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.780]   I wonder if you have a Wi-Fi basis name
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:40.700]   that was actually like a buffer overflow hack.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.540]   Oh.
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:43.020]   Or just dumps JavaScript.
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:43.860]   Wouldn't that be good?
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.660]   Get into your menu bar and hope so,
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:46.660]   execute something.
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:49.540]   Or SQL command, you know, table clear.
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:50.380]   Exactly.
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:51.780]   Yeah, table drop.
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:52.620]   Table drop.
[02:00:52.620 --> 02:00:57.060]   Web 9840 says Abraham links this.
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:58.940]   That's not bad.
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:00:59.780]   That's not bad.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:03.900]   Um, law enforcement, I like that.
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:08.300]   Get your own, stop yelling at your wife.
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:10.300]   Okay, I like that.
[02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.380]   Anyway, just thought I'd pass that along.
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:13.540]   They came to us.
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:16.180]   I think that the best one would be,
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.820]   you left your webcam on.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:21.100]   You'll turn off your chat camera for God's sake.
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:23.060]   He's in the house.
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:24.420]   Leap motion strikes a deal.
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:25.780]   I'm very interested in Leap motion.
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:26.980]   I don't know if I haven't played with it.
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:28.540]   Any of you played with Leap motion yet?
[02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:30.860]   This is the idea that you wave at your computer
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:32.180]   instead of using a mouse.
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:33.180]   It's kind of like connect, right?
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:34.940]   It's connected for your computer.
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:35.940]   Have you played with it?
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:38.020]   I don't know if I've done a leap,
[02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:40.780]   but I've done a couple of the other ones.
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:44.500]   The idea is that they've done a deal, by the way,
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:45.340]   with Best Buy.
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:48.020]   Best Buy is going to take orders pre-orders in February
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:50.020]   and sell the leap sometime in spring.
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:54.660]   They got a deal to bundle with Asus PCs,
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:58.620]   as well as a $30 million round of funding, be round.
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:02.300]   Apparently, they put out 12,000 leaps to developers,
[02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:04.020]   so they've got a product,
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:07.580]   and it will launch with an app store
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:09.940]   filled with applications built around the leap.
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:14.500]   This sounds like any application,
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.660]   in other words, you can't bring up your copy of Chrome
[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:19.660]   and swipe through pages,
[02:02:19.660 --> 02:02:22.900]   or you have to have a leap-aware application.
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:26.220]   It was my understanding, it kind of replaces a mouse,
[02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:28.100]   so anything that's mouse-aware would work,
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:30.020]   but I guess if you had a leap-aware application,
[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:32.540]   it could do even more, right, like the connect could do.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:35.500]   It is accurate to within 100th of a millimeter,
[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:39.700]   and I'm looking at these leap screens.
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:42.100]   I don't see any, there must be a camera somewhere, right?
[02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:44.180]   I don't know, is it using your webcam?
[02:02:44.180 --> 02:02:47.380]   Should be very interesting.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:50.660]   - There's a peripheral that sits on your table.
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:51.500]   - Oh, okay.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:52.340]   - It's, yes.
[02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:54.380]   - Okay, so there is something that's not pictures.
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:55.460]   - Okay.
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:59.820]   - I mean, all they need is any actual real human being
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:02.660]   who wants to interact with their computer this way.
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:03.660]   I mean,
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:06.140]   (laughing)
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.300]   I mean, Microsoft had success with their because
[02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:09.940]   they actively-- - For games.
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:12.020]   - It's for gaming, where you can actually get
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:14.300]   interactive with the game, that's really, really cool.
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:17.180]   Until it kind of reminds me of
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:25.020]   all these companies that are making like 3D viewer goggles
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:27.980]   that are-- - Oculus Rift got so much attention
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.420]   at CES.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.660]   - Yeah, well, like a house of each other.
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:36.740]   - LCD shutter glasses, that they work pretty well,
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:38.220]   but they still can't convince anybody
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:42.420]   that they want to use goggles instead of an actual monitor.
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:44.900]   And so until that actually meets that critical mass,
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:48.260]   they're selling it to like dentists who use that as a way
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:49.700]   to enhance their services.
[02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:50.740]   And so according to real estate people,
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:52.700]   they're selling to law enforcement and police
[02:03:52.700 --> 02:03:53.660]   in the military.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:56.780]   And so I'm sure that they'll find ways to actually use this,
[02:03:56.780 --> 02:03:58.300]   people who are actually selling services
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:00.780]   that where they can build a bespoke application
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.780]   that for which this is perfect.
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:04.980]   But otherwise, great.
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:07.020]   Here's the amount of money you spend for a box
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:09.180]   that you can't use for software that doesn't exist.
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:11.540]   Oh, and this actually costs money, it's not free.
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:13.340]   Okay, thank you for--
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.580]   It's like, at what point do you hit the abort switch
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:16.420]   on this pitch?
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:17.240]   - Yeah.
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:18.420]   By the way, it makes-- - That makes--
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:19.300]   Go ahead.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:21.780]   That looks like serious guerrilla arms.
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:22.620]   I mean--
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:23.460]   (laughing)
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:25.420]   - Well, look at it, I mean, all that.
[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:27.660]   You don't have to always keep your arms straight up.
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:30.220]   But maybe they could then have a secondary product line
[02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:31.820]   of arm rests.
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:35.740]   If I could sit back in my chair and do like this,
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:36.900]   just do this--
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:38.260]   - Yeah, well that's you could.
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:39.540]   - You can go through, yeah.
[02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:40.420]   That's what I would like.
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:41.740]   - Well, you put the thing in your life.
[02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:44.220]   - If you hear about this, that's not cool.
[02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:46.620]   - My camera doesn't go back far enough,
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:51.020]   but I recently built for myself a really big wide easel
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:54.060]   out of pine that keeps one, two, three tablets
[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:57.700]   and a phone right here outside of camera angle,
[02:04:57.700 --> 02:05:00.100]   outside of camera range.
[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:02.740]   And I'm actually finding that this is a wonderful--
[02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:06.020]   So you can't see it, but it's a lot like the command station
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:07.460]   on the Star Trek the next generation
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:08.820]   the data used to work at.
[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:11.140]   You know, where my hands, it just sort of,
[02:05:11.140 --> 02:05:12.740]   is at an angle and on a level where my hands
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:14.140]   would naturally fall.
[02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:16.660]   And that sort of caused me in the past couple weeks
[02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:19.260]   since I've set this up to sort of change my mind
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:20.860]   about the Gorilla Arms concept.
[02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:24.220]   If you are sitting at a desk and the screen is two feet away,
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:25.820]   yes, that is very tiring.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:27.940]   If you're in a comfortable chair and you're at a piece
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:29.860]   of furniture that's designed to hold a tablet
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:31.860]   right where you'd want it to be,
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:33.660]   I've got a really nice wall of glass
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.300]   that's providing a lot more information,
[02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:36.860]   much more interactively and quickly
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:38.460]   than a computer where the screen is.
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:42.380]   So maybe we're still just waiting for that iPad moment
[02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:45.660]   where someone figures out how to perfectly articulate
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:47.300]   this idea so that people will just simply
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:49.100]   fall over themselves to start using it.
[02:05:49.100 --> 02:05:51.180]   - Well, we know that Microsoft really hasn't
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:52.140]   capitalized on Connect.
[02:05:52.140 --> 02:05:54.660]   I kept waiting for something good to happen.
[02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.060]   And they even did a Connect for Business,
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:05:57.860]   but I don't know and nothing's really happening.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:00.340]   - And Connect support is built into Windows 8.
[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:01.180]   - Yeah.
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:02.020]   - It's in Windows 8.
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:04.740]   It's what we, you know, isn't the minority,
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:07.220]   that's what we want, the minority report interface.
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:08.660]   - But I think the Connect support is more
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:10.460]   for gaming than anything else.
[02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:11.300]   - Right.
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:12.140]   - For Windows 8.
[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:13.820]   I don't think they are really thinking
[02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:15.900]   that people can be using meetings to say,
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:18.180]   now if you look at this report here,
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:21.300]   you can tell that our projections are,
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.140]   I don't think that's where they're intending it for.
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.420]   It still is a gaming platform
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:27.100]   until society decides that we are actually ready
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:28.620]   to start dealing with computers this way.
[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:30.260]   So it's difficult enough getting them to interact
[02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:33.540]   with their computers via voice on a mobile device.
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.020]   When you give them something where they don't even
[02:06:35.020 --> 02:06:37.860]   understand what the UI language is,
[02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:39.100]   you know, is there a click?
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.260]   Is there a drag or a double click?
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.860]   Is there a swipe?
[02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:43.860]   Is there a tap?
[02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:46.180]   People don't understand what that vocabulary it is yet.
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.260]   So it's-
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:48.460]   - Well, you could have said the same thing
[02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:50.460]   before the iPad came out about touch,
[02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:51.660]   pinch, zoom and all that.
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:52.940]   That was all a new vocabulary.
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:54.500]   We learned it pretty quick.
[02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:56.580]   - Yeah, but even then we understand the idea
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:58.500]   of an on-screen button that we actually reach out
[02:06:58.500 --> 02:06:59.420]   and click on.
[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:01.100]   We're just using our fingertip as a way
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.900]   of making that interaction.
[02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.860]   So what do we, again, what is the analog for,
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:08.660]   are we actually trying to grab something
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.860]   or are we actually trying to move something?
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:14.140]   - It's a fascinating problem, but I'm not sure
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:17.100]   that we're gonna see a solution to in the next couple of years.
[02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:20.100]   - Two more things to hate about Facebook.
[02:07:20.100 --> 02:07:22.140]   The young couple who said if I get a million likes,
[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:23.500]   we're gonna sleep together.
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:25.500]   (laughs)
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:30.500]   And then the Facebook page from two siblings,
[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:33.020]   they wanted a family dog.
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:35.060]   They said if we get enough likes,
[02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:38.700]   if we get a million likes, we get a family dog,
[02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:41.500]   they got 2.6 million Facebook likes.
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:42.860]   The dad is probably really,
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:44.940]   (laughs)
[02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:47.660]   he did not want a dog.
[02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:50.860]   So he said, oh, just, yeah, get a million Facebook likes
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:52.700]   and I'll get you a dog.
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:53.540]   - They did.
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:58.020]   - But father of the year, if he then said that,
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:07:59.700]   actually this was actually public,
[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:01.060]   this was my way of telling my kid
[02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:02.540]   that we're not ready to have a dog yet.
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:04.980]   This would not be a fun environment for a dog to live in.
[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:07.180]   And despite the fact that you gave him two million likes,
[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:08.660]   I'm still not gonna give him the dog.
[02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:12.100]   'Cause that's how responsible a dog owner,
[02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:14.260]   I would be the fact that I know that an apartment
[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:15.700]   which people are going in and out all day
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:17.300]   is not a good place for a dog.
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:18.780]   - Ah.
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:20.580]   - This is the lucky- - That's how it was a good story.
[02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:21.980]   - It is, it was from ABC News.
[02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:24.100]   You guys found this story.
[02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:25.860]   - Yeah, I mean, we had them on Good Morning America,
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:29.100]   so I'm sure that's part of how they got so many likes.
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:30.260]   But I think they had a lot of,
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:32.100]   they had like a million by the time they were
[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:33.660]   on Good Morning America.
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:36.180]   - Two girls and a puppy on Facebook.
[02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:38.820]   (laughing)
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.300]   - It's a very popular page.
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.980]   - Safe search filter on.
[02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:44.300]   (laughing)
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:46.700]   Annie and Ico's with the Chicago Sun Times
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:48.780]   and of course, a regular on Mac Break Weekly.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:51.340]   He does an Ico's Almanac on the five by five
[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:53.180]   network at five by five.tv.
[02:08:53.180 --> 02:08:55.500]   Anything else you wanna plug?
[02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:57.340]   - Yes, I've also do an audiobook edition
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:00.580]   of my tech columns on another five by five podcast
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:02.260]   called Old Tech News.
[02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:04.460]   Or you can check out my Twitter at an not go
[02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:06.220]   and my blog at an not go.com.
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:08.420]   In frequently updated because too many people
[02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:10.020]   are asking me to write things for money for me
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:11.460]   to actually start putting things on my blog.
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:12.660]   Unfortunately, I'm lazy.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:14.980]   - I do like that idea of taking the,
[02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:16.420]   reading the old columns.
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:17.380]   That's a great idea.
[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:19.340]   - Yeah, I really enjoy that a lot.
[02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:22.540]   Also, it's so much nicer when you know that you have,
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:25.100]   you know, eight minutes of stuff written out for you
[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:28.100]   and all you have to do is use the announcer voice
[02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:29.780]   and read it quite carefully.
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:31.140]   Then all you have to do.
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:31.980]   - Is that it?
[02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:32.820]   (laughing)
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:33.980]   - You did all the work.
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:34.820]   - You already wrote.
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:35.660]   - Exactly.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:37.420]   - As a matter of fact, that's why I built like this deck
[02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:40.180]   so that I can have like a good reading platform.
[02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:41.340]   So I'm enjoying it a lot.
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.820]   I just recorded the fifth episode.
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:44.940]   It should be posted sometime tomorrow.
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:46.180]   - Mr. Dwight Silverman is with
[02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:49.220]   the Houston Chronicle blog.cron.com/techblog.
[02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:52.220]   He's their social media manager.
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:53.060]   - That I am.
[02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:55.020]   And I still keep my hand in the tech blog.
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:58.380]   I also have the Wednesday night technology bite show
[02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:01.140]   on KPFT.org.
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:03.020]   And Leo, you're welcome to come back to get--
[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:04.580]   - I wanna do that show soon, yeah.
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:05.420]   Just let me know.
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:06.260]   - We'll get you on.
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:07.100]   We'll get you back on.
[02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:09.420]   - It's a fun show to do 'cause you have like 18 hosts.
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:10.260]   (laughing)
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.180]   Yes, it's chaotic.
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:13.820]   What you need to do is come in to Houston
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:15.500]   for the first Friday of the month
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:17.340]   and come into one of our geek gatherings.
[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:18.220]   - Okay.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:20.260]   - And you should roll on in.
[02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:21.700]   - I'd love to do that.
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:22.540]   It's a blast.
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:24.220]   That sounds like fun.
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:25.060]   Thank you, Dwight.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:25.900]   Great to see you again.
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:26.740]   Glad you're feeling better.
[02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:27.580]   Dwight had the flu for a while.
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:28.420]   I'm glad you're feeling better.
[02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:31.340]   - I had, I sounded like Barry Dwight last week.
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:32.420]   - A little baby.
[02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:33.260]   - A little baby.
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:34.100]   - A little baby.
[02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:38.100]   - Joanna Stern is a technology editor for ABC News.

[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:40.020]   I can't believe it's been a year.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:42.180]   Don't make it a year again, okay?
[02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:43.260]   - Apparently it was May,
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.700]   but we still need to, we need to do this Monday night.
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:47.860]   - It feels like a year.
[02:10:47.860 --> 02:10:49.020]   - It did feel like a year.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:49.860]   - You're so great.
[02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:50.700]   I really appreciate it.
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:51.540]   And I just wanna apologize
[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.260]   for everything that we said today.
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:55.100]   (laughing)
[02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.020]   - I don't know, that's the excitement of doing this.
[02:10:57.020 --> 02:10:58.500]   - We don't get many women around here.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.340]   And now you know why.
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:00.900]   - That's the excitement of doing these.
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:01.740]   (laughing)
[02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:04.260]   - I know, Becky, Becky Whirly has warned me.
[02:11:04.260 --> 02:11:07.300]   - Yeah, well, Becky's worse than anybody.
[02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:08.140]   Are you kidding?
[02:11:08.140 --> 02:11:08.980]   - I know she's.
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:10.300]   (laughing)
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:12.780]   - The conversation goes with the gutter when Becky's here.
[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:15.220]   She warned you against us.
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:17.020]   I warned you about her.
[02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:20.780]   - Well, I, Becky.
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:22.380]   - It's all good friends.
[02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:23.980]   @JoannaStern on the Twitter.

[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:35.980]   I faded like an, like, I don't know, 30 minutes ago.
[02:11:35.980 --> 02:11:36.820]   I was just saying.
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:37.820]   - Sure, you gotta bring with you.
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:40.460]   Well, they didn't warn you that when you do twit,
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:43.780]   you've gotta bring supplies for at least several days.
[02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:45.380]   It's a long ass show.
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.780]   - Seriously, I should have like ordered food.
[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:49.460]   - Oh, I've had a cheeseburger.
[02:11:49.460 --> 02:11:51.420]   I've been to the bathroom four times.
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:53.540]   I finished a Mickey a wide mouth.
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:55.460]   I mean, this goes on and on.
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:57.820]   - I don't see how Pournell survives it frankly.
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:11:59.660]   (laughing)
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:02.260]   - He also fades towards seeing it.
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:05.460]   - That's why when you become a regular on twit,
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:07.220]   they send you a coffee mug,
[02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:10.180]   a good microphone and a box of those astronaut underpass.
[02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:11.180]   Astronaut diapers.
[02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:12.180]   (laughing)
[02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:13.020]   - Thank you, Andy.
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:13.860]   Thank you everybody.

[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:16.380]   - It's amazing.
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:17.220]   - Yeah.
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:19.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:21.240]   - Do it, all right.
[02:12:21.240 --> 02:12:23.040]   Do it in the twit, baby.
