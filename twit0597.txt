[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Oh, how hard oh dear you know people are moving out of it so there's no big shopping malls and it's just so hard we're like we're gonna get we're gonna get my good blue jeans I just it's not I don't want to live there Becky Worley good to have you Mike Becky Worley is also here other dear friend from ages gone by she's the big time host tech reporter at Good Morning America we're seeing you every day now
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm not quite at host status I'm knocking on Michael Strahan and Robert do they have like a hierarchy like are you junior host oh no I'm the way C team on the west coast our west coast C team under the radar at 2 30 in the morning because they clearly love you because you're on all the time I wake up a lot and have the 440 live shots so I'm doing the morning thing but there's so much interesting consumer technology consumer technology news and it's really fun to bring that into a mainstream
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   perspective and then get to come do this and geeky podcasting with you and I just noticed that there's a little tribute if you look in your shot to call for help remember on the old call for help show we had a kind of a window like the one behind you and there was a day it was a fake tree branch with a string on it and every once in a while somebody would every time you walk by she's tugged the branch make it look like yeah so yeah I mentioned that apparently our staff has decided to put a fake tree branch in the window behind you
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   it could be anything pretty much it's a tribute though to help think of it anyway a tribute that also here I'm thrilled to have Greg Ferro back he is the host of the packet pushers network thank you IT an enterprise tech guru and good to be back brilliant
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   brilliant I was lucky to be here in the valley and I couldn't hold myself back from coming up to see what's going on were you here for work yeah I'm doing a working with some of the startups in the valley this week and then I'm doing a social media tour of about a dozen technology startups in my field
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   oh that's fun yes so you actually you don't you're not just a podcast you actually work mmm well this is podcasting so part of my media presence is to get in front of the vendors and learn about their technology so I'm a but you work I mean you consultant I do a consult and analyze I'm I advise a number of companies about their technology strategies and
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I mean I just yeah so I'm working one of the biggest highest performance compute labs in the UK right now working on their next super computer build out which is really interesting and have a number of companies that I advise to keep my hand in as a professional network engineer and enterprise IT engineer and then but my real full time job is the podcast and
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I want to keep my finger on the pulse of real technology not just you know become a podcast host who's like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I'm not a major fan of the
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major fan of the major
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   working with all these people who really are covering these stories it keeps me up today anybody who's doing this is doing keeping up with you know you got to keep up today but I'm not I'm a much I'm in a much deeper but I'm much more vertical so I'm in a niche of data networking and enterprise IT I try to I try to play with all the new phones
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   and I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm not a fan of the other thing I'm
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   to be in surgery don't want to TV doctor who's just make it stuff up that's right that's true so you want to be practiced did you go to see yes while you're out here no Mike did you go to see yes no no I avoid that like the play Becky you must have got a C. Yes negative it's only the second one I haven't gone to Wow why not
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   no interest I think you know I've heard from a lot of people it just was not a media story yeah I mean the stories maybe there's little crumbs I think you actually had a great story about about Zeiss's yeah that was last year that that article was written about a year ago but the reason I'm kidding no the reason I put it there is because we were talking about Apple working with Carl Zeiss and people like gosh does Carl Zeiss have any yeah they have amazing technology and that's smart glasses that was that was teased at last year's
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   CES the technology is super solid and if you read that article I'm talking about how they're working with some competitor to Google so that doesn't support or not support well that's that's that's that's the big story from Robert anyway he says and it's not clear we talked about this a little bit last week it's not clear where he got this he says in his Facebook post a Zeiss employee could firm the rumors that Apple and Carl Zeiss are working on a pair of augmented reality or mixed reality glasses that may be announced.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   This year maybe next year then later on in the post he says something about the fact that the people in the booth made faces when he mentioned that as if they were laughing nervously I hope that wasn't his source.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Well that's what he said in the post that's his source. That's the source he said to the employees why are you doing something with Apple and they laugh.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   This implies though a Zeiss employee confirmed implies that a Zeiss employee said something to him but not merely laughed nervously you think it's not a change from what I saw.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Yeah well this is the previous post I don't know anyway it wouldn't be so much of a surprise and then the other piece that's of interest is the Zeiss booth was in the augmented reality marketplace and yet they had no augmented reality products.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So that kind of you know yeah confirm something they're working on something secret.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   So you remember that techno remember what remember bookstores yeah there is a building where they built there was books inside.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   You know I was in one yesterday oh wait a minute that was augmented reality I literally was we had a company called Locksipital who makes the first one I've ever seen for an iPhone the visor for the iPhone and it's augmented reality so you can see things
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and touch things watch the new screens every from yesterday and then our co-host Nathan Oliveris Giles from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I said okay now touch that wall he touched the wall in a hole opened up in that wall and there was a bookstore in there that they had scanned and you could walk in and go from augmented reality a real world to a virtual reality in a bookstore.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   So thank God we still have bookstores.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Yeah and thank goodness Amazon didn't run them out of business and to virtual so anyway so in bookstores they used to sell these flat lenses it was a flat little credit card size lens to magnify the book.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Remember those that the check that's called a Fresno Fresno lens it's 200 year old technology that's the technology that the Carl Zeiss technology is based on.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   They put it into the glass and they have 250 patents supposedly around smart glasses and so the idea is for augmented reality mixed reality they'll be able to build these into ordinary glasses at low cost and these will be just you go to the optometrist office.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Now because unlike a regular lens that you have to grind precise tolerances these are just and you've all seen them.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Yeah they're just little wedges of glass that give you a less I have to say a less high quality.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   But imagine what's what's possible now with lasers and computer.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Maybe they can do better.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Yeah so they've apparently got some really fantastic technology and it's actually a separate company they spun out a separate company just to do this sort of thing.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And I'm really excited about this technology in particular but other efforts in general that will result in smart glasses that look like ordinary glasses.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   There are a bunch of companies working on things like that taking different approaches but I love this approach because you definitely want visuals you definitely want a screen.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Okay so let me ask the question why does this form of augmented reality glasses differ from Google Glass.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Why do you see the difference between the bright screen in the upper corner of the lens being so socially different or sort of from a market use case better than most of the last.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So I think that the hot part of the company they should be partnering with and I talked about in the article is Luxautica which is the umbrella company for all of the glasses.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   All the vanity, let's get Gucci glasses, those are Luxautica glasses in an Italian company.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And so I'm pretty sure that within three, four, five years you'll be able to go to the optometrist office and if you want progressives, do you want this, do you want smart.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And if it's smart what's your platform, whatever, it's a checkbox item and you just get your ordinary glasses and there they are.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   They have this similar effect as what do they call it when you have two different lenses.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Bifocles, it'll be like bifocles and you'll be able to just get little notifications so and so is calling you.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   And the problem with Google Glasses were twofold, first they looked really stupid.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   It was a big boom that came out in front of your face.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   By the way this guy spent 1500 bucks on him and wore him around for a long time.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I still use him, I love, I love where is the mermaid.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Well I think the fundamental thing about Google Glasses was they were an ego play. The idea was that they were meant to look like you're a dick.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Well I don't think they were meant to.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I think they were meant to.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I think they were meant to be mobile advertising.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I think the dick came free.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Stupid comes, stupid is a stupid is.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I just want to show you up here in Fort Bragg, there is, and there are a number of these, the old lighthouse.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   That's how they started, 200 were, for now lenses, these are made in France.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I think it's pronounced, probably pronounced fine now because it's a French.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I looked it up, it's a fine now or a fine now.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Yeah, there's an S in it.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Well you don't want to say it wrong because you're a TV announcer.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's an island.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   It's an island.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But these lenses are jewels.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I went up to Fort Bragg and saw these.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   And this one's still operational.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It's run by the Coast Guard.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   But it was completely restored and they're just gorgeous lenses.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And so they could make these giant crystal lenses without having to focus the light.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And focus the light.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And it was good.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Well there's a few things in there.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   One is, so Google Glasses were meant to be an ego play.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You put them on your face.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I disagree, that wasn't meant to be an ego play at all.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Absolutely not.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Why tried to diffuse it?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It was an experiment.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   The second, it was an experiment.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So if that's the case, then why are Snapchats Galasses working so well?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Because they look like glasses.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Now the problems with Snapchats glasses is that if you've got an optical, medical optical
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   you can't use them.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Well that's why L'exotic-ish.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   You're saying Snapchats are not an ego play?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   They're limiting, they're putting their money machines.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   They're not.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   They're trying to make ordinary glasses look like an ego play.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   But they look like ordinary glasses and they operate like ordinary glasses.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   They look ridiculous.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   They have a lens on both sides.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   They look like that.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   I don't disagree.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Of all those days, the day I didn't bring my Snapchats' medicals in and I couldn't be
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   wearing them now and now in the head.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   How do you feel when you wear them?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Like a dick?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Well, like a schmuck.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Like a trendy dork.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I don't want to start at something.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   You know I wore them to Vegas because I was just curious what the reaction would be.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   And of course Vegas is camera shy to some degree.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   When you get to Vegas now they even have ads that say let's keep what happens in Vegas
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   here.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Let's not share it too much.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   But nobody knew what they were.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   So only we hipsters and Snapchat folks and tech people.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   We hipsters.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Greg ops out.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Right.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   I know what they are.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Even the waitress at the restaurant and I'm like like taking pictures of her.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   She said what are you doing?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   What are those?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And I had to explain what they were to her.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And I think she was probably somewhat uncomfortable.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.440]   Is maybe the difference that the Google Glass was attempting to be very, it almost looked
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.000]   Euro or intellectual with this.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   That's what Greg is saying.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And then the Snapchat's are goofy.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.120]   Well partly it's also that they cost $1,500.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.480]   So that's kind of, it was a little pretentious to wear them because it was a statement I'm
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480]   willing to spend $1,500.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.800]   They were trying to attract content creators and experimenters and people like that.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.480]   It was an experiment they were upfront about it and said this is a trial.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   They said that.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   They're going to try it.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   Because they didn't know what to do with it.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   They had technology, they didn't know what the application was.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   It was so new that they...
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   What happened to the rumor that they're going to keep making this?
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480]   They are doing it.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.480]   They're going to work, it's probably going to come out for enterprise.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.480]   It's going to be a real product.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   It's not though.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   Augmented reality or virtual reality.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.480]   It's just a screen over your eyebrow.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   It can be augmented reality if the applications are going to be.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480]   Heads up.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.980]   Heads up would be superimposed on what you're looking at.
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.960]   It's heads up literally where you have to look up.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.560]   So it's like you have a little monitor right here.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.480]   For manufacturing it'll be augmented reality.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.640]   People will be using machines and the instructions and things.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.840]   See that, I'm excited about it.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.120]   I think augmented reality where it is superimposed.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.120]   It is a heads up display.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   They're coming out today using Google Glass for health and telemedicine.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.160]   It's like a reference manual that's there.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.280]   That's where I fundamentally disagree with what you're saying, Greg, that this is going
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.080]   to be a build and add on to your specs.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   Do you want polarized?
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.560]   Do you want sunglasses that go with it with that prescription?
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.720]   Do you want smart?
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.360]   I'm still not seeing a regular human use case.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360]   Oh, I am.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   It's notifications.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360]   Really?
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   So there's no camera.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   There's no camera.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   That's the thing.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   There's no camera.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.360]   What?
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   That's real.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.320]   I walk around and I don't know who I'm looking at.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   I don't know.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   I know I worked with you.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   I can't remember your name.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.320]   It pops up your name.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   Some seminal.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   That doesn't exist.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.160]   You just call me Greg if you had had.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.000]   I think it exists.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.440]   I think it's completely doable.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.560]   They've turned off as far as Google has that capability.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.880]   But Google has turned it off because of the creep factor.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.680]   That's the biggest problem, in my opinion, with Google Glass.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   Exactly.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   It's a camera.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   Yes.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.480]   Without a camera, it's just you have it's informational.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.000]   So if you think about we're entering this world of artificial intelligence virtual assistants
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.520]   where you can have a really actually smart and useful Siri, Cortana, etc.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.040]   Not supposed to say those words.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   Imagine when you're Alexa.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.080]   Don't say that.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:48.520]   So imagine when you have real preemptive, you're walking down the street and says, "Hey,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.600]   you should be interested in this.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.280]   I know that you care about this sort of thing."
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.440]   And just a little subtle notification that other people can't see.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.400]   Meanwhile, you're wearing ordinary glasses.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   I think that's really what people are.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   I would love that.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.200]   At least how might I disagree with that.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.080]   Most people here have an Apple Watch.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.200]   My visualization is you take the Apple Watch and put it on the inside of the glasses as
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.280]   something that you can see as you're moving around instead of having to wristwatch it.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   Then that's loosely where I see the progression going is down that direction.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.800]   And that's why I think it's very credible that the Scobull story, that Apple might be
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   interested in doing this.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.600]   I don't know if they're doing it with Zeiss, whatever.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   They're doing it with all of them.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   That's why I would guess.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.720]   Big company is talking to everybody who makes components for this type of stuff.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.280]   They're talking to all of them all the time.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.280]   And so it's meaningless to say they're doing it because of course they are.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.280]   Because they're talking to...
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.880]   Because they're talking, they're going to have meetings or whatever.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.480]   Nothing's going to come of 90% of it.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.480]   Two people could have said now at least twice.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:44.080]   We're meaningfully like we're very interested in AR.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.960]   Well, but I think that that's him putting a little flag in the sand saying, "We want
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.960]   to claim this."
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.040]   And people are looking at Apple saying, "Look, you got nothing.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.520]   You got no VR.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.040]   Siri is a weight lagging way behind everybody else's product.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.040]   What are you doing besides coming out with watch bands?"
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.400]   And I think this is Tim saying, "No, no.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.560]   We're doing something.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.560]   We just...
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.120]   As typical Apple, we're not going to tell you anything until we have."
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.440]   And I think it's very credible because of what you said, that this would fit into their
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.440]   line.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.960]   By the way, somebody's pointed out, I think we talked about our Mac break.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.560]   The AirPods could have a similar augmented...
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.160]   Well, see, but this is another thing.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.800]   People would love for people to be able to wear AirPods every waking moment.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   All the time.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   But you can't.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   The batteries don't last long enough.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   They're too weird looking.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.760]   But glasses, through bone conduction, can give you audio in a device that only has to
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.480]   be charged once a week.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.520]   And since you've already got this smarts and the intelligence and the battery and all
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.320]   that stuff in the glasses, people are going to want a little visual cue to go with the
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   audio.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.440]   But think about the production challenges here.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.280]   Glasses have to be fitted to every single person.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.800]   You can't produce one product.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   They already are.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.760]   But it exists already.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.760]   The whole system of measuring eyes.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.000]   Couldn't you imagine something that goes in the frame that is...
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.560]   Yes, you could.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.520]   But now you've got to produce an outlet which can customize for every human head.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.680]   Do you want round frames?
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   Do you want square frames?
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680]   You want clear?
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680]   Do you've got women?
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   Do you've got men?
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   You've got children?
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.680]   How does that work?
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680]   How does that act?
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   It's just a question of having something they could grab.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   And Apple is not about customization.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   Apple is about producing one.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   Apple.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   Apple gets and we shove it in.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   Apple's not going to be the company that does this.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.680]   You have AirPods.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   There's no EarPods.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.920]   There's no ability to have a soft row or an over ear.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:22.920]   You can't have headphones.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   AirPods are.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   But they are.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   This is the only choice you get.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920]   And that's Apple.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920]   And it's like it if you don't.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.360]   You know, Apple is not about customization.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.560]   It is about personalization of the experience in software.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.680]   It is not about customization of the hardware.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.480]   So for Apple to do glasses would require a fundamental shift in its corporate operations.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.640]   And that is not something it's likely to achieve.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.120]   They make clip-ons.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.160]   Well, this is where these Luxodica comes in because they...
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160]   I've got glasses.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.760]   They're actually manufactured in regional locations.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.080]   So when you go to the optometrist and you get your glasses made, they're actually made
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   in local region.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.720]   The machines are fully robotic.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.520]   And your order goes off into an area usually within about 500 miles of where your optometrist
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520]   is.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.120]   And they're manufactured on the spot and then shipped to your location, popped into the
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   lenses.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.120]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.560]   And so in theory, this Fresnel effect could be something that could be, you know, a base
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.200]   lens is produced in a factory overseas, shipped to the local location.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.120]   And then it's actually customized for the person that's popped into the frame that you
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   choose.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.600]   And maybe the frames got switchable components inside.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   Well, there you go.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   You just have to have.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.840]   But I think that that's a decade away.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.960]   Oh, a decade away.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   Easily.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.600]   The material science that you need to carry a battery in here.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.320]   Isn't there also a case to be made that Apple is just going to scattershot do everything
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.520]   they can with everyone on every technology to try and figure out what they can get into?
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.880]   I do think they're going to have to support it from a software thing.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.400]   I mean, if people start switching to Android so they can have the new smart glasses from
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.960]   their optometrist, then they will have to do something.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.520]   I think that there's something, I'm sure they're looking at it and considering it and wondering
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.520]   about it.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.480]   You talked about batteries, talked to a startup in San Francisco, a tiny startup called View.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.920]   And they're getting around all these issues.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.400]   They have good audio through bone conduction.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.520]   They have batteries on both side or no, they have battery on one side, the electronics on
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520]   the other side.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.160]   And they're using lights and blinking lights and things off in the corner that alert you
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   and you can customize it.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.560]   Green means your wife is calling.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.800]   That sort of thing.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.160]   And their batteries last for a week and so on.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:25.880]   They're not projecting a screen, but you can easily see how notifications with screen,
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.880]   you know, visual element could be optimized and customized to give you at least a couple
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.040]   of days of battery life in today, we're using today's battery technology.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.800]   And again, somebody's going to figure this out.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.840]   Apple has a big advantage.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.640]   They have a rabid fan base that's willing to spend a lot of money.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.960]   I don't think this Apple Watch would go anywhere if it had been from Samsung.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.560]   In fact, it hasn't from Samsung.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.800]   So but Apple could make a fairly expensive product that they could get early adopters.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.160]   What I find interesting, I don't think Apple will own this space ever, but I think Apple
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.800]   wants to be in this space.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.360]   Apple doesn't do partnerships well.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.640]   So what I'm trying to say is that to perhaps trying to say indirectly is Apple needs to
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   partner with other people to deliver those.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.240]   And that will buy, or buy Carl Zeiss.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   Yeah, that ain't going to happen.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.520]   Apple Zeiss is only one optical supplier, one of about 10, right?
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.560]   And not even the biggest.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   So and you've got to know.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.560]   The other ones are two and fifty pounds.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.440]   I don't see these as roadblocks, but I do think that Apple is a little bit behind in
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.880]   so many of the other technologies that are going to be required to make this thing succeed.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.760]   And we are seeing a convergence and we're seeing amazing voices clearly.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.600]   One of the next big things, I would argue that that artificial intelligence machine
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:41.960]   learning voice and augmented reality are kind of the next big three things.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.760]   Yep, which is interesting because they've been here for coming as the next big thing
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   for over a decade.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.200]   Well, that is your decade.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   Transforming it.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.880]   We are making this progress.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.120]   And we're in the hockey stick, I think.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   We're starting to get on.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.120]   Yeah, it's at the tipping point.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120]   For sure.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.280]   I don't buy it with AR and VR.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   I see VR in gaming.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   I see AR in the history.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.600]   VR I'm not excited about.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.600]   I really think it's AR.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.040]   A VR only to the extent that it's in using conjunction with AR.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   There'll be niche use cases.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.560]   Yeah, and people run around and go, "Oh, but it works for..."
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560]   Yeah, gaming is great.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.000]   But I don't think you want to walk around town with a VR.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.760]   I can't help being a consumer reporter and thinking of these through that lens, how
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.880]   it's unintended, and that's where I see...
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.120]   But look at how unexpected the A word echo, well, I shouldn't say I don't want to do a
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.120]   command.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.120]   Yeah, it goes surprised us, but it worked.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.120]   It worked.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.520]   And for consumers, it worked.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   And this is...
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.000]   We don't know the sales.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Well, I do.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   But applause.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.520]   And Amazon voice controlled device in their home have been shown to have 10% higher purchases
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.520]   from Amazon.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   Of course, well done.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520]   I do.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.520]   I just bought batteries that way.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   I just bought batteries.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   And I do that all the time.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   It's frictionless.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:52.080]   I've shown my favorite events of the year, and I'm actually moderating a series of panels
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.840]   in its week after next, the Virtual Assistant Summit in San Francisco.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   Oh, how fun.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.520]   And this is for the people who are the movers and shakers who are actually building this
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.520]   stuff.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.520]   All the heavy hitters are there.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.680]   It's an amazing conference.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.640]   And the progress you see year after year is just phenomenal.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:11.760]   The application of artificial intelligence last year, a tiny little woman from Google
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.160]   got up on stage and told us how smart reply works in inbox and in aloe.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.920]   Is she going to be in the Google home?
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.560]   How can I say she's going to be in there?
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:25.560]   And she talked for like a half an hour about how the AI behind that e-to is mind blowing.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.640]   You know, I was just talking about the radio show.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.680]   Somebody said, well, I want to tag all my photos and is there a software that'll do that?
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.080]   I said, just upload it to Google.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.240]   Google's amazing.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.240]   You can.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.720]   I mean, it's one thing to say, OK, give me pictures of Paris.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   That's easy to do.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.720]   You've got GPS.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.120]   You've got landmarks.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.880]   But try it with dogs.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.240]   It will find not only, well, if any breed of dog.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.760]   Now, that's I think a very big challenge for any intelligence because, you know, a
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.040]   Doberman picture doesn't look anything like a shitsu.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.440]   And yet it knows that both their dogs.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.880]   It's an amazing step forward in artificial intelligence or machine learning.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.840]   It detects different types of food.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.720]   You can say, you know, show me burgers, show me pizza, show me there's some unbelievable
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   stuff.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   So I feel like huge progress is being made.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.880]   It is not being made in Apple as far as I can tell.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.640]   You never know because Apple's a black box.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   Apple's actually got amazing AI too.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.400]   Apple's got amazing AI, but it doesn't have the data pool.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.440]   Well, this is the thing about an attack.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:28.120]   Amazon has been seeding the point of the echo is to see that out there to get collecting
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   data.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.760]   It was never about selling products.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.360]   It was about collecting data to build a name.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360]   I would argue it's both.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   Why not?
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   It doesn't have to be one, right?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.440]   But it's not explicitly just most people have too much of a narrow focus on ads to
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440]   sale.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.240]   It's a wonderful synergy because we're making 10% more on these guys and they're given
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   us data.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   But Google's done this historically.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   Google's always done this.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.920]   I guarantee you that's why Google Photos is free and they're encouraging you to upload
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   pictures.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.800]   They're building a database of machine learning.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.240]   It's why Google, Google 4-1-1, they even said that we're collecting voice samples.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.360]   That's why there's no artificial intelligence startups below a billion dollars.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.240]   Because you have to have the data and the way you get the data is to tap into.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.760]   We have been in this industry for the last few decades.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.080]   We've been in a position where somebody could start something in a garage and really build
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   a business.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.560]   We are rapidly getting to the point where you can't be a Facebook, you couldn't be a
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:23.480]   Google, you can't be a machine intelligence company because it requires too much to get
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   started.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   We've kind of gone back to that all day.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.120]   We're already at the point where Google's giving away email just to get a data lake.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.120]   Just to get the data.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   Just to get the data.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.800]   For a while academics were leaving the university and forming little startups for AI and stuff
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   like that.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.280]   But all the Silicon Valley companies have bought them up especially.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.280]   That's all you can hope for.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   DeepMind, Google bought DeepMind which is a name.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.840]   The reason that those guys got bought up was because they can't monetize because they
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.280]   don't have enough data to artificially customize.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.280]   Absolutely.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.280]   But there's a...
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.280]   One of the weirdest problems.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.280]   That sounded good to me.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.280]   I believe you said it with authority.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.280]   That's the important thing.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.960]   It didn't help us with the bombs.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.360]   Always certain sometimes right.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   That's my major.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.160]   Did you see the story that DeepMind, you know, DeepMind won the Go champion?
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   Yes.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.440]   But what DeepMind, what Google has been doing without announcement is unleashing DeepMind
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:17.200]   against real players all over the world particularly in China and Japan where Go is played.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.720]   And I guess people didn't know that they were playing DeepMind.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.800]   They thought they were playing a real Go master.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:29.120]   It has now beaten the 50 top Go players in just complete dominance.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.200]   So you could say when it beat Lisa at all who was a great player, well, but that was
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   one guy.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.440]   It was tuned to beat his style, et cetera.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.000]   DeepMind and AlphaGo are getting better and better.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.400]   And this is the thing that people...
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.360]   In my opinion, Google's huge advantage and the thing that should scare people because
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   yeah.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.960]   I think they are farther ahead than maybe even.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.680]   This is a product of machine learning.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.400]   So this isn't something they've programmed it to do.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.480]   They program it to learn how to play Go.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.600]   And every time it beats one of these masters, it gets better.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.800]   And it's also the Go masters are saying it's transforming the game.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.040]   It's playing in a way that no humans have ever thought to play.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.080]   And it's sort of welcoming their eyes to new ideas.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.640]   So at the technology level, you're right.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.840]   So let me flip this back into the other spaces.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.160]   The trouble that Google has is monetizing this.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.120]   Apple takes whatever it's got and monetizes it like nobody else does and has this massive
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.680]   money lake to dig it out of any hole.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.280]   Google's got all these great technologies, but they struggle to monetize them.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.440]   And in fact, of late Ruth Porat, their new CFO, has been starting to cut off alphabet
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:37.640]   projects and force others to lay off people because it doesn't seem like Google's running
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   out of money.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.640]   No, but there is a bit of technical...
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.040]   Well, there always has to be a banner I have to prune.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.040]   It's rationalization.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.960]   They have to rationalize and focus.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.000]   More wood behind less arrows.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.720]   But so you're right.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.840]   I think Google does have better technology, but it doesn't have a process for monetizing
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.120]   that technology.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.760]   And that's what Google needs to work on in the next...
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.560]   It's like Xerox Park, where there was a great book Xerox invented the world and lost
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.360]   anyway because they didn't...
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360]   Apple monetize.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360]   Look at the Google cars.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.120]   Google was way ahead of everybody else.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120]   And now all of a sudden...
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   Waymo.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.560]   Now they're waymo ahead of everybody else.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   Oh!
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   The rename.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.840]   Actually, I do want to talk about autonomous vehicles because that was another big story.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.880]   It's going on right now, the Detroit Auto Show.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.640]   I found that the news from there more interesting than CES.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   Maybe.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   That was definitely a lot more talk.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.760]   Do you love that new Volkswagen van?
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.760]   The throwback?
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.400]   Yeah, the throwback van.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   It's a concept I think.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   I don't think it's real.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.760]   It's yet another throwback van from VW that will never see the market.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.760]   It's always good to go back to the past.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.760]   Yes.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.760]   Especially if the present has this whole thing with the...

[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.760]   We've got a great panel having fun.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:01.760]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:06.760]   Greg Ferro is here from the packet pushers network packet pushers.net from GMA.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:08.760]   Good morning, America.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.760]   Becky Worley, who's up at 4 a.m.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:14.760]   Almost every morning talking to America and her jammies.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   I'm in the bottom.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   You do it from the last season.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   You do it from your house sometimes.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.760]   Not anymore.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:20.760]   I go into the cemetery.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.760]   Oh, the fee's awful.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   I like it better.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.760]   There's no traffic at that hour, too.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:26.760]   There's no traffic.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.760]   I don't have to manage all the...
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   Oh, gosh.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   Well, it's a better quality, too.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   It's better quality.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.760]   I don't have to be the technician, cameraman, and audio person.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.760]   Free coffee.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.760]   Right?
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.760]   Actually, they have little chocolates in the lobby.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.760]   And every time I finish my live shots, I take one piece of chocolate.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.760]   Just one.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   Just one.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.760]   But do you know what I think of when the alarm goes off at 2.30 a.m.?
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.760]   I can't wait to get the chocolate.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   Chocolate.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:48.760]   Oh.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.760]   It's amazing the power of small rewards.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.760]   That's right.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   That's like a mouse-try-the-box.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   And for me, it's a pillow.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.760]   I wake up at 2.30 in the morning.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:56.760]   I think of my pillow.
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   What the hell?
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   Whatever happened to my pillow.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.760]   What is this giant marshmallow I dreamed about that I ate?
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.760]   Those aren't pillows.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   Here we know the joke.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   Also, Mike Elgin.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   For him to get up pretty early in the morning to fool her on a joke.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   She knows them all.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.760]   She knows them all.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   Our show today brought to you by the best solution for people who love magazines.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.760]   I still love magazines.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.760]   Almost every month there is a great opportunity to get a little bit of a joke.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:25.240]   Almost every month there is a great article in Rolling Stone or Vanity Fair or Atlantic
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.240]   or the National Geographic or the New Yorker.
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.760]   An article I'm dying to read, I can't always read online.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.760]   A lot of times I can't read online.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:34.760]   If it's National Geographic, I want to see the pictures, the photos.
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:40.000]   Well, now I can get it all on my iPad, on my iPhone, on my Android device with texture.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.760]   I don't have to get the expensive news stand edition.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:47.760]   I don't have to worry about cluttering my house, piling up magazines on my coffee table.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:53.240]   The texture gets more than 200 of the best magazines in the world and delivers them right
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.360]   to your iPad where you can read them.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.920]   It's just like reading the actual magazine.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.320]   You have all the same pages.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.680]   You turn the page.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:06.320]   There's bonus features that you can't get in a magazine like video and many of these.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.200]   It's very affordable, much cheaper than buying a magazine or subscribing and you just don't
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   have the clutter.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.680]   Plus, because you're going to get so many magazines and textures searchable, you can
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:22.880]   find so much stuff, find new magazines, new articles, back issues are there as well,
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.880]   of course.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.280]   Now, texture is normally $9.99 a month, which is really a great deal.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.880]   That's the cost of two magazines in the news stand.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.760]   I like to take the sex quizzes and Cosmo.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.640]   I don't know about you, but that's just fun for you.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   I always fail them.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   Almost always.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.640]   I'm trying to.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.320]   One day I'll pass.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.480]   But that's, see, I'm not going to buy Cosmo for that, but it's fun when you have it.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:45.480]   Or people magazine, you know, it's fun when you have it.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.560]   It's a great offer for the cartoons, although everybody should read that cover to cover
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   anyway.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.560]   I love the New Yorker.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.560]   And this is a great way to get it.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.400]   You don't need to sub-fast company, which has some of the most brilliant writers.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.400]   Great writers.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.400]   Brilliant.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.400]   You're a great, nice, Elgin.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.400]   And Mike, Elgin there.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   Oh, gosh.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400]   Cooking light.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400]   I love it.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.400]   Anyway, here's the deal.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   We're going to get you a 14-day free trial.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.400]   Why subscribe to a couple of magazines?
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.160]   And you can have them all on your smartphone or tablet.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.640]   I favorite the magazines I want.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.040]   They automatically download.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:17.320]   So even if I'm disconnected in the cabin somewhere, I can read my favorite magazines.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.000]   Texture is giving you a free trial for two weeks when you go to texture.com/twit.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.280]   Texture, T-E-X-T-U-R-E.com, just like text in a magazine.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.840]   I don't know what the U-R-E is like.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.760]   Texture.com/twit, two weeks free right now.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   We had a fun week.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   We had a lot of good stuff.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.760]   Specials from CES.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.680]   And well, I'll tell you what.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680]   Take a look.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.600]   Previously on Twit.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.440]   Megan and I teased on this very show that someday we would totally switch phones for
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440]   a month.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.320]   I sent it to Chinese so that it's even more complicated.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320]   We're not great.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.120]   You really sent me up for success here.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.040]   Thanks a lot, Megan.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.040]   Home Theater Geeks.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.200]   Hey there, Scott Wilkinson here, the Home Theater Geek.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.800]   This week I'm roaming the floor at CES 2017.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.680]   We developed a technology that uses little actuators that vibrate the panel and make
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.080]   basically a stereo speaker system.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.240]   And the voice comes from the screen.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240]   Stop the screen!
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.040]   It's not from below or from the sides.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.480]   The new screen savers.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.040]   This is the bridge.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.680]   Mixed reality heads up for the iPhone.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.320]   What's new and special about it is you actually can map your environments and then do AR
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.520]   or mixed reality where you bring characters or whatever in the world with you.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.520]   Don't go in there now.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.520]   It's a fake!
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.520]   It's a trap!
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.520]   That's so cool!
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.520]   You put a hole in our wall.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.520]   That is freaking cool!
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.520]   To it.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   Now, where did I put my iPhone?
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.520]   Silver lining is hopefully by the end of this adventure.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:53.520]   We will embrace you back with our green Android arms and we will have converted Miss Moroni.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:59.800]   One would think, however, I have noticed ever since I've started with iOS that I'm really
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.800]   popular here at work.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.800]   We stand around and talk about what you can do with your phone.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.800]   It's really cool!
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]   Oh Lord.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   That's actually fun.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.440]   For a month, Jason and Megan are exchanging.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.120]   So Jason, host of all about Androids using an iPhone and Megan, host of iOS today, is
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.360]   using an Android phone.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.360]   She's using a Pixel.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.080]   And it's really interesting that watch.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.480]   She seems to be hating it more than you would think.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.400]   It's a bit of a struggle because Android is a big learning curve, frankly, much more so
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   than the iPhone.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.840]   So I think she's struggling a little bit with it.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   I love Android.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.040]   I think the Pixel is an amazing phone.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.240]   I think the real lesson, people always bash the other platform, but a lot of that is just
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.480]   you're just using the way your own platform is and you try to use it and it doesn't work.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.480]   It doesn't seem intuitive.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   Phone is phones.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.480]   Phone is as Megan is here with a look at what's to come this week.
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   Megan?
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:59.840]   That just a few of the stories we'll be watching in the week ahead today is Wikipedia Day.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:05.720]   On January 15, 2001, the crowd-sourced encyclopedia launched to the world, which means that today
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.440]   is its 16th birthday and it would like you to buy it a car or give a donation.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.000]   FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler resigns this week.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.160]   He's already given his final speech in which he gave one last plea in support of net neutrality,
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.320]   which will arguably be his greatest legacy.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.600]   This week, we officially say goodbye to six-second video phenomenon, Vine.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.040]   Twitter has confirmed that they will shut it down on January 19 and convert it to the
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.040]   Vine camera.
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.960]   That's an app that will let you record Vine videos.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.000]   The Vine community, however, and the social network will be no more.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.240]   Netflix announces earnings after the close of market this Wednesday.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.240]   We'll be watching for revenue, contribution margin, and subscriber growth numbers, which
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.480]   are the big questions for Netflix since they continue to avoid the advertising model.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.640]   Jason Howell and I will cover all of this in a whole lot more all week on Tech News today.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   That's recorded each and every weekday at 4PM Pacific and that is a look at the week
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   ahead.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   Thank you, Megan.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.880]   Monday through Friday, 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern Time.
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.200]   Midnight UTC for Tech News.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:15.760]   Today, I didn't know Wikipedia is celebrating its 16th birthday.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.760]   Wow.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.760]   That's amazing.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.440]   So iPhone is 10 years old this week.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:28.760]   The video game industry began in 1968 with a patent that made TV video games possible.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.520]   Ended up being the Magnavox Odyssey.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   Do you remember that?
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520]   I don't think it was the Odyssey.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.480]   It was a terrible, terrible thing.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   What else?
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.840]   There were big anniversaries this day.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:46.000]   I still think Wikipedia is the most amazing example of what the Internet is capable of.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   It's amazing.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   And broad volunteerism.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.640]   It's the wisdom and idiocy of crowds.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.040]   And then there's Twitter.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.040]   Yes.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.160]   Well, you like Twitter.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.280]   It's so funny how wide the ladies love Twitter.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   The pendulum swings so drastically when I consider Twitter.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.280]   Me too.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:12.680]   There's so much vitriol and yet there's so much freedom and they go so clearly hand-in-hand.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.640]   So I'm a huge Twitter fan because I don't have to put my personal information into it.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:23.040]   Whereas if I go into Facebook or Google or any of the other LinkedIn, I have to overshare
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:27.240]   all of my personal data and quite honestly Microsoft don't link in.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.240]   I don't trust Facebook.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.080]   I don't think anybody trusts Facebook.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.040]   And I've got all sorts of ideas about that.
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.680]   But on Twitter you can be whatever you like.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.440]   Can I share something that scared me this week which was a website that I did not know
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.680]   exist called Family Tree Now?
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.000]   A lot of people shared that with me.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   Holy cow.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   It doesn't have me.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   Yeah, it does.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   No, no, it doesn't.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.240]   It does because I not only did I find you, I found your kids on it.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.040]   It was unbelievable.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:07:03.480]   So this thing is an incredible linkage of databases that will say who your known associates are
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.520]   and your previous addresses.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.480]   I found the address that you and Jennifer lived at back when you lived in San Francisco.
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.320]   I wonder why it didn't find me the last time I used it.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.960]   And what's different about this than some of the other fine people fast and all of those
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:22.280]   sites completely free and actually very elegant in its design.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.880]   I was totally tripped out by how immediate it was.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.680]   I was able to search tons of people.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.040]   Wow, it is really.
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.640]   The stalking on this site is scary.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:33.640]   It's got every address I've ever lived at.
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.640]   You can opt out.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.400]   I'm actually become helpful because I've been quite a place.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.120]   Well, I'll tell you what, it's really interesting.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.120]   I had a, I suddenly.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   This is amazing.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.120]   Where do they get this information?
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.040]   Is this from, this has to be from credit records?
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.960]   I have no idea.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.520]   This is the stuff you would normally pay for.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.960]   You'd have to create a log in at one of these sites and then you would pay for these
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   individual work by before.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.040]   Normally this is the stuff you pay for.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.900]   This is a scary stalking tool.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   You can opt out.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.320]   I opted out on Friday and my information has been removed.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   But just a little anecdote.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.640]   But this is a genealogy site.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   Supposedly.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   But these aren't dead people.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.520]   These are living people.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:15.160]   Now, I sublet my apartment in Seattle in, back in the early 90s.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.200]   The guy stiffed me.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.200]   I sued him in small claims court.
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.080]   He never paid.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.240]   I've been searching for him for 20 years.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   Did you find him?
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.080]   Hired a private investigator.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   Found him on this site.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.240]   He lives 10 miles away from me.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:29.240]   Are you going to go visit him?
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.240]   Search his name on LinkedIn.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.240]   You're 30 in the morning.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.240]   Guess where he works.
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.080]   Guess we'll be getting a garnishment notice from me.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.080]   Wow.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.480]   I have been looking on and off using all of these sites.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.120]   For 20 years and a private investigator.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.880]   And only this found him.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.800]   But now you have to find a new hobby.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.560]   You know, I got a lot of emails from people and I saw a lot of tweets about family tree
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.560]   now.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.040]   And I thought I searched.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.960]   I guess I didn't do it right because you're right.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.400]   I'm just related to 23 and 20 years.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.400]   No.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.400]   No.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   It's a woman in Roseville outside of Sacramento who started this database and has, it's incredibly
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.400]   elegant.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.600]   It's really good.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.920]   Too good.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.640]   And totally free and easy.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   This is scary.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.400]   A lot of information on here and boy, I'm puzzled by where this information is coming
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   from.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.800]   But I think really it's probably just collating information that's been spread around.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.440]   They really don't talk much about the background.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.240]   It just says we like taking services that typically cost money and making them free so
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.680]   everybody can use them.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:32.520]   Some technology veterans used to work at the NSA.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:38.280]   I think it's address based because it like went all the way back to the known associates
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.840]   were like roommates that I'd had at different times or like the.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.880]   Well, that would mean it's credit reporting.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   Those are the credit agencies know all those places.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880]   Maybe.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:51.480]   But how would they get it out of the credit agencies?
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.320]   Probably got it off the hackers.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:55.720]   Because credit agencies are hugely insecure.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.720]   Actually, that's an interesting point.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.320]   Because you just started when collating a bunch of hacks.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.480]   If you just collect a bunch of hack databases, you could probably build a substantial product
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.800]   where web go shopping for.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.040]   Well, that's the thing that scares me about this not being creepy because this is there
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.160]   about us page and it really pretty much doesn't say anything except here's their kitchen.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.600]   It doesn't give an address.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.240]   It's in Roseville, California.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.640]   Where's the board of directors?
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.440]   It says no names of anybody.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:24.120]   Obviously these are real pictures of their ancestors.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.760]   Yet a lot of help that is.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760]   That's it.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   Found us on Google.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   It sounds like the CIA to me.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.360]   But also because there's no sign in because there's no capture, think of how easy this
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.360]   is to scrape.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.400]   You could automate this real quick.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.400]   So that is.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.560]   And why is it free?
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.600]   Well, you do pay if you want more, right?
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:49.200]   They have ads that run that look exactly like records that are part of their own design.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.120]   And you click on it and you don't even realize it's a paid product until you get way deep
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.120]   in it and then they want to charge you.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.040]   And so again, the good thing about it is you can opt out and that did work.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040]   But creepy.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.120]   Well, let me just sign in with Facebook and give them a little more information.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   Oh, that's good.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   Good idea.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   About me.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.120]   Let's just do that.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   Nice.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   Wow.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.120]   Okay.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.480]   So anyways, US only.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.480]   That's the good news.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.760]   It's funny the things we worry about that are we perceive, you know, go.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.840]   Well, everybody's still worried about Google's and our privacy with their reading.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   And they say, just go to this.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.880]   Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.120]   That stuff is out there.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120]   Creepy, right?
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.120]   Facebook.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120]   Let's Facebook class data.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.120]   Although Facebook's got a much, much greater reach, they're actually tracking much more
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120]   metadata about you.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120]   Like they follow you around.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.120]   They actually like cookies in your browser and follow you around.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.440]   And that's why I'm of this strong opinion that Mark Zuckerberg is going to run for
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.920]   president in 2020.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:52.760]   So this is one of my favorite stories that both Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos suddenly
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.440]   woke up one day and said it was that easy.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.440]   We ought to do this.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.480]   Full Tony Stark stuff, right?
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.760]   And what is the conflict of interest if the guy who runs Facebook, who can clearly totally
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.080]   manipulate the election, if he should choose to.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   Yep.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   Runs for president.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.680]   He will be 35 like the month before the filing deadline.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.560]   I mean, it all fits into place and it makes perfect sense.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.040]   And I can even see.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:26.920]   Oh, and by the way, he's going on a 50 state tour to meet people in all 50 states this
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.920]   year.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.440]   On the back of a train, there'll be CEO Facebook in the president.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.880]   Why would everybody want to be president?
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.040]   That's what everybody says when I say this, they say, well, why would you want the
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:38.040]   demotion?
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.040]   Right.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040]   He's already the emperor.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.040]   The world.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.560]   But but it'd be useful to have a two million man army.
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.560]   I don't.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.560]   It'd be great to have an old term.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.560]   Yeah, there's certain things as a private industry.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560]   You don't have nukes.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.560]   You don't have bombs.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.440]   But I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:57.720]   And I don't know Mark Zuckerberg, what what I from what I know about Mark Zuckerberg, by
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.720]   the way, this article is by Nick Bilton, is that he's a do-gooder.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.000]   I think he's a dead.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   I am not of the opinion that he's the evil incarnate of a lot of people.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.240]   I think he wants to.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.560]   He really wants to make the world a better place.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.640]   And I could see and if that what better bully pulpit.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.960]   Can we argue about that?
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.680]   I don't think he's a do-gooder at all.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.000]   So basically his- The man wants to give away his entire fortune.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   Of course.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   Why not?
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   Right.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   Exactly.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   So why how could that not be doing good?
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   Because he stole it from somebody else.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.400]   Money can money can buy you things.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   Okay.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.840]   It can buy you material comforts.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.440]   It can buy you security.
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.480]   It can buy you fun and frivolity.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.560]   It can buy you lots of things.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.920]   And one of the things it can buy you is influence.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:43.520]   And he has enough money 10 times over to buy all the things that money can buy.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.520]   But he doesn't have the money to buy is to have much more influence in how the world
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.120]   works.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.240]   And we all like I like solar power better than other types of things.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.240]   We all have opinions that we want.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.240]   Yeah, you have a pet.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   You know, project.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.240]   Yeah, I'm not so crazy about GMOs.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.040]   I have all these different opinions.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:04.360]   What he's doing is he's promising to take his money and buy the things that currently
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.040]   his money can't buy.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.120]   That is he's going to throw all this money into things so that the world works the way
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.640]   he'd like it to work.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.240]   Whatever that is.
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.920]   And Bill Gates has done a similar thing to that.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.280]   But essentially it's we all saw the matrix or what do men with power want?
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.760]   They want more power.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.440]   So he's spending his billions to put himself in a position to overrule other interests in
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.040]   the world so that his ideas and his views, his desires, win the day.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.880]   Larry Page wanted an island so he wouldn't be regulated.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.880]   He even said it.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880]   He had at Google I/O.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.680]   He said, you know, we need to I want an island.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.200]   I don't know what's in your experience.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.200]   You're talking about Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.680]   But after doing a big speech, anti-Trump speech about building walls, he went to Hawaii
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.680]   and built this big wall.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.640]   No, it was not a big wall.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.720]   It was a wall.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:50.720]   It is a smallish wall to keep out the roof.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.720]   It's 3.5 feet.
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.720]   Right.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.400]   I could climb a 3.5 foot wall.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.280]   And that wall is not comparable at all.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.280]   And I know from firsthand knowledge.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.240]   I think the point you're trying to make, Mike, is that the Silicon Valley hierarchy
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.160]   is so full of itself that it's really easy to go and fix the world.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.720]   So they're going to go and take their billion dollars and they're going to go and shove
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   it down other people's glass.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   I'll go even further.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:14.720]   I think it's the way to do that.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.080]   Because they believe they're the smartest people in the room.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.760]   And most often they lack the empathy of a dead snake.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.760]   That's exactly right.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.400]   They are incredibly foolish individuals.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.400]   They're a rabbit.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.200]   They're capitalist.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:32.880]   Lining their pockets, but they want to couch their aspirations in this like we're saving the
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:33.880]   world.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.240]   The only reason I don't think he's a devil is because I'm somewhat aligned with the things
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.240]   he wants.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.680]   But if you disagreed with them, then I'd be very upset.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680]   Right.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.160]   That's a good point.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.280]   How does that differ from Warren Buffett?
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.640]   Warren Buffett will not run for president.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.560]   I think Mark Zuckerberg is going to run for president.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.760]   But in terms of doing the most good and the most good and the most people, he doesn't
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.320]   have a vision for doing good for people.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.800]   He does get reminded the gates.
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:56.960]   I think Buffett is somewhat humble.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.440]   He doesn't have a vision.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.440]   He doesn't want to impose his vision.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:00.440]   He plays humble well.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440]   I do.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.440]   You nailed it with the description of the Silicon Valley icons.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.800]   They are often the smartest.
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:13.560]   I remember Steve was the smartest person in the room that didn't make them a good person.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:20.120]   But sometimes people who are so smart, they can't see the failings and they believe that
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:23.200]   they are a good person, empathetic and all that stuff.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.440]   They don't understand that they in fact lack that.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.440]   And so I think-
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:28.880]   That's exactly what God has brings it in Trump.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.720]   Well, what's interesting is, and Nick's article says he wants to be emperor is a phrase that's
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.000]   become common among people who've known Mark over the years.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.440]   He points out some other data points.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:46.560]   Remember Mark got religion or at least didn't deny that he was an atheist, right?
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.440]   He says, I believe religion is very important.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.400]   He didn't say I am religious, but that is a checkbox.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.320]   You have to check if you're running for president.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.320]   His sister's-
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.320]   Orthodox.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.800]   He just hired President Campaign's former campaign manager David Pluth to lead policy
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.000]   and advocacy for the Chan Zuckerberg initiative.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.280]   Who's been at Twitter all this time, and so he's been in the private sector.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.680]   He has, as I mentioned, announced he's going to meet people in every state and maybe the
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:22.880]   biggest giveaway when Facebook reorganized so that he could give all this money to the
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.640]   Chan Zuckerberg initiative.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.320]   It was set up in such a way that he could continue to run Facebook even if he took public
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.320]   office.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.320]   Well-
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.200]   So conflict of interest is not the issue one would consider.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.560]   Well, but that's interesting.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.080]   So I think that this is a bell.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:46.040]   They're going to watch President-elect Trump very carefully to see if he can navigate that
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040]   conflict of interest.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:56.880]   Do you perceive Zuckerberg as having an ideological bent at a severe angle to the president-elect?
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.760]   Well, that would be, at least for Bezos and possibly for Zuckerberg, that would also
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.360]   be a stimulus, right?
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.320]   Oh, I never even thought I could do this.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.400]   I don't like what I'm seeing.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.640]   It's about time for the smartest man in the room to run the place.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.200]   Yes, that's what I think is happening.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.040]   That doesn't necessarily mean that the smartest man in the room is the best person in the room.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.960]   No, empathy is more is important.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.760]   Look at, you know, he's thinking I without any help from the Winklevi ushered into existence
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.320]   this magnificent Facebook.
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.120]   And so there's idiots in Washington.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.280]   They don't know what they have come in.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.240]   I'm going to go in there and fix everything.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:39.360]   This is like when Eisenhower went into office, Truman said, "Poor Ike, he's used to the military.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.760]   You give orders and people do it."
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.280]   He's like, "Here, when you're president, it's almost impossible to get anybody to do anything."
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.600]   No, and I love that.
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.680]   That's Obama said that, and I've forgotten who else said that the power of the presidency
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:53.840]   is merely the power to persuade.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.160]   But I don't think people like Zuckerberg or Bezos are thinking that way.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160]   I don't know if he's...
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160]   He's a held company.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.480]   I think you feel hamstrung all the time by the responsibilities of the shareholders.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.480]   You've got a bullshard.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.920]   You've got, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.320]   But those things exist for good reason.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.640]   So if you cast your mind back to Victorian era politics, say around the 17th and 18th
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:17.080]   century, when the incredibly wealthy people who'd built up enormous wealth on the backs
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.360]   of slaves or trade or exploitation of the Far East or India or the colonies down in Africa
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.080]   and stuff like that, and then suddenly they developed a conscience and started to invest
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.240]   their money in making life good for their workers.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:36.360]   So, for example, in England, and during that Victorian era, the reason that they started
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:41.520]   to introduce school meals was not because they wanted to be good for the children.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.920]   What they actually were concerned about was one that the children were starving by the
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.640]   time they were growing up too small.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.840]   Yeah, they're not good workers.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840]   They're not good workers.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.760]   And they're also not good army, not good soldiers because they're not physically strong.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.360]   And they literally instituted feeding of the poor as a way to ensure the perpetuation
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.040]   of their positions of privilege.
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.040]   I see it.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.600]   But clothes clothed in generosity.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.920]   Now, what we're seeing is massive wealth to storch your perception of reality, I think.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.520]   The rich are not like you and me.
[01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.760]   Well, they can do anything.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:16.120]   So if you could do anything, wouldn't, and you were in a time where you felt afraid for
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:22.520]   your child, your child of color, your wife whose public health is her main initiative
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:29.480]   and you see the ACA being cut away, wouldn't you choose to do anything to counter what
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.480]   you're seeing as the erosion of things you're looking at?
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.000]   No, I've got to my Hawaiian island build a higher wall.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.720]   That's you.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.480]   You don't have dothraki death meals when you watch Game of Thrones.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   Not every night.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.000]   Apparently, that's what marked it.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.280]   So show a hands.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.480]   Who would vote for Mark Zuckerberg as president?
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.480]   Against whom?
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.480]   It would depend on...
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.480]   Oh, against whom?
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.480]   That's a difficult...
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.480]   It depends on what...
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:50.480]   Against Jeff Bezos?
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.840]   Yeah, I'd vote for Zuckerberg over Bezos.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:55.840]   Really?
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.400]   Because Jeff Bezos is a megalomaniac.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.400]   He really lacks empathy.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   That's not why I wouldn't vote for him.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:06.840]   It's more that I see him as such a capitalist, more so than Zuckerberg.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.280]   And I don't want to hear him laughing on TV.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.280]   He thinks it's very...
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.280]   He thinks it's very different.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.280]   So I've grown up...
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:16.600]   I grew up in Australia, which is very much a social democracy, where there's a public safety
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.040]   net and a very substantial free health care, unemployment benefits and so forth and so
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040]   it.
[01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.360]   And I now live in the UK, again, social health care, very fundamental.
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.400]   I do not work in the US because there is no fundamental human rights here.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.040]   In terms of no public health care, there's no safety net.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.960]   If you fall out of the system, let's say...
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.480]   This is a country where you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480]   Yes.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.480]   It's up to you to achieve...
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.480]   This is the only country...
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.480]   And just don't injure yourself while you're pulling the bootstraps.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480]   I take your...
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.480]   In fact...
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.480]   If you don't want to take your...
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.720]   I know, I love that window.
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.720]   I love that window.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.840]   I mean, this is the only country in the world where medical bankruptcy is a thing.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:51.840]   So the most...
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.840]   We are the only country?
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840]   Yep.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840]   Where you can actually...
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.480]   I think we're a number one in medical bankruptcy.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.040]   We are exemplary.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.040]   That's right.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.560]   We have amazing medical bankruptcy lawyers.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560]   Amazing.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.080]   And that helps so much.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.720]   I mean, I'm a bit of a believer in this.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.680]   I'm not a big fan of the universal basic income.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.320]   I think there's so many flaws in it.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.320]   That's insanity.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.800]   No, there are reasons...
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.400]   When AI is doing all the work, then we've got to figure out some way for people to eat.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:23.280]   So the basic premise behind unemployment benefits or universal basic income is if you don't
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.880]   feed the people and keep them in their houses and keep them happy...
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.800]   They make terrible soldiers.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.720]   They come out of the houses and start causing riots.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720]   They revote.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.720]   Yes.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.720]   And they revolt and you end up with the peasant uprisings of the...
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.640]   The truth is it's very clear that the history of government is the history of trying to
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640]   prevent peasant uprising.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   Pretty much.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.640]   Yes.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.000]   And so if you don't start thinking about...
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Like we're talking, I was reading a research article this week.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.840]   I'll try and find the notes and get into the show notes.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.680]   You're predicting that something like 40% of middle management jobs will disappear in
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.920]   the next 10 years through machine learning and AI.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.920]   So particularly imagine...
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.920]   Let me give you a scenario.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.920]   But every job below that or a great deal of the jobs below that will also disappear.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.080]   Forget middle management.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.080]   Who's going to drive?
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.080]   Nobody.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.080]   Who's going to be a cashier?
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.080]   The middle management has typically been safe.
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   Right?
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.080]   They sit in a...
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   What they're saying now is...
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080]   First people, I fire as a middle manager.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.080]   Okay.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.080]   I've had the medical question for you.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.080]   The worst.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   No, do anything.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.080]   You've been the teacher and a listener.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.080]   I'm totally reviewed.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.760]   So they're talking now about artificial intelligence which will conduct the quarterly
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.760]   review.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.760]   Oh, God.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   So you will literally have a voice...
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.760]   It's time for your performance ratings.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   Come to my...
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760]   I think that's right.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.760]   I think that's right.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.720]   People already have software that knows who's going to quit and when.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.720]   Exactly.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.160]   So when I went up to Amazon to talk to them about this new concept they have for stores
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.920]   that have no cashiers.
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.400]   You walk in, you get your stuff, sensors tell them...
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   They have that.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:39.400]   It's called shoplifting.
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:40.400]   That's what I said.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400]   That's amazing technology that they're going to exist.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.400]   Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:48.840]   And that as many people will work in those stores as work in your current seven-line
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:49.840]   services.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:50.840]   Working in security.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.840]   Because they're going to be prepping the food.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.200]   They're going to be doing all the back-end work because what you're going to buy is stuff
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.880]   that's going to eradicate cooking or they're going to be able to allocate all this other
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   resources.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   Rubbish.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.880]   I was...
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.880]   They're not an archer.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.560]   I was amazed that they were trying to spin this.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.240]   How are you even thinking?
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.800]   So the first store might come out with all that great and then straight after that someone
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:16.160]   would be an accountant looking at the bottom line going, "You know, if we got rid of all
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:21.400]   those high cost goods, we could just increase our profit margin and... Boom!"
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.680]   That sounds like Adar-Adar rubbish.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680]   Here's one other question.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.680]   They're filling themselves.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:31.720]   What would you tell your kids, what do you tell your kids, that they should pursue going
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:35.040]   forward so that they can survive in this world?
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.320]   I think it would be folly for me to try and predict who they will be and who the future
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   will be.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320]   So they're screwed?
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320]   Not much?
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.320]   I think so.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.320]   But that's the whole point, isn't it?
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   We've all figured it out.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   If you...
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.800]   Universal Basic Income, maybe that's... maybe they don't have to work.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.160]   My theory on the online to Universal Basic Income is that there are... you will have vast
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:00.400]   unemployment and those people, if they don't have jobs to take, what do they do for food
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400]   and medical...
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.120]   In most cases, what happens though, at least so far with Universal Basic Income is it eliminates
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.280]   all entitlements.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.960]   So you get a lump sum, but you're responsible for your healthcare and everything else out
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   of that lump sum.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.840]   Well, in the US, where healthcare is a problematic industry, yes, but in other countries, it would
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840]   not necessarily be.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.720]   Did it basically have that in Alaska?
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.640]   It feels... yes, because they had oil, right?
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.160]   Right, so they got an oil check.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160]   Everybody got a big check.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.160]   How about we're about...
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:33.600]   My fear is that this is a perpetual motion machine because who's providing the money...
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.920]   I mean, what I'm going to spend, give the money to the... I'm going to spend some of my
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:41.480]   income so the corporations can make money so they can give me back my income, but that
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.480]   doesn't...
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   It doesn't work.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:44.480]   There has to be something right because if you ever...
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.480]   It's going to be something...
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:49.560]   If you have an adding value to the system like oil reserves, adding value to the system...
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.560]   Right, look at the right...
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.560]   What's the joy of the...
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:52.560]   What's the joy of the...
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.560]   ...so you're in Ferguson, right?
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.560]   Why did those people start to riot?
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.040]   Fundamentally, it comes down to...
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:57.040]   Poverty.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:58.040]   Poverty.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.120]   Right, so if you don't start thinking about... so if you start to increase...
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.120]   Oh, I agree.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.520]   ...you know, cut jobs at radical levels, you're now going to have vast unemployment.
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.840]   Because people will stuff... if you don't have enough food or don't have enough health
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.200]   care or whatever, then what else is there?
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:17.360]   Anyways, fair to say that fake news and the Comey letter and all that aside, Trump won
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.200]   fundamentally because a lot of people were scared because they didn't see a future.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.120]   Well, it's very difficult to understand social democracy.
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.680]   The idea of that government spending can be...
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:29.680]   Well, stimulus.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.880]   Well, a safety net can keep you...
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:38.240]   Unfortunately, it's, I think, a non-starter than US just because of our national history
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:40.040]   and our personalities.
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:42.320]   How universal basic income works out over time?
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.880]   There's going to be models.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.160]   I mean, how do we get to the current set of economic models that we operate society on
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.160]   today?
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.400]   They've evolved over two or three hundred years.
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.760]   So trying to predict where UBI goes is very, very difficult.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.360]   But we know some form of it will be needed if we start, continue to reduce jobs with
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.360]   tools like Facebook.
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.720]   Look at what Facebook's done for recruiting.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.400]   Look what LinkedIn's done for recruiters.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.160]   And just wiped out vast industries.
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.280]   And there's no more need to place job ads in the local newspaper to find them because
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.320]   you go and find them somewhere else.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:14.800]   So all of that technology that these guys, people in Silicon Valley, get all clever and
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.840]   feel great has actually been destructive to the economy overall.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:21.600]   Yeah, I wrote a comment about this and did a lot of thinking about it.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.000]   And it's like, they talk about disruption.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   Let's disrupt this.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.640]   Let's disrupt that.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:31.040]   Within Silicon Valley circles, disruption feels like something is being fixed.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.240]   But if Silicon Valley disruption sounds like something's being broken.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.320]   So basically somebody is going to have self-driving trucks.
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.440]   Well, there's hundreds of people who own small trucking companies and that disruption
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.720]   means that one thirty year old is going to cross your industry and become a billionaire
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.680]   while you get in the unemployment lines.
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.640]   That's what disruption is to a lot of the world.
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.120]   And I think that has a lot of crazy things.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.560]   Look at Amazon's public cloud.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.160]   We're talking now about Amazon's public cloud AWS is running roughly around about a ten
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.840]   billion dollar run rate.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:01.880]   Depending on who you listen to and what sort of number you use, that's probably destroyed
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.320]   fifty to a hundred billion dollars worth of revenue in the enterprise IT market.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:06.320]   Wow.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320]   It's either a five to ten to one.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.320]   So every dollar...
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.720]   Who is disenfranchised by AWS?
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   Oracle, Cisco, IBM, Google Payback.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.720]   Oh, it could have been a nicer guy.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.200]   But you know, the companies who used to produce software, the companies that used to produce
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:26.840]   computers, that which is done in enterprise IT needed people and sales people.
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:27.840]   Right.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:30.160]   So it's not just companies, it's also headcount of being reduced.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:32.240]   You don't need so many sales people.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.480]   In my grandmother's lifetime, technology changed at a faster pace than any time in history.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:44.440]   In my mother's lifetime, social norms changed at a faster pace than in any time in history.
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:49.240]   And I think that in my lifetime, economics will change at a faster pace than in any time
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.240]   in history.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:51.240]   And that's what we're fundamentally looking at.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   Interesting.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   I would agree with that.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.480]   Wow, you guys are smart.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.480]   I just want the new iPhone.
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.480]   You can have it.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.480]   Nice.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.480]   Can I have it?
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.480]   All right.
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.480]   Lots more to talk about.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.240]   Mike Elgin, Becky Worley, Greg Ferro.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:10.880]   This is a good panel.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.440]   I hope everybody's enjoying this conversation.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.440]   Very, very interesting.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.320]   We've danced around politics.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.600]   I think with real...
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.360]   I'm not a raises age.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.360]   Yes.
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   I hope it's been a raises age.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.360]   Nobody's sickled in showers.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   Oh, there we go.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.840]   Actually, we could talk a little bit about that.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.640]   There's a tech angle to this leaked dossier.
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:32.640]   That's interesting.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:33.640]   I shouldn't say leaked.
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:36.120]   But it's interesting.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:42.080]   For instance, one of the pieces implied that Telegram, the secure messaging service created
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:49.400]   by the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia, Pavel Durov, in fact was cracked by the FBS, the Russian
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.800]   Security Service.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.840]   And that some of the information came from that.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:58.840]   Telegram was quick to deny that they had been hacked, but they've always used their own...
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:03.360]   Roll your own encryption, which has never really been fully vetted.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.680]   In fact, there's a good reason to think it may not be fully secure.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.760]   They had a good explanation for what the...
[01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:14.320]   What they believed the leak was, which had to do with a phone number verification of an
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.560]   account.
[01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:19.640]   But I thought that was very interesting.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:22.640]   I always get a kick out of...
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.640]   Maybe not wanting to say...
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.160]   Telegram anymore for secure messaging.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.160]   Right.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.320]   But you don't know what is secure and what isn't.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:31.960]   I always get a kick out when people say, "Oh, well, the NSA can't crack that and the
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:32.960]   GCSQ can't crack that."
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   We don't know, do we?
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960]   We don't know.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.560]   They exist to crack everything.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:38.560]   And they have...
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.800]   I'm sure that they have access to things, lots of things that we have no idea that they
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   have access to.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:44.800]   Well, here's what we do know.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:47.680]   We know that the math is hard, but we also know that it is solvable, that it's crackable
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.240]   given enough time and horsepower.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:54.960]   And what's the missing piece of that puzzle is how much horsepower the NSA is capable
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   of applying.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:02.400]   So for the current generation of cryptos that we're talking about, 1024 keys, it's generally
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.400]   assumed that that's not crackable with brute force.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.040]   So you can't just feed the key into it at all.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:11.080]   No, it's in fact, until quantum computers come through the broad assumption.
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.080]   It's just not fast enough.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.640]   And I use a 4096-bit queue.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:18.440]   But the challenge was with Telegram was that there is...
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.960]   If at any time you can get the keys, then you can take control of it.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.960]   In this particular situation...
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.280]   It does have some forward secrecy, but it's not perfect forward secrecy.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.200]   Yeah, but this is just a non...
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:33.240]   If you're using public key cryptography and if you can get to the right place, then yes,
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.760]   you can get those keys and you can decode.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760]   You could decode every...
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.080]   But that applies equally to TLS and equally to...
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.080]   Right.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.160]   But there is perfect forward secrecy.
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.160]   There is off the record.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.160]   That's right.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:44.160]   There are technologies, in fact, that's what's cyclical.
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:48.600]   It's only if you implement Telegram in a specific way that it's actually insecure and that is
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:52.360]   by design, insecure because that's the only way that a program can work.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360]   Right.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360]   So it's not like...
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   Signal is still...
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.040]   And now what's interesting is WhatsApp was accused of having a flaw.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:06.080]   Moxie Marlon Spike, who created the OTR protocol used by Open Whisper Systems, the protocol
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:10.960]   used by WhatsApp and Signal, says that was a misunderstanding of how Signal worked.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.800]   And in fact, he does not believe that WhatsApp has a backdoor.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.960]   There is no WhatsApp backdoor, says Moxie Marlon Spike.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.320]   If Moxie says it, then it's going to be true.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   I trust Moxie.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.320]   For my purposes.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:22.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:26.760]   I mean, he knows a lot more than Mortal Man.
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:28.240]   I think so, yes.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:34.520]   So, and I'm sure Steve Gibson will talk about this on security now on Tuesday because...
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.520]   At length, no doubt.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:41.800]   Steve does nothing with gravity.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.360]   But he does it with so much enthusiasm, the whole way through.
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.440]   Yes, and will understand it better by the end.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.440]   Yes.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.120]   Talking about security, you don't want people skimming over the details.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.600]   You want all the details.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.600]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.440]   It's like I would say, you don't want me to be your surgeon.
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.800]   You know, I will leave a tool inside of your body.
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.520]   That's like saying, that's how I feel about it.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.280]   Don't you don't want me to be your security guru?
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.280]   No.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:03.920]   Well, and that was the complaint of Battelleagram is they rolled their own anchor toe and that's
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.920]   not generally...
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:11.040]   That's why everybody basically is moving to open source TLS libraries that have been
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:13.600]   known and tested and tried is because you can't do it yourself.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.600]   Right.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   Well, and even...
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.680]   Much better having one implementation globally where conceptually everybody...
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:20.200]   You know, it's either all or nothing.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.200]   The flip side of that, of course, is if there's a bug in that library, we're all done.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.280]   Great new video from the EFF.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.280]   We've been playing it.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.200]   I asked our staff to throw this in.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.240]   Baratunde Thurston explaining encryption and why it's so important.
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.880]   It's the internet and it's filled with unencrypting...
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.200]   It really is a series of tubes.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.360]   Data that can be targeted by all kinds of eavesdroppers.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.360]   The hacker looks like this.
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.960]   All I need is Wi-Fi and some software and...
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.440]   Nolda Coincer.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:47.760]   I can see everything you're up to.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.400]   The EFF has been protecting your privacy online for over 25 years.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.880]   And now their goal is to encrypt the web.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880]   The whole thing.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:00.760]   Switch every site from insecure HTTP to secure HTTP...
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.320]   That's what you're talking about.
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.320]   The EFF makes all the difference.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.360]   You've ever seen him wear a suit and tie?
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.320]   He really means that's a good looking fella.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:11.240]   The lock lets you know your session is safe.
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:12.240]   Here's the problem.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.240]   We used to call it not every site.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:14.240]   Now it's a large tale.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:17.240]   But the EFF has you held it fundamentally powerful.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.440]   The first is HTTPS everywhere.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.400]   It's a plugin for browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
[01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:28.320]   It encrypts your communication with most major websites.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.080]   So they can't spy on it.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.080]   They being the accurate.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.080]   People with the hacker flip me off.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.080]   That's a little choice.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.080]   This is also good.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.080]   Now this is not lets encrypt.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.080]   It's a similar technology.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.080]   It's a simple size and automates the whole thing.
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.080]   Sounds like it works very similarly.
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:48.080]   It's just like the modern day back service analysis.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.080]   Is this a grind out?
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:50.080]   Yes.
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.080]   The EFF is protected.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.080]   So we've said that in the alright ICU it is.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.080]   It's a tool for deploying lets encrypt certificates.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.080]   So they deploy lets encrypt certificates.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:03.800]   Now lets encrypt is very important because it's actually a conglomerate of big technology
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:04.800]   companies.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.800]   Funding it.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.600]   And it's free and easily implemented.
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.440]   In fact I use lets encrypt a lot of people use lets encrypt.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440]   Yes.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.440]   It's really great.
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.440]   I think so.
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.440]   The only only concern is who's funding it.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.880]   Because once you can get your hands on those private keys you can theoretically decode everything.
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.880]   Oh crap.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:24.800]   Well one thing that lets encrypt does which is interesting is that the key is only good
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.800]   for three months.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.800]   Yes.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.800]   You get a new key every 90 days.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.400]   That's terrific because when you do certificate keys you want to revoke them.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:34.520]   So lets say I gave you a certificate and now I want to revoke that certificate because
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.280]   you're not who you say you are.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:39.360]   So instead of maintaining certificate revocation lists, CRL.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.000]   Which by the way Google has said we don't want to do.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.480]   Fire Mozilla doesn't want to do.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.480]   It's impossible.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.480]   It doesn't work.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.400]   Well what actually would have to happen is your browser every time you connect it to
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.640]   a website you would have to go and check a CRL server to say is this certificate revoked.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.440]   And if it is then you would have to put that round trip time not only have you got to
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.200]   connect to a DNS lookup then connect to the web server and now you've got to do a CRL.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.760]   Well on a mobile phone now you've put your phone down and walked away and no ads can
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.760]   be shown and Google's not making money.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.560]   So you want to get away from CRL.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.280]   So the answer to that is to go for a 30 to 90 day revocation.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   So you just revoke the certificates automatically.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:17.200]   They have an expiry date so at 30 to 90 days they automatically just switch off and that's
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.760]   effectively your revocation.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.780]   What's great about Let's Encrypt and the cert bot is it's automated renewals so you don't
[01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:24.960]   really have to pay any attention.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:30.200]   I have an automated script just every 90 days gets me the new Let's Encrypt.
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:36.400]   So the most common HTTP server software you know Apache, NGINX and Harp proxy and just
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.240]   download what run it on those machines and the crypto keys will just rotate automatically.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240]   Automagically.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.280]   I love seeing Baratundana and a thoot.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:49.480]   And by the way another reason you know to support EFF because they really do in God's
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:50.480]   work.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.880]   I give them a monthly donation.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:37:00.720]   I have monthly donations for Wikipedia, EFF and then a few like ACLU and a few others
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:05.440]   like that because I think we got to support these institutions going forward.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.440]   These are the institutions that are making us safer and making the world a better place.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.240]   Let's take a break real quick more to come in just a moment including the hackers because
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.280]   they're being hacked.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.760]   But this week in tech this week brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:25.120]   Good friends of mine, people who are teaching you the info you need to be a better IT professional
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.760]   or to become an IT professional.
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.000]   This is a great job market.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.240]   I think it's got to be the fastest growing job market of all and so many opportunities.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.760]   So if you're thinking of starting a career in tech in IT or you want to get better at
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.480]   your job that you already have you don't have to go back to school to do it.
[01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:47.400]   The school is the most expensive way to do it and maybe you're a self starter but just
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:49.280]   go into the bookstore and buy in a bunch of books.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.960]   That's a little challenging and expensive.
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:54.200]   ITProTV is the middle way the best way.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:57.480]   Great entertaining engaging content just like Twit.

[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320]   They've got it.
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320]   They've got it.
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320]   They've got the version nine.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.560]   CompTIA's Project Plus certified information systems security professional cyber security
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:37.160]   analyst plus CCNA cyber ops ITIL operational support analysis Microsoft system center and
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:42.280]   also the stuff the day to day stuff that makes you money like Microsoft Office and managing
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.520]   Apple computers things like that.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.280]   You get the virtual machine labs which are awesome.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.640]   You don't have to have a Windows server.
[01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:52.440]   You don't have to have a Windows machine just an HTML5 browser.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:56.440]   You can configure the server, configure the clients and every time I do it I blow it but
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440]   it's easy.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.840]   You just press the reset button, you start over, transcend or practice exams so you can
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.480]   take the test before you take the test.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.520]   That's worth under nine bucks by itself.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.580]   A love IT pro TV and you're going to love it too.

[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.900]   That's the most economical $570 a year.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.880]   That's less than buying the materials let alone go into a technical school.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:30.360]   But if you use our offer code TWIT 30, TWIT 30% off forever for the lifetime of your account.

[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.200]   they're just knocking it out of the park.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:42.880]   Incidentally they are going to be introducing a new membership level beginning February
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:49.160]   first and I think you're going to want to subscribe now because all current premium
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:54.400]   members as of that day will automatically be given the highest membership level.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:01.720]   So effectively you want to lock in this price now do it today.
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.520]   IT pro TV slash TWIT and use the offer code TWIT 30.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:08.640]   We have one of my listeners from the Packet Pushes actually emailed us and what he does
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.720]   is every day he spends one hour watching videos.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:13.720]   It's all it takes.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.480]   And he doesn't sit the exams he doesn't do whatever but what he's doing is learning
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.960]   all the stuff that's around him.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:22.040]   So he's in this particular job but by listening to the videos and watching stuff he's suddenly
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.240]   becoming aware of what all the people around him are doing.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.600]   The value of the test is moot it just helps you get that first job because without the
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.520]   you know you have no way to prove that you can do it.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.360]   He's actually looking for where he wants to go to job.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.160]   You can then upgrade your you know.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.320]   And this is a great way to do it.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:39.600]   Yeah I think it's great.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:45.240]   Celebrate you know the name it's a company that makes a device that law enforcement uses
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:48.120]   to suck the data from your phone.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:54.200]   They also we think may have been the company that sold the hack to the FBI that allowed
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:57.480]   them to get into the Bakersfield iPhone.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:04.680]   They've been hacked which frankly is not good on your resume if you're a security firm.
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:09.600]   According to motherboard which has been doing a great job on tech coverage Joseph Cox writing.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:17.160]   900 motherboard has obtained and validated 900 gigabytes of data from celebrate including
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:25.160]   customer information, databases, technical data about their products and most importantly
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:30.600]   you can use this information to see who's been using their my celebrate domain which
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.640]   is the portal you log into to get new software versions and make sure you've got the latest
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.640]   version.
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:42.480]   Celebrate is widely used by US and federal law enforcement plus according to the hack data
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:47.920]   possibly also with authoritarian regimes in Russia the UAE and Turkey.
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.840]   And family tree net and family.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.680]   Sorry we shouldn't make comments like that.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:54.680]   That's not it was joking.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.080]   It's depressing though isn't it that anybody can be hacked.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:02.560]   Any we don't so we do it show every week we talk to some of these issues we've actually
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.120]   just stopped bothering with breaches because it's pointless.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:06.120]   It's too common.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.760]   It's so common the second thing is there's no impact.
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:15.400]   So look at Yahoo lost a billion accounts over a sustained five year period and yet Verizon
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.000]   still bought them for the value that was agreed.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.800]   So they've gotten away with that.
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.760]   So if that a breach of that magnitude should have had in any reasonable reading of the
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.440]   situation some sort of impact to the company financially.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:30.920]   Here's the good news.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.320]   We don't have to talk about anymore.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.960]   President like Trump has appointed a.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:37.960]   What are you laughing about?
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:43.480]   The mayor of the former mayor of New York as his cyber security adviser Rudy Giuliani.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.520]   Now you may say well Rudy Giuliani what do you know about security.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:51.560]   Oh no he has a company a full service security investigative and crisis management consulting
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.720]   firm called Giuliani security and safety.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.200]   Let's just run over to that website right now.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:01.720]   No site can't be reached.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.640]   The reason is it was a mess.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.720]   He was running a four year old copy of Joomla with Joomla is a comedy of errors with more
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:13.440]   than a dozen known exploits.
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:19.760]   You could I mean it had a publicly look at this is this is Michael Finan who I guess
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.520]   is a security researcher.
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:26.080]   As soon as he heard Giuliani had been appointed to this cyber security job he checked expired
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.040]   SSL certificate doesn't force HTTPS.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:34.600]   Who's CMS login so you can go in there and brute force the login at your leisure.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:35.600]   It uses flash.
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.000]   You know what's probably great about this is he probably puts security company on his
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000]   resume.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000]   Yeah and go away with it.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000]   So now he's there it's fine.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.400]   Use is using version 5.4 PHP.
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:54.600]   So what you're saying about this list of things that are not quite right in his field of expertise
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:04.600]   is that he is one of the better qualified candidates.
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:08.040]   Knowing that this situation was coming so we need a man like that who's going to take
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:10.240]   on some security.
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:13.920]   I doubt that I think I think the thinking seems to be that we get we need to get tough
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:14.920]   on the cyber.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.920]   The cyber and Giuliani is tough.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:21.560]   It was either that or Barron and I think they made the right choice.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.560]   I don't know.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:24.560]   Barron knows the cyber.
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:26.560]   That kid is good.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.760]   Have you heard about Trump's razor?
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:35.600]   It's the it's the maxim that the stupidest explanation is always the right one.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.600]   Any event.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:40.960]   I don't know even where to begin.
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:46.880]   The nation's future president he will be president on Friday his security advisor cyber
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.640]   security advisor the guy.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.640]   Remember Trump really in his press conference blamed the DNC for their lousy security.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.720]   They got hacked because they were insecure.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:01.240]   That's all is now putting his trust into a man who can run a web site.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:06.040]   On the other side of this the sort of that sort of at that sort of level your security
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.440]   chops aren't actually all that relevant.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.880]   What actually matters is your ability to bring people to the table.
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.720]   It's clear that Rudy knows where to go to get the best people to run his web site from
[01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:16.720]   five years ago.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.720]   Can I go back to that point you made about breaches and the idiocy of reporting on them
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.160]   because I really think that there's an opportunity for me to learn from this in conjunction with
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:31.280]   an anecdote I was at the grocery store like a little mom and pop bo-dega kind of place
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.560]   and the guy was asking me about my credit card.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.480]   Did I feel nervous because it was a high limit credit card?
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.480]   I said no I use a service on my phone that lets me see every time a transaction comes
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.560]   through so it doesn't freak me out because if I if something comes through I see it almost
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.560]   immediately.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:51.560]   And he calls his son up did you know about this the man the man and the son says I don't
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.120]   trust it.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:56.800]   And I said well it's owned by Intuit and you know that's a good indicator that it's
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.760]   not a fly by night company says doesn't matter they've all been hacked I don't trust anybody.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.160]   And then at the same time I got in the car and there was an NPR interview going on and
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:11.800]   it was this Russian journalist and she said when you don't trust anything you can't believe
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:12.800]   in anything.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:17.880]   And I just thought that was so interesting this concept of like we don't trust companies
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:24.800]   we don't trust governments we don't trust the security of you know our security services.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.800]   So we're in not just post truth but we're in like what do you believe in that?
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.520]   We're screwed believe or post fundamentals.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:35.880]   So I mean the the breeches thing is just really true to me because I you know I'm continually
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:39.360]   reporting oh this breach that is it's no point talking about the breaches I mean look back
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:45.040]   at target when it got breached how's it share price doing right right up and to the right
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.040]   glory doesn't matter.
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:52.240]   Hotland payment systems you know why there's zero penalty we don't care.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:57.000]   Can I make one other point we pay three percent on all of our credit card purchases that's
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:04.160]   why we don't care because they have the liability that's the unbanked should care they're the
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.840]   ones who's who have more at risk and they're going to be the ones who are going to struggle
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:13.320]   because if you don't have an electronic transaction capability you will be frozen out of the system
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:18.360]   over time and you know the financial Apple pay for example you know this ability to
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.080]   wave your Apple watch it at a coffee shop is really the coolest thing ever right.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:24.080]   So let's face it.
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.040]   But who can afford it right it's you got to buy it right.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.040]   What the coffee or an apple.
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:30.400]   Sorry Paul I guess you could afford the coffee you could afford an apple watch.
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.400]   Yeah no yeah that's right you know if you've got the privilege to own an apple watch and
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:34.400]   an apple watch and an apple watch right.
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:37.880]   Yeah you know you've got to have like two thousand dollars worth of assets to use a
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.160]   wave you'll watch and give by a transaction just like buying online you know as you can
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:44.720]   shop on Amazon provided you've got a six hundred dollar phone or five hundred dollar
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:46.960]   laptop to buy on Amazon it's totally free.
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:55.440]   Hey your data breaches don't just happen at Target they might also happen at Best Buy.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:01.160]   So the Geek Squad now this is an interesting challenging story because no one likes child
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:04.600]   pornography that's a bad thing.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:10.200]   And when you bring your computer to Best Buy and if the technician is going through your
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:16.000]   computer and happens to see child pornography it is their legal requirement to report you
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.200]   to turn you in.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.200]   It's anybody's.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.200]   Anybody's.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.200]   Not just best.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:24.120]   If I'm looking over Greg Ferro's shoulder I notice he's got that film on there I can't.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:27.760]   But if I were able to read his screen I might want to turn him in I don't know what he's
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:28.760]   doing.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:33.840]   But I know but this is where it gets interesting and by the way a court a judge has ruled no
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.920]   the defense can bring this up.
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:41.800]   A California doctor is facing federal charges after his hard drive was flagged by a Geek
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.240]   Squad technician.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:51.600]   But the lawyer in the process of discovery for his defense found the FBI had cultivated
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:59.360]   eight sources in the Geek Squad over a four year period with all of them receiving payment.
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:05.280]   And at that point the judge says well you can pursue this is the Geek Squad an employee
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:12.120]   of a federal agency in which case the search is illegal because it's a warrantless search.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:16.960]   So a private person I can look at your hard drive and it's not a warrantless search.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:21.680]   As a citizen you can report it and it go ahead but it's no false motivation.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:28.040]   But if if that person is being paid by the FBI to look then a warrant is needed.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.960]   I don't know how this is any different I mean I watch all the police procedural dramas they
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:37.640]   all use CIs to go do illegal things all the time and then they get this information through
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:41.560]   the illegal activities of the person they're paying and then they go and they're like well
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.560]   we didn't do it.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:45.840]   We didn't break an enter we didn't do these other things and everybody's like yeah you
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:52.920]   know the right side wins again and it's like this feels to me has the flavor of just something
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:57.720]   that happens in the world generally has now entered the world of technology and privacy
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.960]   and now we're like oh my god this has to be stopped.
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.760]   This happens all the time.
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.320]   So is that issue illegal?
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.560]   It happens in the let me just as a global person somebody who doesn't necessarily just
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:07.560]   live in the US.
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.400]   A citizen of the world.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.720]   Only applies in the US.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.720]   So the US.
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:16.280]   Well that's the whole NSA thing and it's they can gather information about foreign nationals.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:19.760]   No the way the police force works in this country is it works with very little funding
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:25.560]   so the only way to make it stick is to use CIs and to do entrapment and stuff like that.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:29.160]   It's not legal to do that in most other countries in the world it's just the way your legal
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.160]   system works here.
[01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:34.720]   Well entrapment's not I mean I think that that's an overarching assumption.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:38.320]   I mean well abbreviated in general throw it out if he detects it.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.000]   So the point is this guy signed his computer over to Best Buy.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000]   Yes.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.600]   Best Buy found this file in a weird partition that hit the eye.
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.400]   At the eye they had to dig through it.
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.400]   Another reason.
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:50.960]   Doug through the hard drive looking for evidence.
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:51.960]   Looking for evidence.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:52.960]   That's the case.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:53.960]   Best Buy did not receive a payment.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:54.960]   No.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:59.160]   The bounty and that's the question is this is a bounty.
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:02.120]   Or is it a prepayment or is it a bounty.
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:04.240]   And therefore that went to the individual.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:10.760]   So if you did that in other countries, European countries, Asian countries that would be entrapment.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.560]   Right.
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.600]   It's just not allowed.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.840]   You can report that as a citizen's arrest but the way that so for example in this country
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:23.040]   when you let's say you get arrested as a drug on a drug offense a minor drug offense.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.240]   The police will make it a condition for you.
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:26.240]   They will let you off.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:30.920]   They'll cut you a deal if you go and find eight more drug dealers and report them.
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:34.080]   So that is an exclusively something that only happens in the US.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:35.080]   It's not something that happens outside.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:38.200]   I'm sure this is the case in other countries.
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:45.560]   If a psychotherapist protected by a client privilege does hear of a crime that is about
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:47.360]   to be committed or is required.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.120]   There's reporting requirement is there not.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:50.120]   That's true in other countries.
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.040]   What are that kind of payment for illegal snooping and all that kind of stuff.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.920]   In fact, is much wider spread than you claim.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:05.120]   I mean in Asia, you mentioned Asia, in China and Japan, two massive countries.
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:06.680]   That is fairly widespread.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:11.200]   And then beyond the English-speaking world in Europe, most countries don't fit in those
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:12.200]   categories.
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.640]   I should explain the French system out of this because that's a completely different.
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:16.640]   Especially recently.
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.720]   I don't want to conflate this beyond whatever.
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:21.120]   I'm saying that there are aspects of this which are unique to the US legal system.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:22.120]   Yes.
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:23.520]   And the way that your legal process runs.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.520]   Right.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.720]   So therefore, I just wanted to highlight that.
[01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:30.040]   Well, in fact, that's why the judges allowed the defense attorney to pursue this line of
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:36.000]   questioning because it does raise the issue of the legality of the evidence.
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.920]   And here's a memo, for instance, from 2010, where in 2010, six years ago, an FBI agent
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:45.760]   said source has reported all has been quiet for the last five or six months.
[01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:51.520]   However, source agreed that once schools started again, they may see an influx of child pornography.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:55.200]   The best by technician involved in this case was later identified as a source.
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:02.320]   So for six years, the FBI has been in direct communication with this Best Buy Geek's Guide
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:05.800]   Technician and has been in Korea and has been saying, "Do you see any?
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:07.840]   What's going on?"
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:11.480]   And so this is what the defense attorney says.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:16.880]   This two-way thoroughfare of information suggests the FBI considers the Best Buy Technician
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:22.920]   to be a partner in the ongoing effort of law enforcement to detect and prosecute child pornography.
[01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:30.680]   So that's where this might, in fact, get that evidence suppressed because it is illegal
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:33.480]   search and seizure if he's working for the FBI.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:38.680]   I always question myself in these stories by saying substitute child pornography for
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.680]   tax evasion.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.680]   Yes.
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.080]   That one is so loaded.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:51.360]   If someone was reporting tax evasion based on Excel spreadsheets that they found in partitions
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:56.800]   that had been deleted on a computer, I think we would all very clearly articulate, "This
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:59.880]   is not okay."
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:00.880]   It's very difficult.
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:01.880]   Yeah.
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:04.920]   So that's where I would say if they have a legal mandate or we have a different set of
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:08.280]   rules for child pornography or the imminent harm to die.
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:12.520]   Well, it might be different rules because you do sign when you hand over your hard drive
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:19.600]   to Best Buy that you have waived any right to raise a fourth amendment claim because
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:20.600]   you have to sign this.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:24.360]   I am on notice any product containing child pornography will be turned over to the authorities.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.360]   Done.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.480]   So you're on notice, right?
[01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:33.520]   On the other hand, the Geek Squad guy has apparently lied to investigators saying, "I
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:37.360]   do not remember ever being paid by the FBI and prosecutors of acknowledge the FBI paid
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.360]   him $500."
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.480]   It's because the FBI told him not to say anything to you.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480]   I was working for the FBI.
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.480]   It gives me $500.
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:44.480]   I never remember anyway.
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.400]   And you're right, child pornography muddles Muddies the Water because no way is going to
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.800]   say, "Oh, they shouldn't go after this guy."
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:56.160]   And in the transition of the show, it also muddies the water in the world of advertising.
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:57.160]   Leo?
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:58.160]   Child pornography.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.600]   Yeah, with FARC, the FARC story.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.000]   Oh, I love this story.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000]   Yes.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.600]   So Drew Curtis very well.
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:04.600]   Friend of the show.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.600]   Friend of the show.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:09.440]   I've been a fan of FARC since we used to have Mon Weekly on the old screen savers.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.440]   And he's pretty upset.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:13.800]   There's a couple of things going on.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:18.800]   He's pretty upset because Google has blocked him from having ads.
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:23.640]   Now it turns out he's not alone in this.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:25.160]   What's going on, Mike?
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.680]   So Drew Curtis, of course, with FARC.
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:33.360]   Basically there was a story from years and years ago that contained a photograph which
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:38.640]   in after a little bit of digging they found was a photograph of a fully clothed adult.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:39.640]   I'll show you the picture.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:40.640]   I think it's in the FARC story.
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.240]   It's totally acceptable picture.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:45.880]   It was flagged as child pornography.
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:49.840]   And so they simply stopped payment for his advertising for weeks.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:55.360]   And this is during a bad year for FARC and they really needed it at the end of the year.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.080]   And they just turned off the tap.
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.080]   And it took FARC a long time to even get through to Google on this whole question.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:05.280]   And when they finally got through and were communicating with Google, Google said, "Well,
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:11.560]   you had the Pito Bear logo also present and therefore we considered it child pornography."
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:16.760]   Pito Bear is some kind of teddy bear that I guess trolls or whatever used to associate
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:17.760]   with child pornography.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.040]   Anyway, there was no child pornography.
[01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.600]   They did nothing wrong, but they basically killed--
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:22.200]   No, it had told actress in the photo.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.200]   It was not--
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:28.360]   Yeah, but they essentially accused FARC of committing a horrendous felony and cut off
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:29.360]   all the money.
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.680]   And Google was completely wrong.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:37.000]   And it took forever for them to-- and Drew Curtis goes on this-- given that that's their
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:43.800]   business, fundamentally-- and I agree with Drew Curtis on this-- fundamentally, any business
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.560]   should take care of their customers.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:47.200]   Google's customers are the advertisers.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.200]   It's not that silly convex.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:53.120]   They're off canceling drone programs and building self-driving cars and all this stuff.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.600]   And while their customers are sitting there being burned and accused of felony--
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:00.600]   We've heard this story again and again and again and various guys.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.320]   So here's the problem I have with this.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320]   It's awesome.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.160]   I think these people are incredibly foolish for running such a stupid business.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:14.440]   If you think-- so what they've effectively done is outsourced their advertising to Google.
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:17.920]   And so they're completely dependent on Google as their only revenue source.
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:21.400]   That is the dumbest thing you can do to your business.
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:26.520]   And in hindsight, they have no human contact with their sole source.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:27.920]   There's no one to talk to.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:28.920]   That is a huge problem.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.880]   So my problem here is you outsourced a critical part of your business.
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:33.880]   There's not a lot of companies.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:34.880]   A lot of sites do this.
[01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:36.520]   But none of them are actually thinking about--
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:38.320]   Including a bunch of Macedonian teenagers.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:41.000]   They're sure-- clearly he has accepted that risk.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.360]   Now, there are certain parts of your business that it is wise to outsource, right?
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.840]   And they are things like cleaning toilets and-- and people in the bush bins and winter washing
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:52.600]   the windows because they do not impact.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.200]   But if you give away a key part of your business, that is literally where the money comes from
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:00.960]   to another company, you have put yourself at risk to the platform.
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:01.960]   That's a good point.
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:03.160]   And this goes over and on and on.
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:08.120]   Now, when we built the business that we run or that I run at PacketPishers, we deliberately
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:13.680]   do not run on Google Ads because I would not want to have my business at someone else's
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.680]   beck and call.
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:15.680]   But this happens all the time.
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:18.600]   Look at the newspapers that use Facebook as a publishing platform.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:19.600]   It's not unusual.
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:23.840]   And they're still not smart enough to work out that they need to own the relationship
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:24.840]   with their clients, right?
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:26.640]   They're customers of the people who read it.
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:29.880]   But your clients-- and what they're saying is, yeah, we'll let Google or Facebook go
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:35.280]   and find clients and bring us money because we can sack our advertising people or the--
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:37.720]   You know, if you give away your revenue--
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:39.960]   Don't put your monetization in the hand of a bot.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:40.960]   But all of these--
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.960]   Anybody else, right?
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.960]   At least it's Google.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:44.200]   You look at someone like Time.
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:48.000]   They just signed a three-year deal for $100 million without brain.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000]   And I think--
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000]   Outbraining Kabbalah.
[01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000]   Kabbalah.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000]   Kabbalah.
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000]   Wow.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000]   Oh, this is how Time magazine's monetizing?
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.640]   Around the web stories that you see at the bottom of every web art.
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:02.640]   It'd also be interesting to belly fat.
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.320]   These-- once you see them, you see them everywhere.
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:09.120]   They take you to these-- they seem editorial.
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:11.960]   They take you to these quasi-editorial--
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:12.960]   They're horrible.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:13.960]   --click farms.
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:15.240]   And then they try and sell you something.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:19.320]   And this is how a lot of really highbrow journalistic sites
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.960]   are maintaining their website.
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:26.000]   You know, Bugs me, Google AMP, which is the idea of Google AMP,
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.200]   was to speed up loading on mobile platforms
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.360]   by eliminating disgusting ad tech, elaborate JavaScript,
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:37.240]   punch the monkey things, to pre-cash the content.
[01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.320]   So it loads instantly.
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:39.400]   And it works really well.
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:41.920]   And Google's made a deal with Outbraining to Bullah.
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.480]   So that-- that content will load very fast, too.
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.000]   Yes.
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.800]   Unfortunately, it looks like it's native advertising.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:49.440]   It looks like content.
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:50.880]   And it's just going to fool more people.
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:52.000]   And it's just crapped up.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.040]   The New York Times is one of the only sites that does this right
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:57.440]   in that they have an in-house creative team that
[01:59:57.440 --> 01:59:58.640]   creates their own--
[01:59:58.640 --> 01:59:59.480]   Native content.
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:00.440]   --native content.
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.480]   And that's the way to run-- so here's my problem is.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.760]   We've seen this so many times.
[02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:07.440]   These people literally outsource their revenue to somebody else.
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:09.320]   And then they get into a mindset of, it's
[02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:10.960]   because I write content on the internet.
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:12.320]   It's my privilege to make money.
[02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:13.840]   I don't have to think about how much--
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:14.240]   Well, that's a good--
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:15.280]   You know, Greg?
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:16.640]   Dumbass business models.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:17.280]   You can't disagree with you.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:18.360]   With dumbass people.
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.280]   And you get dumbass.
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.160]   I'm sorry, but you're a dumbass.
[02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:22.400]   Well, but that doesn't mean--
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.400]   That sounds better when you say dumbass.
[02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:24.880]   Yes.
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:26.640]   Greg says it-- he calls it like it is,
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:27.480]   but it sounds kind of hard.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.360]   But we still need to blame Google.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.200]   I mean, Google, it doesn't make Google do--
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.960]   Well, that's Drew's point of view is, well,
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.560]   this is Google's business.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.320]   Why are they screwing me and not just me?
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.960]   Why is he using Google instead of some other ad tech company?
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:40.320]   Why didn't he-- as soon as he's revenue
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:42.440]   stop coming, why didn't he just switch ad tech providers?
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:42.920]   No idea.
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:43.960]   I don't know anything about it.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:44.960]   They blame Google.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:45.960]   But he's un-scupidity.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:46.640]   But he's un-scupidity.
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:47.520]   Or how they work with what their model is.
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:49.120]   I don't know anything about his business.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:52.800]   But I do know that Google makes a fortune
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.080]   from not employing human beings to provide tech support
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:56.960]   to their customers.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.160]   And I don't like the sound of that.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:00:59.200]   We all say how.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.160]   Then don't use Google.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:00.720]   Disrupt.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.720]   Don't use Google.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:02.800]   That's legit.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.080]   There's over two cars.
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:05.600]   There's Yahoo.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:06.120]   Ha.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:06.880]   Yeah, but Yahoo uses--
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.120]   A company you can count on backwards.
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:11.120]   But there's 250 ad tech companies in the back end.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:14.680]   Like those disgusting names that you just mentioned.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:15.960]   Who could have-- he could have instantly
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.880]   should have been able to instantly go and say,
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:18.880]   no money coming from Google.
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:19.760]   Go to another company.
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:20.600]   Put their ads up by--
[02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:21.600]   Oh, I don't know why you're coming from.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:23.480]   If that's where he's revving you coming from.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.280]   And what he should be doing right now
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:28.160]   is he should be out there working on a business strategy
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:31.960]   to start selling, advertising on himself, and doing direct deals
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.800]   with companies to put ads on his site
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.560]   so that he owns his business and stop whining about,
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.240]   oh, Google didn't give me all the money that I am.
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:39.720]   I don't know.
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:41.520]   Petafiles need to stop whining about--
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:43.280]   they shouldn't have gone to Best Buy.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:46.040]   I just think there's also a point that's much larger here,
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:48.640]   which is we talk about how disruptive and amazing technology
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:50.800]   is until you have a customer service complaint.
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.120]   And then you have zero recourse except it
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.360]   goes sound like a whiny bitch on Twitter.
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.440]   And it's just--
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:59.760]   That was the funniest thing from the interns,
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:02.320]   or the internship, the comedy about Google,
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:05.680]   where they got put on Gmail tech support.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:06.920]   And I saw that in Silicon Valley,
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:08.840]   every burst out laughing.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:13.040]   Because there's no phone number to call when your tech support
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:13.920]   is the work.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:14.440]   That's so funny.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.440]   Why do we all rely on Gmail?
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.280]   Same problem.
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:17.960]   Same problem.
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:18.840]   My email's down.
[02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:19.800]   What are you going to call?
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:20.400]   Exactly.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.320]   And that's why most companies are choosing Office 365.
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:24.400]   So Enterprise IT.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.360]   They don't use Google for that exact reason,
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:29.040]   which is why Google of course now has an Enterprise people.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:30.840]   We would actually-- but anyway.
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:33.080]   I just think that-- I really think
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.040]   that the mistake that people make
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:36.600]   is just because I managed to write something
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:37.720]   and publish it on the internet.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:38.960]   You have a right to make money.
[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.360]   You do not.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.600]   You have to write content that people actually want to read.
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:43.720]   And if you want to monetize it, you
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:46.240]   have to understand what making money is all about.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:49.360]   And that means a sales force and selling it and managing sales--
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:51.800]   At the very least diversification of income streams.
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:52.480]   At the very least.
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.840]   If that's a 15-year-old business model in 2001,
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.040]   yeah, you could publish something
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.160]   and money would come teeming out of the sky.
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:59.480]   This is 2017.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:01.720]   Media companies of any sort need to grow up.
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:04.400]   So do you fart himself is what you're saying?
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:06.280]   I don't know Drew, and I don't know what FARC does.
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:07.640]   But I know how the business model works.
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:09.000]   I apologize, Drew.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:09.400]   But he's right.
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:10.720]   We still love you, Drew.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:11.720]   Our show today brought to you--
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:13.640]   I'm going to monetize the heck out of this show.
[02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:14.960]   Let me tell you right now.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:15.560]   Bring it home, Lee.
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.160]   Bring it home.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.240]   Our show brought to you by those good folks at Tracker.
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:20.360]   We're all used to--
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:21.960]   Who doesn't lose stuff, right?
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.560]   I saw a stat the other day.
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:26.480]   The average person spends 40 minutes a day looking--
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.080]   Looking for so many.
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:29.080]   That is so many.
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.600]   Glasses, remote controls.
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:32.840]   All you have to do is get the tracker.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.160]   The tracker is a cute little quarter-sized,
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:37.200]   standardized aluminum device.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:40.080]   By the way, there are other Bluetooth trackers like this.
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.680]   The problem with the one I'm thinking of,
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.120]   when the battery does, you throw it out.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:44.600]   It's done.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:46.200]   You can't replace-- in the tracker,
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:47.960]   you can replace the battery.
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.480]   It's awesome.
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:51.480]   What you do is it doesn't have a GPS built into it.
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.560]   I want to be very clear about that.
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.680]   I think a lot of times people say, it's not GPS in there.
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.040]   You can't put GPS in that thing.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:58.240]   But it would cost a lot more for one thing.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:59.200]   You pair it to your phone.
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:02.440]   Your phone, the tracker software, can track up to 10 devices.
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:04.400]   I actually have my tracker attached to my keys,
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:05.760]   because that's what I lose the most.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:07.360]   You can have a couple of things it'll help you with.
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:09.040]   First of all, separation alerts.
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:10.680]   You leave your keys behind.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:12.960]   The tracker app on your phone goes, hey, your keys.
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:15.960]   You left them behind, as soon as you get 100 feet away.
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:17.200]   But it can go the other way, too.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.080]   Your tracker device, if you've got your keys,
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.160]   but you left your phone behind, can be bad.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:23.240]   You can even push a button on the tracker device
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.040]   that will make your phone yell.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:28.040]   You get to customize that alert.
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:30.040]   If you-- let's see, what else?
[02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.320]   If you leave-- oh, I love this.
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:33.600]   OK, so in a lot of these devices, you leave your key.
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:35.240]   Let's say, oh, you go to Vegas.
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.600]   You're doing really well.
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:37.560]   You have a couple of drinks.
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:38.640]   You're playing the craps.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.200]   You leave your keys at the craps table.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.880]   OK, you get back to the room.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:42.680]   You look at your phone.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:44.200]   The phone says your keys at the craps table.
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:47.560]   Problem is, since then, some guy from Muncie
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.360]   picked up your keys and got on a plane.
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:50.720]   And your keys are now in Muncie.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:52.760]   I don't know why Muncie, but that's where they are.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:53.600]   How would you know?
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.120]   Because the tracker is in your-- you're in the room in Vegas.
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:56.840]   Well, here's the thing.
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:04:58.080]   Everybody see that?
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:01.160]   That map has 3 and 1/2 million.
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:01.840]   It goes zoom out.
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:02.920]   You can see it's all over the world.
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:05.360]   3 and 1/2 million tracker users.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.880]   Tracker devices out there in the wild.
[02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:08.160]   That means zoom out, Carson.
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:08.920]   Just zoom out a little bit.
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:09.280]   There you go.
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:11.400]   You can see the whole world is loaded
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:14.840]   with all over the place, even Muncie.
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:18.280]   So the moment somebody with the tracker app on their phone
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:21.360]   walks by your keys in Muncie, their app goes, oh,
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:23.040]   there's Leo's keys.
[02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:24.680]   I'm not saying it happened to me.
[02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.520]   But the app said, there's Leo's keys.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:29.480]   And then it said to me, hey, your keys are in Muncie now.
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:30.720]   And now I know where they are.
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:32.080]   This is beautiful.
[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:36.160]   This is the largest crowd GPS network in the world.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:37.720]   Leo, I use this in Marseille.
[02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:39.240]   When we were living in Marseille and I put it on,
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.240]   they have the giant European keys with the big--
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:41.920]   Yeah, the tassel?
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:42.960]   Yeah, the gigantic--
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.360]   And I had it attached to that.
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:46.760]   And it occurred to me that this is actually a security thing.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:48.920]   So if I'm out and about it, I lose the keys,
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:50.440]   or something happens to the keys.
[02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.440]   If those keys are away from the apartment,
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.360]   I know that some burglar hasn't broken in,
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.040]   a waiting formula.
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:57.280]   But if they're in the apartment--
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:57.960]   They have the apartment.
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:05:58.960]   Then I had another issue.
[02:05:58.960 --> 02:05:59.560]   And then I have to--
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:00.060]   Oh.
[02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:00.560]   I'm just a side of that.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:01.840]   It's great for travelers.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:02.740]   It really does work.
[02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:03.940]   You could put them in your bags.
[02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:05.100]   I mean, this is really useful.
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:05.660]   You know what I'm doing?
[02:06:05.660 --> 02:06:07.820]   I've got-- my daughter just got a retainer.
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:09.060]   Put it on the retainer.
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:09.820]   Retainer case.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:10.320]   I can't--
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.180]   Put it on the case.
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:11.860]   I got a track.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:12.860]   I got a camera in my room.
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:13.980]   It's going on the case.
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:14.740]   It's going on the case.
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:15.580]   That's a good idea.
[02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:17.380]   It'll really take you some time to get the Hamilton
[02:06:17.380 --> 02:06:19.420]   singing guy on her track.
[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:23.540]   I've seen these used in corporate companies in paper files.
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:25.180]   And the ones that-- you know, the internal mail,
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:26.740]   where you have to ship a document around.
[02:06:26.740 --> 02:06:27.480]   What a good idea.
[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:29.760]   And when you've got a company which has got like 50 or 100
[02:06:29.760 --> 02:06:31.680]   or 300 locations, where the hell is that?
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:32.440]   Ah, that's brilliant.
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.080]   And if you've got a piece that you pop it in
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.120]   and then ship it around and then you
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:37.040]   know where the hell that critical documentation is
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:37.440]   in theory.
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:38.160]   It's so cool.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.080]   So here's the deal.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:41.560]   Go to the tracker.com, T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:44.240]   No E, no second E. The tracker.com.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:45.680]   Promo code to it.
[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:48.760]   And by all the trackers you need,
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:51.640]   but you're going to get a free one thrown in at the end
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:52.880]   when you use a promo code to it.
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:57.080]   Free tracker bravo with your order, the tracker.com.
[02:06:57.080 --> 02:07:00.240]   They are growing so fast.
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:02.600]   I think he told me it's 100,000 new trackers
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.000]   in the wild every week.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.960]   And his network effects, the more they grow,
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:06.680]   the better it is.
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:07.920]   You want them to grow fast.
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.880]   It's great.
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:10.320]   What else?
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:12.720]   A couple of quick things.
[02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:15.840]   Here's a-- I really like this.
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:20.160]   The I-PG guy is a designer.
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:22.640]   He said, this is the next Mac Pro.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:23.320]   Upgradable.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:24.640]   Just spread it out a little bit.
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.040]   I've been saying Apple should bring back
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.800]   the cheese grater, the old Mac Pro,
[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.360]   because it was upgradable.
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:31.160]   And Apple, I don't know if this year Apple's
[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:32.600]   going to have an upgraded Mac Pro,
[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:34.240]   or if they're just going to ban in the whole line.
[02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:35.280]   Sometimes I think Apple does it.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.160]   What are we looking at, Leo?
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.160]   This is some of the concept.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:39.680]   But see how you could upgrade?
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:42.480]   It's got a real video card, so you could actually change it.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:43.640]   You could upgrade the hard drives.
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:45.440]   It's got slots for four hard drives.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.120]   And it's still beautiful.
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.360]   You could still say innovate my ask,
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.880]   or whatever it is, Phil Schiller said
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:53.720]   when he introduced the Mac Pro, and stopped all innovation.
[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:55.520]   It strikes me that Mac Pro is probably
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.920]   the precursor to Dongle Hell.
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:58.840]   Really that-- It was the first.
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:00.320]   It was the first of the Dongle Hells.
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:02.000]   And Apple says, we're going to put this inside,
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.280]   and everything else is going to hang off this thing like that.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:05.840]   Apple said the Dongle Industrial Complex.
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:08.280]   According to R's Technica, Andrew Cunningham was very good,
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:13.080]   and should know, he says Apple is planning a Netflix,
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:16.280]   and is going to do scripted TV shows.
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:17.520]   They're getting into the TV, but it actually
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:18.560]   comes from Wall Street Journal.
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:21.040]   So let's give credit where credit is due.
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:22.760]   The Wall Street Journal, Apple sets its height
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:26.600]   on Hollywood plans for original content.
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:27.720]   That's a hard thing to do.
[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:31.320]   That's a big outlay of cash over a long period of time.
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:32.560]   Do they have the cash?
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:33.960]   They have the cash.
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:35.720]   God knows.
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:37.520]   As long as they make those shows in the Netherlands,
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:39.960]   they're set.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:43.200]   You know, if I wanted to upset Hollywood,
[02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:44.040]   what would I announce?
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:44.560]   Oh.
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:45.680]   What would I think?
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:49.040]   So you think this is a shot across the bow,
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:51.680]   trying to get them to cooperate with apples?
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:52.160]   Yeah.
[02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:53.880]   Apple, you've got to come to us on our terms.
[02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:55.000]   You want to sell us your content on the run?
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.040]   You won't sell us your content.
[02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:57.720]   We'll just go and do Netflix and stuff.
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:58.880]   And Amazon and make our own.
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:08:59.920]   So they just find it.
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:00.560]   It's leaked.
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.280]   It's leaked.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:01.720]   It's not what--
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:06.400]   No, actually the journal is known for being a conduit for Apple
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:07.400]   PR.
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:07.800]   Like they--
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.000]   This sounds like a PR player.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:09.800]   Yeah, you're smart.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:11.600]   They're actually doing business negotiations
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:13.360]   and saying that Hollywood would come to the table,
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:14.840]   or we'll go like Amazon and Netflix,
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:16.080]   and we won't need your content.
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:16.920]   Brilliant.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:18.040]   I think you're right.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:20.080]   They have such less--
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.880]   Their leverage is so much smaller than it
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:24.040]   would have been in days prior when it comes to this,
[02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:25.400]   because they're not in the converse.
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:26.440]   No, no, no, it was reversed.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.160]   Hollywood was absolutely refusing
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:31.480]   to give Apple content for fear of them dominating the market.
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:33.480]   And they did the same thing with Netflix and with Amazon.
[02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:35.200]   And then Netflix and Amazon just turned around,
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.040]   making their own content.
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:36.520]   That's what I mean.
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:38.200]   It's that Apple's leverage is diminished.
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.400]   It is the fact that they're now using Apple--
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.000]   Netflix and Amazon has leveraged to say,
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:42.840]   sell us your content.
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:43.640]   They're funny.
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:44.480]   Wow.
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:45.360]   How we have--
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:47.440]   Flip that around, invert that concept.
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:49.120]   Apple could go and start making content.
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.760]   And yes, with repatriation on the horizon
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:54.200]   and a tax holiday from President-elect Trump,
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.680]   sure, what's $10 billion?
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:56.520]   They go lots of money.
[02:09:56.520 --> 02:09:57.520]   Over five years, there's not a cat.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:58.520]   It's not an issue.
[02:09:58.520 --> 02:09:59.920]   I still can't wait to see a game of phones.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.840]   That's an issue.
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:04.640]   Well, they do have some original content already.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:05.640]   They have that app.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:06.600]   That app one.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:07.680]   They have a--
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:08.320]   Right, the app.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:08.840]   What is it called?
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:09.840]   The app's got a great name.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:11.000]   Yeah, it's a really good name.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:11.500]   Oh.
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:12.520]   I had to rip off of something else.
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:13.440]   Charim will know.
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:15.080]   We'll find out in a moment.
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.480]   Yeah, they bought purple karaoke.
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:18.040]   Oh, they did?
[02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:18.840]   Yeah.
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:20.760]   They're doing a 30-minute carpal karaoke.
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:22.680]   It won't have James Corden.
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:23.600]   Right.
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:25.560]   And it will have a rotating staff.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:28.720]   So that doesn't bode well for the future of the content.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:29.220]   No.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:31.840]   That sounds like an afterthought kind of content.
[02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:32.840]   Yeah.
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:34.600]   I think Apple wants to sell Hollywood.
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:37.480]   Apple's best move would be Disney and Pixar and so forth.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:38.840]   But their best move was just--
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:40.000]   what did Netflix do?
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.680]   They had no expertise in making stuff.
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:44.840]   So they gave $100 million to Kevin Spacey.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:45.840]   You just funny yourself.
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:46.440]   Say it's make-cast the cars.
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:47.240]   You just fund it.
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.240]   You fund the right people.
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:50.840]   It's just such a massive upfront cash commitment
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:52.480]   to commission these works.
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:55.280]   And for every success that we actually see on Netflix,
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.280]   I believe there's two or three shows that die on the vine
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.800]   or die in pre-production or--
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:02.280]   That is the expertise is choosing the shows.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.280]   Actually, Amazon does it brilliantly.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:07.240]   They do a bunch of pilots.
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:08.640]   And then they put them all up.
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:10.800]   And they let you choose which ones are going to get made.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:11.800]   I think that's brilliant.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:12.520]   Analytics.
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:15.080]   And these platforms show they know how long people are
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:16.040]   watching for.
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:17.360]   They know whether they're binging them.
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.400]   They know whether they're watching the evenings or in the mornings.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:19.800]   They know if--
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.400]   They have much better ratings than they're using VV.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:22.880]   There are even things like, are people actually attentive?
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:24.400]   Because if you're not online from--
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.960]   you can't just press play and let it play all day.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:27.440]   It stops.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:28.360]   Netflix actually stops.
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.400]   And the reason it stops is so they get the analytics
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:32.000]   on whether you are actually watching.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.280]   So I thought they didn't start.
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:35.000]   Yeah, no Netflix--
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.360]   While they didn't start, they have played through.
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:37.600]   If it goes for more than 60 minutes
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:40.960]   without you pressing stop, start, it'll actually pause
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:42.280]   and say, are you still here watching?
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:44.720]   And that's literally not because they want to stop streaming
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:46.160]   partly because they want to save money,
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:47.440]   but mostly because the analytics.
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:48.360]   Are you actually watching?
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.880]   Planet of the apps.
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.200]   Planet of the apps.
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:51.880]   Brilliant.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:53.120]   So cute.
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:11:55.280]   Marissa Meyer leaving Yahoo's board.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.440]   I don't think the merger has completed the $4.8 billion
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:11:58.960]   merger.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:00.880]   You said that Verizon isn't going to get a discount.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.360]   They wanted a billion dollars off.
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:04.680]   Maybe they got one in the back end.
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:06.880]   I got one in the back end and it was no fun.
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:09.360]   I don't.
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:12.040]   I don't-- I mean, the story is, is that at the end of the day,
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:14.200]   they deal with it didn't fall apart.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.600]   You would have thought the breach of this was--
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:16.600]   You would think.
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:17.120]   Right.
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:18.720]   It deals with a billion accounts.
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:19.960]   Yahoo should be dead.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:21.920]   There should be nails going into the coffin and people
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:24.640]   pouring, you know, sprinkling holy water on top of it
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:25.960]   because it must be cursed.
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:26.960]   And they've spun on.
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:28.200]   But it still makes money.
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:28.720]   Yahoo.
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:29.600]   It still makes money.
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.760]   Yeah, but what it actually does is it makes double money
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:33.960]   for Verizon because Verizon makes money.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:38.480]   So as the traffic crosses a Verizon backspace, Verizon can
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:39.880]   now match the content.
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:41.080]   So this is why they're by Huffpo.
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:42.160]   It was for peering?
[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:44.600]   No, they sell the data about what the traffic calling
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:46.520]   the backbone to the ad tech company so they can do better
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:47.160]   at targeting.
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:47.760]   You're data.
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:49.480]   They get 10% to 20% better targeting.
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:50.360]   They make billions-- it's a 24--
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.880]   You're actually paying for it.
[02:12:51.880 --> 02:12:53.880]   It's a $24 billion market.
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:56.640]   So traffic data crosses the internet backbones.
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:57.160]   Wow.
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:58.480]   Do you guys use slice?
[02:12:58.480 --> 02:12:59.880]   Yeah, I love slice.
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:01.680]   I didn't realize they're also an analytics company.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:03.560]   Well, because they know who's getting stuff delivered.
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.080]   They're not the only one either, by the way.
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:06.560]   There's another company that does it.
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:09.040]   So this is a company that comes through your email
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:10.600]   to see what receipts you have.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:11.920]   And then it tells you when things share.
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:12.720]   It's on its way.
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:14.120]   When there's a price drop.
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:15.280]   I love it.
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:17.680]   Yeah, it's a great app.
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:20.240]   But I didn't realize they are also selling the data of what
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:21.080]   selling they were doing.
[02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:21.920]   What do you bet that--
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:22.360]   The Earpods story.
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:25.760]   Yeah, what do you bet that that was their original business
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:26.720]   plan they knew?
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:28.040]   All of those services should be free,
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:30.240]   because they make far more money out of the back end selling
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.040]   the data out of the back end.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:31.440]   It's slice is free.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:31.880]   It's free.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:32.400]   It's free.
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:32.900]   It's free.
[02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:33.400]   Yeah.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:34.920]   That's how they monetize this by selling data.
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:38.200]   So Verizon, you know, Verizon AT&T, those carriers,
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:40.920]   are literally at up tens of billions of dollars
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:42.560]   industry selling your private--
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.720]   your data is it-- it trusses the public back part.
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:49.200]   The Yahoo stuff that didn't go to Verizon,
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:54.520]   the stake in Alibaba, Yahoo Japan, is being rebranded.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.760]   It can't be called Yahoo anymore.
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:56.120]   No, that's a decision.
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:57.560]   It's called ATABBA.
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:58.160]   Altaba.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:58.760]   Altaba.
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:13:59.360]   Altaba.
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:03.840]   I think they were going to-- it's got Alibaba mixed with nothing.
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:05.160]   All that's left is Alibaba.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:06.600]   All that's left is Alibaba.
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:08.080]   That's an acronym.
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:08.640]   All that's left.
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:11.080]   The alternate to Alibaba.
[02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.920]   But Marissa's, I guess, going to have some time off?
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.720]   Well, this is just a holding company.
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:18.480]   Who cares if she's on the board or not?
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.240]   This is not a--
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:21.440]   Yahoo Japan doesn't need management.
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:23.680]   Obviously, the Alibaba is a straight up chip.
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:24.480]   And if I was on a train--
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:26.000]   four other members are going to go--
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.160]   This is not a--
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:29.880]   Is this a-- because Yahoo won't even have a board.
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:30.760]   Verizon's the--
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:31.120]   Yeah.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:34.040]   So this is just a financial holding company.
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:36.280]   There's no slam or no slag.
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.280]   This is technology that's developed as there's no--
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:38.780]   Yeah.
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:39.280]   What's next?
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:40.080]   Well, the Yahoo Japan--
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:41.000]   That's what I was wondering.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:42.920]   The whole-- well, Yahoo Japan is still a technology
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:44.560]   but it's a wholly different business.
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:45.880]   Hugely successful in Japan.
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:47.040]   But they just have a stake in it.
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:47.600]   But hold on.
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:48.640]   They're shareholders in it.
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:49.640]   It's not like they go--
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:50.960]   Does she go to a media company?
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:52.200]   Does she go to a tech company?
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.120]   Does she go to a--
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:54.080]   Becomes a VC.
[02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:55.720]   Yeah, that's the net floor.
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.160]   She's the only money she's got a golden pair.
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.560]   She's got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.280]   So she's not worried about what she's going to do next,
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:05.400]   except she would like to do something I imagine.
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:06.600]   VC is the easy way.
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:09.000]   That's what happens to these people a lot.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.120]   But I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.880]   She's got to be a hot number, right?
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:14.480]   Because she's a woman, high profile.
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:15.840]   There's got to be a company that would love to have her as CEO.
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:17.240]   She made a pretty good business.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:18.600]   She's only had two jobs.
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:20.760]   She got as much out of Yahoo as it was to be done.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:21.840]   As well as she could be--
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:23.960]   Did she go to YouTube?
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:24.440]   I don't know.
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:25.960]   I don't think she'd go back to Google.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:26.720]   I think she'd move on.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:29.480]   She left Google under mysterious circumstances,
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:30.320]   various rumors.
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:31.120]   I suspected--
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:34.640]   She challenged herself a media person now.
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:36.040]   There's plenty of media companies.
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:36.680]   I will watch.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:37.360]   Why not WAPO?
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:38.360]   I don't know.
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:40.080]   What a challenge would it be to go and work for Amazon?
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:40.960]   Go for Bezos.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:41.800]   Go work for Bezos.
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:42.320]   I didn't.
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:43.320]   She'd be vice president.
[02:15:43.320 --> 02:15:45.240]   Nobody wants to work for Bezos.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:45.760]   Really?
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:46.560]   I think you're right.
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:47.160]   You're a robot.
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:48.640]   I think you're right.
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:49.480]   Hey, we're done.
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:51.880]   This has been really fun.
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:52.400]   Wow.
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:53.160]   What a great panel.
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:54.480]   In fact, everybody's agreeing.
[02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:55.960]   Best tweet ever.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:57.040]   So--
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:59.080]   The chat room said, I like this great guy.
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:15:59.960]   I like this great guy.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:01.160]   He calls him like he sees him.
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:02.160]   Yeah.
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:02.840]   Not my fault.
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:03.600]   Didn't do it.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:05.600]   He talks funny, but I like him.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:08.800]   Greg Ferro is at the packet pushersnet, packet pushers.net.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:09.240]   That's it.
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:10.440]   Tell me about the podcast.
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.200]   The podcast is Enterprise IT.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:15.200]   We focus on deep dives on the technology.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:16.920]   We mainly focus on data networking.
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:17.880]   We do a bit of a new show.
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:19.040]   There's a network break.
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.000]   We've got the Data Norts, which is about private cloud
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:21.720]   and public cloud.
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:24.880]   And if you're an IT professional,
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:26.360]   you might want to listen to our shows
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:29.480]   and learn more about building your career in that.
[02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:33.000]   Get some wisdom around your core competency
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.360]   in the industry as a whole.
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:34.840]   Love it.
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.080]   By the way, they're great shows.
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:36.920]   Must listen.
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:38.240]   And Greg makes them fun.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.120]   Makes them entry.
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:39.720]   No, you do.
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:40.200]   You're really good.
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:41.080]   We don't take it too seriously.
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:41.440]   Yeah.
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:42.640]   No, I like that.
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:45.360]   Mike Elgin is writing, writing, writing,
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:48.920]   computer world fast company, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:50.880]   And traveling, traveling, traveling soon.
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:52.120]   Yes, soon.
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.400]   Soon off to Europe again.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:55.800]   And I also have the fatcast, who's the podcast about food
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:56.880]   and technology.
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:57.920]   How's technology and food?
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:16:58.400]   It's gone great.
[02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:00.720]   It's been on hiatus for about a month and a half.
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:01.360]   Coming back to the world.
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:03.000]   You've been a little busy with a granddaughter.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.640]   Yes, yes, yes.
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:07.040]   And so almost two months.
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:07.560]   Oh, wow.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:08.120]   That's cool.
[02:17:08.120 --> 02:17:08.720]   Yes.
[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:12.160]   His son Kevin and his wife Nadia and the beautiful--
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:14.200]   We're growing her to be an Uber geek.
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:15.680]   Princess-- super geek.
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:16.520]   Squishy face.
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:17.880]   Princess squishy face.
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:18.920]   Pea squishy face.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:19.440]   Yes.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:21.000]   Get the fatcast.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.360]   It's on iTunes everywhere else.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:25.720]   And as Ed Bo says, if you love technology,
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:27.720]   you'll want to subscribe.
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:30.200]   And Becky Worley, you can see her every morning.
[02:17:30.200 --> 02:17:31.520]   A good morning America.
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:32.600]   Practically every morning.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.800]   Lots of mornings.
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:37.200]   More and more all the time covering consumer technology.
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:38.880]   Consumer rip-offs.
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:42.240]   Chilling her body to a temperature on a godly temperature.
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.320]   I am the--
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:44.880]   Robin Roberts calls me Mikey.
[02:17:44.880 --> 02:17:45.520]   Give it to Mikey.
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:46.520]   Mikey'll try it.
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:48.280]   Mikey'll try it.
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:49.600]   I'm Be Worley on Twitter.
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:50.760]   You know what I'm doing mostly?
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:52.040]   I'm coaching.
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:53.920]   I was coaching Girl Soccer in the fall.
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:55.560]   I'm coaching Boys Rugby right now.
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:58.720]   And I'm going back to coaching Girl Soccer again in the spring.
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:17:59.680]   You love sports.
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:00.680]   You love planning it.
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:01.600]   I'm sure it's fun to coach.
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:03.120]   I have so much fun doing it.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:04.520]   It's amazing.
[02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:07.040]   So you're actually a soccer mom.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.120]   I have the minivan.
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:09.360]   I pick them all up.
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:10.640]   It's the Cadillac of minivan.
[02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.600]   It is-- it has heated seats.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:13.120]   Yeah.
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:13.600]   It is.
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:14.960]   What she's not telling you is she's actually
[02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:16.120]   doing consumer research.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:18.160]   She's watching all the kids in the back of what they use in
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:18.800]   and how they run--
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.920]   I'm sure you can learn a lot from kids these days.
[02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:21.920]   I'm telling you.
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:23.680]   Instant research every day.
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.000]   Well, at least I know who the good kids are.
[02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.240]   Oh, no, you can't play it there.
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:29.120]   No.
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:30.080]   Mommy knows.
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:31.040]   Yeah.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:34.400]   Mommy's got a margarita in that thermosin.
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:34.880]   That's right.
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:35.880]   Big mother.
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:37.320]   Oh, no.
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:39.680]   We do-- this week in tech every Sunday, 3 p.m.
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:42.280]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2300 UTC.
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:43.440]   If you want to stop by and watch live,
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:46.440]   you can watch on our own website, twit.tv.
[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:49.920]   But you can also-- we're on YouTube live now, youtube.com/twit.
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.240]   Just got the silver button for 100,000 plus subscribers.
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:55.560]   Thank you.
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:58.360]   They sent me a snide snarky note, Susan Wojcicki sent me a
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:00.720]   note saying, well, it's OK.
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:03.000]   I mean, it's not a million.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.680]   But it's a pretty good number for somebody
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.200]   over 16.
[02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:10.160]   So good for you, Leo.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:11.720]   Good for you.
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:13.040]   You're trying hard.
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.120]   I feel like it was a participation button.
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:17.400]   And you replied and said, well, YouTube is nice, but it's
[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:18.960]   not 23 in me.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:21.680]   That's not something wrong by your sister.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:22.440]   That would hurt.
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:23.080]   That would be--
[02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:24.080]   That would hurt.
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:24.880]   Yes.
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:25.400]   Yes.
[02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:26.400]   Yeah.
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:29.360]   And mom who got it all started by leasing her garage to
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:31.840]   these young guys, Sergey and Mary.
[02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:33.800]   And she's an educational powerhouse.
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:35.400]   She's talking about the song.
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:35.840]   She's amazing.
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:38.280]   She's great.
[02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:41.200]   Now you've completely thrown my train of thought.
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:42.880]   I was telling you about the show, YouTube.
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:43.880]   And you.
[02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:46.000]   You were to find us.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.160]   All the shows are on YouTube as well.
[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:51.080]   After the fact, of course, your podcast client can find
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:52.400]   Twit easily enough.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:54.040]   If you want to be here live, though, join us in the
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:56.760]   chat at mirec.twit.tv or join us in the studio.
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:19:58.560]   We've got a great studio audience.
[02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:01.080]   Really, the best looking studio audience I think we've ever
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:02.240]   had.
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:04.800]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:07.760]   And we'll make sure we have a seat out for you.
[02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:08.640]   Thanks for being here.
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:09.680]   And we'll see you next week.
[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:10.640]   Another Twit.
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.640]   This is in the can.
[02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:13.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:14.480]   Yay.
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:15.480]   [APPLAUSE]
