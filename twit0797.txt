[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   It's time for Toy This Week in Tech. Great panel for you. Renee Ricci is here from Mac
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.220]   Break Weekly. Alex Lindsey is back. We're so glad to have him Doc Rock too. And of course,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.560]   we're going to talk about Apple's announcement. Three new Macs based on their M1 chip. Why
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.920]   they're not faster than 98% of Intel laptops. We'll also take a look at the new Xbox Series
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.560]   X refrigerator. Eric Schmidt becomes a citizen of Cyprus and they are canceling YouTube
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.400]   Rewind. That plus the first video Carson ever saw on the internet. I got to warn you, it's
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.800]   disgusting. All coming up next on Twitch. This week at Tech comes to you from Twitch's

[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's time for Twit this week in tech. The show where we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.040]   And you're going to I think see if you look at the panel, there's a little leaning, a
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.320]   little bias in this particular episode. In fact, it looks a little bit like Mac Rake
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.240]   Weekly. Renee Richie's here. He wasn't on Mac Rake Weekly this week because you were
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.960]   getting briefed by Apple on the M1 chip. Glad to have you. Renee, did you learn many things?
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.520]   I have spent the entire week deep diving on the M1. So I'm ready for anything you can throw my
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.280]   way. This is going to be a deep dive on M1. But there's other techniques, but we definitely
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.240]   are going to spend some time on that. That's why you're here. So is Doc Rock, the YouTube
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.480]   sensation Aloha? And you're apparently a fan of not the Kansas City Royals.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.440]   No, no. This is a car club. We do a highfalutin, JDM style cars. That means Japan domestic model,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   by the way. And it's called a really executive luxury car. So my friends, they take old Japanese
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.000]   luxury cars like the Japanese version of Crown Victoria's and dress them up.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.160]   Oh, they have beautiful in Japan. I saw we were in Tokyo. We saw a wedding. And they have a beautiful,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.760]   kind of looks old, but maybe like one of those checker caps, but it's big.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.000]   And it actually because the wedding headdress is so big, you open the door and then they have a
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.800]   door on the top to open up so that the bride can get out with her wedding headdress on.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.080]   It's a beautiful car. I would love that car. I mean, spacious, you know, I mean, just beautiful.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.240]   I don't know. So, fan taxis are awesome. And I wish they sold them as regular cars because
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.840]   they're their boxy and funny looking, but they have so much space and automatic doors. It's incredible.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.040]   Oh, yeah, that's right. They've automatic doors because you have to learn if you're in Japan,
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.600]   not to close slam the door like you would in New York City after you get out of the car because
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   you'll break the delicate automatic closing mechanism, which is very embarrassing. Hey, also with us.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.400]   It's Alex Lindsey. Haven't seen you in a long, long time.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.960]   And good to be here. Oh, 9/0 media founder of Mac break and Mac break weekly. And he's been so
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.200]   busy with the various conferences he's been putting together. You still do, though, the morning show,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.040]   right? I do. I do. My office hours. Yeah, we're doing them still two or three hours a day.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.000]   And over the course of every morning, I think we have about 400 to 600 people
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.840]   joining. So it's still pretty crazy. But yeah, you people can find it just with the office hours.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.680]   I tweet about it every once in a while, but we've been kind of just relaxing into the group that
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.040]   we have. We've got about 2,400 people that are part of the group and then about 800 in discord and
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.160]   and then a set about four to 600 show up every day to talk about media production and virtual
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.520]   production. So welcome. It's good to see you. So as you can see with the three Apple fans here,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   there might be a little bit of a bias towards the M1 chip. But I want to explain why we want to
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.560]   talk about it. I mean, this is from the point of view of technology. This is a very important
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.080]   week. This is the week Apple said, no more Intel. We're going to design our own chips,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.320]   something we've been doing on the iPhone and iPad for years. But we're now going to put them on the
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.080]   Macintosh. This is not something Apple hasn't done before. In fact, this is the third time Apple's
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:12.160]   changed massive change of chip platforms. But this is one I think is going to be very interesting
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   and may in fact be challenging to the rest of the PC industry, the x86 based industry.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.080]   And that's why you guys are here because you're going to help us all understand
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:28.400]   what is happening with the M1 processor. Apple announced three new Macintosh computers all
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.800]   available day of which was nice. People will start putting out their reviews. Renee, can you tell
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.040]   me when the reviews will come out or is that also embargoed? Yeah, typically when you have an
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.120]   embargo, the embargo is embark on. You can't even mention that you have an embargo. So I'm
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.040]   going to guess you just raise your eyebrows. No, you don't have to do anything. Don't even show
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.800]   him. I don't want to put him on the spot. But I would guess it'll be probably Wednesday. We'll
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.240]   start getting reviews of the new MacBook Air, the new MacBook Pro 13 and the surprise, the Mac
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.760]   Mini, all based on this Apple M1 chip. Can you tell us that you got briefed by Apple?
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:11.280]   I mean, it's such a virtual world world, Leo. I don't know. I did do a lot of research this week,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.920]   though, but a ton of time there you go. That's what you can say. I've done a lot of research,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.600]   some of which may or may not have been by talking to people at Apple. All right, that's fine.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.040]   And beyond Apple, because I always want to hear what Apple has to say, but I also want to hear what
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.840]   you know, the other side of all those different. Well, I'll give you the negatives because there
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.280]   been a number of articles, YouTube videos and so forth saying, whatever you do, do not buy
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.840]   the new M1 Macintosh. And I'll give you some of the reasons that you guys can
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.240]   can say why or why not that's accurate. First, of course, it's the first generation chip from Apple.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.960]   We've never seen it. Can I just say what it is before we talk about the negatives?
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.520]   Yeah, what is it for some people? So the best way to think about it, if you're at all familiar
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.280]   with Apple Silicon is the M1 is basically if you took the A14, the chip that's in the new iPad
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.400]   Air and all the iPhone 12s, you made the X version of that, the one that you would expect to see
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.800]   in the next generation of iPads Pro. So instead of six CPUs, it has eight CPUs. Instead of four
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.640]   GPUs, it has seven or eight GPUs. And then you added a little bit of Mac specific stuff like
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.600]   hypervisor acceleration, emulation acceleration, thunderbolt controllers. So a little bit of
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.640]   uniquely Mac stuff. But that's, I think the the gist, the quick gist of what it is.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.560]   It isn't a brand new chip. It's an evolution of the existing A14 chip.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.160]   It's a sibling. And I think it's a 14 generation IP. Yeah.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.800]   Yeah. And I think that that's a really important piece of information is that Apple isn't
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.400]   creating a new chip. This is just a bigger, faster version of what they're using in the iPad.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.520]   So in the iPhone and everything else. So it's not, and that's one of the things,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.680]   this is an evolution. They've been building their own chips in reality for quite some time.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:56.320]   And so they just haven't moved it over to the Mac OS until now. So, and that gives them a lot
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.080]   of history and a lot of stability that we wouldn't expect. I think we think of this as a first
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.480]   generation chip, but it's really a 14. You already debunked point one of the
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.720]   multi point, you know, as funny as I've been telling people for at least since they got
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.760]   announced, there was like, well, this is not going to work. And this is not going to work.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   And do you remember the Intel transition? And I would say this is not the Intel transition.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:24.000]   You really have to let go of what it used to be. And I get that. I understand your basis for that
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.280]   thought. But the first statement they made is we've been doing this for a decade.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.880]   Like dude, barely walked out on stage. And within the first six words, he said,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.960]   hey, we've been doing it. He said Aloha in my head. We've been doing this for over a decade.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.840]   And today we're going to show you like what's popping. Like, so I keep, I've been trying to
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.040]   say that to everyone. Just calm down and relax. This is not the first gen. If you have an iPad
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.280]   in your, especially my DJ friends, Esarato and you know, algorithm DJ runs on your iPad,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.400]   it will run on a new computer. Okay, slot. I guess I know what role I'm going to be playing
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:08.800]   on the show today. Okay, but yeah, there's no denying Apple's been designing chips since 2007.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:16.560]   But they've never done a desktop version of this chip. This chip will be attempting to run
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:25.680]   software designed for an Intel Mac, not for an A14 processor. And it's a different environment.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.720]   That there are new things. You mentioned this USB four Thunderbolt. You mentioned the unified
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:38.640]   memory architecture. The memory is actually on the chip, which and then that brings up the second
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:47.040]   caveat or negative because this chip can only have two Thunderbolt channels and can only have up
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.120]   to 16 gigs of RAM. That's the max you can get on these new Macintosh computers. So they are somewhat
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.560]   limited. I mean, you could get 64 gigs of RAM on the Intel Mac mini. I think that's a misconception.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.840]   Like this is a really weird thing. Like I think nerds forgot because we only ever buy the high end
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.960]   that the literal machines that these are replacing the MacBook Air, the lowest end pro,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.720]   and the original silver that they don't sell anymore. The silver Mac mini were all 16 gigabytes.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.080]   And if you want six to say more, if you want more RAM, you could get more RAM,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.720]   not on an air level, not on an air, but you kid on a MacBook Pro and you could
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:31.280]   own a Mac mini. I would say versions of those computers. Right. And also like the person who buys
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:38.400]   the air is not typically the person who would want 64 gigs of RAM. But Mac mini buyers, which you
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.000]   own a lot of Mac mini's are they all 16 gigs? Most of mine are actually because we don't
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   we don't really expect them to do that kind of work. So you know, so when we buy a Mac mini,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.480]   I'm expecting it to do a limited amount of work. And in fact, we I think we're I'm going to be buying
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.280]   a Mac mini. One of these new ones in the next couple of weeks is specifically for the kind of
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.360]   stuff that we do it could be perfect. You know, for for what we you know, again, we don't expect
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.040]   Mac minis are kind of for us like glue that we tie things into we don't have high expectations. In
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.680]   fact, I looking at the stats that I've seen come out so far, I have a feeling that we can do more
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.240]   with them than we than we did in the past. So so they're pretty it looks pretty positive as far as
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:24.000]   what that looks like. And you know, while the we're limited right now to 16 gigabytes,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.760]   we have to remember that this is the this is the 320 by 240 version.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.040]   You know, I understand.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.360]   Yeah, I'm not saying one should never buy an M1 Mac or or Apple Silicon Mac,
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.680]   but that these are not there's going to be a lot more to come and it might be prudent to wait
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.240]   because it's first gen because there are limits.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   Well, don't buy it if you wouldn't buy the Intel version. Like if you would never have bought
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.000]   the Intel version was 16 gigabytes and two terabytes don't just buy these because they're
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.760]   shiny and new. Well, here's a question.
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.120]   By the system you would buy.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.800]   I mean, some people were upset that what you mean a MacBook Pro with only two ports? I mean,
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.360]   there are that's not an illegitimate complaint.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.600]   Well, that's but that's the Mac book it replaced at two ports.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.760]   Right.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.040]   It's literally that. Yeah, right.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.720]   But there is a there is a question is 16 gigs.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.640]   And now I'm going to put a different hat on maybe a defense hat, but 16 gigs of RAM on this
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   platform may not be comparable to 16 gigs of RAM on an Intel platform.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.520]   That's what I keep saying.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.280]   Intel's memory management is very different.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:27.360]   Right. It's segment is the same like it's LPDDR four memory.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   Apple has their own kind is LPDDR4X, which is probably faster than DDR4 because it's
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.120]   unified architecture, right?
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   Well, it's shared. Yeah, it's shared between the CPU and the GPU.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.720]   But the thing is that LPDDR4 itself, even on the Intel machines is limited to 16 gigabytes.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.360]   When Apple goes above it, they drop the low power version.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.840]   They use just plain DDR4 and they bolster the battery to compensate for it.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.520]   So they're just they're only replacing the lowest and most popular and most constrained devices at
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.280]   this point. Yeah, I think people cannot get that disconnect from their head.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:09.040]   But again, you're doing memory calculations based on the way that a Intel based processor
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.240]   handles memory, right? And I keep trying to akin it to horsepower, right?
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.240]   When you look at a muscle car and a horsepower is, you know, 500 horsepower.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:25.280]   But if you go and get yourself a little rice rocket, like my boys up here and you lighten it up and
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.600]   you put in some turbos and stuff like that, you end up with an eight and a half second Civic.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.640]   I mean, and it exists. It look at ESPN on sports, you know, races, you'll see it exists in the world.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.120]   So again, everybody was trying to put that power to weight ratio based off of trying to move a
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.200]   lead sled level car. But if you take it down to a motorcycle or a Hayabusa or a jigsaw,
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.280]   you have things that are 105 horsepower, you know, a Suzuki jigsaw is 105 horsepower,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:00.000]   but zero to 60 is faster than a Ferrari. So you cannot just align that speed that you know,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.280]   with the speed that what's going to come until you actually have it in your hands.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.640]   And there's a lot of postulating bases on guessing. It's pretty much
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.240]   real. I understand. Yeah. And even though weird benchmarks are leaking out to geek bench and
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.960]   graphics bench, those are prob those we shouldn't, we shouldn't judge until, as I said, something
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.560]   like Wednesday when the, when the actual reviewers, people not Renee, but people like Renee,
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.760]   who are benchmarking furiously, even as we speak, will have some better numbers.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.840]   But benchmark, I just prefer time to completed work. Like, I think benchmarks are like,
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.880]   was one person faster off the post was another person better at the, at the end. So I like like,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.040]   like how long I ingest this footage, how long before I'm exporting, I was just giving you plausible
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.480]   denial of that ability to, I don't know what you're doing with that machine you may or may not have.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:54.640]   It's just protecting your ass there. No, I appreciate it. I just mean, like, there's a lot,
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.960]   like benchmarks are one thing, but also I want to see a bunch of people at the work loads. Yeah.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:05.680]   But I've been, but if you're a Photoshop user, 16 gigs. Yeah, it's on Apple Silicon, but
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.520]   it's been made up. But imagine this, so too, Leo, like imagine Photoshop that doesn't bounce 16
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.760]   times before it opens. It doesn't beach ball constantly with every time you move the pointer,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.640]   or like my, the battery life is going to be transformative. Like the performance is one thing.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.400]   I think Apple was aiming for battery life and they didn't get lucky with the performance.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.160]   That's interesting. Performance blew their expectations. They prioritize battery life,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.440]   you think on these, on these, for these machines, not a Mac Pro or anything, but these machines,
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.880]   they were looking for battery life. Yet they put it in a MacBook Pro.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:41.600]   Pro. Well, and I would, I would say that this is the self-identified pro.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   What I was going to say, I was going to say is that with the two ports on the side and that 13
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.840]   inch, we kind of considered the pro light, you know, like it was never really a pro. You know,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.800]   it was kind of like, or it was like an air pro or a pro light, but it was not really a true
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.200]   MacBook Pro ever. You know, and so when you look at the performance specs on it, it was not something
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.600]   we, like we were buying at the, we have a couple of 13 inches that we bought, but it's the one
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.720]   above that. So, so it's not that one. And so we would consider that one a slightly,
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.400]   the advantage that it has over the air is the fan, right? You know, like that's the big thing
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.800]   that it's going to be able to, you know, manage heat more effectively than the air is.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.680]   So basically, this is a MacBook Air with a fan is what you're saying.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.120]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's how I view it.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.800]   I've had a bad idea of the pipes. Do we have a, we don't know what the clock speeds even,
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.480]   Apple didn't say clock speeds. No, but I mean, I don't matter anymore.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   They may not matter anymore. No, clock speeds may not matter anymore.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.600]   Yeah. I mean, I think that sorry, go ahead.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.560]   Go ahead. All I'm going to say is that the transformative piece of this is all of these
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.120]   things being on one chip. The fact that we don't have to go back out to the board all the time,
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.040]   we don't have to use those external buses. We don't have to deal with all those external pieces
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:55.760]   is going to dramatically change the performance profile. And so it's not going to matter exactly
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.120]   whether any one of these components is faster. The fact that they're able to talk to each other
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.360]   so much faster is going to make a huge difference in what's available. And I think that it's probably
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.040]   one of the most transformative things that we've seen. And I think that within a very short period
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.400]   of time, PC manufacturers are going to have to figure out some way to do something similar.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.440]   You know, I think that, and it's going to be very hard because without owning,
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.280]   what Apple is doing is they're forcing everyone to play a game that almost nobody else can play,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.720]   maybe nobody else can play, is that we own the operating system, we own the hardware,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.200]   we own all the components that go into it. And we're going to vertically stack those so they all
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.800]   work together effectively. I don't know who else does that. And without being able to do that,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.680]   I don't know how you keep up. I look down the path of, OK, well, this is the 320 by 240 version.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.520]   One happens when another one comes out that's got 32 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of RAM, 128 gigs of
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.800]   RAM sitting on that chip with 24 lanes and all kinds of other stuff that are going into it when
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:19:00.640]   you think about a Mac Pro that is built for this, the performance specs could be dramatic.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.720]   And it really could put the PC industry on, no, the PC industry will respond. They'll figure out
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:15.680]   some way to do it. But it's going to be, I don't see how a traditional PC keeps up with what Apple
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   has just done. They'll sell modularity as a feature. I think it'll be the big competitive edge they'll have.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.720]   Yes. The PCs. Yeah. Like if you want to build a gaming rig and you want to have a
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.360]   rise in car, do you want to have CUDA cores or whatever? I think they'll just.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:33.680]   Sure. But the question is, if those have a hard time competing with this unified piece,
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:39.200]   what benefit does the modularity give you if you can't keep up with the unified architecture?
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.640]   Well, some people just like. We don't know. Customizability. And one of the things that's
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:49.760]   becoming very clear, and this we'll talk about later the issue with the big server release and
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.720]   the slowdown of the certificate servers. But one of the things that's becoming clear and clear is
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.200]   that this is, Apple is getting more and more locked down. It's an appliance.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.800]   It's an appliance. You can't upgrade the memory. The memory is on the chip. You can't upgrade the
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:13.040]   memory. There's nowhere to put it. The controller for the hard drive, such as it is, is on the chip
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:20.800]   so that you can't replace the hard drive because there's nowhere to put it. So increasingly,
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.160]   these are sealed boxes, black boxes. And some people will hate that.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.480]   And some people won't want that. If all you care about is how it feels to use it and getting a job
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:37.360]   done. I think that Apple, I think Apple, I always think of Apple as they look at what 90%
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.280]   of the people want 90% of the time. And in that sense, 90% of the people, 90% of the time are
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.400]   going to want something that's faster, that works well, that's integrated. And there's a more of a
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.640]   fringe element that's going to want to, and I built, I have a box in the next to me that I built.
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:55.360]   So there are reasons that you build boxes that you need to do a very specific task.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.200]   So I don't think that that's going away. But I think that there's going to be a large number of
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.680]   people that a vast majority that won't care, especially if the performance specs start to hit
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.120]   what what what where the rumors are. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.480]   A lot of people are just I agree. There's an upside clearly to the M one, but these were the M chips,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:23.200]   the M family. But I mean, you can't there are people who say 720p camera. What two ports? What?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:30.000]   Yeah, the seven three P cameras easily addressable for that for the computers that it's replacing.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.520]   That's a non factor, because they have seven 20p cameras. Well, yeah, and also all the
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:43.360]   other I know they suck. Absolutely. But nowadays, the people who need a better camera per se,
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.120]   you're not going to use a built in camera anyway. You're going to plug in a Sony a 6400 like here,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:54.240]   and you're going to slap on a Sigma 16 lens like here, and you're going to be fine. So I don't
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.120]   care what they put in the machine. I'm not going to use it. The people that really matter, they
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.320]   don't care. But it's funny, when I'm watching YouTube videos and watching Nebula, all I saw
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.920]   was people who actually use mirrorless cameras complaining about the camera that they put in
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.240]   the computer. And it's like, just some people that are just capitulating because they have to,
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:19.520]   or they make themselves feel better, or like I tagged on Renee's post today, I said, I think
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.320]   people are literally saying all this stuff because they don't want to get tagged as a fanboy. So they
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.360]   have to say something bad, but it really doesn't matter for the people that are going to use it.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.400]   And maybe these cameras will be better because of the dedicated hardware.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.880]   ISP image processing. Yeah, maybe I mean, I don't know if I SP.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:45.920]   I mean, I think that we send out, we send a lot of kids out. And we just assume that the built-in
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.200]   webcam, whether it's PC or Mac, is not going to be usable for our events. It's not something that we
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.360]   even think about. So we send them either Logitech 920s or BRIOS, but that's just kind of what we
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.080]   send out. And that's a significantly better camera that you're never going to be able to afford to
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.920]   put into your device. And so to back to Doc's point, which is perfect, which is that for the
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.760]   people who care, you'll buy an extra camera. For the people who don't care, it's good enough.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:17.840]   So let's lower expectations and people should not buy this unless they're replacing the Intel
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:26.800]   equivalent. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. This is not this is not a high end system. This is just a
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.480]   more taste of what a high end system might look like. Go ahead, Riddam, sorry.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.920]   And nerds are going to buy the Mac community or the air to tie them over until they get the
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.440]   more powerful machine just because they want the new thing. That's the way it'll be. But I think a
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.720]   lot of people, it was a I don't want to say it was a safe and gutsy move because starting at the low
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.160]   end is a power profile. We all know from Apple like this is a straight iPad pro sort of place. So
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.360]   we know the power that's going into this. But also the MacBook Air is their most popular computer
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.480]   laptops far outsell desktops for Apple and the MacBook Air far outsells any of the other laptops.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.320]   So it's also gutsy. It's like they trust this enough to burn the Brit burn the boat behind them
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.560]   and go all in on M1 because they stopped selling. They're still selling the higher end versions of
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:13.920]   the Mac mini and the 13 inch MacBook Pro on Intel. They are only selling this on the MacBook Air.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:20.320]   And I mean, knowing what people buy an Air for this is going to be it's going to be better battery
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.840]   life. It's no heavier. And the Y series was horrible. The Y series until ships were terrible.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:32.720]   So it'll be it'll be a better experience than your existing air and by a long shot probably,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:36.080]   right? And the thing that killed me that there are two things that really impressed me. One is
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.840]   Apple seems genuinely surprised at how good these are. And that doesn't happen that often.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.320]   Like sometimes, you know, like they'll they'll project confidence. But I think they were really,
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.520]   really were targeting battery life and they got huge performance gains. But also I had a chance,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.360]   I did have to admit that I had a chance to talk to some of them on the record on one of my shows,
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.800]   the Mac and Mac OS marketing team. And from what they were saying, Steve Tolina who runs
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.480]   EZ Rektor product marketing for cross platform said they were getting better results on metal
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.040]   in emulation than they would get straight on Intel. So if you have an Intel app that leans on
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.800]   metal, it will run better on Apple silicon than it runs natively on Intel. And that
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.240]   that is sort of makes me recategorize a lot of what my thinking was going on.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:20.880]   Well, and that's another unknown because most of the software you run will be having to run on
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.960]   emulation on Rosetta too. And so that's the other unknown is how the software you need is going
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.280]   to work. I mean, if you're just using Apple software, I presume logic final cut
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.920]   all the office all the office tools, they'll all be native.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.680]   Is it using after effects? You're gonna have to wait a while.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   Is it universe? Okay. Is it universal binaries for all of those?
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   Yes. So it's like it was in the Intel transition. One version of the program will run
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.040]   natively on either Intel or Apple silicon.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.040]   Yes. Rosetta's a little bit different though because it'll do a translation on download.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.880]   So you don't have to do it at runtime every time. So it'll do it either when it's downloading or
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.520]   when it first runs. And for dynamic code, it'll still do it at runtime. But for everything else,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.720]   and they've had three years to figure out how to accelerate the stuffing out of that, so to speak.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.240]   Yeah. Somebody brought it up this week on actually one of yours shows deals and they were talking
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.880]   about, well, you know, the Microsoft office is not going to work in this and that I'm like,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:27.600]   Microsoft office works really well on phones and tablets. Microsoft office works on Amazon
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:33.280]   super slow tablets. And large portion of this stuff has gone cloud anyway. And so again, one
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.040]   of the conversations came about, well, how is this stuff going to work with cloud or into the apps?
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:43.360]   We find because it's running in a browser, so to speak. So that's another reason why people's
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.120]   expectations of what you need from RAM and all this stuff are kind of different too.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:53.440]   Many applications are trying to move to they're taking the dependency off the CPU and they're
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.800]   moving the dependency to clusters that exist in space. And you're just sort of the window sort
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.600]   of back and forth as more and more computer applications run that way, it'll be fine.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.920]   Because, you know, when we got to how do I remove this background of this, you know,
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.200]   picture on my iPhone, your iPhone isn't doing a lot of that complicated calculation in the past
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.800]   that would run up to a server, get done, come back. But now you can do the kind of half and half,
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.600]   you know, and then eventually it will be back to the just the iPhone chip. So again, I think
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.520]   people's thinking is based off of what we know, not where we're going. Apple's pulling a Gretzky.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:38.640]   And really the Apple is what they need that computer to do is much bigger than what
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:44.000]   we've looked at in the past of a simple word piece. I mean, when we look at USDZ, when we look at
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.280]   AR coming, when we look at all of those those things driving forward, Apple needs these computers
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.880]   to be higher performance. Apple did say benchmarks that came out Leo, they got so if people aren't
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.720]   aware of this geek bench automatically uploads everything you run. And I think a lot of people
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.040]   who have early access don't realize that. So the benchmark just got all sucked up. And they've
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.960]   got a bunch of emulation benchmarks now and the the M1 by itself is faster than any Apple computer
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.640]   currently at single thread. Even in emulation mode, it is faster than any
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:20.320]   current Apple single core of computer. It's according to Apple, faster than 98% of PC laptops,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:30.240]   although PC world Gordon Mong called called that BS. Apple is full of it, he said. This is
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:35.680]   I think that he's trying to redefine they're both defining two different things. Apple's talking
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.040]   about the the total number sold and he's talking about the number of different devices. So to him,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.920]   it's not 98% because it's well, there's only X number of devices and Apple is one of those,
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.760]   whereas Apple's talking about the total number of that are actually sold.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.680]   Well, there's a lot of crappy PCs out there. That's how you get
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:29:00.880]   90% right there, but they're talking that he's not he's not comparing apples to oranges.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.800]   What they said, whether we decide that's a useful statistic and almost all those statistics are
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.160]   useless. But what they were defining is that is of the total soul, they're not full of it,
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.240]   they're just picking a different they're picking more. I wish they would be doing that.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.480]   That's kind of a BSE thing because you know what people think that means,
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.440]   that if I were just to go to the store, the chance of me finding a laptop that's as fast as the new
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.400]   Mac book here is one in 50. That's what they think it means. It's not what it means.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   Well, but I will be it will be interesting to see when it when it comes up what the cost of the
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.200]   computers that are faster than that will be on the PC.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.040]   They're comparing if you read the fine print, what they really mean is faster than 98% of the
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:52.640]   i5 based PC systems with you you a Intel 630 graphics based on the best selling systems publicly
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.960]   on publicly available sales data over the last nine months. It's not it's there's a lot
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.880]   but there's a lot of print here.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.560]   I will say that if you if you give someone a thousand dollars and tell them to go buy a PC laptop,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.880]   what I'm interested to see is can you get a PC laptop with the same battery power and the same
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.520]   battery life and power. Definitely not battery life. But I think that if you if you require those
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.720]   two things you're probably going to have a hard time finding a PC at the same price that can do
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.120]   the same thing. So what you've what you guys have just spent the last half hour doing really is
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:31.520]   lowering expectations for this first generation. Well, just saying that they can make it logically.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:38.320]   Expectations. Lowering them so that you don't say, well, this is going to you're going to is
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.760]   it going to blow my socks off? No. I think your looks will be partially off your feet.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:53.600]   Yeah, as I was going to say, your socks will be slightly blown off. Should anybody buy an Intel
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:02.320]   Mac anymore? Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. There's still some of them. If you if you have a piece of
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.720]   dedicated hardware that is very crucial to your business, right? Say like my laser or my CNC.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   That I would stick to Intel for for a while because those type of hardware, they don't do these kind of,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.880]   you know, firmware updates where I can get it fixed or whatever. Like, you know, there'll be two
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:25.760]   $60,000 breaks that do nothing. So in that case, yes. And people love to text people like me and
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.440]   my specialized machine is, well, it's going to break this. Yeah. But like, you know, my sisters,
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.280]   none of them will be bothered by chains. They don't even know what kind of chip is in their
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.680]   computer right now. They don't care. But, you know, and then the other one, that's going to be kind
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.840]   of craziest people like to throw around this pro word. If there was three letters, I wish that I
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.880]   could absolutely remove from everything to do with tech, it would be the word pro, right?
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.880]   Because people wouldn't when Apple does it, it's a fire. When go pro does it. Well, it's a dope
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.840]   little camera that does what little cameras do. And you know what I mean? But Alex will tell you,
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.720]   there's tons and tons and tons and tons of high level productions that are still using GoPros
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:09.760]   for certain shots, right? It's not as many as the people who own GoPros want you to think,
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.520]   but they do exist, right? If it solves the problem, if the screwdriver goes into the thing and you
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.960]   turn it and the screw comes out, it works. Does it? Well, there's also like us level pro. And then
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.200]   there's like, you know, the MKBHD and Jonathan Morrison and Alex Lindsey level pro. And there's
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.080]   like ILM and Pixar. I mean, I think you could spend infinite money. And it's almost like anyone
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.960]   who lives a mile north from you as a northerner. Anyone who does your workload or more is a pro.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.840]   And everyone who doesn't is just not a pro at all. I say all the pros is getting paid. If you're
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   getting paid, you're pro. If it works, well, in the story. What I will say is that is that
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:53.200]   after seeing the rumor performance of this chip, I, we will hold on to the max that we have as long
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.680]   as we can. Like we're interesting. You're not like, you're not yelling away. As soon as I saw it,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.280]   I was like, Oh, I don't know if I want to buy another Intel machine until I see what happens with
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:08.320]   the next Mac pros and the iMac and the iMac pro and especially the Mac Pro, which we won't see
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:14.800]   for a couple of years. But it will definitely keep me from wanting to upgrade unless I, you know,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.440]   unless I absolutely have to, when you have to, you have to, you buy what you need. If it's going to
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.160]   make, if it's going to pencil out financially for a project, you buy the hardware as a pro,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.720]   right? You don't think about what you need. Okay, well, I'm going to bill, I'm going to bill out
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.400]   this much work on it. I'm going to go ahead and go ahead and buy it. It doesn't matter. But
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:40.080]   I will say that we will only buy what we absolutely have to based on that performance because of,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:47.920]   I think that the Mac, given this chip, I think that the Mac Pro slash, I think that the Mac Pros
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   and the iMac will be the next group. And then I think the iMac Pro and the, and the Mac Pro will be
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:01.440]   the next group. And I think that in those swaths, I think we're going to see significant
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.200]   performance increases. And so as a, as someone buying them, I'm going to hold off, you know,
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:12.400]   if I can, you know, and not just jump into something because it was a cycle or because it's the end
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:18.160]   of the year or other things like that. So that's an interesting point that what you got from this
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.600]   was a signal that it's worth waiting. That's what I'm doing for the 60-inch, like for sure.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:30.320]   That's really interesting. I'm waiting on the 60-inch. I think that it's going to be,
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.880]   I think the performance that we're going to see is going to be stunning, you know, as we,
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.200]   as we go forward. And I think that, again, I think that by the time we get to the Mac Pro two or three
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.040]   years from now, I don't think we're going to see anything else out there that has that kind of
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.200]   performance. So I think it's not just a performance. I think it's like, the battery life is going to
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:51.760]   be amazing for the performance, but it's those little things like every, when I'm scrubbing through
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:55.200]   a final cut timeline, I don't have to wait for the beach ball or I'm launching Photoshop and I
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.480]   have to wait for the filter, shaving seconds off of that is going to eventually save minutes and
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.240]   hours of my life. And that's the part I'm really looking forward to. Well, also, Alan Kay said,
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.120]   if you really want to make good software, you got to make the hardware, or maybe say, if you really
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.560]   want to make good hardware, you got to make the software. But that's the point is you need to
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.600]   control a full stack. And that's one thing that Apple's doing that really, nobody except maybe
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:23.120]   Samsung with their X and S chip is doing. They're going to rough you years for X and S.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.320]   Yeah, I mean, but they're going to make they make the operating system. They make, and we'll talk
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.560]   about big sir a little bit, but they made they're making the chips, they're making everything.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:41.280]   And that's more than just raw power. That's a synergy that is very hard for a PC maker to duplicate.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.800]   It's purpose built like they have when you hear Johnny Saruji talk about it, he says that
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.760]   basically their job is to make the fastest chipset in the world, given the thermal limits of that
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.280]   of the chassis, and that every year their job is to increase that performance only constrained
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.920]   by the limits of time and physics. And when you have a company that's not profit and loss based
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:05.040]   on the chipset, which Qualcomm and Intel just have to be, but they only care about selling iPhones
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.920]   and Macs. There is no P and L for that chipset. They can run as fast as they want. That puts
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.400]   incredible competitive pressure on the industry. And I think when you combine them with what AMD
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.480]   has been doing, because AMD has been super impressive with Ryzen and now with Navi2,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.520]   it's I think it's industry redefining this year. I think we're going to look back and think that
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.960]   as bad as 2020 has been in some ways in terms of just silicon for the PC industry in general,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   it's going to be transformative. That's why I was willing to make this show more about Apple
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.480]   than it would normally be, because I do think this has this reverberates throughout the entire
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.880]   PC industry. I mean, I just from a security standpoint, 100%.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:50.240]   All of the, let's say nefarious software out there is designed to bust Intel stack,
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:56.080]   right? So we're going to get a whole bunch of computers out there that are not running Intel
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.160]   stack. So we're starting malware zero. There's none.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:07.760]   >> Well, I'm saying also, I just think that there is no way when you look at the trajectory of this
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.480]   tiny little chipset doing what it's doing, at least in the rumors, and we'll see more of the
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:20.160]   reviews as they come out. But as we look at that and you mark a potential trajectory beyond battery
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:28.720]   life, just performance, the PC industry has to do something like it, or it's going to be very hard.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.160]   >> And who would do that? NVIDIA was buying arm.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:37.120]   >> I think that NVIDIA is buying arm, but I don't know. I mean, to me, I think that you almost look
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:42.400]   at something crazy like Microsoft buying AMD, merging that together and almost having to go
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.680]   straight at Apple. You know, like basically you almost have to own both of those.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:54.000]   >> But you see the problem they have because if they do that, they then completely cut off their OEMs.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:02.960]   And that is a complete change of their business because without Dell and HP and Lenovo making PCs,
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.160]   it's a very different business. So if all of a sudden Microsoft says,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.280]   and Windows now is designed to run on our custom arm chips, that's a problem. You can't do that.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.520]   >> I can't think of another company that's in the position. Apple is with the exception of
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.600]   maybe- >> They'd have to build a consortium.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:22.640]   They'd have to literally set down and everybody put their big boy pants on and put their egos away
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.200]   and build a consortium. You need a consortium.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.880]   >> That may be the kind of response you need.
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.480]   >> Microsoft. >> I also think like you-
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.440]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.920]   That's a very good point, Rock.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.240]   >> I also think you were right before, like there is going to be people for whom this approach is
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:41.920]   anathema. They just don't want an appliance computer. Apple is building- Apple is not building general
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.800]   purpose computers anymore. They're building things like appliances. Very few people care about
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.960]   being a mechanic to their own car. They don't care about upgrading their refrigerator.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.800]   They don't care about changing their television set instead of buying any television set.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:00.320]   And Apple is laser-honed on that consumer market with a little bit of service made to pros at the
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.920]   very top of the end. But there are going to be a lot of people who just want to buy a case and
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.680]   upgrade the car every year. They just want to buy a case and upgrade the RAM every year.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.920]   They want to do it like a hobbyist. And Apple is not going to serve that market
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.600]   at all. Or they have very specific needs like high-end gaming that just Apple is probably not
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.680]   going to cater to. And it's the same way where someone says, "Apple's sure locking this app."
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.320]   And I'm like, "Yeah, except for cross-platform people who Apple will absolutely not serve
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.400]   at all in any market." And there's tremendous value in that. I think they'll still be
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.120]   tremendous value in doing everything that Apple's not doing.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.960]   Is there a reason to buy for cating developers? So you're going to really, I mean, this is so
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.440]   already the case, but it's going to be even more so. You're going to have one category of
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.840]   developers that do iOS, macOS, and then you're going to have the rest of the world.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.520]   And there's not going to be much more crossover, right? Like the height of Windows.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.080]   Yeah. Again, I think that the issue is, and I think that I don't know what was going to happen
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.880]   there, but I kind of feel like the John Hodgman ad at the end, the little John Hodgman thing that
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:11.760]   little preview could be a preview to a searing. Apple is about to have the high ground when it
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:18.000]   comes to performance. And I think we may expect to see more of those kinds of ads again, where
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.920]   they're not just positioning ads that make you feel good. They are going square and hitting the
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.120]   other platform really, really, really hard because they have it. They're going to have,
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:35.280]   for the next couple of years, to get to Doc's point, you need to build a consortium, but that
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.520]   consortium takes time. It'll take two years to organize it. Then it'll take two more years to
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.360]   agree on things. It'll take five more years to build it. You're talking about 10 years
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.920]   of everyone trying to organize themselves around the idea of what to do while Apple doesn't have to
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:56.880]   talk to anybody. That is devastating. And I think that it is, so what you look at with developers is,
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:05.120]   well, I have, for the average business user, 15 hours or 18 hours of usage time, means a lot.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:11.520]   And then as the performance comes out, for the average 3D artist or the average video artist,
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:19.520]   seeing these crazy performance improvements is going to mean something else. And then you take
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:25.920]   that with a searing set of ads that constantly underline that. And it doesn't mean that Apple's
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.400]   going to take more than 10 or 15% of the market, but that's the most valuable 10 or 15% of the
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   market in the industry. And that really takes a lot of the fun out of it for a lot of other
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.720]   PC manufacturers. Let me, I should probably play the John Hodgman.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.960]   It was such a good moment. It was the one more thing on the one more thing, wasn't it?
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.800]   But I just felt like that might be. At first, I thought it was just funny that they would
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.840]   add it in. And I was like, oh, that's really a blast from the past. And I was like, oh, I wonder
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.520]   if it's a hint to the future of how hard they're planning to swing.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.440]   Well, that's the other thing I think people don't let set in. These are the slowest SOC chips that
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:09.280]   will ever exist. Right. Right. So everyone's, but it doesn't, these are the slowest SOC chips
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:16.640]   that will ever exist. So six months from now, when the M2 or the X, as Renee says, it's going to come
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.440]   out, you know, when we get ready to build six teens, now we're at the next one. And then soon,
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.280]   we'll be at the M5 and it will be at M6, which chips are invisible.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:32.560]   And that's the MI6. And again, I think that I do think that the more modular PC
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.840]   could catch up at some point, but the problem is just going to take them a long time to make
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.080]   the turn because it requires so many people to agree on something. And that is the thing that
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.840]   Apple is forcing. And I think that what we're seeing over and over again is Apple starting to
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.080]   really force the industry to do things they're uncomfortable with. John Hodgman.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:57.040]   Stop. Hang on. Wait. One more thing. Hi, I'm a VC. Is there a time for questions? Good.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.920]   Because I have one. Why? Why? Why make all these advancements? What's the point?
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.400]   Right? Oh, you're so quiet now. Look, I'm a machine. I'm proud of it.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:12.400]   That's my fan. Longer battery life. Plug it in. Where are you going? Just plug it in.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:20.000]   Fast. I'm fast. I'm still fast. Check it out. Still got it. PC still got it. I've always been
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.520]   there. I always will be fast. Okay. My battery is drained. I got to go plug in. Good luck.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.040]   Thank you, Apple. Curtis C. Curtis C. Apple computer.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.920]   Don't take us down, please. People were wondering why John Hodgman's beard disappeared last week.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:46.480]   Now we know he had a gig. That really was great to see him back. Let's take a little break.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:50.800]   This will not be all Apple all the time, but there are a few more things we need to talk about.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.480]   And I really honestly, I want to defend this. I think this is a big shift for PCs, for the desk
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:04.800]   for computing. Maybe the shift is, maybe Renee, you nailed it when you said there's a fork in the
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:13.360]   road. Appliances, whatever that other thing is. Workstations, I don't know. And here's the fork
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:18.480]   in the road. We also have to remember there that the Mac Pro is not an appliance, and it was built
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.440]   in the era of them working on this chip. It may not be the only outcome.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:28.080]   That's a year off, probably. They said this could take us a transition. It'll be at the end of the
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.920]   two-year transition. It'll be a new Mac Pro. It was the last time. It took a year, the last time.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:37.120]   But it took them a while to get that final. It ended with X-erve and Mac Pro. Those are the last
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:42.640]   ones they rolled out. True to that. It may be faster than two years. Apple likes to under-promise
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.880]   over-deliver, but just for 2020 Leo, nobody knows anything. I don't know what's going to happen
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.880]   next. I mean, I'm very happily bought the Mac Pro. Maybe I should have bought the Air. You see,
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:59.680]   that was a crazy thing to do. I wanted a fan. When they announced it back in 2016,
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.600]   they announced this weird computer. They said it was for people who would normally buy a MacBook
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.480]   Air, but just wanted a little bit more. I think we have gotten people who self-identify as Pro.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:14.080]   They found it start-ups. They're doing crowdsourcing things. Or they just want to feel like they're
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.200]   a pro. They want that Pro logo on that machine, but they don't have intense-
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.920]   That's me. Opposer is what you're saying. I'm a poser.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:25.360]   It's literally a MacBook Air with slightly better performance and slightly better battery life.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:31.680]   They sold a ton of those. I think they're smart enough to keep that around.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.440]   20-hour battery life, maybe. For Apple-optimized video. But everything else is going to be good,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.720]   too. Let's take a little break. Renee Ritchie, it's nice to see you. We didn't have you on
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:48.160]   Mac break weekly this week, but we're going to use you up. We're going to miss you. Not miss you.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.520]   Next Tuesday, you'll be back. We're going to use you up in the next couple of days and find out
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:56.320]   everything you know. Maybe your review will be out by then. We can get you to talk off on the record.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.960]   Doc Rock is also here. It's always a pleasure to have you, youtube.com/docrock.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.080]   Yes. I got to keep the bearded and respectable seat warm for you, Renee.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.800]   Yes. He did a really good job. I just said a boat and sorry.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.920]   Yeah, you were great. Thank you.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:16.160]   Fill in. You kept Andy appropriately. You let him go, but you gave him enough rope, but you didn't let
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:24.400]   him go. Of course, Alex Lindsey, we haven't seen an age. It's great to see you in an uncharacteristically
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:31.280]   gray box. Usually you have some fancy backdrop. The gray has become easier to manage.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.520]   Yes. Everybody loves it. What is it? 30% gray? Everybody loves that. Everybody loves that.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.200]   They're nice. They're just easy. You can take it with you on trips.
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:46.160]   Thank you. I showed today brought to you by actually what's in here. Mint Mobile. Breaking
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:51.120]   up with your wireless provider just got a whole lot easier. We love Mint Mobile around here.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:56.960]   They were the first company to sell premium wireless service online only and pass the savings
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:02.800]   on to you. Now Mint Mobile is introducing something we've all been waiting for, their unlimited plan.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:11.920]   And get this unlimited, unlimited nationwide text, unlimited nationwide calling, unlimited data,
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:20.320]   30 bucks a month, 30 bucks a month. Let that sink in and unlimited plan for 30 bucks a month.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.800]   Now I'm on the 30, the 25 bucks a month, 12 gigabytes a month, which for me is,
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.560]   you know, but that's plenty of data. And so they still have those other plans.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:32.480]   But if you want unlimited, that's about a third what I'm paying the big boys for.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:39.120]   A third. How much are you paying overpaying to your soon to be ex wireless provider?
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:46.640]   Mint Mobile saves by not having retail. They're online only. They pass those savings on to you.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:52.160]   All the plans come with unlimited talk and text and high speed data delivered on the nation's
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.000]   largest 5G network. I know you want to know. So I'll tell you it's T-Mobile.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.920]   So if you get great T-Mobile service where you are, you're going to get it with Mint Mobile for
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.040]   about a third the cost. You can bring your own phone,
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:11.120]   keep the same phone number along with your existing contacts. They'll just send you the
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.920]   SIM, no charge for the SIM, unlike the other guys. And of course, if you're not 100% satisfied,
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.000]   Mint Mobile has you covered with their seven day money back guarantee. They also sell phones.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.200]   In fact, that's where I got this iPhone SE, 15 bucks a month. So for half what I'm paying,
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:31.360]   the big boys, I get the phone and the service for half phone and service. Break up with big
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:37.280]   wireless. Switch to Mint Mobile's premium unlimited data plan. Just $30 a month. I don't need to say
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.560]   really much more. It's just that's the deal. Get your new unlimited wireless plan for just 30
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:49.520]   bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your door free. Go to mintmobile.com/twit. Mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:56.480]   30 bucks a month unlimited everything. Mintmobile.com/twit. Thank you, Mint Mobile for
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:04.880]   your support of this week in tech. Anon did a pretty good breakdown, I thought, on the end.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.960]   One chip given that they, you know, we don't know much about it, but they were able to take
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:15.280]   this illustration from the Apple keynote. There's the chip, by the way, that's the RAM on the same
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.360]   car. I just say that when a company drops their own die shot, especially Apple, because usually
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.720]   you have to wait for chip works to do it, when they drop their own die shot, that's like the
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:29.840]   version of a John Travolta strut. They're pretty proud. Anon was, they really worked hard to
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:34.320]   annotate this. Here are the, well, this is an interesting thing. They have an eight core and
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:41.200]   a seven core GPU. The lesser priced models have less storage and one less core on the GPU.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.400]   Is that going to make for you?
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.560]   It's explanation is perfect. I won't even try to steal it. Go ahead, we need to make it.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.320]   Is it binning? Is that what it's? Is that why?
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.640]   Yeah, so it's just like, it's the same reason why you got the A12X before you got the A12Z.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.000]   If they just went for the ones that had eight cores, they would be lower yield and higher cost.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.760]   So this way, they get more chips that they can use and they can pass along those savings and
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.880]   the lower price, MacBook Air. So instead of segmenting based on clock speed, they're not doing that.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.720]   You can buy the lowest end or the highest end. You're getting the same clock speed per core on the
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:16.480]   CPU and GPU. They're just saying, if you want to save some money, you can have one with seven
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:23.440]   GPUs instead of eight. Okay. Yeah, I of course got eight GPUs because I need more.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.640]   Well, that doesn't even know if it makes any difference to me.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   It's like cowbells. I don't even. I need more GPU. What is interesting is they're putting a
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:39.040]   16 core neural engine in every new Mac. That's the kind of thing you get on a phone. I'm not sure.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.400]   And they made a big deal about that machine learning and stuff. I don't do a lot of machine
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:48.160]   learning coding on my Mac and touch. But it's not the coding. It's going to be the image
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.320]   processing. It's going to be final. It's going to be pixel mader and Photoshop and final. They'll
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.960]   benefit from it. Yeah. I mean, all the neural filters that they're doing now, they're colorizing
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.520]   and super res zoom. It's everything that you can do on an iPhone camera. Now you'll be able to do
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:09.440]   in post process on one of these Macs. Yeah. They talk a little bit about the pipelining.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:15.600]   It's a big pipeline, a huge pipeline. And that could make a big difference in performance as well
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   as the amount of L2 cache on chip 16 billion transistors. I mean, if you say it's an A14,
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:30.160]   okay, but that's a third more than the A14. Well, it's got the extra cores and then it's got the
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.560]   Mac specific silicon IP as well. And it's interesting because they didn't just spend their transistor
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.920]   budget on more. They like, they save some like it's efficient and performant. And Apple seems to
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:44.160]   really believe that you get a performance through efficiency that if you can keep that chip super
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.880]   efficient, it'll perform better because it's not overheating. It's not sucking down all the power.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.840]   And I think they're proving that out now with these designs. Yeah.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:58.560]   How about you? And I'm going to ask Alex this because I think you're probably the one that will
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:08.880]   be most penalized by this. No eGPU support, no discrete GPU. How important is that to you?
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:15.360]   And do you think that the M1 GPU is going to be sufficient for some of your all of your needs?
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:21.280]   I'm not buying a I don't buy computers expecting to put an eGPU in it. So I mean,
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:28.400]   so the fact that a Mac Mini or one of these can't handle eGPU, I'm not really going to buy one
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.000]   of these to expecting it to. If I'm going to buy one of these for the field,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.160]   I might buy one so that I can, for me, the Mac Mini is going to be a really good zoom
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:42.800]   head head for bringing people into an event where I do think the GPU is probably going to perform
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:48.960]   better than the previous Mac Mini's, which were pretty bad. So Intel's integrated graphics are so
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:53.120]   bad that anything Apple does is got to it's going to be better probably. It's better than I would
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:57.760]   say. That's why you like it better than Iris, which is not saying. So I, yeah, so but I think that
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:02.720]   that has me interested in the Mac, in the Mac Mini is because I think I might actually get
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.800]   better performance than what I expected. But I don't again, I don't buy computers expecting to
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.560]   add an eGPU. So it's not really that big of a deal to me. I will that be an issue down the road?
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.000]   I mean, I built machines sometimes with four dedicated cards. Yeah, GPU cards. I presume you
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.200]   could use a dedicated GPU on these, not these, but some generation. The other question is, is that
[00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:29.200]   you know, because Apple is pushing down a lot of those pipelines, you know, we don't know what
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:33.840]   those other chips are going to look like, how many GPU, how many lanes are they going to have,
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:37.840]   how powerful are those GPUs going to be. And again, all of these things being integrated
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.480]   without having to go out to an external bus, without having to negotiate with external components.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.120]   Yeah. You know, it's going to say a lot of time. Do you think Apple intends to eliminate the discrete
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   GPU? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I mean, I think that I mean, I think that you can put it in, but I think that
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:57.920]   I don't know if you'll need to foremost thing. Now, I think that on a Mac Pro,
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.560]   whatever chip goes into there may allow that because the Mac Pro is extensible. But I think that
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:08.400]   as they look at all the other chips, they're not going to really consider the eGPU as an external
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:14.800]   piece could not just each, but even an AMD card in the case. Well, I think that I don't know what
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.920]   the Mac Pro will do as far as that goes. But what I will say is that all the way up to that,
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.640]   they're not going to probably really support an eGPU because I think that an eGPU would actually
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.800]   slow them down. Yeah. You know, so I think that'll have a boss. It's going to suddenly, you've
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:33.040]   been a huge shunt. It's going to, it's like, it's like transferring files and you have two really
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.200]   fast computers and then you're passing over the internet. It sounds like their plan is we're
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:43.040]   going to, we're just going to make better and better. I don't want to use integrated graphics,
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.080]   but we're going to make better and better GPUs on our, our our chips. And you will need an external.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.560]   Look at the power consumption of an AMD or an Nvidia, like if you look at Ampere or you look at
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:59.040]   Navi2, they're 200 to 300 watt draw. And we've never seen Apple operate above 10 or 11 or 12
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:03.280]   watts on an iPad. And I don't know what they're going up to on these, maybe 15 watts or something.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:08.960]   But the amount of overhead that they have to fill before they even reach parity with the power draw
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.560]   of those cards. And also when, when I'm, when we're talking about GPUs, I mean,
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:19.440]   when I'm using an iPhone, I am pushing 2 million polygons, I'm doing AR tests with the iPhone.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.720]   And I'm pushing 2 million polygons at 30 frames a second right now on the last generation of
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:29.280]   iPhone. I haven't even started on the, on the 12 yet. And so that is an enormous amount of GPU
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.440]   power already in the phone. And that's not even nearly as powerful as what we have here. And so,
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:38.000]   I don't, I think that there's going to be a lot of power, you know, to spare, you know, for,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.080]   for what these machines specifically are capable of. And then we, again, we don't know
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.640]   how many, you know, how many lanes in the GPU and CPU are going to be available for larger chips.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:52.960]   And I keep telling people now, like, when I first heard about it, I thought it was funny,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:58.480]   then I did it and I was like, Oh, this is not funny. This actually works. LumaFusion on iPad
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:05.680]   to cut 4K stuff, right? I get my basics down. And so then I use the Final Cut XML export,
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:09.120]   open it up and Final Cut, slap some titles on post YouTube,
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:16.880]   pray I get as much views as Renee Richie. But it, it amazes me until I got this 2020 iMac,
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:23.360]   like a month and a half ago, my iPad would run circles around my 2017, 27 inch iMac with like
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:30.800]   60 plus gigs of RAM. So you, when you start building the software that works for the, for the chip,
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:37.040]   running at the right, you know, clip doing everything as it should, it's faster than you think people.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.920]   And like you're trying to compare, well, I can't even get four, you know, 4K streams to run on my
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:48.000]   computer. Yeah, but they just said that they did four, four, what is it, 4K or 8K, two streams on
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:55.520]   a K. Are you joking? Like, are you actually just a camera that can't play the footage back.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.800]   So I think people again are wrapping their head around what they know. And I fully understand
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.880]   you. I'm not claiming that you're dumb for that. But you need to let go. I do not call Leo by
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:14.480]   doing this anymore or going, can I get Lincoln 8 5 7? No, fam, stuff changes. It just changes.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.120]   There's still people that buy vinyl records and have turntables. There's always going to be people
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:25.680]   that will buy PCs with external graphics or discrete graphics cards. And again, I do think that
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.920]   there's there may be there's going to be cases where you need to soup it up or where you need a
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:34.480]   lot more control. I mean, I use Android phones for certain things because any of them be customized.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:41.280]   I use I have PCs for things that need to be customized or the apps only run on a PC. So it's not
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.200]   necessarily all one way or the other. But what I will say is that the performance is going to
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.000]   be really compelling. And again, the PC market is going to have a really hard time making that
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.200]   turn to compete with it. And if they really bring out these, the Hodgman ads again, it's going to be,
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.440]   it's going to hurt a lot. Can they still make trucks? Is Apple still going to make trucks?
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:04.560]   These are trucks. But I think the big, the big problem is that we like, these are trucks with
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:09.520]   really nice seats and cup holders. These are a luxury system. These are a common
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.680]   one. People want that like they're not taking away the flatbed. They're not taking away the big,
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:18.320]   you know, bumpy tires. They're just making it real, real nice inside and giving that engine
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:22.640]   just as much power as they can give it. So it's like it's a really nice luxury truck.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:28.480]   When Mac OS came out, a whole new generation of application software started by delicious
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:34.640]   library, but came out that was beautiful. It was functional that was skeuomorphic. It changed
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:39.520]   our expectations of software. And I'm wondering if this is going to change
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:46.800]   our expectations of software. If this means Adobe and the kind of the historic incumbents
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:53.440]   are going to be left in the dust and the upcoming companies like LumaFusion and Pixelmator
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:59.120]   are going to be the next generation of tools. The responsiveness is going to be unbelievable.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.960]   I think that's going to be in the area. People just don't want to use Lightroom. They're going to say,
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:07.920]   why am I using Lightroom? It's sluggish. It's slow. Yeah. I mean, you're already getting that now.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:17.280]   Luma, I can speak English. Skyloom. Hello, AI coming out in the week. Yeah. Luma Nara,
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.040]   I always hated that word because it gets stuck in my face. I love Lightroom.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:26.720]   They'll always be Mac fun to me. Thank you, Kevin. It will always be Mac fun to me.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   I love Lightroom from the bottom of my soul. But you know what I use every day nowadays?
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:37.680]   I use Mac fun. And because what they're doing is different and it's incredible. And if I had
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:44.560]   to give it to somebody who isn't as pixel peeper as me to edit a photo, they can. Lightroom is
[00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:48.880]   great when you're trying to protect a job. You don't want anybody else to be able to get in there.
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.960]   But if you want to be open and inclusive and let more people come in because it actually
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:58.720]   expands the industry for what my dad's ilk used to say about us hybrid shooters.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.880]   Now my dad, his red sits on the floor. You know what he shoots with all the time? His Sony A4,
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:11.280]   A7, because it's better. It's a nice camera. I got to admit, your dad's going to take his
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:18.320]   age now lugging the Reds. No fun. Yeah. You know, back in the day, it was the line. It separated
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.720]   you from the guys who were just playing. But if you ask him any day, what he wanted to shoot with
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:29.920]   at $1.74, he's going to pick up that Sony and run around. It has a $6,000
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.800]   baddest on the front. But that's a different conversation. More honest. You use this baddest
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.640]   in orders. Because you data pro. Yeah. That's how I got this way. Yeah, 100%.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.040]   Because that's bad. Baddest, man. They're talking some heavy girl, heavy glass.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.160]   Serious glass. I think that industry goes like that.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.920]   Well, and I think that Adobe is in a pretty delicate
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:02.160]   location because a lot of people, like me, bristle at the constant membership that I have to pay
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.800]   for using that. And while we have a station that has After Effects and
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:12.640]   Premiere and other things, it's mostly just for getting things in and out of those apps.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.920]   So most of our work, most of our graphics work is all done in motion. Our heavy duty
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.400]   technical stuff is all being done in Resolve and in DaVinci Resolve. And then the stuff that
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.440]   needs to be fast turns are all done in Final Cut. And the thing is Resolve is a good example of,
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.720]   for 300 bucks, I have an incredible amount of power. Resolve is M1 Native. It's going to be
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:39.680]   M1 Native. Right. And you're talking about apps that are M1 Native that are also incredibly
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.440]   powerful and used in the industry. And then you also have Final Cut again that is,
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.960]   with both Resolve and Final Cut, you're paying 300 bucks once. You're not paying 50 bucks a month
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.840]   for those things. And then for Photoshop, while I still have a copy of Photoshop,
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.200]   I spend more time in Affinity Photo than I spend in Photoshop at this point. So I'm slowly
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.280]   transitioning because I'm trying to figure out, can I do it in Affinity Photo? And right now,
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.280]   I can't do absolutely everything, but the things that I can do are a lot faster.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.240]   To get back to that, it's very responsive and very easy to use. And so I think that we're going to
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.720]   continue to see Adobe kind of having to kind of figure that out. Now, I will say that I found
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.000]   it interesting that they posted a bunch of videos about 3D, like the introduction to 3D. So I'm
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.920]   interested to see what Adobe is going to do with that. They're going to go kicking and screaming.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:34.960]   But I have a feeling we are headed into a great schism, a great separating, a calling,
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.560]   where there are going to be people who are going to go one way. And there's going to be this new
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:46.160]   way, this new Apple way. And there's going to be, as soon as you start using LumaFusion or
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.600]   PixelMator Pro, and you're just going to say, yeah, I don't need that on the other side.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.880]   There's going to be this great, easiest transition. On the previous transition, it was like,
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.840]   when is Microsoft Office? I'm desperate for it. And this transition, it's like,
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.560]   hey, as long as the browser works, I'm in Google Docs. I'm fine. That's true.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.680]   Well, and we're just wondering if Leo was going to get all sparkly because he said we're going to
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.800]   have a great color. And so I was wondering if he was coming. Oh, I thought you meant like team
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.640]   Edward, like, I'm not familiar with that fan player.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:21.840]   Dracula and Westat tell me he's not in the club, sir. I'm more like thinking like Thanos here.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.920]   We're just going to take half of the industry and chop it away. Well, and I think the other
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.360]   things we haven't talked about at all, even within all of these things is the AR capabilities and
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.520]   what's about to happen here. If you pop open your phone, your new Apple,
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.880]   my new LiDAR device, yes. Well, and you go, but you go, let's say you go to the Apple,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:50.640]   Apple USDZ examples, just search that on Safari, Apple USDZ examples. And you click on one of those
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.680]   little objects in there, it pops out of your browser into the real world. And that LiDAR snaps
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.640]   it immediately immediately. Immediately, like instantly you have whatever was there on your
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:07.200]   tabletop or on your floor. And that is the beginning. Imagine being able to do that.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.600]   Right now, you can take those models and put them into your motion project. And through motion,
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.560]   you can put them into Final Cut. Final Cut and motion are both using a 3D engine.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.560]   And then what we haven't seen yet, but I can't imagine not coming, is being able to have that
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:27.680]   3D engine, that AR engine inside of pages and inside of keynote and maybe even numbers. I don't
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:33.040]   know why you would do that. But the thing is, is that being able to start putting that kind of
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:40.640]   content, that 3D content, everywhere. And then you have, by having the USDZ inside of motion
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:45.120]   Final Cut, you already have tools that are able to create content for that market.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:51.200]   That is a big, by the way. I had not tried this with a new phone, but you're right. That's
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.160]   instantaneous compared to the hour used to be. It's instantaneous. It's not enough to come out
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.480]   of the web. You're no longer leaving your phone like an animal. So it's downloading,
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.120]   so it's going to be a Ghost 12 downloading in the boom. It's there.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.600]   And then boom, it's there. Now I'm at... I just had a biplane coming out of his face.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.960]   And it's got a shadow and it's really quite solidly attached to the table.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.040]   Because of the LiDAR. It's not going to slide around. And so it's not just the performance of
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:23.920]   the desktops. It is going to be Apple starting to play a bunch of games that are very hard
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.560]   for everyone else to play. Even if you look at some of the stuff around Dolby Vision and Dolby
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:34.720]   Atmos, Apple now have AirPod Pros that are using Atmos. You have all the phones. I mean,
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:41.600]   if there was a race for HDR, that race is done. I don't want to go on the average consumer.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.040]   I had somebody call me on the radio show saying, "I got to buy a new TV with Dolby Vision
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.560]   because I've been shooting a lot on my iPhone and the HDR looks great on my iPhone, but I don't
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:58.480]   have a computer that can display it. So I need to buy a TV because I can't afford an HDR display."
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:05.440]   Well, the issue is that the problem that everybody has now is that now there's going to be tens of
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:12.240]   millions, possibly hundreds of millions of people acquiring footage in a thousand nits of brightness.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.600]   Before it was like, "Oh, if they had the TV, if you lived in a hundred-knit world,
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.280]   which is a standard dynamic range, if you lived in a hundred-knit world,
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:25.120]   your whole world was the real world and then there was the hundred-knit, it was kind of dark
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.160]   world." But you were used to it. The problem now is you have a phone that is constantly showing
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.440]   you what the difference is between a thousand nits and a hundred nits. So the people's eyes
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.640]   are now getting trained to what a thousand nits looks like. And the problem is that their TV is
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   not going to be sufficient. Their computer is not going to be sufficient. And all of that.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.560]   And the only thing they're going to know is Vision now. And they're not going to know what HDR10 is
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:55.600]   or HDR10+ or HLG or any of these other formats. But the reason that that's important for manufacturers
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:02.960]   is manufacturers, HDR10 is mostly we don't want to pay Dolby's licensing. So you have Dolby Vision,
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.840]   but the problem they're going to have is that consumers are only going to know what Dolby Vision
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.400]   is at this point because Apple's pushing it down the path. And so Apple's forcing these other
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:17.280]   manufacturers to pony up or be seen as falling behind. And then the same thing with the chip.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.160]   So Apple's forcing everybody else to play a game that Apple plays better than they do.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.360]   And that's going to be an interesting mark for the next decade.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:32.320]   You know how you know this is true Alex? I find myself looking for things on my iPad that when I
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:38.480]   listen to it and turn my head it will respond. I noticed this little gimmicky.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.000]   You're the AirPod. You're trying to get the AirPod Pro
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.040]   surrounding the whole time. Spatial sound.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:51.280]   I feel like as a person who grew up in the industry, I should know this is a gimmick and
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.360]   this just stopped. But I can't help it. I'm like, oh, it works. It works. Oh my god.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.000]   The HomePod's do that. Now, too, the spatial audio is amazing.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:58.720]   Shut up. Yeah.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.800]   Where in Bartlett? Don't say that. What is that? What is that?
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.880]   Candle. He's holding a send of candle.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.280]   That's the HomePod mini. Yeah.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.440]   Well, so cute.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:12.400]   Shake it and ask a question. Yeah. Magic.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.200]   Paul says.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.640]   Maybe. Tell me a bad joke.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:24.000]   The minis aren't quite as good as the main HomePods as far as recreating a surround sound.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.440]   But we've had not myself, but someone in the office hours, TJ Asher,
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:38.400]   he has a discrete Atmos system. So 10 speakers in his home theater.
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:42.320]   And he put two HomePods in there to compare them head to head.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   And he said, the HomePods aren't the same, but he was amazed at how close the HomePods got
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:52.480]   to a discrete system because they can hear it. They can hear the room.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:09:00.720]   Yeah. Yeah. So I think that, but I did the docs point though. I do this all the time now.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.280]   I do this thing with my head where I go as soon as I pop up a video that I know is coming from.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:08.560]   I don't know what the platform is. I immediately go back and forth with my head and I go, oh,
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:14.080]   it's just stereo. All right. All the Windows users are feeling really bad right now.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:17.360]   So we're going to have to figure out something here to make them happy.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.800]   Oh, I got something. Big Sur came out on Thursday and it was kind of a mess.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.520]   They tried to. They tried to. We'll talk about that in a second.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.320]   Is this going to be an Apple show the whole freaking time? Yeah, probably.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.640]   Probably. You can play. Go play Minesweeper. You got a solitary game.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.200]   Play Minecraft. That's Microsoft Minecraft. I like Minecraft, although I have to say animal
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:47.840]   crossing is my new Minecraft building that island up getting doing a little terraformin.
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.640]   Are you trust me? Do not add a volcano to your island. Just speaking from me.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.720]   Can you add a volcano to your island? If you can, I'm doing it.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.720]   Oh, you have one on your island. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.480]   Well, it's on one island over, but every time it goes, that's not a good thing.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.080]   That's not a good thing. Yeah, it's not a good thing. Yeah, good point. Good point.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.400]   Okay. If they offer me a volcano, I'll turn it down. How about that? Doc Rock is here.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.120]   Where can we see your dad's photography? Do you mind giving him a plug?
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:22.000]   He's retired. He's retired now, but he used to support a lot of the TV and film guys that
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.880]   would come to Hawaii to shoot. I mean, there's a lot of stuff in Asia originally worked at KBS
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:32.160]   in Korea and C-21 was another production company. But yeah, he's been in the game for a long time,
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.680]   retired and maybe like 10 years ago. Now I just want to watch the beach with his A7
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.360]   Fort Mark IV and his best lens. And it's funny because I was like, look at this old guy.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:49.440]   Then all of a sudden he'll bust out a drone. I forgot the name of it. It's the one the AK drone.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.200]   What's that old guy get a drone like that?
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:59.120]   If you have a phantom, what does he have? Oh, it's AK. Oh, it's Inspire. Oh, he has a DJ
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:05.840]   Inspire. Oh, nice. Oh, nice. But it's just hilarious because no one's expecting, you know,
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.160]   this OG to just reach it. And he carries everything in a plastic bag from the grocery store. And so
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:17.840]   that way it looks inconspicuous. And then it's just, you're just like, man, you're cracking me up.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:24.560]   AK is funny. AK. Our show today brought to you by my Goodnight's Sleep. I'll tell you,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.640]   if I couldn't get a Goodnight's Sleep, I don't know if I could do these shows. But thank goodness,
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.480]   I have a Casper Casper. You've heard of Casper, the Sleep Company with outrageously comfortable
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:40.640]   products at not so outrageous prices from award winning mattresses to pillows I love. I actually
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:46.880]   have a love affair going with my Casper King size pillow. This is get off of me. So no, I'm
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.400]   holding on to you. The sheets, the duvets, the dog beds, Casper's got it all. They even have
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:59.360]   those great glow lamps. They transform the way we sleep once news at a time bedding bed frames.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:06.880]   Here I am with my brand new Casper King. Look, it that's a king size mattress in a pretty compact
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.040]   box. It's one of the reasons I love Casper. I mentioned this before I got it for my son when he
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.280]   went away to college, he said, Dad, the mattress in this dorm is disgusting. I said, there's help
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.840]   on the way. He was able to just lift on the second floor, lift it up the stairs and
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.720]   replace the mattress. It was so affordable. After four years, he said, what should I do with the
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.600]   mattress? I'll leave it there for the next guy. He deserves a good mattress. Every Casper mattress
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.920]   is designed with a system to react and adapt to your body. Look at how it fits perfectly all night
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:43.920]   long. You know what I'm lying on right there? 1,501 perforations. I counted them to create a
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.120]   cooling system. So effective. You won't even notice it. You won't be awake.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.560]   You know, sleeping cool is really important. Only Casper mattresses are made with 86
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.160]   supportive gel pods to align your spine and eliminate aches and pains. It does something
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.400]   remarkable. It gives where it needs to give and that supports where it needs to support.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.880]   That's what you want. The two combined seem like contradictory, but really they're quite good.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.480]   It's the cooling, supportive comfort you need for the most refreshed feeling. Come morning.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.000]   Even Samantha, our cat loves Casper. Actually, both cats were on the Casper this morning.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.560]   With over 20,000 reviews, an average of 4.8 stars across Casper, Amazon, and Google Casper
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.920]   is rapidly becoming the Internet's favorite mattress. The best thing is, you don't have to
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.640]   try the mattress in the mattress store with a salesperson staring at you given to the stink guy
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:40.080]   because you spent three extra minutes. No, you get 100 nights. 100 nights risk-free.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.720]   That's their sleep on a trial. Anytime in that 100 nights, if you say it's not for me,
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.560]   you call them up. They come. They take it away. You don't have to put it back in the box. Don't
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:55.280]   worry. They'll refund you every penny. Casper offers free shipping and painless returns to the USM
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:01.120]   Canada. Now with 0% APR financing options, it's even easier to try a Casper mattress.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:08.400]   Wouldn't this be a nice surprise for your loved ones? Honey? Honey? Go lie down. See how you feel.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:16.560]   Casper, go to Casper.com/twit1. Use the code TWIT1, TWIT1, TWIT1, TWIT1, TWIT1, TWIT1,

[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:49.680]   and enjoy it through the summer. Casper.com/twit1. Thank you, Casper. Thank you, Casper, for supporting
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:57.120]   the podcasts all year long. Patrick Wardle, who is one of my favorite
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:04.240]   security, Apple security guys. He works at Jamf, but he's also the creator of some great software
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:12.240]   at Objective-C.com. Tweeted, "This is true," tears pouring out of the sad face. Previously,
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:18.080]   a comprehensive Mac OS firewall could be implemented via a current network kernel extension.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:25.360]   That was then. This is now under Big Sur. Apple has deprecated KXS, giving us network extensions,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.560]   but apparently many of their apps and demons bypass the filtering mechanism.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:40.400]   This goes along with news after Big Sur came out that anytime you open a program,
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:47.760]   Apple checks with their certificate server, OS OCS-P server, to see if the developer
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.800]   certificates legit and if it's been notarized. Because so many people were downloading Big Sur,
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:58.800]   it seems to have affected the OCS-P server. Everything slowed to a crawl. It's designed to fail open.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.880]   If you're not online, you won't even know. Or if you block it with Patrick's Lulu or Little Snitch,
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:10.000]   you won't even know because it says, "I can't get the certificate, so I'm not going to bother."
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.800]   But if it's slow, it keeps drying. Your software. I have to say, I read about this on Thursday.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.640]   I didn't notice it. I asked my wife, "Is your Mac slow?" I didn't notice it.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.480]   Any of you guys notice a slowdown on Thursday? No.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:33.520]   I think it was geo. This is interesting to me on two ways. One is, I think there was an architectural
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.440]   failure in the way that it was designed. Because like you said, if it didn't get a response from
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:43.040]   the internet, it would just fail safe. You would just keep going. But if it got through,
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.680]   but didn't get a response, maybe it thought there was some sort of chicanery. Malware was
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.120]   trying to stop it from communicating, and it would fail secure. But that should have been
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:56.240]   something that was architected into it. But I dislike the reporting on this so much. It was one
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.680]   of those classic examples of my mom watching BBC and CNN and my YouTube comments filling up with
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.360]   Apple is spying on us. It said things like, "Every time you launch an app, Apple gets a hash of the
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:14.880]   naps name and your geolocation time and date." And that is not true. And Apple doesn't retain any
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:21.440]   of that data anyway. Well, whether Apple retains it or not, we have to trust Apple that they don't
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.880]   retain it. Maybe I trust Apple. But whether they retain it or not, it isn't. And by the way,
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.880]   Microsoft does pretty much does do that. And even admits that they do that. Apple's doing it for
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:39.280]   security reasons. This is part of system integrity protection and gatekeeper. And it doesn't do it
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:46.400]   all the time. It does it periodically will check the developer certificate. It doesn't necessarily
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:51.760]   know what you launched because all Adobe apps have the same developer certificate. But many apps
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:57.680]   can be identified by the developer certificate. So Apple is getting some information.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.480]   And it's not tied to you. My understanding is that it's very similar to how there are other
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:06.480]   operations work where there is a unique but time-limited hash that lets it know
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.000]   that these things are happening together. But again, they say they don't retain it.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.640]   They say it could be tied to you. They've got the IP address. By the way, it's not sent. And this
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:24.960]   is the other problem. It can't be sent encrypted because the OCSP server also does a certificate
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.080]   approval for HTTPS. So you would have an endless loop if you send it encrypted. So it has to send
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:35.280]   it over HTTP. And that also raises the issue that it's not just Apple that may be seeing this,
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.600]   your ISP will see this traffic. Anybody in between you and Apple will see this traffic.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:42.800]   So maybe Apple's not malicious with it, but this traffic is being sent.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.000]   Yeah, that should be better architected. The other part about the little snitch and stuff,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.200]   again, if you look at this through the lens of appliance computing, I spoke to a bunch of people
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.280]   about this. And they're like, if I'm serious about the security, I'm not running anything on my Mac.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.040]   I'm running this at the router level because I have 800 different devices in my house. And I'm
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.280]   not just blocking one MacBook Air. I'm blocking this stuff from everything in the house. And the
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.920]   only way to do that is the router. So you could do that. You could block it. It would fail.
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.440]   But by doing so, you would be defeating system integrity protection.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.360]   Yeah. But if you were paranoid about, for most people, as much as we like to believe that we are
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.640]   a hard target for everyone out there on the internet, most people could care less what we
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:26.640]   had for breakfast. But if you do, if you have a reason to believe, we had a discussion with
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   Dave Nainen, a super duper. He really opened my eyes on this. He's like, do not encrypt your
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.960]   backup drive. And I'm like, but why encryption is good? And he's like, no, nobody cares about
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.360]   your kids' photos, but you. And once you encrypt that, if anything happens to it, those photos are
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:45.120]   lost forever. For your personal private, highly mobile data, encrypt that completely. For the
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.840]   stuff that super, for stuff that would cause a divorce, if you ever lost it, make sure that
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.840]   that is kept in a way that you can recover it. And this is similar. There are certain things
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.600]   that for people like anti-malware is more important for the vast majority of people.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.440]   If you are the person for whom zero knowledge is critically important, you should be doing this
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:07.920]   on the router. Or using Linux. Because Windows does something very soon. But you might want to
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.200]   switch. You might want to Mac, like you might want a bunch of stuff and maybe your kid is on a switch.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:19.520]   You can block it at the router. But again, you're disabling this kind of a vital protection
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:23.840]   against. We never have to disable it. Like you just let let's sip run on your Mac. You don't
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.040]   care. It's just good. But it's no longer checking. It can no longer check the certificates.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.320]   Yeah, it just thinks you're it just thinks you're the organization. Everything is not
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.600]   doesn't matter. So if you had malware that was not notarized, wouldn't matter.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.520]   But I'm guessing if you're that high, like, so yes, if you're really dumb, like if you're dumb
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.680]   paranoid, don't do this. But if you're really smart, you know, you're engaging in this practices
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.440]   and malware is not your issue. Like there are some people for whom their data being stolen
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.760]   is far more of a worry than their data being lost. If being lost is far more of a worry,
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.520]   use every commercially available like run it like an appliance. If being stolen,
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.080]   this is the this is the fork on the road. This is the appliance fork. We are at that work.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:07.040]   And the other thing is that we the last couple months, I had to really think about
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.960]   security for our computers. And you know, it really became a you know, because we were in a
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:18.080]   position where we were possibly targets of state actors. And so so the issue is is that
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.960]   you get into the situation where if you're really going to be serious about it,
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:26.240]   like if you're actually interesting, you need to, you know, our computers were completely
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:30.080]   separated from all the other computers. They weren't allowed to talk to the outside world.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:33.600]   They were unless they had to. And when they did, they went through, you know, there was all these
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.520]   rigorous, you know, the way that the passwords work and the way that you access things and what
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.920]   you install and all these things become something that every single piece, if you're not going to do
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.480]   all of those things, you're leaving gaping holes open. And the only reason most of us don't get
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:53.040]   hacked is because we're not interesting. So to a to a renaissance point is that is that generally
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.920]   we are one thing I got became very clear of over the last six months is that in general,
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:03.360]   most of us live in a pretty wide open space, you know, and so there's a couple things to do there.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.520]   One is to be relatively knowledgeable about what you're downloading. Another thing is to,
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:15.360]   you know, it's taking those those basic, you know, financial theft is something that you're
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:22.400]   probably more apt to be in trouble for. And also, I would say, don't be interesting.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.200]   Like don't do go to websites, there aren't, you know, like, like the thing is online is that,
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.520]   you know, I used to be very, very like, how do I stay off the grid and how do I stay
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.200]   disconnected and everything else? And I learned that the best thing to do is just not do anything
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.640]   online that I can't, I can't back up, you know, because it's just it's there's a, you know,
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.760]   when you look at all these things, people start to feel like they're secure, you're not secure,
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:49.280]   you're not secure online. If someone wants to, you know, like you're not secure online, like,
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.520]   soon as you go out there, you're not it's the wild wild west. And so you just have to kind of
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:58.080]   think about what you're doing and what you're connecting to and make sure that you're doing
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:03.840]   things that are defensible. So let's let's talk a little bit about the change in
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:12.400]   and this is Patrick Wortle's tweet and all that the change in how firewalls work. Little snitch
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:17.520]   still works, Lulu still works. I have Lulu running on my big Sir Mac, but apparently it's not as
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.360]   effective as it used to be because it's not a kernel extension. It's it's a user line now. Yeah,
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:27.600]   it's in user land. So a apple can bypass it. And then Patrick says if apple can bypass it,
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.880]   then there is always the theoretical possibility that malware or bad actors could bypass it as
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.440]   well. But if it's at the kernel level, then there's possibly the bad actors can access your kernel.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.800]   I mean, this is like the trade offs that we make all the time. Right. Right. Right.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:47.280]   And every that paranoid switch to the new tip because then there's no executables written for it
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.800]   yet. Although they say you change in the executables as fast right now they don't exist. So if it's
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   that paranoid, then just give you actually a big sir, which I'm not a big the biggest thing people
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.840]   will notice is the cosmetic changes, which I'm not a fan of. I find it hard to read the menu now.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:09.760]   Just everything is all the Texas thin and the colors are pastel and it's just not as good. But
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:15.920]   that's fine. That's just I'll get used to it. But there is this big shift that is probably good
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:23.520]   for security in Apple's new Mac OS 11. And they started this in Catalina. You probably noticed
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:28.960]   it if you ever looked at your disk with a disk util, you've got two volumes now. You've got a read
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.840]   only system volume and you've got everything everything else. And they're separated. Actually,
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:38.240]   more and more we're running into problems with any time you run a program. This program needs
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.320]   access to your document folder. What you mean? I have to give it permission? Yes, you do.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:48.640]   Suddenly, there's all of these permissions that are involved. You know, probably we should learn not
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.640]   to give full disk access to every app that asks for it, I suppose. But that's... And now photos
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.600]   on iOS, he's like, "Do you want to give them access to a few photos or all your photos?" Yeah,
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:05.920]   they've really gotten granular. And now this read only system partition is signed by Apple and can
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:11.440]   only be signed by Apple. So one of the first things I wanted to do with Big Sur is a clean install.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:16.800]   Forget it, Leo. You're not going to get to do it. You have to turn off boot, in order to boot to a
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:21.840]   USB key. There's all of these processes you have to go through. I end up just saying, "Okay, fine."
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:27.120]   And it is an effective clean install because this read only partition is replaced with another
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.920]   read only partition. Only Apple can sign it, which also means you'll no longer be able to make
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.240]   bootable backups because it won't boot because it's not signed by Apple. The workaround,
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.680]   according to Mike Bombich, a clarbon copy, cloner is to make a backup if you just can
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.920]   install Big Sur onto the backup. And that'll make it bootable because Apple will sign it when
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:53.840]   you install Big Sur onto it. So there are some big shifts in the underlying security model,
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:59.920]   big shifts in the other. Probably again, for the best, but it's the appliance model. For consumers,
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:03.920]   for consumer electronics, it's for the best. But if you're for traditional computers, it's
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:09.280]   horrifying. Yeah. And there's always this layer that you always have to be careful of is that when
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:15.120]   you turn the security up too high, people stop using it because it's difficult.
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.000]   And so that's always going to be something we're going to try to opt out of things or get
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.200]   laissez-faire about opting out of things because they don't want to deal with that. So it's always
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.920]   a matter. And I think what Apple's doing a lot of times is by embedding it all into that process,
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.240]   that they're doing it for you. And again, the average person is going to be
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:41.920]   not going to care and they're probably better off with it. If you're a geek, then it may be more of a
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.160]   problem. If you really want to dive in.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:52.080]   Jeffrey, as long as it doesn't slow down performance, I don't think people should just get bent a
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.240]   lot of shape over it. I mean, yes, we are starting to miss some of that granularity and some of that
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.920]   control. But we're also getting past stages where you need that. Now, I got it. If you're not on
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:06.720]   Wi-Fi rebooting when you don't have an internet connection with modern devices to paint in the
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:12.800]   butt, but as long as you have a connection, it rebuilds itself using the recovery server. So
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:19.600]   really need that bootable USB anymore. Although in the very beginning, I screwed up this brand
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.880]   new computer out of the box trying to do a time machine backup, which I never do, but I was lazy.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:31.360]   And it did not like that. The switch to Catalina with the two volumes, the container. But luckily,
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.920]   because I have a Docker based server in the back and I know how doctors work, I just had to think
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.680]   of it. Everybody should just be running Docker and then you'd have to worry about this.
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:50.080]   I just like the name. I like the whale icon. That's what I like. So that actually is another
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:58.240]   issue that we will probably bite people. I think what Apple's doing, though, is
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:06.960]   is probably going to be for the best, but there's going to be some bumps. If you're using time
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:12.560]   machine, for instance, time machine will now use APFS. But in order to do that, you have to
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.320]   turn off time machine and race the hard drive to turn it back on, reform at the hard drive
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.200]   APFS and turn it back on. But at that point, time machine is actually what it should have been
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.800]   all along, a real snapshot thing instead of a bunch of hard sim links and weird folders.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:33.120]   So there's going to be a bunch of bumps along the way, I think.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.280]   Be right.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.440]   And Apple allows for short-term pain. If they believe there's long-term gain, more than
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:46.400]   Microsoft or companies like that, they're willing to burn those boats to get some future
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:46.880]   fast.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.960]   Well, partly because they know that Mac users probably are willing to put up with it to a certain
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.520]   degree. I feel like though, we are at the fork in the road. And this is Jeffrey Paul here.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.040]   Maybe this is a little bit sensationalized. He's a hacker living in Berlin.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:06.080]   Your computer, he writes a sneak dot Berlin, isn't yours. It's here. It happened. Did you notice
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:12.800]   the world Richard Stallman predicted in 1997, the one Corey Doctorow also warned us about.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:20.480]   And he's talking about how Mac OS basically has a mind of as a life of its own. He overstated
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.600]   what was going on. This is one of the blog posts that said more information is being sent to Apple.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:30.320]   Well, I guess the question is, is that the users that buy it care?
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:30.560]   No.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:37.040]   I just don't think that they, I think that that's the issue is that they're just fine with it.
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:41.200]   I mean, in the same way that people are fine, people use Facebook. I mean, Facebook is just
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.160]   a problem. Or they use Chromebooks. Like, the Chromebook is completely managed environment,
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.600]   and it's better for some people.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:50.800]   In fact, that's why I recommend the Chromebook. It's assigned, you know, booter. You can't modify
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:55.920]   the operating system without the Chromebook saying, hey, you've been hacked. You can power
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.560]   or wash it. Yeah, it's completely an appliance. I guess the problem, there's a little disconnect
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:05.200]   because a lot of Mac users started using a Mac. Yes. Because it was a Unix machine.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:12.160]   You know, it wasn't an appliance very much so. I don't think it's bad that it's an appliance now,
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:18.000]   but it is something to be aware of, I guess. Let's take another little break. Now we can stop
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.040]   talking about Apple. Thank goodness. Thank God. I'm so sick of that.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:28.800]   Now we can get mad at Google. That's coming. We can drag Google for the rest of the show.
[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.720]   They're going to drag Google for a little while. Renee Richie, no, sorry.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.920]   Do you have a Renee Richie dot com? You should have a dot net and dot com for it's the dot net.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.760]   OK. And that will that then forward to youtube.com/Renee Richie? No, but I post all the videos there
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.360]   so that you can see them and a lot of the transcripts so you can read them if you don't like what
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.880]   we should now have your lower third say Renee Richie dot net. I think only like three people
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:56.960]   go there, but yeah, I think YouTube is just easier for people because it messes their expectations.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.440]   I put the website up as sort of an accessibility feature. I like it. Look at this. It's nice.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:08.800]   I didn't even know you did this. It's the baby yodafone. Do you like the mini? It really is.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:12.720]   I do. I do. If I didn't have big photograph and big battery needs, I would be on the mini.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:18.080]   Yeah. Gruber said that he thought the max was too big and it is big. It's heavy. It's like it,
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:25.280]   but it's like a fine German automobile. It's I like the bigness of it. Yeah. And that camera.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:30.320]   Man, have you taken a lot of low light pictures with it? Yeah. But the funniest thing with the
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.040]   camera was you saw this stark divide in the community because like MKBHD, Marques Brownlee,
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.480]   Peter McKinnon, and a couple of the people said there's no difference in the camera.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:43.280]   And then Neelie Patel and Matthew Panzareno and a couple others said there's a big difference.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:47.520]   And it turned out that people with kids in pets were trying to photograph their kids in pets and
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:52.560]   people without them were photographing like their computers. And with the with the Ibis,
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.160]   it was making a huge difference if you were going after a moving target, but not at all.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:01.200]   If you're going after a stationary one. Oh, you know what? I've got a lot of pictures of pets.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:10.160]   So there you go. And the deep fusion does really nice on cat fur. It does. And also like the new
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:16.560]   Ibis, the in-body stabilization is really good for catching those moving targets. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:22.960]   And I like the blue. I got the blue. I think that's me too. Well, I bought the blue, but this
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:28.240]   is the apple one is gold and the one I bought myself is blue. Yeah. Yeah. I did gold last year.
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:36.160]   All right. Let's take a little teeny weeny break. Doc Rock is also here. YouTube.com/docrock.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:42.000]   Or do you have a website too that you're not telling anybody about? It's Doc Rock tips. I need
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.800]   to update it, but I've been so busy making YouTube videos and everybody just goes there anyway.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.360]   It's the live stream thing like, yeah, things things that I used to have to type. I could just say
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:57.280]   about live now. I feel like YouTube is just a different it's a world I don't know or understand. I feel
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:02.160]   like you pioneered it, Leo, but you're you're here talking right now. You read the YouTube.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:07.680]   But that's why I understand. Yeah. And I was trying to explain that to somebody today from
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:14.880]   the what was that show the science type thing with you and told that O'Brien then you went to
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:20.960]   take the site and yeah, that's what it was. I was there. No, the virtual character. Yeah.
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:29.200]   And then call for help like you pre date YouTube. I mean, like, yeah, but now you're just doing
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:35.520]   video all of that. You're there, man. You don't like pre date YouTube like Nikola Tesla predated
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.120]   electricity. Yeah, but he got a sick car with just horrible.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:47.040]   And it's so nice to see my old pal Alex Lindsey come up for air now that the election is over
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.760]   and you stopped doing things that were under attack by nation states. I can't wait to buy you a drink
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:58.080]   and find out what the hell you were doing. It's nice to see you again. Oh, no media at Alex
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.920]   Lindsey and you still do the office hours. Find out about that in his Twitter feed at
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.840]   Alex Lindsey or on his YouTube page. And if you want to see the office hours, you just go to
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:11.120]   youtube.com/Alex Lindsey. That's also we all have our name. Learn just youtube.com/hername.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:19.520]   And we put six days a week, we go ahead and stream most of it. So you can you can watch most of the
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:26.560]   episodes that we couple hours a day of content that we're pushing up. And it's a pretty interesting
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:33.440]   group of people that we've kind of collected. So there's 20 to 30 panelists who represent a
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.640]   couple centuries of media production that are all answering people's questions. That's all we do.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.760]   We just get up there and say, Hey, if you don't ask any questions, it's going to be a really short
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:47.680]   show. And somehow people ask 20 or 30 questions a day and we do the best we can to answer them.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:53.920]   And so everything from HDR and at most to what drive should I buy from my heart, my Mac and
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.400]   my phone doesn't do this or I'm having trouble with zoom. And so just the why is whatever the
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:04.560]   audience comes up with as far as questions go we answer them. And I'm at youtube.com/leo-report
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:11.040]   where I haven't posted in years. You have all the Twitch channels on every day.
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:17.920]   Yeah, YouTube.com/twit. There's a lot of channels there. I should probably be preparing like kind of
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:27.760]   a post-twit like separate from Twitch, like blog and YouTube channel. I mean, I have all that
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:33.600]   stuff, but I don't put anything there just in case they fire me. I'm just thinking I should,
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.640]   you know, I should put all your eggs in one basket. We had a good week this week on Twitch.
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.200]   John, do you have a little mini movie maybe that you could show people that would help them
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:50.640]   understand what they missed? And in the other corner, it's the smoking hot Xbox series X and S,
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.200]   either smoking hot because it's totally awesome or because it's literally smoking.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.400]   Hold on, hold on. I'm ripping a sweet. Oh, don't put your faith. Don't put your. Oh, man.
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:03.120]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:10.160]   Twitch news. Well, now it's time for the Mac to take a gigantic leap forward. Well, today,
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:15.600]   we are incredibly excited to announce our first step in this transition with our first chip
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.720]   designed specifically for the Mac. M1. All right. So the rumors have been optimized.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:28.720]   The M1 chip powering three new Apple devices starting with their most popular, the Mac book
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:34.880]   here this week in Google. It was a story about TikTok and the news today saying hello. And he
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:40.560]   is what's going on tomorrow. You're supposed to put us out of business. They could just shut
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:46.080]   off and be quiet or they can just continue to attack them and say, Hey, look, we put our
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:52.160]   nicks out there. You put all of this ridiculous information out there about us. We got business
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:37:01.120]   to write all about Android. Happy birthday, Android. You're 13 years old now. This is a huge milestone.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:07.920]   You're officially a teenager. Androids voice is all cracking right now. Thanks a lot, Flo.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:08.800]   Twitter.
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:21.680]   Thank you, Jim Cutler. He's so great. Please do. Microsoft has published a alert, a warning. Do
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:24.960]   not blow vape smoke into your Xbox Series X.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.120]   I thought I would always think of doing it. I'm just thinking to my
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:29.920]   smoking.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:35.520]   Smoke. Probably not a good idea to vape in the first place and then add that to not go to your
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:41.520]   Xbox. I really would love either an Xbox or a place I really wanted. I got up early.
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.680]   Midnight on Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday,
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:50.640]   Thursday morning and spend an hour refreshing target in Walmart. Hoping I could get in there
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:57.360]   in order, but no. You got one, Renee? Did they send you that too? No, I don't see. That's
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:00.080]   the curse of covering apples. I don't get any of the stuff. None of the good stuff.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:00.640]   We else.
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:06.880]   How about you, Doc Rock? You get a PlayStation five. No, but I did want just these Xbox
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:12.000]   refrigerator though. I didn't see that. Oh, yeah. I could say three in the world.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.480]   Joe has one Snoop Dogg has one and they're giving one away.
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.280]   Right. And I only wanted it because actually I wanted it partially because just he had any
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:24.480]   other parts because snooze, but I'm really curious what's inside Calvin's. What's inside his
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:30.000]   is not the way it's inside. I could tell you that. Wait a minute. It's not like I would think
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:37.600]   like a college refrigerator. It's a no. It's a big refrigerator. It's an Xbox Series
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:45.920]   exercise refrigerator. So, okay, again, not an expert, but what does Mark has Brownlee say when
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:51.840]   he sees this? Oh, he was doing all sorts of other stuff. How come I don't get a refrigerator? He says
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:58.160]   this is actually a great shot of a puzzled just dean and her sister looking at this thing and
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.920]   saying what the hell what what did I just get? Was that UPS dropping off this giant thing?
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:10.720]   It's on a pallet. I would say that I I she has a very, very clean garage garage. Yeah.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:18.400]   With her little Tesla charger. Yeah. John, you know, Alex discovered just dean, by the
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:24.000]   nice one to point out. I think she was on her way no matter what. Yeah. Well, good Lord.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.600]   Oh, there we go. Just got to go. What is that? A client's around brand for her. Very unbrand.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:36.320]   Yeah. It's the unboxing of a giant refrigerator. It really is a giant refrigerator.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.440]   Wait a minute. Let's jump ahead here. Let's see. It's going to take him a while to unbox this thing.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.920]   Ah, it is. It's a fridge. Does it look like an Xbox? Can you blow a baby's
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:49.600]   mic into it? Did you see the power button?
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:53.360]   Oh my God.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:40:00.400]   That's because you're standing next to the fridge, girl. Yeah, get away. Get away from the fridge.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.560]   And it's all that's. That's a good. If you if you if you look at the number of views,
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.840]   that was the most that was the least expensive promotion. Three million views.
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:17.600]   Right. Nice. In the last couple of weeks. Yeah. But does this make you want to run out and buy an
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:23.600]   Xbox? No. I guess you're making it. We want that fridge. Maybe you want a Xbox coming up. I want
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:30.080]   the fridge. It's just kind of like brand promotion, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. I would be full of bourbon,
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:34.800]   but that's okay. And then what happens to this? Is she give it back? I mean, what are you going to
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:39.600]   do with this thing? Is she promoting a contest where you can win one? Oh, she's going to give it away.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.960]   Not this one. I think there's a third one that gets given away. This one, she's just
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.760]   putting it in with cakes and had Xbox cakes in the fridge. And it's just this whole bunch of
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:53.840]   promotions. Nice fridge. Is that it's probably a sub zero, right? They just painted it. All right.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:57.760]   All right. All right. I should have gotten into YouTube when I had a shot.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:03.040]   I should have. No, I don't want what I want. What do I do with a giant Xbox fridge?
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.480]   That's the problem. You look at those things and you go, Oh, I'd love to. I'd love to be on that
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.360]   gravy train. And then when you are, you go, what am I going to do with all this crap?
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   I don't know. The thing is like when you get your first case to review and you're like, Oh, my
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:22.800]   God, I got a case. And then when you get 400, I don't know. It's like, no, no, no. Yeah. Thank you.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:30.160]   I want to tell you about the only credit card I use if I shop online, the only one. It's aptly
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:38.240]   named privacy, privacy.com. This is going to be a big online shopping holiday season, right?
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.680]   We're all staying home, shopping online, not just shopping online, donating to charities,
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.680]   supporting small businesses. But you really want to do that safely. You protect your financial life
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:59.520]   online with privacy, privacy.com/twit. It lets you generate unique credit cards every time you shop.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.240]   There are two things you can do. You can have it a one time use credit card. Boom, it's done.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.720]   You use that credit card. It's done it. It looks just like a regular master card or visa card to
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:13.120]   the merchant, except they don't get any of your information. I like that too. And boom, it can
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.560]   never be used again. Or you can make a credit card that's tied to the merchant. So I have an
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:26.720]   Amazon privacy card. I have a privacy card for my Comcast subscription for anytime I shop online
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:32.800]   for all the cases and so forth. Privacy.com. What's great about this, I also use it to sign up for
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.320]   subscriptions. You know how that is when you sign up for a subscription and then you forget to renew
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.920]   it. And years later you go, "Why am I paying five bucks a month for this?" Well, with privacy.com,
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:49.680]   you can just pause that credit card anytime. And that's it. It's over. You'll never be
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:53.760]   accidentally billed twice, upgraded to another service without your consent. You can set
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:01.920]   spending limits per month, per year, per charge. You'll also anytime somebody uses your card
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.080]   at a different merchant, you'll immediately get notifications. You can see all the
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.600]   the declined uses and you'll immediately know how somebody's got that card and start using a new one.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:17.040]   If you just pause your privacy card, they'll block the charges anytime you don't want to use
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:22.720]   that card anymore, or you can delete the card. You can create a merchant or a single use card
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:31.040]   easy to do. There's a privacy Chrome extension. I use the Firefox extension. It will automatically
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.560]   fill out the credit card information for you, including number, the security, three-digit,
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:41.920]   or four-digit security code. It's also got built-in sharing. So for instance, I like to buy my mom
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:48.000]   dinner. So I send her a card using privacy straight from the dashboard and just a few clicks. No copy,
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.480]   no paste, no screenshots. She doesn't have a privacy card. She doesn't need one. It's a regular
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:58.080]   credit card. And I say, "Mom, dinner's on me tonight." Beautiful. It's easy to track how
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.080]   what you've been spending with your account summary feature. You can create custom tags,
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:07.360]   so you completely organize this. It's just the best, safest way to make purchases online. Ties to
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.800]   your US checking account or your debit card. I should mention that. It's not a charge card.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.680]   You're going to--the money is immediately withdrawn, but you shouldn't probably be using charge cards
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:23.040]   because the interest rates are so high. This is just like using a debit card. You can have a
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:27.520]   limit though on it. You can assign it to a merchant. You could say it's only--it can be used once.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:34.240]   And that's a beautiful thing. They have a variety of account levels. I get 1% cash back. More than
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:41.680]   pays for the pro card level that I've used. To me, this is just the way you should be shopping online.
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:48.640]   privacy.com/trip. Sign up for an account. If you are a business, they have a card
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:54.400]   issuing API you can use. They have a business-sized card you can give to your employees, that kind of
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:59.520]   thing. And incidentally, just to encourage you to use that special address, you'll get $5 to
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:04.880]   spend on your first purchase, but you have to go to privacy.com/trip. That way they know you saw it here.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:11.360]   You get the $5 and we get the pat on the head. Thank you. You did good to it. Privacy
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.040]   dot com slash twit. I could not recommend this more highly. I've been using it for years.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:24.960]   And I just feel safer shopping online using it. All my holiday shopping will be done with privacy.com.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:31.520]   On we go with a show. This is a big story that Google kind of dropped on people
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:39.600]   this week. And I think there's some upset. If you were using Google Photos because of their
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:49.520]   unlimited storage, it's over. Starting in June, Google will count that storage against your Google
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:58.000]   Drive storage. No more free unlimited storage. We used to tell people with iPhones. I get calls
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.040]   all the time for people saying, "Oh, my phone's full. I need a new phone." No, put Google Photos
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:07.600]   on there. It uploads all your photos and it even has a button that says delete the photos that are
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:12.480]   backed up and it saves space on your phone. But now it's the same as iCloud. You're going to pay
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.560]   for the storage that you're using. So first they make icons that even a graphic designer can't tell
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:24.480]   the part. And now this Leo, I get war with us. They're at war. They hate our users. You get free
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:30.960]   with Google Drive, free 15 gigabytes. Honestly, it's fairly affordable and I pay for it. If you had
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:39.280]   a Pixel phone back in the day, you'd get unlimited original storage. Anything you've got stored there
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.480]   is going to stay there. It's new stuff that's going to start counting against your Google Drive.
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:48.320]   My mom just got the warning. It popped up and said she ran out of Gmail space because she's
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:52.560]   one of those people who just sends countless Jeff gifts to everybody. Yeah, shared with Gmail.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:57.200]   We shared with all your stuff. So I have to go in and subscribe her to get a go-back on track.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:04.960]   Will Oramus writing on Medium at 1.0 says this is Google's anti-competitive behavior. I don't
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:12.480]   think I agree with this. But he said Google Photos crushed a lot of other photo storage services
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.000]   on the way to the top because they were free. So they put them out of business and now they're
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.040]   going to charge. I guess that is kind of classic anti-competitive behavior. I don't even remember
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:27.520]   ever picks or loom or picture life. But he says those startups basically could not compete against
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:33.920]   free. One billion people use Google Photos. And I guess once you have all those photos there,
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:38.880]   you're kind of duty bound to keep using it. Amazon still offers unlimited free original storage.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.840]   If you're an Amazon Prime member, sites like Shutterfly that do photo printing will let you store
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:49.280]   unlimited photos there as well. So there are still some competitors. But do you think this is
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:56.560]   anti-competitive of Google that this is, as Will Oramus says, Google just made the case for breaking
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:02.720]   up big tech? I don't. I have to admit, I don't think that there was a big conspiracy with Google.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:07.840]   I think they just really don't want organized kids. Yeah. They're like, wow, we're spending a
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:14.480]   lot of money on storage. And there's a lot of energy being consumed to do 28 billion photos of
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.480]   each or something like that. So at some point, you do have to, and again, the stuff that's been
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:25.920]   there for two years that you haven't touched, that you're not paying for, starts to really add up
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:32.480]   to a lot of storage and a lot of power and a lot of other things. And so while I could be
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:39.360]   theoretically upset if stuff disappeared, I don't know. It's not coming though. I mean, at least
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:44.320]   so far, they're going to let you keep your stuff there. Yeah. So I think they talked about if you
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:47.760]   don't touch your, if you don't touch it for two years, or they're going to send you a bunch of emails
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:51.760]   and then they're going to go to lead it. What is touching a mean? Do I have to look at every
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:56.960]   photo? I got 60,000 photos of Google photos. I got a terabyte. If you don't use your
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:02.480]   account, okay. Like I have, I have probably 12 or 15 Google accounts. You know, so it's not
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:06.160]   uncommon to have a bunch of accounts. I mean, it's uncommon to have that many, but it's not
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:11.040]   uncommon to have a couple. As somebody in the chair, I'm saying JBC the third,
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:16.720]   hey, it's Google. They could have just said, hey, starting in June 2021, there's no more Google
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:20.640]   photos. They didn't do that. Right. You'd be happy to be a leader. Remember Google
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:25.200]   read me? Yeah. Yeah. And then we penciled reader. Yeah. Or wave. Yeah. Or wave.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.800]   Or a lot of things. But I don't think wave put anybody out of business. Right. Well,
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.360]   the funny part about this, I think that no one wants to wrap their head around.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.760]   The reason why you're upset, let's get, let's be honest. I like to be honest. Okay. The reason
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:43.920]   why you're upset is because Google wants to take away, let's just say two terabytes of your photos,
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:49.040]   because you store them there for free, because you didn't want to buy a hard drive for you to store
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:56.640]   them at your house. So you're mad that someone else is going to stop paying for your story.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:57.200]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:03.360]   Yeah. That's a good one. Two terabyte drive is 50 bucks at Costco. Right now, I was there
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:09.440]   yesterday, go get it, press download, get it all, and then start again. Like take what's up there
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:16.320]   on there off, and then put the new stuff. You got 15 gigs. But I mean, yeah, you're complaining
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:19.760]   because you're mad they're not going to hold your hand anymore. All right.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:26.640]   Yeah. I think that the fact that they did it for so long is quite a feat.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:32.160]   And I would never put anything, I want to pay for things I have to admit. I don't want things
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.920]   for free because I want to know that they're going to last. Like we're paying for it. I have a better
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:41.040]   sense that they're going to actually be there next week as opposed to if it's free, it's just a
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.080]   drawn resources eventually something's going to happen. And I think...
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:47.920]   And customers worse than their free customers typically like I had a paid Google account for
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:51.920]   a while and we got features later. They didn't work well. They would cause problems with new
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:56.080]   Android devices when you logged on with your paid account versus your free account. It's a really,
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:00.640]   free is in Google has turned out to be a really interesting thing because it's enabled access
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:05.600]   to services that a lot of people financially just wouldn't or couldn't afford. But the
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:11.760]   capriciousness with which Google annihilates those services, I think, is something you always
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:15.520]   have to remember before you go in. Like go in with your eyes wide open, take advantage of it,
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:21.040]   never depend on it. And Renee, can you tell people this because filming didn't I go listen to me?
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:26.960]   This is the 10th time, maybe longer. I just picked a random number out of sky because whatever
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:33.440]   number I picked is higher than that. That free stuff either stopped becoming free or died.
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.960]   So when when you realize that there is no free, not a one.
[01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:47.280]   Here's the killed by Google site, killed by Google.com with all 280 cloud print. Remember that?
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:51.040]   Killed by Google. Google play music. Remember that? Killed by Google.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:55.120]   The reader was a big one because they destroyed a lot of RSS readers and then they went away and
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.400]   taken a while to wrap back up. I mean, this has gone on. Google just killed their expedition,
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:05.520]   which I thought was a really cool VR tool. Oh, should we show the, we got one minute to the launch,
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:12.480]   we should probably show the Crew Dragon is about to launch this time with what, four guys?
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:17.440]   It's this is, are they going to the space station? Where else are they going to go?
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:21.120]   Right? Mars is it. There's nowhere else to go. So go to the space station.
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:26.800]   They're going to space dock because the enterprise is ready. Oh, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:33.120]   Yeah. Take it out. Take it out, Mr. Sulu. Let's go for a ride. All right. Well, we got a minute
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:38.560]   pulse engines on this. This is a night launch, which in Florida, which people, you know, love,
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:42.480]   there's something to something. I've never seen one, but I hear that they're just stunning because
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:47.040]   of fireball and what you're about to see is a lower third. That's a Google just canceled this
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:56.880]   launch canceled by Google. No more. Sorry. Elon Musk is such an interesting story because
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:53:05.760]   both, he's both crazy. He's got COVID now, apparently. He's both crazy and doing this.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:10.160]   A lot of masterminds and geniuses weren't very nice people. Leo, we tend to conflate the two.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:13.840]   We think if you're a genius, you have to also be a humanitarian and it's not, you're not calling
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:18.560]   it Thomas Edison had Twitter. We'd think he was in that job too. I'm sure. Imagine Steve Jobs on
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:23.600]   Twitter. Yeah. Yeah. Steve Jobs on Twitter, right? But he had the good. Oh, look at that. Now they
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:27.760]   got a big countdown. He had the good sense. I was bringing some production value to keep it. He
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.000]   emailed a few times more than he probably did probably. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The production
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.520]   values and all the space, that stuff through the roof. But NASA's even good at this. They understand
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:42.160]   public relations is a big part of this. Yeah. I feel like they could take. I didn't see it.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:45.200]   Obviously, we were on the show. It's why I didn't see it. The last launch, I thought, they could have
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:50.640]   done a lot more, a lot more production. Well, that's what you should do a little
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.560]   illustrator. Okay. Here we go. Yeah. It turned out the lights. Look at that. See what I mean?
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:02.160]   It turned out the lights that you could see. Not even gravity contains humanity.
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:08.080]   Not even gravity contains humanity, ladies and gentlemen. Not even gravity.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:13.840]   If you've got 800 million tons of explosive material up your butt, no.
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:17.360]   Not where we want to hear. No gravity won't contain you.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:24.080]   Anyway, that's the motto of the M1 chip. Not even gravity. Gravity contains
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:30.880]   app. The laws of no, they mandate the laws of physics and thermal constraints still,
[01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:36.160]   thermal envelopes still constrain them. It's actually really hard for me to watch launches,
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:42.720]   because I'm still traumatized after Challenger. I just go, please, please don't let anything happen.
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:48.560]   I don't want anything to happen. That was what? 1980, five, six. I was watching it live.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:53.280]   Yeah, I was too. I was in school. Yeah, watching it. I was sitting in my mat.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:57.680]   Did you have to say that? I was writing a writing Mac assembly code,
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:00.720]   16,000 assembly code in my skivis.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:04.960]   Watching it on Steve Gibson is doing that watching this launch. Yes, that's right.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:10.640]   It just kind of hurt every day. He was watching it in his school. I know. What school grade school?
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:16.560]   Yeah, I watched the first one in school, an elementary school, like the very first base mission.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:22.720]   Oh, I'll never forget. My mom and dad wake him me up in the morning to watch Apollo land on the moon.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:30.160]   In 1969, I was 12. I was three. Oh, you're an old guy. And I realized you were that old.
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.480]   It. Yeah. Black and white TV. Young at heart.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:42.080]   All right. There goes the Falcon rocket with the crew dragon. This time.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:48.000]   Full seat GoPro. GoPro gets a GoPro.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:56.480]   No. Why? Tesla cyberpro. It's it's it's a osmo. They actually get the video of the separation now
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.680]   and the the or you know the orbital insertion is just remarkable to see that.
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.640]   They really do a good job with that and. I'm going to get managed and cut off the nine Merlin
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:10.960]   engines will throttle down and then shut down. We're going to get state separation.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:16.800]   It's fun. I miss Walter Cronkite, but it's fun. So all good. They're up there.
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:21.600]   The throttle down in preparation for state separation. That's pretty cool.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:27.360]   I showed it. I brought to you by zip recruiter. It's been a tough year. As we all know,
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:33.280]   and businesses have had to be very flexible from working remotely to pivoting business models
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.880]   to survive and even grow. Restaurants moving. They're dining outdoors. They're adding takeout
[01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:44.720]   and catering. Consumer packaged good companies shifted to focus more on things like surface
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:52.160]   cleaners. This is this is my hand sanitizer, which is made down the road by the local distillery
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:58.880]   that used to make whiskey. Now they make whiskey set at hand sanitizer. It's a wonderful thing.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.840]   Major retailers now sending face masks, but you know what? If you're a company and you're still
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:09.440]   hiring, you're still surviving in this climate. Hey, good on you and thank you. Now, can I point

[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:04.720]   There's a new, and they don't suck. I'm just teasing. There's a new law. I said before,
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:07.680]   like I hold them to a high standard because I believe they're one of the most important
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:11.360]   companies in history. They're kind of build Star Trek for us. Yes. And we want Star Trek
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:16.000]   built to not like to be good for us. So we have to be very sweetness of Google. Yes, I agree 100%.
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:24.880]   I agree 100%. Lawsuit, looking to get a class certified by the judge, filed in Federal District
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:30.560]   Court in San Jose on behalf of four plaintiffs, contending. I don't know what you have to think of
[01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:37.680]   this. That Google, "Why you Google is using Android users limited cellular data allowances
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:43.040]   without permission to transmit information about those individuals that's unrelated to their use
[01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:53.760]   of Google services. 260 megabytes a month via cellular data when the phones are not even in use."
[01:59:53.760 --> 02:00:00.400]   I don't know yet what that data is or why it's being sent. Of course, you agree to it, I'm sure,
[02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:09.280]   somewhere in the fine print and all of that. 8.88 megabytes of data. Is that a problem?
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:16.080]   I mean, I guess it is if you have a very small cap. That's the thing is they give you a lot of
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:19.600]   free stuff, but they don't pay you for this stuff. And that's a difference. I think eventually,
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:25.120]   it'll become more and more. You're paying with your data. And for some people, especially if
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.640]   it's costing you cellular or it's costing you some otherwise, you might decide that they should
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:32.880]   actually pay for that data rather than just charge you for it. It's probably telemetry or
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:38.400]   something. Google feeds its machine. They are letting you use Google services inexpensively or
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:42.000]   freely because they are using all that data to make Google better. That's the bargain that you're
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:49.440]   signing up for. What the attorneys did is they set up a brand new Samsung Galaxy S7 running Android,
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:56.720]   signed into a Google account, no Wi-Fi, let it just sit there. With all apps closed,
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:05.280]   transferred data to Google about 16 times an hour. I guess the next thing to do would be put
[02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:09.680]   wire shark or something on there and see what that data is.
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:15.520]   It's not the first time somebody's done this. It just seems inefficient.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:20.640]   The Capone wasn't doing anything. It was still holding a whole bunch of data.
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:27.280]   I think that it's inefficient, but I don't know if it's worthy of a lawsuit.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.640]   Maybe it's preloading ads. Maybe it's... I don't know what it's saying. The register,
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:41.360]   which had this story asked Google to respond, they declined to comment.
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:48.400]   It's just not known what it's doing. I keep an eye on that.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:52.240]   Nerds will figure it out. Nerds will figure it out. They figure everything out eventually.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:59.760]   Eventually they figure it all out. Eric Schmidt, remember him, former CEO of Google,
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:03.360]   has decided to be a citizen along with his family of Cyprus.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.640]   I hear Cyprus is really nice this time. It's really nice this time of year.
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:13.760]   The advantage is once you have a Cyprus passport, you can go to all the shanking countries. You can
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:20.400]   go all over the EU. It's not horribly expensive, just a few million dollars.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:29.120]   Cyprus is one of a number of countries doing this, allowing you to effectively buy citizenship.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:37.520]   Skirting residency requirements. Just give us a little money. Eric did it not only for himself,
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:45.360]   but his family. I don't know. Do you have to give up your US citizenship if you become a citizen of Cyprus?
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.040]   I don't think he denounced it. I think he denounced it.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:49.760]   He still has to pay American taxes even if you don't live there.
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:51.840]   Yeah, they're going to get you.
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:55.520]   Until he denounces it, he still paying American taxes. This isn't really a tax thing.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.920]   It's more of an access to countries than anything. I think he just wants to be able to travel around.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:03.760]   He used to change his name to get his privacy back. That's what he told us to do.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:09.360]   I mean, in the last couple of years, it has because of all the reciprocity with what the United
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:13.200]   States has been doing. Things have gotten harder to travel, not that we noticed this year,
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:20.160]   but I think that being able to have more flexibility is probably part of the process.
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:26.640]   You, YouTubers, might be disappointed to know you will not be on the bus this year in the YouTube
[02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:34.400]   rewind because they're in Gombe one. I feel so weird about this. I feel like this is YouTube
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:39.920]   sort of copping out on one sense because 2020 has not been a... YouTube rewind was originally a way
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:44.880]   to sort of celebrate YouTube. Eventually, it became a way to sell YouTube to advertisers,
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:49.520]   and it became increasingly separate from what the platform actually was, and sort of cringy for
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:53.920]   the people who were involved with it, culminating in, I think, one of the most disliked videos in
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:57.520]   the history of YouTube. Was that last year or the year before? I think it was the year before.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:01.120]   Last year, they went back to the top 10 list. They did basically the Watchmojo thing,
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:05.440]   but it feels like there's been a lot of people struggling really hard on YouTube, and they could
[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:10.080]   tell that story, and they'd be maybe because it's not an advertiser-friendly story. They're just
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:16.320]   abdicating it completely. So first time since 2010 that YouTube will not have a year-end rewind.
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:21.440]   And I wonder whether this is a convenient way for YouTube to kill it off. I think it was starting
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:28.640]   to become a bit of a liability. Yeah, the 2018 was the most disliked video of all time on YouTube.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:35.280]   So I think that we could see them just letting it slip off into the dark next year. It'd be
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:44.320]   highly likely. Yeah. It's a recipe for disaster. On the one hand, you are rewarding your top creators
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:50.320]   by giving them some prominence. But boy, if you mishandled it as they did in 2018,
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:56.960]   it's not- Most of those creators are doing okay. They don't need the help.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:05:02.400]   And also you can't win. Why is it PewDiePie here? Why is it Gameop here? Why aren't these tech
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:10.160]   creators? 18 million thumbs down on the 2018 rewind. However, it did get 208 million views.
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:17.120]   So that's not- YouTube made some ad money. Yeah. That's right. That's right.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:22.880]   I just thought I don't know anything about these things. I'm just curious. I watch these things.
[02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:27.040]   I don't know who any of the people are. The guy was like- The guy was like this guy. He was like,
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:30.960]   it's like deciding not to be the best of Twitch just because 2020 was hard. Right. No, we're doing it.
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.840]   Yeah. We're doing it, man. We're doing it.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.920]   Let's see. What else? EU hits Amazon with anti-trust charges.
[02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:51.360]   Yeah. Okay. That was going to be rough. Yeah. EU is really cranky about it. What?
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:54.000]   They don't like it if you're a store- What was that? What's going on?
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.720]   What's going on? We're looking at space. Was that the main engine shutdown?
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:06.560]   John's my space expert. We're nine minutes into the launch. Oh, oh, oh, that was- I love it when
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:13.120]   they do that. That was the recovery of the rocket landing on the platform. That's what that was.
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:17.680]   I love it. I'm watching him miracle every time. Every time. Only one of them this time, John.
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:19.920]   Only one recovered. All right.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:25.680]   There was only one. You only needed one, huh? All right.
[02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:32.400]   YouTube- I'm sorry, YouTube. European Union and YouTube, I confuse them all the time. The EU has
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:39.200]   unveiled formal antitrust charges against Amazon for abusing its dominance in online shopping.
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:44.240]   They've also opened a second investigation into the company's business practices.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:52.240]   The investigation for the first part started last year to probe its dual role as a marketplace
[02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:59.280]   and retailer. The concern is that Amazon uses information it gains from being a marketplace for
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:05.760]   third parties to create its own competing products. The investigation found Amazon feeds non-public
[02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:10.960]   seller data such as number of products ordered and selling revenue into its own retail algorithms
[02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:15.920]   to help it decide which new products to launch and the price of each new author. Kind of like
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:20.160]   grocery stores probably do when they- With house brands. With house brands, right?
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:25.280]   It is, but at a whole different scale. Yeah, well, yeah. So everything-
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:31.440]   Amazon does is- Hold a different scale. And I think that that is the- I don't know how you
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.520]   solve this problem. I mean, I do think that Amazon's in a very- It's obviously a very advantageous
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:40.320]   position for them to be in, but I think that it is starting to get to a point where
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:46.720]   people need to look at it at least. And I don't- As you know, I don't usually say that,
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:50.640]   but it is starting to get to a point where as a retailer, as someone who's coming up with a new
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:56.000]   product, how do you come up with that new product without just being run over?
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.080]   As soon as you start being successful, they're going to take it away. And that's the-
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:06.000]   So I think that that's a really interesting problem that I don't have a solution for, but it's
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:10.400]   complicated. Because it doesn't necessarily hurt the consumer directly. Consumer will
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:19.360]   pay the same or less for something of equal, but does it stifle innovation because people can't.
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.920]   Because I know for me, the moment someone says there's a product, I immediately want to go to-
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:28.480]   I immediately just see, is it on Amazon? Because I don't want to put in a new credit card. I don't
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:32.720]   want to go through the signup process. I want to just go to Amazon and have it shipped to me.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.040]   For you in two days. Yep.
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:43.680]   The part that gets crazy is when- Because the common question, Alex, is it stifling technology
[02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:50.240]   or innovation as you put it? There's many products out there that are very good,
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:57.040]   that don't exist on Amazon, but they still sell lots of. Francis Road doesn't sell on Amazon.
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:00.480]   You can buy Road stuff there because people resell it. Other people sell it.
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:09.760]   But you can't go to Amazon and buy a PodMic or a Roadcaster Pro or direct from Road. Road is
[02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:17.840]   now one of the top microphone companies in the game. How do you say that? Amazon did take
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:22.880]   a very similar S-Mic that made an Amazon-based version, but nobody on YouTube wants to Amazon
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:29.760]   basically. Everybody wants the Road PodMic. You can't get one. I get it. They're normally
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:36.320]   talking about nuts and hats and socks and things like that. I don't know. Walmart's been doing it.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:43.440]   I think this gets back into it. To your point, what's important for a lot of retailers or
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:47.200]   anyone making something is your brand. It's how many people trust that brand. The reason that
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.600]   Road can still sell these things outside of Amazon and Amazon can even copy it and it doesn't matter
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:57.200]   is because Road has built a level of trust with their users, with the public in the same way that
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:02.560]   whether it's Blackmagic or Sony or other people. We have some level of trust that that's going to
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:13.200]   be a certain thing. Road has benefited from that. You look at in a lot of ways, if I come with
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:19.920]   something that's remotely interesting, whether it's Amazon or Chinese manufacturers, you end up
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:28.400]   with a hard to get something out there that isn't that simple that might have some ingenuity but
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:35.840]   might not be patented. It's hard to make that work. I think Amazon is this giant snake that's just
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:41.280]   grabbing on to all those things. Again, as individual users, I don't think that we necessarily
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:47.920]   are impacted by it. I know that when we've worked with large information companies,
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:52.880]   we've got a lot of innovations that we want to do that we're very careful not to show them.
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:57.920]   Because we're just like, "Well, that'll be it." They'll just take it away and they'll run off with it.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:01.520]   That was with Microsoft. Remember back in the day, you would never show Microsoft anything.
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:09.440]   You're kind of dancing with... I wonder if at some point we're going to see kind of a head-to-head
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:17.520]   between Amazon and Alibaba, the Chinese giant. They had Singles Day was 11-11, it was four days
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:28.960]   ago. $56 billion in sales in one day. They're spreading it out now. It's going to continue for...
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:35.280]   Well, it started November 1st, I guess it ended November 12th. Gross merchandise value surpassed
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.800]   $3.56.42 billion as of Wednesday. That's not a final figure.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:47.120]   I think you've got two mammoths. You've got one in the east, one in the west. It's going to be
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.680]   very interesting to see. At some point, they're going to come head-to-head. That's going to be the
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:56.880]   next World War. It's not going to be between nations. It's going to be between online shopping
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:06.400]   giants. TikTok, we mentioned that TikTok was saying, "Hey, what up? What's going on? Are you going to
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:11.680]   still shut us down?" They did get an extension. Cepheus responded saying, "You and I have till
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:18.240]   November 27th." It's complicated, though, because a judge stayed it. I don't know what's exactly going
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:26.000]   on. Cepheus, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, said, "You have till the 27th to
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:32.480]   divest." Is Oracle going to buy it? I don't even know. Oracle and Walmart, right?
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:36.640]   Walmart. I don't even know. TikTok was saying, "Hey, we haven't heard it from anybody."
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:44.240]   Commerce Department says, "It cannot, thanks to the court order, shut down TikTok. They were going
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:48.960]   to ban companies from providing internet hosting or services for the app, but the
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:57.040]   Judge Wendy Beatlestone, my favorite judge in Philadelphia, said, "The lawsuit was brought by three TikTok
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:04.640]   stars. Comedian Douglas Marlin, fashion guru, cassette, Renabe, musician, Alex Chambers, they said,
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:10.160]   "Your honor, you shut down TikTok. You shut down all my income." And the judge said, "Yeah, that would
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:18.560]   be bad." So the judge stated, "The TikTok is petitioned for the divestiture order to be invalidated."
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:25.520]   There was an election. I don't know what's...
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:28.960]   It's almost like companies, governments shouldn't try to regulate specific individual companies,
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:33.040]   but make regulations that cover industries. So let's say talks should be regulated as part of
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:37.040]   Facebook and Twitter and TikTok, and Huawei should be regulated as part of
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:40.880]   internet. Targeting companies leads down to very long past.
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:47.600]   It was just a kind of aimless political ploy for votes.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:49.200]   They lost interest after the election.
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:52.560]   It's like the phone went dead because no one cares anymore.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:59.120]   And it does kind of lean towards the capriciousness of the current political atmosphere that we're
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:07.440]   going to go down some crazy path for no real reason. So I think that it'll probably just
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:09.680]   wind away into the end of the day.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:10.240]   I think so.
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:11.200]   Do you know, into the...
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:15.520]   I think there's still something to where a lot of it also came up from,
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:21.760]   again, the regular traditional media. They talked the story a lot because at the end of the day,
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:26.960]   they're losing eyeball time to the burgeoning medias, if you would call them.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:33.680]   And if you remember, say what, circa 2000, I want to say three, when Viacom just wanted to...
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:39.280]   I'm sorry, I took that back. 2007, when Viacom wanted to blow up YouTube,
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.840]   and there was all these fights and stuff, and then they went into a room,
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:43.600]   and they shook hands, and they shook it out.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:50.240]   And all of a sudden, lots of Viacom shows had YouTube channels that got millions and millions
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:56.240]   of views, and they still existed this day. So initially, you were the threat, and then they
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:59.200]   figured out how they could use you. So they put the lawsuit away,
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:03.600]   worked it into, let's make it work to our benefit as well, and then now it's normal.
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.840]   Right? Stephen Colbert is on YouTube two seconds after he goes off the air,
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:10.640]   because it's a very lucrative position.
[02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:19.760]   Yeah. Karsten's first internet video. I don't remember this. We talked last week about how
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:25.280]   they've remastered the dancing baby. Remember that one? Do you remember the exploding...
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:30.080]   They remastered it? They remastered it. You didn't see it? Yeah, they made it...
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:37.200]   It's because it was... I guess it was... You probably know Alex. It was like a sample 3D model from
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:40.800]   one of those programs. Let me put an Ally McBeal, didn't that some point?
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:46.080]   And then it was big an Ally McBeal. The Oregon Historical Society
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:55.680]   took the original exploding whale footage from 1970, 50 years ago, it was 16 millimeter,
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:05.760]   and they remastered it. And now, ladies and gentlemen, oh, it's going to load an ad. I don't
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:13.360]   want to see an ad. Here we go. The special remastered version of the first video.
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:18.400]   Oh, it's still loading an ad. Karsten... No, here we go. Here we go.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:25.200]   Okay, see how much better that looks now than it used to? Let's play it. Let's play.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:30.880]   Not only had a whale of a problem on its hands, it had a stinking whale of a problem.
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:36.400]   What to do with one 45 foot 8 ton whale dead on arrival? Oh my god.
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:41.920]   We're moved back a quarter of a mile away. The sand dunes there were covered with spectators and
[02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:48.720]   land-lubber newsmen shortly to become land-blubber newsmen with a blasted blubber beyond all
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:54.720]   believable bounds. This is the first viral video, apparently, Ted. This is more exciting than the
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:17:08.080]   launch of the Falcon. I uh, you're excited. All right, Alex. Oh god. Oh no, here comes the blubber.
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:17.840]   That is so cool. Okay. It's all over. All over. The highway.
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:23.920]   Stop rolling immediately after the blast. The humor of the entire situation suddenly gave way to
[02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:30.000]   a run for survival as huge chunks of whale blubber fall everywhere. Okay, thank you Karsten.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:34.640]   That's at least barbecue at that point. Did you start being... It's totally... This is really remastered.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:41.280]   I don't understand. I just... You know how many neural engines it took to render that out later?
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:46.720]   All of them. You could have done it on an M1 chip very, very quickly.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:52.160]   Same thing. Yeah, I'm going. See? I got it in. We're going to call full circle. Ladies and
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:58.800]   gentlemen, I think we have done our duty to you all and then some. So I'm going to take this
[02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:03.840]   opportunity to say thank you to our fabulous panel. Renee, we'll see you back here on Tuesday for
[02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:13.680]   another Mac break weekly. Yes, sir. I think we can go in an even deeper dive on the M1 chip and find
[02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:17.920]   out what you found out. Maybe we'll even get to see your review. I don't know if it'll be out
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:24.400]   by Tuesday, but we'll find out. I'm not saying that he is reviewing it or he has his hands on
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:30.400]   anything or he would even know anything about it. But if he did, maybe we'd find out more
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:35.520]   on Tuesday. I also want to thank Alex. Alex, you've got to come back to Mac break weekly whenever
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:41.520]   you can. I'm ready. Okay. So now that the election's over, you've got some time on your hands.
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:44.800]   Yeah, I've got a little bit of production over the next couple of weeks and then after that,
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:52.080]   I'm ready to go. All right. Nice. Alex, you can find him, of course, at Alex Lindsey on Twitter,
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:58.240]   l-i-n-d-s-a-y, youtube.com/AlexLinsey if you want to find out more about office hours. Every morning,
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:05.280]   seven days a week for three hours, they discuss video production technology. They have guests.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:09.280]   It's really an amazing show. You do a great job. It's so nice to see you again, Alex. Thank you
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:18.000]   for joining us. It could be your doc, rock. He's a YouTube celeb, youtube.com/docrock. Also doing
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.440]   double duty this week. Thank you for being on Mac break. We're back here on week 46, 2020.
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:30.640]   We set a record. I got tweeted twice. Tweeted twice. Tweeted. Tweeted twice. Tweet about it
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:38.080]   that you got tweeted twice. Okay. Okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. We do a Twitter every Sunday,

[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:49.920]   But you don't have to because we have on demand versions of the show available on our website,
[02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:55.840]   twitter.tv. There's a YouTube channel. I hear. I don't know. The kids tell me that you should
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:20:02.000]   subscribe and smash the bell. And that way, something wonderful will happen. There it is.
[02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:09.120]   Right? Right? Where is it? Right there? Right there? You can also use your favorite podcast
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:13.360]   application and subscribe. That'll be another way to get it automatically the minute it's available
