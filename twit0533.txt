[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:05.480]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.840]   And it's always fun because I get some of the best, most interesting journalists together
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.280]   and we just basically it's a Gabfest.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.280]   We actually try to figure out what the collective noun for hosts would be.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.400]   I'm at a Gabfest of hosts.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.520]   Mark Millian is here from Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   Good to have you.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.000]   I'm on board with Gabfest.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You have a new title.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.480]   You're now the business tech editor?
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.880]   Is that new?
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   No, not exactly.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   You were global.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   You were the global.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.640]   Yeah, I had more of a focus on global.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.120]   Now it's just that anywhere in the world.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   That's where Mark Millian is.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.880]   It's still global I guess if I'm focused on everything.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.480]   But yeah, just general technology.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.120]   You have a bulldog if I'm not mistaken.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120]   I have a French bulldog.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   Yes.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.200]   A French bulldog which is almost as good as a pug.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.120]   That's what Lauren Hockenberry, Hockenson, I almost called you Hockenberry.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.120]   I did call you Hockenberry.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.120]   I did.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.440]   Laura Hockensit is like a Hockenberry.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.640]   The son of a Hockenberry would be Lauren Hockensit.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   I guess.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640]   Is that Swedish?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.400]   I don't know.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   Is Hockensit Swedish?
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   It is.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   First time on Twitter.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   Welcome.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   Thank you.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.840]   You are, I love your bow.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   Thank you.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.000]   Very few Twitter hosts actually wear bows in their hair.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   You might be the first.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.640]   You know, it's something that I just sort of picked up over time.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.440]   I have about learning.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.960]   Is it your trademark?
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   It is.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.280]   I don't think I've ever done a Twitch show without them.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.720]   I've been out every time I've been on Tech News today and Tech News tonight.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   You were the bow.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   Love it.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.960]   Actually, I got inquired by one of the producers as to how many bows I actually own.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.160]   Well, now we know.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.320]   It's a lot.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.360]   You have a knot of bows.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.000]   I wear bow ties frequently and had I known I would have worn my bow tie today.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I apologize.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.760]   Look who else is here, not from Sweden or from Bloomberg?
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.000]   Patrick Bejaw from France.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.760]   Hey, so I usually wear scarves and it's sort of become my French trademark.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   Is it really?
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   I'm not wearing mine now.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   Now you're joking.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   With the magnificent.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   No, I am.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   Wait, wait.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   I'm going to go get a scarf.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   Now I have to.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.960]   While I explained the professional things.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.600]   Last time he was here, he worked at Blizzard, but now he is a full-time podcaster.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.400]   Strange, though, that may sound with Le Ronde voutet French spin dot FR or actually French
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   spin don't come.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Look.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   Yes.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   Now I remember you do wear a star.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.440]   You do wear a star like an entire closet of scarves.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.240]   I always, always have a scarf handy not too far for me because at some points during
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.800]   the day I might get scarf panic and I have to have one.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.440]   There you go.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.000]   I've heard that exists in France.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It's Paris.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It does.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Oh my god.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   But only in France.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.120]   And for today's show, I don't know if we have it available to you.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.320]   We have the binocular version of this show for no apparent reason because there's nothing
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.400]   you can do with that.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.760]   But I got my Rico Theta S camera, which I pre-ordered months ago, finally came.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   350 buck, 3D camera.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.480]   It does 3D stills.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.400]   And then you can do 3D video, which I, but we haven't figured out how to do it live yet.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.760]   You need some software somehow to stitch this.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.640]   It's live, but it's not, you know, it doesn't look like anything.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.000]   It looks like you're looking at us through a snow globe.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.120]   It looks like it should work in cardboard, right?
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.120]   But it doesn't.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120]   Really?
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   But it doesn't.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   No, you know why?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120]   Because each one is in a separate camera.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   One's the front, one's the back camera.
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   You need to stitch.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.080]   If you looked at this in cardboard, you would have one eye seeing the front and one eye
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   seeing the back.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.880]   That would be kind of weird.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.640]   Only good for certain kinds of lizards, but not in fact for humans.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.160]   But we're going to, but we apparently, Rico is coming out with stitching software.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.520]   But that's what Google with a jump thing with a 16 camera rig.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.960]   But that's like $10,000, the GoPro version of that.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   This is $358.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   I'm very intrigued.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.280]   Anyway, we'll keep you posted and eventually we'll figure out how to make this a live
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.120]   stream.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:11.480]   Well, this was the week we got quarterly results from Google Microsoft, Amazon, and boy, this
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   was the quarter of the cloud.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.320]   Is that the takeaway from all this, Mark Millian?
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.000]   That is the common thread that all three of those companies have invested a lot into
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.200]   those businesses, Amazon being the first that got out way ahead of this move to the cloud.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.040]   But Google and Microsoft being the latest comer to that group, but they're all way ahead
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.120]   of the legacy companies like IBM and Oracle who are just getting hammered by this transition
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.560]   in the industry.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.960]   You see in the results from those three companies, they just absolutely, I mean their stocks
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.760]   were up anywhere between 8 and 12% after the earnings came out.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:04.840]   They added a combined something like $85 billion in market cap in a single day.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   Wow.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.400]   Microsoft had the highest stock price it's had since 2000 since the Department of Justice
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.120]   inquiries into Microsoft's monopoly.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.760]   It's been a stagnant stock for years.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.840]   I think this is, boy, this is at least Wall Street's judgment on Sachin and Della, that
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.840]   he's done the right thing.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.640]   He's moved Microsoft into the cloud.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.160]   The other big story, at least from Microsoft's point of view, was that Bing for the first
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.520]   time ever is profitable.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.640]   Bing made a billion dollars.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.720]   That's a shocker.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.920]   The Microsoft, I guess it's more than just search, right?
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.680]   It's just Microsoft online services, right?
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.000]   I think they did single out Bing making a billion dollars.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.840]   But you have to, I mean, yes, they are profitable, but they're not profitable in the sense that
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.400]   we think of search engine being profitable like, well, basically like Google.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.640]   It's mostly things like Yahoo using them and embedded into other OS's like Windows 10
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.480]   and iOS for Siri.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.320]   And in fact, Yahoo is moving away.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.840]   So it might be the end of the line for...
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.040]   So it is profitable, but it's not...
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:24.200]   People didn't all of a sudden started to go to Bing.com and start searching for stock.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:30.280]   Microsoft revenue is a whole down 12%, but that is the earnings beat the estimates, and
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.600]   that's really what the Wall Street is looking for.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   You know what the part of the problem for all three companies is they're global companies,
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:42.200]   and the dollar's strength against global currencies means that they didn't make as much money as
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   they could.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.640]   The currency exchange rates were a big problem for these companies.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.160]   That's been an issue for the last year to two years as the dollar has gotten really strong
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.600]   and the euro has gotten very weak, and especially in the last quarter or two as China has disappeared.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.920]   Their growth has gone, you know, has just completely vanished.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.640]   But a lot of these companies, all these global companies have hedging programs to minimize
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.760]   the risk from currency.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.480]   They buy euros and they do some trading and things.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   Exactly.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.400]   Yeah, they invest in other things in certain markets to kind of hedge against any fluctuations
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.680]   in currency, but it's...
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.840]   I mean, there's still...
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   There's no perfect...
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   There's no silver bullet against currency fluctuation.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.920]   It's hard to read the results at Microsoft because the new reporting structure is extremely
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   confusing.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.800]   There are three segments, productivity and business processes, Intelligent Cloud, and believe it
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.680]   or not, they have a segment called More Personal Computing.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.120]   Productivity, which is office, SharePoint, Skype, Exchange, Dynamics, Intelligent Cloud,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.640]   Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server, System Center, Visual Studio, Enterprise Services,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.760]   More Personal Computing, Retail OEM and Volume Licensing for Windows, Patent Revenue, Windows
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:08.860]   Phone Revenue, such as it is, Hardware Devices, Xbox and Gaming Revenue Advertising and Search
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.860]   Road.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.560]   In other words, miscellaneous.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.060]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.060]   Microsoft's earnings are...
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.060]   This is a mess.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.060]   I can't even...
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:21.760]   And Intelligent Cloud, you would assume means Cloud, and yet Office 365 is not included
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.760]   in there, which is a cloud version of Office.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   I'm not drawing cloud products.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.440]   So just to break it up, revenue of $6.3 billion for productivity with an income of $3.1 billion,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.640]   those are both declines, which you might expect.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.800]   Because cloud was up a lot.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   Intelligent Cloud, revenue of $6 billion, operating income, $2.4 billion, that's a 14% increase
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   in profit.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.600]   More Personal Computing was down 4% with a mere $1.6 billion.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Initially.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   But there's...
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.600]   Because of this big industry shift to cloud revenue...
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.040]   It's up in the right place, right?
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   Right.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   It's up in the right place.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   What...
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.640]   You know, the industry and analysts all seem to think is kind of the future of where the
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.040]   industry is going.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.280]   All the companies, the three who all reported earnings on the same day that show promise
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:18.960]   in this area, they're getting rewarded for it by investors.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:28.440]   And cloud revenue ends up looking very different in earnings than selling a box of windows
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.880]   for $3, $400.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.440]   Why is that?
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.520]   Because with selling windows or selling office, you sell it all at once.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.520]   It's a huge...
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.480]   You got your big revenue, but that customer may not buy from you again for three or four
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   years.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.400]   But cloud is like every month, you get a little check.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.720]   Investors love cloud right now because it's like Netflix.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.160]   It's like a subscription model.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.160]   And you can kind of...
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.560]   It's more predictable, isn't it?
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.160]   It's more predictable source of revenue which investors like.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160]   Amazon is...
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.760]   I always thought a retail company would know.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.480]   Amazon's a cloud company more than anything else.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   Net sales at Amazon...
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   Well, I don't know.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   I can't.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.480]   I can't.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480]   I can't read anymore of these numbers.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.760]   Amazon is kind of this unseen behemoth in cloud.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.840]   I mean, everybody who is anybody where they're salt in cloud knows about AWS and how important
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.800]   it is and how violent it is to so many companies.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.000]   But most people just think of Amazon as the place where they buy their diapers.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Right.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.520]   And it's remarkable how they've sort of silently been able to take over cloud and not only
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.560]   that but sort of held back and grouped their cloud profits and structure in a way to essentially
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:42.240]   lay low and capture the business before everybody else got wise to it because now AWS is ubiquitous.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.240]   And Jeff Bezos is one of the top 10 most richest men and people in the world, right?
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.360]   He shot just after their earnings.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.920]   He shot up to number three richest American.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.800]   He made...
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.400]   It's funny money.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:03.160]   It's stock money but he made $2.9 billion in one day in the stock price increase.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.280]   He owns a newspaper for fun.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.640]   It's mind boggling.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.720]   I wish there were more Jeff Bezos who would subsidize newspapers.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.880]   Bezos is worth $53 billion.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.080]   Third richest person in the US.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.080]   The Koch brothers must be unhappy.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.600]   Yeah, they're no longer number.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   We're number four or whatever.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.960]   That's not as fun as saying we're number one.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.920]   That's just phenomenal.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.840]   But I think you're right, Lauren, when you point out that Amazon, despite the fact of
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.880]   appearances, they really are the cloud leader, aren't they?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.600]   I mean, there's lots of other companies.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.480]   Microsoft and Google, you'd think, would be cloud leaders.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.040]   But Amazon saw the potential of the cloud and launched web services long before Azure
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.840]   or Google services.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.640]   And now it's integral into not only a lot of ways that companies do business but also,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   I mean, every app spins up in its sense of AWS practically.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:05.360]   And they're gaining a lot of reliable money from a lot of companies that are not going
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   anywhere.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.560]   And they've sort of established themselves as top dog.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.800]   It's interesting to see other people veer into cloud, you know, seeing kind of how Google
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.360]   finally steps into the arena and how Microsoft grows.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.560]   But I mean, at this point, it's hard to think about anybody actually becoming a formidable
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   foe to AWS.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.560]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   That's not what you'd think.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.880]   But Bezos, in fact, I think, as I remember, I read the Amazon book that was almost an
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.880]   afterthought.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.800]   We've got some extra, we've got all these computing power, which we don't use after 5
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.120]   PM.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.200]   Maybe there's something we could do with it.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.880]   It wasn't, it wasn't a huge big strategic move.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.800]   The other thing of, I think maybe this is telling is you watch the Walton fortune slowly
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   dwindle away.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.840]   They lost about a quarter of their net worth.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:59.760]   That's brick and mortar retail while Amazon and particularly Jeff Bezos, sword.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.360]   Is that, is that just a coincidence or is it also a, I think it's got to reflect the
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.360]   change in how we shop?
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.480]   Well, one, I believe that Amazon is now the largest retailer in the world.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.320]   I believe that they've officially passed Walmart.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.720]   Uh, there you go.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.320]   One, two, I'm finding it really hard to not make a good night.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.520]   John boy joke.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.280]   Well, the Walton family.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.440]   Is they're all going to sleep.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.160]   Um, yeah, they're all going to sleep now.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.480]   Uh, but it's true.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.000]   It's now, Amazon is now surpassing brick and mortar stores.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.160]   There's no such thing as this online retail versus brick and mortar.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:38.140]   I mean, Amazon is retail at this point and Walmart is struggling as our other brick and
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.140]   mortar store.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.240]   So it's interesting to see how the landscape will change and whether or not going brick
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:53.680]   and mortar is going to ultimately be a niche market as we get more savvy with our Amazon
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   prime now button deliver yesterday.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.480]   I got that dash.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.040]   I thought about, you know, I got one for toilet paper.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.200]   You know, that button you press and they send you toilet paper and, uh, I got a 12 year
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.600]   at home and we got like, I got 18 cases of toilet paper because he kept, he kept pressing
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   it.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   You can get notifications though.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.920]   Well, yeah, I had it set up for me to auto order because I'm okay.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.960]   Um, it says, well, we won't order a new one until the old one comes, but they're so damn
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.080]   fast that by the time I noticed this was happening every other day, I was getting a
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   case of continental.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.280]   I finally, I only realized, oh my God, Michael's present the button.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.480]   So I've hidden it.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.680]   You know, I don't know if, uh, how they're reporting their earnings, but another thing
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.920]   that Amazon has going for them is how international they are.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:45.720]   I, I've noticed in France as well, uh, a couple of years ago, a lot of people were using
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.520]   Amazon, but a lot of people were a little bit defiant and thinking, you know, basic
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.960]   and not anti Americanism, but thinking, oh, they're the big American company and we have
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.480]   to preserve our own blah, blah, blah, and you know, whatever.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.800]   And slowly with their Amazon prime and their incredible services and in spite of all the
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:11.000]   bad press they've been having, uh, I've, I've seen more and more of my friends starting
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.080]   to use Amazon with prime, which is magical.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.320]   You know, you just press the button.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.120]   So you even have prime and friends.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.120]   Of course.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.920]   And they're, uh, improving it all the time too.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.280]   Uh, sounds very, you have to order me.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.280]   I apologize.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   Why you would have, you have prime in France.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.520]   We got to have that in the third world.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.200]   A couple of years ago.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   No.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.320]   Um, but you know, until a few, a few, um, months ago, you had to, uh, order before 3pm
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.200]   in order to get your order, uh, on the next day.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.400]   Now it can be later in some places.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.080]   And so my friends who are tech heads are, are using it, but in the few, in the last
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.560]   few months, uh, I've noticed my mom is using it too.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:59.240]   She just tried it because I basically made her and, uh, and now she lives in a slightly
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.640]   remote location.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.920]   She can't live without it.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.160]   She has just become better, you know, the way she shops.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.560]   She's like, if I need something, I'm not going to take the car and go somewhere.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.960]   I'm, it's going to come to me.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.720]   That actually was the knock on Amazon for a long time.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.760]   Was it was, you know, very successful in the US and maybe the UK, but not an international
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   seller.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.840]   That sounds like that's changing.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.480]   And that's of course going to make a big difference in overall sales.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.520]   What I think is really going to be important is how Amazon tackles, uh, Asia, um, a lot
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:33.520]   of Asian countries specifically China, uh, and, uh, what is the, uh, Alibaba Alibaba.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.600]   And, uh, Korea has a G market, uh, which are both incredibly popular and sort of like
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.840]   the, the patriotic choice when you, when you live in those countries, you, you use those
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.800]   and it'll be interesting to see whether or not Amazon will actually try to move into Asia
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.440]   in any concerted effort and really make, uh, their presence known in, in places where
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.720]   they're really shocker the minority, uh, retail system.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.920]   You feel like there's a collision between Alibaba and Amazon about that.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.920]   For sure.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:07.080]   And, but Amazon is investing an insane amount of money into India, which has, you know,
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:14.000]   for as behind as India's, uh, internet economy is e-commerce in particular is an area where
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.800]   they're one of the biggest players in the world.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:24.160]   There's two, uh, homegrown companies called, uh, Flipkart, um, and Snapdeal, who, uh, do
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.640]   just insane amounts of, I mean, it's the second most populous country in the world.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.320]   And Amazon is seeing this pop up like right before their eyes and so they pledge over
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.360]   a billion dollars to invest into India.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:41.200]   Um, and China's another good example with, uh, with Alibaba is an, an area where I don't
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.480]   know that they're going to be able to push in at this point.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.360]   Alibaba is a gigantic, gigantic company.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.160]   And Alibaba would love to be here, I think.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.080]   I mean, I don't think that their, their, their ambitions are no less than, uh, Amazon's.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.600]   The problem Amazon has is they've, if they paved the way, right?
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.840]   They showed you how to do it.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.760]   And, uh, and so it's, uh, it's no longer a secret sauce.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.240]   The, the battleground is going to be some of these developing markets, like India, which
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.080]   is already more developed than a lot of the, a lot of countries say in like East, Southeast
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.640]   Asia and Africa, that some of these, uh, some of these global companies are starting to
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.640]   look more closely at.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.800]   You just build the infrastructure.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   That's what they do.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.000]   That's what they did in the US.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.320]   Well, infrastructure, literally the infrastructure is an interesting piece of the puzzle because
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:29.920]   in India, for example, there are no like FedEx or UPS that service a lot of these areas.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:37.280]   Russia, um, also as a company called, uh, ozone, I think that they had to buy up a logistics
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   network by all their own trucks to deliver in person.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.040]   And a lot of you think they'll do that?
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.360]   In fact, they'd probably prefer to do that Amazon.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.360]   Sure.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.320]   A ton of money goes to UPS because of Amazon.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.240]   They're really tough, uh, with UPS negotiating those deals.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.920]   Wouldn't they rather, uh, just do it themselves?
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920]   Maybe.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.160]   I mean, I do see some, some Amazon branded trucks driving around San Francisco.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.720]   That's the Amazon now stuff, isn't it?
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   The same day.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.480]   Prime now is finally available, which is interesting because you would think that that would come
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.240]   to San Francisco much sooner, but actually it's been working pretty, pretty well in New
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   York City.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.240]   I have not.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.240]   Although I've really thought about it.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.640]   I was sick all week this last week and was like, Oh, should I use prime now to order
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.640]   myself soup?
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.280]   And then I was like, no, I should go outside and see some like people.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.280]   I did.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.080]   I made the social choice.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.080]   I made the wrong choice.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.520]   Uh, but I, what I have heard, I mean, uh, Amazon prime now is actually really interesting
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.280]   when it comes to interactions with Amazon's real time deals and sales.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.840]   Um, that's really where it can get interesting is if you are looking at something and all
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:43.160]   of a sudden it goes on sale, you can get the prime now and they'll send it to you right
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.040]   away and it's easier to get things that might otherwise sell out.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.560]   That's what happened on Amazon prime day when they had the discounted echo, I believe.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.320]   And also a couple of the other stuff they had it as a separate stock in prime now that
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.520]   you can access and get sneaky.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.520]   I know.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   It's crazy.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   And I'm like, Oh, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,

[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:45.520]   considering how Sorkin feels about tech and about -- Oh, he hates tech, yeah. And people who are in tech or run tech companies, I can't believe that they didn't have some random person somewhere.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:57.520]   I don't know the person who was lint rolling Steve Jobs's Turtle Act saying something along the lines of how, you know, being so close to technology is apt to change your moral character or some blah blah.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   Actually, I felt like there wasn't a lot of soap boxing against technology in the movie. I don't recall him doing a lot of that. I mean, he does do a lot of that in interviews and in terms of his movies.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   Well, even Danny Boer, the director, who we had a great interview with. I really liked Danny Boer. Said the problem with these tech titans is they've become virtual governments and nobody, they have no oversight.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   And so people like Jobs, Larry Page, Wheeled Mense Power, without -- they're not elected officials without any oversight. It's not a bad point of view, a bad point to make, I should say, but that also sounds like a political point of view.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.520]   Like, we need to take these guys down a notch. They need to be more accountable.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:52.520]   Yeah, I mean, they should be accountable. I wouldn't say that they're dictators. I mean, they're -- we vote for them with our dollars by buying their products and investors, you know, give them their money based on --
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:58.520]   You know, one of the problems with that, though, is we don't really know what we're voting for. For instance, how do we give Google our dollars?
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   You go to Google instead of going to Bing, which just had the first profitable quarter.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:12.520]   But I don't think people are thinking in terms of that, right? They're not saying, "Oh, I'm putting in a vote for Larry Page in the way he runs Google. I'm just using a search engine."
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:23.520]   Well, then -- I think in some cases, people do are aware of the potential issues. For example, data privacy is one concern.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:31.520]   It has some pretty important consequences in Europe, at least. You know, we're very concerned with that issue.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:40.520]   And it does have consequences, and I think it is kind of a voting with your wallet situation.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:47.520]   And certainly the leaders of those companies are concerned with the ability to sell their products.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   I'm not sure, you know, it's equivalent to doing right by your constituency, which arguably politicians don't do either.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.520]   But I mean, there is some form of accountability.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:05.520]   Yeah, I mean, Leo, I don't think you'd be quite caught facing both over the private stations.
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   Yeah, and you're right. I mean, that's one way to do it. Harder, though, with Google. They feel like they're infrastructure.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   Even if you use an iPhone, for instance, you're probably using a lot of Google services.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:22.520]   I just feel like some of these people are a little bit more immune from that kind of pressure.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:31.520]   Google's, by the way, quarter was fairly good as well. Revenue of $18.7 billion. That's 13% year over year growth.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:43.520]   Mobile search revenue, once again, very big. Operating income, $4.7 billion with using general accounting practices.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:47.520]   You have to be able, this is part of your job, isn't this Mark, willing to read these things?
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, I love GAP. I love GAP and non-GAP.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:58.520]   The looted EPS of 573 and 735, respectively. GAP and non-GAP.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.520]   I don't know any of that means I don't care either.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:08.520]   Apple TV's coming next week. We're going to run out and buy one.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.520]   I'm ordering tomorrow. Monday. Now, is it midnight tonight?
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   Midnight tomorrow? When is it?
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.520]   I would assume midnight tonight. That's usually how they do it.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   I don't think they've gone that granular. But...
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   Yeah, I'm looking for it. I mean, Apple TV, I use every day.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   I just got the new Roku 4, 4K. Apple TV's not.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   It does have speech search, but I haven't really played with it much yet.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:39.520]   The fire has speech search as well. The thing that's most interesting to me on Apple TV is some of the things you can tell Siri to do in that are actually pretty cool.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:47.520]   They spend a lot of time on that. Amazon's voice search, I think, tends to prioritize Amazon services.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.520]   Whereas, Apple's is actually, they don't necessarily prioritize iTunes.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.520]   If you've got a Netflix account, they'll fold that right in.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.520]   They say it's cross-service.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:02.520]   They haven't opened it to everyone yet, but I think that's going to be the key.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:11.520]   First of all, when they open it to just more developers, because for now it's very limited, I'm guessing it's Netflix, Hulu, whatever.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.520]   But the more important thing is the apps. That's the big game changer. Not the search.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:29.520]   The search is cool, but the apps is what's going to have the potential to change things in the set-up box market.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:38.520]   I agree completely. I think the apps could potentially be huge based on what Apple has been able to do in a lot of different categories of devices.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.520]   But your point about Siri is a good one.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:48.520]   Even on the iPhone, developers have been waiting for them to open up a Siri API since Siri came out.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:54.520]   They've shown no signs of doing that, going more of the preferential treatment route.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   I'm sure it's a very complicated problem to get voice search to open that up so any developer can build into it,
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   and not turn it just into a mess of responses.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   But I think that once they get there, that'll potentially create a very interesting product.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:21.520]   Yeah, I wonder about that. I'm a utilitarian, and I just have the new circular Chromecast, which does all my needs.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.520]   Sweet.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.520]   It's so good. It's so good.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:31.520]   I think the thing is that I am a person who uses my Chromecast for very specific things.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:39.520]   I can cast my tabs or I can run Netflix, or if I wanted to on it, a backup device, because I also have a smart TV.
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   It often doubles up on apps and devices.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:53.520]   I think a lot of people are really pushing the idea that Apple TV into a lesser extent, but still an extent that Amazon Fire TV is going to be used for gaming,
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.520]   which put that mess away.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.520]   I try gaming on my Android TV.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.520]   I'm across the road. It's not that compelling on a big screen.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.520]   It's not.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:14.520]   Well, this is where Roku is diverging. They were actually fairly early into doing it, emphasizing games that deals with Angry Birds and others.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.520]   Amazon has a deal with Flappy Bird.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   That's the last thing I want to do.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   And now Roku, we talked to their CEO. They've decided gaming is not the right application for us.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:33.520]   They're pulling back, sniffing out while Apple and Google are pushing much harder into it.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   Roku has to put faster processors in to make that work more memory, more storage, and it brings the price up.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.520]   In fact, note how expensive Apple TV is even compared to the new Roku.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   Meanwhile, they're putting no hardware in for 4K, which Apple TV did not do.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.520]   Yeah, I don't think that's quite ready.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.520]   It's still a little bit early for 4K. You know you're going to buy if it's good.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.520]   It's not early that you're going to get a 4K TV. You can almost not get a 4K TV.
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.520]   Yeah, but it's the market. No, I know you don't want a 4K TV.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:08.520]   But I'm saying if you go into the store and you're looking at high-def TVs, you're almost always now looking at 4K TVs.
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.520]   That's how fast that's for.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.520]   Next year.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:15.520]   Well, if you're not buying a TV this year, but I'm telling you this year, if you're buying a TV, you will be buying a 4K TV.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.520]   What's the upgrade cycle on TV? So it's like 10 years, right?
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   Maybe we'll learn the stores maybe.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   Just want to get back to the gaming question.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:32.520]   Sorry, just want to go back to the gaming thing for just a second and say that one of the assets that Apple might have there is the controller.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:44.520]   Because the touch, I was going to say touch screen, the touch surface on the remote might provide a more adequate way of controlling your game than other set-top boxes have.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:55.520]   And that might help push the gaming ecosystem on Apple TV forward a little bit, because the biggest issue with gaming on any device is the control scheme.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.520]   And with this one, maybe a little bit better.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   That's weird though. They didn't include a controller.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.520]   My Android TV, Nvidia Shield, that's the...
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   You have to order it.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   I mean, they were calling that more as a game content media.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.520]   Amazon $30 controller you can buy.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.520]   The Apple TV supports third party controllers.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.520]   And they sell Apple stores now sell game control.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:23.520]   I think if you're serious at all about gaming on the Apple TV, you have to buy a remote.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.520]   I'm with Lauren, which is that you get a PlayStation.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.520]   Yeah, being a serious gamer on Apple TV is like...
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.520]   This is an oxymoron.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.520]   I can't believe it.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   Right now it will be.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.520]   Oh man, it's a snorzy road.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.520]   Oh man, what's your rig?
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   It's not the...
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.520]   Apple TV.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.520]   I think we talked in a year and there will be a lot of cool games for it.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   I got like a Bluetooth fight stick, man.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:44.520]   Mm-hmm, no.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.520]   No, but Lauren, it's not going to be for serious gamers.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.520]   That's for sure. I think that's established.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.520]   Just like, honestly, an iPhone or an iPad is not for serious gamers either.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   But there are a lot of people who game on them.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.520]   When you game on them, you game on them because you're stuck in line at the DMV or the grocery store.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.520]   You're not going to go home again.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:07.520]   There are a lot of people who spend hours, especially kids, spend like Minecraft on touch screens.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   It's a huge, huge thing.
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   And that's the thing.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   The big question is, are they going to manage to convert those people who play when they have free time?
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   That's the way I usually explain it.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   Casual gamers are players who play when they have time to waste and serious gamers are gamers who make time to play games.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.520]   Right?
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   And are they going to convert one into the other?
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:38.520]   And the big thing is, if they manage to do that, developers are going to be interested because for some reason, psychologically,
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:48.520]   I'm pretty sure you're going to be able to sell a game that plays on your TV for, you know, four, five, seven bucks when that's totally unacceptable on your phone.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.520]   And if some people think, "Well, I'm playing on my phone already.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   I might check out that thing that they're making commercials for on my TV."
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   But there might be an intermediate market that's going to make lots more money to the developers.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   It's a big game.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:11.520]   Here is video from ClashCon, the Clash of Clans conference, which is going on right now.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   People playing Clash of Clans, let me see if I can find it.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   Introducing TV.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.520]   This isn't remarkable.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:26.520]   This is like the faux esports, you know, like, okay, I know I don't look at it, but I love esports so much.
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.520]   Do you watch esports?
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.520]   Yeah, I do.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.520]   Yeah, I watch esports.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.520]   Would you watch somebody playing this game?
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.520]   No, I wouldn't, because I went to Dota in League of Legends.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.520]   Now we're talking.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   This is not as fast moving as League of Legends.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:45.520]   It's not only that, but it's like TikTok toe versus A-don't know, like, chess, basically.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:54.520]   Like, Dota and other mobas require so much of a vast amount of knowledge and like different match-ups and items and all this stuff.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:02.520]   Like, you need to practically take a college course in order to understand all of the schema and aspects that go into mobas.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:07.520]   And here it's just like, throw your guys at the thing, hit the wall, explode it.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.520]   Well, that's mobile gaming, right?
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.520]   That's the thing.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.520]   This is not anywhere in the same league, so to speak.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   Which is interesting, right?
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:23.520]   Because when you look at something like this, you think, like, okay, well, this is what people, like, what Apple and what Amazon have in mind when they're putting forth their lives.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.520]   And when they're putting forth their gaming experiences on a television.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   Which is completely different from the way that I grew up.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:39.520]   As a gamer, you know, I have four brothers and sisters and we had an N64 and you better be good because you didn't want to be the fifth person that was out and not able to play the game.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.520]   Which is how it worked.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   You got your controller taken away from you and given to the other person.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.520]   You lost your privilege.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.520]   They get to play now.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:52.520]   So we were really serious about it, but it's one of those situations where you look at this experience and you think to yourself like, okay, well, if we're looking at modern games, we're not going to be able to play the game.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   So, you're looking at modern gaming as it is now.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:52:07.520]   You have this, but then you have, you know, Sony and Microsoft and you have Oculus and you have Valve and you have all these companies that are pushing into this other direction.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:17.520]   And I sort of wonder whether or not this is actually going to be a good fully realized big screen experience rather than just kind of like a novelty.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:24.520]   So yeah, I can definitely play Crossy Road on my Fire TV, but I'm not going to like sit down for hours and like, we.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520]   I'm agreeing with you.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:26.520]   I'm nothing against Clash of Clans.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:36.520]   We have a Twit Clan and I've been very active in Clash of Clans, but it's mobile gaming is not real gaming and like you would sit down living room gaming.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:42.520]   You can, I mean, they've got all the Final Fantasy games on there now.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.520]   They put out all the good stuff out of Final Fantasy 7. I'm not buying that.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:49.520]   Oh, did they?
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.520]   I'm going to take a three week break when a Fallout 4 comes out. I'm not coming in work.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.520]   That's it. I'm going home.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.520]   Yeah, I'm really excited.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.520]   I feel I have to defend Clash of Clans a little bit.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.520]   No, I love Clash of Clans.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.520]   Oh, you got the Pit Boy edition.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   That's for you to have something to say.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   That's where you put your starters to me in my track.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   You can play Fallout and use the Pit Boy heads up to sprite.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.520]   I don't know. I'm going to finally get Uncharted.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.520]   That's a great game.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.520]   I have not started Uncharted. They just made the remastered Nathan Drake collection.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.520]   I'm going to do that and then I'm going to do the new Uncharted.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.520]   Oh my god, you've never played Uncharted at all?
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:38.520]   Oh, being in college in poor is one of those situations where it was like food or Uncharted.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.520]   And I had to be.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:45.520]   You know what? Just play the second one because the first one is and then jump into the fourth one.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.520]   Because if you do all of them, you're going to get uncharted hangover.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.520]   I know.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.520]   You're not going to appreciate it.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:52.520]   That sounds painful.
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:59.520]   I did play all the way through patiently through Mass Effect 2, but was told not to play Mass Effect 1 in 3.
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.520]   I'm a paragon.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.520]   Wow. Four Christ pretty good. I like Far Cryce pretty fun.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   One of the things Apple TV does do that I'm very excited about is you can...
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   And maybe it's just because I'm an old man.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   But you can say when you're watching a show, what did he just say?
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:21.520]   And Siri will skip back 15 seconds. Turn on closed captioning.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.520]   Replay that segment.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.520]   That's pretty cool. I've had that. I've definitely had those experiences.
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.520]   You can say play from beginning. You can say turn on closed captioning.
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   You can say fast forward two minutes. I don't know why you'd want to do that.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.520]   Who's winning the Cubs game?
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   That's kind of... They should change that.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.520]   That's a low-key burn now.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:45.520]   What did he just say? I love that. Turn on enhanced speech who directed this movie.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:51.520]   I think the idea of having a smart agent in your TV might be a killer app.
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.520]   Less so the gaming, but I think that might be a killer app.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.520]   Well, this is what I'm actually going to go ahead.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.520]   Sorry.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.520]   Oh, thank you.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.520]   Yeah, I think actually the big... That's what Steve Jobs was saying apparently on his deathbed.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:05.520]   I don't know when he said he's cracked it.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:09.520]   I've had a pretty relevatory... revelatory...
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.520]   Yeah, that word. Yeah.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:17.520]   Experience a few years ago. I hadn't used a TV for I think 10 or 15 years.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.520]   And then I moved and I bought a big TV and I thought,
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.520]   "Yay, I'm going to buy a TV and I'm going to have a cable box.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:28.520]   And it's going to be really different from what it was 15 years ago."
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:31.520]   And good lord, it wasn't. It was horrible.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:33.520]   So 15 years ago, at least you had TV for...
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.520]   It is terrible, right?
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.520]   Now you've got a DVR from your cable company.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.520]   I don't know what it's like in France, but it's horrible here.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.520]   It is terrible.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:46.520]   But the main thing is that now that we have all of those services that are completely independent from one another,
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.520]   you never know where what you want to watch is or if it is available.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:55.520]   You can go to the Netflix app, you can go and that's where the series search is really killer.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   It's that you just say what you want to watch and it tells you if it is available
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.520]   and if it is where and how much, you know, if you can buy it.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:09.520]   Or that is definitely a significant improvement on the TV UI
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.520]   that I don't think many other services or devices offer.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.520]   Midnight.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.520]   I guess the Fire TV, but...
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.520]   I'll be up at midnight.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.520]   The Fire TV is actually interesting as well because I think that they want to really do that with Alexa
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:26.520]   and doing Alexa integration, which isn't currently available now.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.520]   As far as I'm concerned, I want Alexa everywhere.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.520]   I want her in my Sonos, I want her everywhere.
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:36.520]   Yeah, and they're really working on integrating a lot of what Alexa does in the Echo
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.520]   into the Fire TV without it being actively listening,
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   which I know is really hinky for some people.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.520]   They don't like the idea that their machine is constantly listening to them.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.520]   You actually do have to push a button.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.520]   So what? Come on.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.520]   I don't want Alexa listening to me all the time.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   She's not!
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.520]   The hardware is listening for you to say that word.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:57.520]   And then she listens.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.520]   Oh, come on. What could possibly go wrong?
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:01.520]   I don't know. I'll craft my tin foil hacky name.
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.520]   You can write the prologue to 1984.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.520]   It is, you know, of course that was the whole thing.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.520]   And I think it's why I was preparing...
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:07.520]   Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron... Baron...

[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:23.520]   Bare-nep, bare-nep, bare-noid, parallel-lil-noid.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.520]   Yes, I do.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.520]   Well, there you go.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.520]   But it's different.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.520]   Facebook isn't...
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:33.520]   There is a difference between the idea of having a fully actively listening system
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.520]   and people being able to have access, whether front door, back door access to your information.
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.520]   It'd be kind of cool, though, if you worked at the NSA, you could say.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:44.520]   I'm kind of bored. Turn on Lauren's Alexa. Let's hear what she's saying.
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.520]   Yeah, they're going to like catch me like singing K-pop.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.520]   Make it ache.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.520]   It's not like you're plotting to take over the government.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.520]   What are you going to hear? Nothing.
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   A lot of my garbage ideas.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.520]   Enough of them.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.520]   Enough of them.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.520]   Enough of you don't want them to hear.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.520]   I admit.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.520]   But nothing that they are going to be interested in.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.520]   Very good argument for a police state, Leo.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.520]   I'm convinced.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.520]   [laughter]
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:16.520]   Speaking of police states, Apple has told a U.S. court that it is not possible for us to unlock new iPhones.
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.520]   We don't have a back door.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:24.520]   They laid out a brief on Monday after federal magistrate in Brooklyn asked Apple,
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:31.520]   he was weighing a U.S. Department of Justice request to force Apple to help access a iPhone seized
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.520]   during an investigation.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:39.520]   In the brief, Apple said that for 90% of its devices, anything running iOS 8 or higher,
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.520]   we cannot.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.520]   We strengthen encryption methods.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:49.520]   We have no way of unlocking that phone.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:53.520]   The Department of Justice says, "Too bad.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.520]   You better come up with a way."
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:58.520]   And that is the battle that's going on.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.520]   Not listening in on your Alexa.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:07.520]   I'm sorry, I shouldn't say the name out loud because people listening to the show on their echoes are annoyed right now.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.520]   It's been a quite a few times.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.520]   So is this a case of...
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.520]   I was wondering if they were talking about iOS 7 when they said, "Well, you have to."
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:22.520]   Or if they're just saying, "Well, you have to for iOS 8 or iOS 9."
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:28.520]   In which case, it's like Apple might answer, "I don't think you're listening.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.520]   He cannot do it."
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:37.520]   Well, the DOJ says, "You may not, but you better figure out a way because you own the software."
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:43.520]   Apple in its license agreement says, "The software is not sold to you, but is licensed to you."
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:51.520]   And so the Justice Department replied to Apple's filing saying, "Apple designed manufactured and sold the phone that is subject of the search warrant,
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.520]   but that's only the beginning of their relationship with the phone."
[00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:01.520]   Apple writes and owns the software, and this software is thwarting the execution of the warrant.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:10.520]   So the threat is, "We're going to come after you, Apple, because this is your software that's getting in the way of our investigation."
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.520]   Yeah, this is not the first time this has happened.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:20.520]   And usually the response is that a company like Skype went and installed a backdoor so the government could get in.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   Most companies, if you're going to do business in the United States, you're going to end up doing what the U.S. law enforcement and courts tell you to do.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.520]   They've been so forceful in their team.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:40.520]   Basically Tim Cook's entire, you know, a third of his communication strategy in the past few months has been,
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:44.520]   "We are not Google. We cannot spy on you. Your privacy is important."
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.520]   Do you think they would cave?
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:51.520]   We were saying they have too much power and they're accountable to no one.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:59.520]   I think in this instance it might be a case where they actively and publicly fight an injunction like this.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.520]   Twitter's done that. There are companies that have done that very actively.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.520]   And I think Apple realizes this is a business issue for them.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.520]   As you say, Patrick, they've been selling this privacy and security.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.520]   It'll be interesting.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:19.520]   I think when it comes down to at least in the United States, I don't care how big the company is.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.520]   Eventually you're going to have to do what the law say you have to do, right?
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:35.520]   Well, also in some point your software comes into contact with the server or cloud or something and that information is seized one way or another,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.520]   which is also the difficult thing.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.520]   Right. The downstream wire tapping.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520]   Exactly.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:53.520]   And for the most part, I mean you have to think of the instances in which actually actively unlocking a phone would be beneficial to an investigation that wouldn't otherwise be.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.520]   I mean, I guess it's just covering your bases, but if you already have access to email, Facebook.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.520]   There's lots of other ways.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.520]   All these other things.
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:09.520]   Then how much of an impact would or could a device that is unlocked make as something that I guess is a very important thing.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.520]   It's something that I guess really isn't qualified or qualified in these hearings with the DOJ as far as I can tell.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:21.520]   The interesting thing about this is I think a lot of these companies double deal.
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.520]   They say very publicly, oh no, we're protecting your privacy.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:30.520]   But then when it comes to behind the scenes lobbying, they may not do that.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   And the case in point is this latest bill, which was just passed in the Senate, SISA.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.520]   The Cyber Security Information Sharing Act.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.520]   In public, Google, and Apple, and Facebook, and Dropbox, and Twitter, all wanted to stop SISA.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.520]   They made a big noise about how much they hated SISA.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:57.520]   But there's some evidence that behind the scenes, some of these companies might have been lobbying for SISA to pass.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:05.520]   One of the reasons they might want it to pass, the SISA allows companies to share data about security issues with each other, but also with the US government.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:15.520]   The theory is that as we're getting more and more cyber attacks, the better the information sharing is, the safer everybody is.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:24.520]   But of course, people are concerned that this will also allow companies, or in fact, force companies, to share private information about its users with law enforcement.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:34.520]   And one of the reasons it's thought that Facebook and others might like this bill is because it would eliminate any liability they might have for revealing that private information to law enforcement.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:43.520]   Anyway, the bill has been passed. The president's indicated he will sign it.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:53.520]   I mean, I guess it's a done deal. If you want to continue to fight it, you can go to fightforthefuture.org and write your member of Congress.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520]   But I think it's a done deal.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.520]   Well, here, that would be Diane Feinstein.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.520]   And she has -- Yeah, she'll have none of it.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.520]   So -- It was her bill.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.520]   -- write to another congressman, please.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.520]   -- Thank you.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   So it was on October 23, 2001, that Apple announced the iPod.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.520]   Steve Jobs up on the stage talking about five gigabytes.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.520]   Can you get me my original iPod? It's in the case back there.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.520]   Remember the Firewire connection? A thousand songs in your pocket.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.520]   Only worked on a Mac.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.520]   Only worked on a Mac, remember those days.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   So Mac rumors, apparently, they kept their discussion about the original iPod alive on the Mac rumors site.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.520]   And there it is. Here's the -- Look at that.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.520]   -- What a paperweight.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.520]   -- I know. Firewire poured on the top. The hold button, the actual spinning click wheel.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:55.520]   Isn't that fun? You know what? If we could find a firewire cable, I think we could probably power it up and see what Leo is listening to it, 2001.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:59.520]   -- Will Smith's, Will 2K?
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.520]   -- Yeah. A move into Miami.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520]   -- Oh.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.520]   -- Bienvenino, Ami Ami. I think that actually is on there.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.520]   -- That was on Big Willy's style.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.520]   -- Oh, sorry.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   -- Wow. -- You're close.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.520]   -- I should never brought a knife to a rap fight.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520]   -- Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:20.520]   -- Anyway, it's fun to read these posts because --
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   -- The Internet hasn't changed much.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   -- Elite Mac Ore says, "I poop. I cry. I was so hoping for something more. Weezer x6x80. Great. Just with the world needs another freaking MP3 player.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   Go Steve! Where's the Newton?
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.520]   -- Where's the Newton?
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520]   -- Where's the Newton?
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.520]   -- Here's one from -- I think the best one.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.520]   -- Yeah, you've read these.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520]   -- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520]   -- Pick your best.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:53.520]   -- The one -- I think it's the one you were going to read, but it's one from a gentleman called Pants, or a lady, who says --
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.520]   -- More likely, gentlemen.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:06:05.520]   -- Why don't you spend a little more time sorting out your pathetically expensive and crap server lineup, or are you really aiming to become a glorified consumer gimmicks firm?
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.520]   -- Well, there you have it.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.520]   -- Well, actually gimmicks -- glorified consumer gimmicks firm sounds great.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.520]   -- That sounds great. -- Sounds great.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.520]   -- It's come to think of it.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.520]   And whatever happened to that expensive server line?
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520]   Bye.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.520]   -- Certainly not a big money, not a big bottom line.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   What a load of tripe.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   Gee, an MP3 player with a hard drive.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   How original?
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.520]   [laughs]
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.520]   There are a few people, to be fair, who say, "Oh, this is so exciting."
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   $400 for an MP3 player.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   I call it the Cube 2.0.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   It won't sell.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   It'll be killed off in a short time.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   It's not really functional.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   [laughs]
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   -- Can I have a TV?
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   -- I have to say I didn't --
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.520]   [laughs]
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.520]   They wanted newtons.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.520]   Half of those --
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.520]   -- I know.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.520]   -- of the people on the thread want newtons.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.520]   I have to say I didn't like the first iPod.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:03.520]   I had a tiny, like, two inches by two inches MP3 player from Panasonic that held, I don't know,
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.520]   maybe 128 megabytes.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.520]   And I loved that thing.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.520]   It was super small.
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.520]   So the iPod was too big for me.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:12.520]   -- The reality of the distortion field is starting to warp Steve's mind.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:18.520]   If he thinks for one second that this thing is going to take off, there's no future in
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.520]   iPods.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.520]   Isn't that funny?
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.520]   There are a few people who understood it, but most of the people were very disappointed.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:31.520]   And that just shows you really, in a way, this in many ways is a tribute to Steve Jobs.
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.520]   A guy did not pay attention to what people asked for.
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.520]   He did what he thought was the right thing to do.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.520]   And it turned out more often than not, not in every respect, but more often than not.
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.520]   He was absolutely right.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:47.520]   -- Well, and I think it's important to understand the fact that, I mean, I wouldn't necessarily
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.520]   call the original iPod like the big, one that had the biggest impact.
[01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.520]   I always think of the iPod mini.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:58.520]   Perhaps it's dating myself a little bit because I wasn't allowed, my mom told me no with the
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.520]   iPod, but she was like, iPod mini, that's the right press.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.520]   -- Yeah, no, in fact, that's the one my kids got.
[01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.520]   Their first iPods were the iPod mini.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.520]   -- I didn't know that was the highest selling one at this time.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.520]   And the nano after that was me.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520]   And iTunes, of course.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.520]   And iTunes on Windows was what put the iPod on the map, which was something Steve Jobs fought
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.520]   for a long time, but eventually gave it on.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.520]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520]   Come back with more.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.520]   We are talking about tech.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:32.520]   I want to talk about YouTube Red, the new YouTube subscription channel it launches on Wednesday.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:38.520]   It's a $1 billion funding round, not just for magically, but also for Uber.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   This is not valuing them.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.520]   This is the new unicorn, not valued at a billion dollars.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.520]   Give us a billion dollars.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   Uber will now be valued if they raise his money, which I think they will, at something like
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.520]   $50 billion.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.520]   And they still haven't made any money, have they?
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.520]   There's no profit at all in Uber.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   I don't think so.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   Certainly not magically.
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.520]   Not that I'm laughing or anything.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:11.520]   And a real tech hero, Jack Dorsey, gives back his Twitter stock, at least part of it to
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.520]   his employees.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.520]   I'm a big audible fan.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.520]   I don't think I don't think it's a surprise.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   I am listening to audiobooks all the time.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   We're all excited about this new Sarah Vowell book.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.520]   This is one that Andy and Aco recommended.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:36.120]   Sarah Vowell, who's a contributor to this American life, has this wonderful quirky voice, has
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.520]   written a book about the Marquis de Lafayette.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.520]   You've heard of him, right, Patrick?
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   Of course, Lafayette, I am here.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   He is the Frenchman, the 20-something Frenchman, who helped well win the Revolutionary War for
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   America.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.920]   And she's apparently written, I don't know what it is, a biography, a humorous and insightful
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:03.720]   portrait of the famed Frenchman, and listen to the people that are reading this with her.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.920]   John Slattery, the good-looking guy on Mad Men, you know, the white-haired guy on Mad Men,
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   Fred Armisen from Saturday Night Live, John Hodgman, we all love John Hodgman, and more.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.920]   This sounds like an amazing book.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:23.920]   Nick Offerman, the guy with a mustache, is also in this.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.920]   Is this unaudible now?
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.680]   Oh, I didn't know it.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.680]   You know the Night Vale podcast?
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.520]   Welcome to Night Vale is now an audible book.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.400]   They released, let me just look this up.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.000]   This is awesome.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.640]   So the deal is I'm going to get you two books.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.720]   So there's two books you might want to get right there.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:47.040]   If you listen to the Night Vale podcast, the novel of the Night Vale podcast is now out.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:53.720]   Welcome to Night Vale by Joseph Fink and Jeffrey Crannner based on the podcast.
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.280]   I wonder who narrates it.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.000]   Is Cecil Baldwin the announcer on it?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.280]   So he's in this.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.920]   You know how it is.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:05.280]   Imagine a 15-year-old boy.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.280]   Nope, that was not right at all.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280]   Try again.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:17.520]   Oh, look, you've got my iPod fired up.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.280]   Holy cow.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.520]   I could play-- I could play audible books on the current iPod.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.360]   In fact, one of the best things about audible is it works on everything.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.840]   Your iPhone, your Android device, your Windows phone, your Mac, your PC.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.320]   You can even listen on the web.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.920]   So audible, which is so cool, now works on my Chromebook.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.720]   I am so thrilled.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.160]   180,000 titles.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.760]   This is my audible library.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.720]   I'm just finishing now the three-body problem.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.000]   Amazing science fiction.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.800]   Trilogy that just came out of China.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:49.320]   Neil Stevenson's seven eaves is probably next on my list.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   I'm a huge Neil Stevenson fan.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.240]   Felicia's Day's book is out on audible.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:02.640]   Of course, she narrates it along with a forward by Joss Whedon, who narrates his forward.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.800]   There's so much good stuff.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.000]   Fiction, nonfiction, science fiction.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.200]   The new Ernie Klein Armada, narrated, of course, by Will Wheaton.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.120]   He's a guy who did Ready Player One.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.120]   The hardest thing about having an audible subscription is--
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.080]   you see, I have two credits available.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.520]   Pick in two books.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.120]   I love it.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.560]   I've got so many great books available.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.240]   And you could too.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.880]   Go to audible.com/twit, the number two.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.960]   You're going to be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:30.800]   That's two books a month.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.920]   But your first month is free.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:34.200]   You cancel any time in that first 30 days.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.200]   You'll pay nothing.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.840]   But your two books are yours to keep forever.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.720]   You also get the daily digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.200]   audible.com/twit and the number two.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.920]   If you have seen the movie, The Martian But You Haven't Read the Book,
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.000]   please do yourself a favor.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.960]   If you haven't seen the movie, read the book first.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.720]   So much good stuff at audible.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.240]   audible.com/twit2.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.120]   Two books free.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.840]   Do you think there's any Will Smith on here?
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:05.240]   Let's see.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:07.920]   I wasn't recently played.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.400]   Oh, is there a recent-- is there a recent?
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:10.720]   No.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.680]   That was-- that's late.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.560]   Maybe let's look--
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.320]   I don't know.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.000]   Again, like I said, I was--
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.760]   Yeah, no, they don't have-- that's still to come.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.520]   This is a 14-year-old device.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.960]   That's a browse artist.
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:26.680]   Fitty said.
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.840]   AC/DC Aerosmith.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.880]   I have a little Atlantis.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.800]   But remember, this was 2000.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.000]   Yeah, that's OK.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.640]   Let's see if I'll go down to the W's.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.920]   Zombie Nation.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.920]   Oh.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.560]   Wow.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.480]   Weird owl.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.240]   Walt Disney.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:41.960]   That's my kids.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.760]   That's not me.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.360]   They've grown up.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:43.800]   They've grown up.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.120]   I don't see any Will Smith.
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.360]   But you do have Snap on there.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.320]   So that's kind of OK.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:48.720]   Really?
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.760]   I get points for Snap?
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.400]   I have a power.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.840]   That's exactly the song.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.800]   The power from Jack James Volley and Nate.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.600]   It's from Jack James Volley and Nate.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.440]   You got it.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.360]   Jack James-- Jack James is it.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.320]   Jack James is number one thing.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.960]   You guys know Jack James?
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.760]   Yes.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.040]   Awesome.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.640]   Queen Latifa.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.920]   Outcast.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.360]   You actually said we could listen to something.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.440]   Oh my gosh.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.000]   Oh, I don't know if this fits.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.840]   The standards have changed.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.560]   Little Nelly.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.480]   You want to hear some Nelly?
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.280]   Oh my gosh.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:18.880]   Which one?
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.960]   Air Force Ones.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.560]   I saw Nelly performing Air Force Ones right across the street.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.760]   Oh, that must be cool.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.640]   It was.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.480]   I've seen a show there.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.440]   That's a good venue.
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.560]   Listen, that still works.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.080]   It does.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.440]   That's the iPod playing.
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.720]   Sound quality leaves something to be decided.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.160]   Well, that's not the iPod's fault.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.280]   I don't think that's probably the hookup.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.120]   I got the hookup.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.600]   I'm going to--
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.280]   Is this bringing back memories?
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.440]   You were eight?
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.480]   I was not eight.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.680]   I was not eight.
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:56.320]   Thank you.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.200]   I wasn't eight years old.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.360]   I was--
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.480]   We even got the lights.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.560]   Let me play it somewhere.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.520]   I was in the seventh grade.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.360]   And every kid on--
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.160]   That was how you differentiated yourself
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.160]   on whenever the laptop--
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   What raps off you lights?
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.720]   No, it's if you knew all the words to Air Force Ones.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:17.000]   I should just give you this.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.520]   There it is, the original iPod.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.280]   And it still works 14 years later.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.640]   That is kind of amazing.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.320]   That is kind of amazing.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.440]   I don't know if that's my first or if that's just something
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.360]   I have had for a while or--
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.360]   I really don't know the provenance of this.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.840]   OK, what did I say?
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.520]   What's going to talk about?
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:38.040]   I forgot.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.600]   YouTube read.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.800]   You want to talk about YouTube read?
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.800]   I don't understand what's going on with YouTube read.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.000]   So I want somebody to explain to me.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.960]   I think ESPN doesn't understand either.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.360]   They've been shutting their videos down
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.920]   and putting them back up.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.480]   So starting Wednesday, YouTube--
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.080]   if you go to youtube.com/read, you can learn all about it.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.760]   YouTube is going to launch a subscription tier.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.320]   $10 a month.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.320]   You'll be able to watch YouTube videos without ads.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.920]   YouTube music videos without ads.
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:11.160]   And you'll get a subscription to Google music.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160]   Or the other way around.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.400]   I have a subscription to Google Music,
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.840]   so I will get ad-free YouTube as well.
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:21.840]   You'll be able to save songs offline and videos offline.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.280]   That's something YouTube's always blocked.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.160]   They've been third party apps that do that.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.920]   You'll be able to play them in the background.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.280]   It's really an interesting play.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.240]   But I wonder, who's going to pay $10 a month
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240]   for YouTube videos without ads?
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.280]   Potentially everybody who pays for Spotify and Apple music.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:39.960]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.960]   I buy Google Music.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.120]   That's a great service.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.360]   And so I'm getting this for free.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.640]   So that I would do.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.280]   You think that's what people will say is, well,
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.320]   I'm not the music.
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.960]   So I think that this is one of those situations
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.440]   where there's a little bit of a generational hitch attached
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:58.400]   to the new ad-free YouTube specifically.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.400]   That was a dog whistle you just did there.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.000]   Those directors are writing you.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.440]   It was writing to you.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.280]   It's actually even--
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.840]   You mean there are some people too old to get what this is all about?
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.960]   Oh, too old to get what this is all about.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.960]   What I mean to say is that the bulk of loyal YouTube subscribers
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.600]   to people like PewDiePie or Bethany Moda or Michelle Phan,
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.200]   people who have really made millions--
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.200]   The people who watch PewDiePie are 12 years old.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.400]   They are not going to spend $10 a month.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:29.040]   They don't have $10 a month.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.400]   That's their whole allowance.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.240]   So that's the issue, right?
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.520]   They're essentially establishing this channel
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.280]   that's going to bring people like Toby Turner
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.920]   into the original content space.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.600]   It's going to be YouTube is going to back this content.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.360]   And we have all these great creators
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.960]   that have these millions of followers.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.240]   But are those followers the same people who
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.280]   have that kind of like paper route money to spend, I guess,
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.360]   is really what I want to know?
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.200]   YouTube is doing this all along, which is they want to be--
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.440]   they don't want to be the 12-year-old channel.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.440]   They really want to be the new TV.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.600]   And so when they had the--
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.840]   they were giving people a million, $2 million
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.200]   to do YouTube channels.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.880]   Yes, Shaq got a YouTube channel.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.960]   And that was a miserable flop.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.840]   They really want to create premier content
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.440]   for to replace television.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.440]   And that's expected to be a part of this.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.160]   Subscription services that they'll
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.040]   have exclusives that are only available if you're a subscriber,
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.560]   much like Netflix has house cards
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.680]   and Daredevil and a bunch of other very popular shows.
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.560]   YouTube won't necessarily go the Netflix route
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.960]   and do high quality Hollywood style--
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.520]   But there is money to do that, I think.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.680]   I mean, I think they're planning stuff.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.400]   There's money to do it.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.960]   But at least what we've seen, they're
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.080]   not looking to take on Netflix directly
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.880]   and create a Netflix copycat.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.400]   I mean, they will pay money to commission exclusive videos
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.440]   that look and feel more like what you're
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.080]   used to with YouTube and not sort of hour long adult dramas.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.000]   Now, Patrick, this is US only.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.640]   Sorry.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.840]   Unfortunately.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:09.680]   Unfortunately.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.760]   Would you like to do this?
[01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.600]   Would you do this if you could?
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.360]   I think I would.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.320]   I transitioned from-- basically, I
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.160]   used to watch a lot of video podcasts.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.760]   And now, all the video I watch is on YouTube.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.280]   And I think there's a lot of valuable content, not just
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.080]   for 12-year-olds.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.000]   You're totally right.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.400]   PewDiePie's audience is 12-year-old boys and 14-year-old girls.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.760]   But it's not just that.
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.320]   I think YouTube is in a runt.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.520]   And they have a problem with revenue.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.040]   The big problem on YouTube is that creators
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.320]   don't make enough money to make a decent living,
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.800]   because the ad revenue has become so low.
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.920]   It's always been very low.
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.720]   But with the ad blocking and everything,
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:57.000]   it's impossible for people who aren't either students
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.720]   or unemployed to make a living on YouTube,
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.040]   because it takes too much time.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.360]   It takes too much energy.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.440]   And it eats up your life.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:08.320]   And people with respectable followings
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.400]   are not making the amount of money that
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.200]   makes their activity sustainable on the long term.
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.200]   So I think what they're doing is basically kickstarting it,
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.640]   kickstarting a longer process.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.440]   First of all, by giving a lot of people
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.560]   lots of different reasons to get that subscription.
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.160]   It's not just removing the ads.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.240]   It's the music and the ability to--
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.360]   they've artificially constrained the app
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.960]   so that it couldn't play in the backgrounds and stuff like that.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:39.360]   And I would like to have that ability and the exclusive content.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.240]   It's a big package.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.840]   And once that happens, not only do people
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.520]   provide $10 a month to YouTube, which
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.080]   is an enormous amount, the equivalent to an enormous amount
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.280]   of ads watched.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:56.680]   So the revenue per user would be significant for those
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.800]   who choose to do that.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:03.320]   But also, it removes a little bit of ad inventory
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.840]   and potentially could raise the ad price a little bit
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.680]   and make the even the CPM on ad supported content
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.240]   a little bit higher.
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.480]   And I think they don't have a choice.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.880]   They have to provide that option,
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:21.800]   because the revenue from ad only is not
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.360]   sustainable in the long run.
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.040]   Even if it doesn't work out in the first year or two,
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.360]   they have to provide that option.
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.720]   And maybe, if it's not good enough,
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.760]   if they don't get the numbers to affect their revenue,
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:41.080]   they can then introduce a three months or yearly deal that
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:44.200]   is going to make it cheaper that people are then more
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.000]   likely to go for.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.840]   So I think it's a very important play for YouTube.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:52.120]   And it's actually, I would say, platform defining.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.920]   You're a creator.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.120]   You, in fact--
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.400]   I mentioned this at the beginning of the show, Patrick,
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.640]   you are now a full-time podcaster.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.520]   And that's because of Patreon.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:06.120]   You have a model.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.680]   Jack Conte, who founded Patreon,
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:11.040]   has quoted in this article on the Verge.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.880]   He said, he doesn't think Red will
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.200]   bring about any improvements for creators.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.280]   Subscripsh-- by the way, Jack was on here a couple of weeks
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:19.800]   ago.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.640]   He said, one of the main reasons I created Patreon
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.800]   is because Pomplimos, the wonderful music
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.800]   that he and his girlfriend Natalie Donmake,
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:33.880]   would get a million views on a Pomplimos video that
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:37.680]   cost them $6,000 to make and make $1,500 in ad revenue
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.320]   from YouTube.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.240]   It wasn't a viable model.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.200]   So he created Patreon so that viewers could support
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.680]   the artists directly.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:48.440]   He says, subscription services are great for consumers.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.680]   Pay $10.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.800]   Have any song or video in your pocket whenever you want.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.040]   But for the creators, there's still
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.600]   too way too much of a middleman.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.080]   He said, my art might be worth $10 to a super fan.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.960]   But if she's listening on Spotify, even with a subscription,
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.160]   I'm still only getting pennies every time she interacts
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.040]   with what I've made.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.400]   Patreon is, of course, a better model if you want to support
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.520]   creators.
[01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.360]   But YouTube is where the audience is.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.520]   Yeah, the audience-- I mean, Patreon
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.520]   is for engaged audiences.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:25.160]   And it's a very small percentage of your audience that
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.440]   is actually going to go and support you on Patreon.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:33.840]   For me, for example, I have a bi-monthly show.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.520]   And it's supported by about 1,000 people out
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.480]   of a much wider audience.
[01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:45.160]   And they give about $2.5 to $3 per episode.
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.200]   And that's, with additional revenue on the side,
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:53.000]   that's roughly enough to make an OK living.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.720]   I don't think that's the audience that YouTube is going
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:56.640]   to go after.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.720]   I think what they're hoping is going to happen
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.240]   is that it's going to make currently on YouTube
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.520]   if you don't have at least 500,000 to a million subscribers
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.800]   to watch your videos, you're probably not
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.160]   going to be making a good living.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.320]   And even then, I'm not sure it's decent.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:14.880]   I think what they're--
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.680]   If you're already YouTube creators are just not making money.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:19.560]   They're doing it for promotional reasons.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:20.960]   Something else.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.360]   I think YouTube always tries out PewDiePie and Michelle
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.680]   Fan because they are making millions.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.280]   But they're the--
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:26.480]   Of course.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.920]   --the exception, I think.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:31.320]   I think those people are making enough money to live on
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.560]   if they're students living in their parents' basement.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.040]   Or it's ironic.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.640]   But-- and I think what they're trying to do
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.320]   is to get that threshold where you can make a living out of it,
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.320]   not on Patreon level, where you can make a living out
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.120]   of a few thousand people that support you.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:52.880]   But maybe a few tens of thousands people watching
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.960]   and subscribing, maybe 100,000.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.640]   And a portion of those people are going to go and subscribe
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:03.800]   to YouTube, and that's going to raise your revenue level.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.440]   There's a lot of unknowns about YouTube red.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.600]   We don't know how they divide the $10 up.
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.560]   Is it based on views?
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.640]   I'm not going to get more money from YouTube red
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.880]   than I would have gotten from ads embedded on my content.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.280]   We personally twist.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:20.240]   We don't know exactly what's going to happen to us.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.120]   The current thinking is nothing because our ads
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.720]   are interstitial.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.240]   We don't turn on monetization on our--
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.880]   we've been told we can't turn on monetization on our shows.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:33.360]   Our full shows, because they have their own ads.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.640]   And I don't think that YouTube red will hide our shows.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.400]   But I think even ESPN is confused,
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.400]   because they've been taking shows down and putting them back up.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.200]   It's not obvious what's going to happen at all.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.560]   And it could be that all of a sudden come Wednesday,
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.240]   none of our shows with advertising--
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.560]   our own advertising like this show
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.720]   will be visible on YouTube.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.040]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:55.720]   Well, the intricate thing about the ESPN situation
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.240]   is the fact that ESPN, a lot of ESPN's content,
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.320]   is licensed from somewhere else.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:04.120]   It's usually it's licensed from the NFL, or the MLB, or the NBA.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.760]   And those have separate licensing deals, which
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.560]   is why you saw that whole--
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.840]   I'd like to think that it's connected,
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.080]   but I'm unsure.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.120]   I don't get to see fully what's behind the curtain
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:15.840]   over at ESPN.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.480]   But it's kind of the same issue when
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.960]   you look at the fact that they had to do DCMA takedowns over--
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.520]   Is it related to YouTube red or just coincidental?
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.800]   I think that timing might be coincidental,
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.560]   but it also shows the tenuous agreements
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.320]   that ESPN might have in creating and producing content that
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:39.840]   is licensed or has specific deals in terms of sharing
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.560]   for these big sports leagues.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:49.160]   What happens when you have a viral NFL video that ESPN is
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:54.480]   running, but ESPN is using for something like YouTube red.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.440]   Does that violate the deal with the NFL?
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.200]   Does YouTube have to make the contract with the NFL directly?
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.240]   All of a sudden, you start to see these things first,
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.640]   like if you have this old media, how that interacts
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.320]   with the way that YouTube red is established is really not
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.520]   clear, because the only thing that YouTube is really talking
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.000]   about are these original shows that they're working on
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.720]   and the expansion or the gusty, up version of what you normally
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.960]   see from YouTubers.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:20.880]   What do you think, Mark?
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.240]   What do you think YouTube's goal is here with red?
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:25.880]   Is this just an experiment, or is this YouTube really
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:28.760]   trying to reinvent itself?
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.680]   I mean, I think it's probably more about the music.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.000]   They've been trying to do a subscription music service
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.480]   for a year, and they've had--
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.720]   YouTube music key, right?
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.280]   Yeah, for at least a year, and they've been testing it,
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.560]   they apparently either haven't been able to get the rights done
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.360]   or haven't been able to find a way to make the service work.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.840]   And now, they're folding music together
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.560]   with all of the rest of YouTube.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.560]   And they're--
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.360]   It's really about the music, you think.
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.560]   I think it's really about--
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.520]   I think that's where--
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:55.360]   I look at my stuff.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.560]   There's an established market for it.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.760]   He doesn't have a subscription to any of this stuff.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:00.560]   He just watches YouTube music videos.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.720]   And a lot of kids do that.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:02.880]   And a playlist all the time.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.600]   That's what-- that's his music right there.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.320]   And they-- you know, he's in college.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.040]   He's 23.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.640]   They have a-- they put up a big screen,
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.920]   and they just let it run all day.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.600]   That's their music.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.480]   And if you're a consumer who's trying
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.520]   to be a way between Spotify or Apple Music or YouTube,
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:26.920]   which presumably has pretty much the same catalog, plus,
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.320]   if you're going on an airplane, you
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.000]   can save some videos to watch from the plane along
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.640]   with all of your music for the same price.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.080]   Yeah, actually kind of like that, yeah.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.800]   Unless you're a fan of prints, and then you're
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.240]   left out in the cold.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.440]   Prints, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones.
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.920]   That's-- you know, that might change with a subscription--
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:46.160]   you know, a subscription service that actually works
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.960]   and brings in a lot of money.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.800]   But I think music is important.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:55.680]   I think it's a portion of what YouTube could become
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.440]   if it managed to make decent money for its creators.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.880]   All in all, you know, music is not
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:05.000]   a huge and enormous industry compared to everything
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.760]   that we have in the tech world.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.920]   I think TV is not going away, but it's kind of dwindling
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.600]   a little bit.
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.560]   It could be replaced by IPTV, in a sense,
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.920]   in the next few years.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.600]   And YouTube has done a great job at sort of moving
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.120]   from the funny cat on a skateboard video image it had.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.720]   But it's not quite a place where people go for actual content.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.400]   It's been getting to interesting videos.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.560]   I think I don't know if you guys know channels like Crash
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:42.160]   Course or PBS Space Time or things like that
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.440]   that are super interesting, super well done, high quality
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.680]   content.
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.480]   But I think it could go even further.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.880]   And in order to do that, they need
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.880]   to raise revenue for the creators.
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.720]   And the potential--
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:57.280]   I really think FARC sees music alone.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:03.360]   So PBS Space Time is a YouTube channel from PBS.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.080]   Discovery Network also has DNews,
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.160]   which is partially based on their revision 3.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.160]   But I look at the views--
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.400]   Yeah, but I look at the views on PBS Space Time, which
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.840]   is great content.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.440]   180,000, 275,000--
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.520]   Go to Crash Course.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.520]   Go to Crash Course.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.520]   That's not money that would make any difference to me,
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:25.360]   let alone YouTube.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.560]   I mean, there's not bad views.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.120]   But in other words, I'm saying there's
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:33.480]   a promotional vehicle for PBS.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.960]   They're not trying to make the money back.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:36.280]   Crash Course, huh?
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.200]   What is that all about?
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.360]   You're thinking it's the same kind of programming.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.080]   They have a lot more videos.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.600]   It's the Green Brothers.
[01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.000]   Yeah, I love them.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.840]   But yeah, they're the same thing.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.080]   They're 45,000, 8,000 views.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.880]   Again, you do this pro bono.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.560]   I'm sure YouTube loves them.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.000]   But they're crowdfunded.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.520]   They're a fanfian.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.720]   But you're thinking in ads terms.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:06.120]   I think if you start getting people
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.480]   to subscribe for these kinds of shows
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.040]   and watch these kinds of shows, I
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.040]   think it shifts the balance of the bit.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.360]   Actually, some of these are pretty good.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:17.400]   John Green's world history views were talking--
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:19.200]   2 million, 1 million, 1 million.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.280]   Now that's taken them a year.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.960]   But these are not insignificant.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.160]   So some are bigger than others, obviously.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:25.560]   Chemistry.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.720]   And those are timeless content.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:33.240]   You can go back and watch them forever.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:36.120]   And the catalog, the back catalog on YouTube,
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.280]   is actually what makes the most money.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:39.640]   So--
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.120]   Kyle Lee, though.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:43.640]   Is this how kids are learning US history now
[01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:46.440]   as watching a video on YouTube?
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.440]   I think they still have school.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:53.440]   I think that there's a reason why there's a million and a half
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.040]   views on this.
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.200]   This is kids going here to either supplement their school,
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.240]   or maybe even this is being shown at school.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.120]   I think that also there's a test tomorrow.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.720]   And somebody did a study.
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:05.080]   Crash course in US history.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   And honestly, I need to know that what's important is Thomas
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.240]   Alva Edison.
[01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.800]   That's the brilliance of this channel.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.200]   Sorry, that was a no-ro.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.160]   That was a test to see if you were paying attention.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.080]   I'm paying attention to the "When is Thanksgiving?" video.
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.440]   Which I'm sure they got a million hits just by saying,
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.240]   "When is Thanksgiving for people who are going to be going?"
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.720]   What an SEO boon.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:26.760]   What is Thanksgiving?
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.000]   Oh, your money.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.320]   What time is the Super Bowl?
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.320]   Because I ask that all the time.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.400]   When is Thanksgiving?
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.200]   School is where you go to watch YouTube, says Joel H.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:34.960]   and our chatroom.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.240]   That may be true.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.680]   I think we're an interesting world
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:43.200]   where the educators of the next generation
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.240]   may be coming from YouTube, not from the classroom.
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.040]   And I don't know if that's a good thing or not.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.160]   Could be a good thing.
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:53.000]   I mean, Salman Khan, I trust him.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.120]   Yeah, the whole MOOC thing has kind of gone out
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.320]   of fashion a little bit.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:56.820]   Has it?
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:57.480]   And no more MOOCs?
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:59.160]   And the one MOOCs, through, and has kind of pulled back.
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:32:59.680]   Really?
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.000]   And the one in the end, I'm kidding.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.480]   It's still a great concept.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:04.840]   The MOOC bubble.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.240]   There's a little bit of a MOOC bubble.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:08.440]   A little MOOC bubble.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.920]   The thing is the MOOCs work.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.120]   Very possible.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.960]   But the MOOCs were thought of by teachers.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.000]   If you look at things like Crash Course,
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.280]   I'm sure there are a lot of them,
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:24.280]   but they are very fast 10 minutes videos made with humor
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.440]   in the way that YouTube videos work.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:31.080]   So they were conceived from a YouTuber's point of view
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.560]   and a YouTube audience point of view.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:35.680]   And I think that's why they're working.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.480]   The other problem, of course, is that YouTube
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.120]   seems to be forcing content creators to sign the red deal.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.720]   Like, you don't have a choice if you--
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.200]   Sign on or your videos disappear.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.600]   But now we never got anything like that
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:50.080]   because we're not partners.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.440]   So I think-- I thought, are we partners?
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.280]   I don't even know what we are.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.600]   No, I think everyone has to--
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.920]   I think the deal is unless you choose to hide your videos,
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.760]   they will be a part of the service.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.400]   And you tacitly agree to be on board with Red.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.840]   OK.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.880]   Well, I'll find out when I get that big check.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.840]   This is cool.
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.080]   Halo 5, you excited?
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:18.040]   You're going to take the day off to play Halo 5, Lauren?
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.280]   No, you're not a Halo player.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.880]   I'm not really a Halo player for a lot of complicated reasons
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.000]   that I will not go into right now.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.320]   You once had a boyfriend who looked a little like Master Chief.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.520]   And now, ever since, you just can't--
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.120]   You know, when you're in a bar and you just look across the room
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.320]   and somebody is in a full Master Chief armor,
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.000]   you tell me if you can resist that.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:37.720]   That'll traumatize you.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.440]   You tell me right there.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:43.840]   Well, it's interesting because I believe that Halo 5
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:47.080]   is by the same development team that did Halo 4.
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:49.280]   If I'm not mistaken--
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.080]   3, 4, 3 industries.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.160]   Holy by Microsoft.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.160]   Yes.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.800]   Which, I guess, some people liked Halo 4,
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:02.440]   although at the same time, that's how Cortana came into existence
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.520]   in a lot of ways.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.120]   So you sort of think--
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.280]   Yeah, Cortana comes from Halo, right?
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.000]   Yeah, Cortana comes from Halo.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.080]   So I think that Halo 5 should be good,
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:15.000]   but I don't know if people are finished playing Destiny.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.520]   Last time I checked, they're all still on that.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.240]   Destiny's good.
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:19.960]   I like that, yeah.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.400]   What time is it in Sydney right now?
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.480]   I bet there's a YouTube video for that.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.680]   It's 10 in the morning.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.240]   Tonight, I've always been very jealous of people
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.040]   who live in Sydney.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.520]   But tonight, if you're in Sydney, look up above the skies.
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.600]   Microsoft is going to launch Halo 5 Guardians
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.280]   around 8 o'clock on Monday night
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.840]   by projecting on the sky the first 15 minutes of the game,
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.960]   first 10 minutes of the game, on a-- it's a 20,000 square foot
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.480]   screen in effect.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.320]   Wow.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:54.680]   And the screen will-- maybe there is a screen.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.760]   I don't know what it is.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.280]   The screen must be a screen.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.960]   We'll make its way from Sydney's northern suburbs
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.440]   towards Koogee and back.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.600]   You know, I used to work for Blizzard Entertainment
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.720]   until a year ago.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.840]   And we used to have brainstorming sessions
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.640]   on with the PR team.
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:13.960]   I used to work in PR.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:17.040]   And we used to have sessions where we would try and brainstorm.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.720]   So that's one of my ideas to launch the game.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.840]   Bravo, Microsoft.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.360]   Bravo.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.600]   It's actually a good one.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.520]   Bravo.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.560]   We have many viewers in Sydney.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.800]   Please send us a video if you--
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.840]   I think you're going to have a highly produced video
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:34.400]   from Microsoft available on the next day.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.000]   Oh, I bet you're right.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.120]   Facebook is putting its social search global.
[01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:45.040]   If you've ever published publicly on Facebook,
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.360]   get ready because your posts will now be searchable.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.040]   Two trillion posts are being indexed.
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:55.920]   I haven't used this yet.
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:56.960]   Have you?
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.240]   Is it going to-- am I going to be
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.680]   able to Google Facebook content as well, which has always
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.360]   been blocked?
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.280]   What does this mean?
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.960]   I think it means you're going to be able to Facebook Google
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.720]   content.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.720]   Oh, Lord.
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.120]   It's a Google content.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.640]   Oh, Lord.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.320]   It's all very confusing.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.440]   Facebook has rebooted their search efforts several times.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.800]   Remember they came out--
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.880]   It's the social graph and that whole--
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.880]   Yeah, how you'd be able--
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.920]   All my friends who live in New York City--
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.240]   You're a city, exactly.
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:31.640]   That's still in there, but they were moving away from that
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.480]   a little bit to make it more of a--
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.400]   just type in a key where kind of like a Google type search
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:37.880]   engine.
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.200]   And I guess now they'll have all the public posts available.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:44.200]   But I don't know if a lot of people really post stuff
[01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:46.600]   publicly like they do on Twitter.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.760]   Maybe they do a lot of pages.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.760]   A lot of pages do.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:50.880]   I post everything publicly.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.360]   Yeah, why not?
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.280]   Hey.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.520]   I don't post it all.
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.440]   The business pages are going to be included in that, right?
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.680]   And all of that is public.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.800]   So I think that's a significant amount of content.
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.360]   Yeah, but I don't know.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.800]   Do a lot of people want to search through press releases?
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.000]   That's basically what it is, very short.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.960]   Company's posting.
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.240]   Media material.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:14.740]   Yeah.
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.320]   I think that a lot of it has to do with the fact
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.800]   that Facebook wants people to connect with public figures
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.040]   in the way that they're sort of promoting their live streaming
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:24.480]   and sort of all of this engagement surrounding Facebook
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.160]   subscribers.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:28.360]   I know as someone who tried to get Facebook verified recently
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.480]   and was told that I don't post publicly enough in order
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.080]   to be--
[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:33.920]   I know.
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:35.520]   Although Google tells me I'm the only Lauren
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.560]   Hockinson in the world.
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.440]   So like there's no--
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:38.160]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:38.760]   I know.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.560]   It's great for us here.
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.520]   Are you parents planning ahead?
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.800]   I think that they were given the name Hockinson, which is--
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:46.800]   Cool.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:48.000]   Thanks, Mom and Dad.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:48.500]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:50.480]   Thanks, Sweden.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.520]   But actually what happens is that--
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:53.720]   Look at that.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:54.240]   It does have live--
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:54.740]   I'm sorry.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:57.160]   I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:59.080]   I did tell you we're a little ADD girl.
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:38:59.600]   Thanks.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.400]   Yeah, squirrel.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.720]   Shiny foil.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:02.160]   Look, see.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.480]   So I did the 360 video, right?
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:08.000]   And now, if you show it on your Android phone on Facebook,
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.240]   you can move the phone around.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:13.040]   That's such a cool looking phone, that Samsung.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.600]   That'll make you nauseous real quick.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.120]   Look at that.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.240]   But I think that--
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.000]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.840]   What Facebook is trying to do is really
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.280]   get people to connect more with their public figures who
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.520]   want to use Facebook as a way to connect with subscribers
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.040]   and followers.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.440]   That's what moments is all about, right?
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:33.600]   Because they allowed us to verify people, I'm sorry,
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.240]   to post live video.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:36.240]   And I just don't.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.160]   I mean, I still come from that space where Facebook to me
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:42.440]   is like a private network where it's--
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.240]   For family and friends.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:47.160]   Stuff where I get to see pictures from my nieces
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.360]   following costume.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.480]   You could post 360 degree video of your life.
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:53.360]   I'm looking at it on Facebook.
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.120]   I can post 360 degree video of me singing K-pop
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.640]   and making eggs, for sure.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:01.200]   You know how popular you would be?
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:02.800]   You would be huge.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:06.160]   You know, actually, I think, a bollaren style.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.040]   I am not--
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:10.840]   I think that that is actually kind of the point.
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:13.480]   When I was saying Facebook is going to become Google,
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.720]   or whatever stupid way I said it, I
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.000]   think there is a path to that.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.160]   Basically, let's say I'm going to tie a little together.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:22.320]   It's going to be beautiful.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:27.000]   When the Master Chief video thing in Sydney
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.560]   gets released and posted by Microsoft, on Facebook,
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:32.880]   you're going to be able to--
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:35.080]   someone is interested in Halo 5.
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.880]   And instead of going to Google to learn more about Halo 5,
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.600]   they're going to be able to go search on Facebook
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.880]   and get these kinds of posts that are going to be what they
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.360]   would have traditionally gotten on Google.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.800]   I think there is a play for keeping people more
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:54.000]   into their ecosystem and making the content,
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.320]   the very large amount of content,
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:01.000]   posted directly to Facebook, including video, which they've
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.640]   been making a big deal of in the past couple of years,
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.880]   surfosable and accessible to older people who are already
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:09.760]   on Facebook.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.680]   So yeah, I think it is a big deal.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.840]   Jack Dorsey gives back a third of his stock.
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.080]   I don't even-- this is amazing.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.960]   I love Jack Dorsey now.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.400]   I love him.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.560]   He only has a small percentage of Twitter stock,
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.720]   but as the new CEO of Twitter, he said--
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.800]   He's got 4%.
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:28.280]   It's worth a lot of money.
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.760]   He's worth a lot of money.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.720]   He's giving back $200 million, so that'll give you some idea.
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:37.560]   And it's going to go directly to employees.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.760]   That's pretty neat.
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.440]   It's a nice conjunction with the layoffs that they had, isn't it?
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.440]   Yeah, he cut 8% of the workforce, but the rest of you
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.200]   going to be happy.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:49.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.000]   I think that there's a lot of people
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.760]   who felt that--
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.320]   I'm sure that felt that Jack moving into the CEO position
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:02.080]   in terms of prioritizing Twitter as the company that he
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.800]   cares about now that he's CEO of two companies.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.760]   I think that it's an easy way for Jack
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:14.560]   to engender loyalty and trust in a way that feels like he
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:15.880]   believes in the company.
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.640]   And I think he does.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.360]   I think it's genuine.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.320]   I think he wants Twitter to succeed, obviously.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.840]   But a lot of it is also giving employees on board
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.920]   and doing so by saying, here, I am giving this back to you
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.440]   guys so you can invest in Twitter.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:31.040]   Good.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:31.920]   That's what you should do.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:35.360]   Yeah, and this comes, I think, a week or so after he pledged
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:41.200]   to give a huge chunk of Square to some charitable organizations.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:42.800]   You know, after you first $100 million,
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.320]   you really don't need more, right?
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.520]   I mean, or $500 million.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:46.360]   I wouldn't know.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.200]   I wouldn't know either.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.240]   But there's some point where you--
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.040]   Bill Gates said this.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:52.240]   He said, at some point, you're infinitely rich.
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.320]   More money is not going to change your lifestyle at all.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.760]   And maybe he just feels like, I got plenty.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.120]   That's the time to give back.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.880]   He also said, I don't know if this is going to change anything.
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.520]   He wants to reset relationships with developers.
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:06.520]   It was Dick Costalo, his predecessor,
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:09.000]   who killed the third-party ecosystem, essentially,
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:15.680]   by limiting Twitter clients to 100,000 new users and so forth.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:17.840]   You actually wrote a story saying the Twitter client has gotten
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.160]   better on the Mac side.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.120]   It will get better.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:20.640]   Not yet.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.140]   Not yet.
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:21.320]   Not yet.
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.600]   We're holding out hope that the Twitter for Mac client
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.680]   will finally be usable.
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:25.840]   You were using Tweet Deck.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:26.200]   It looked like that.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.000]   I am a Tweet Deck loyalist.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.520]   That's also a Twitter client, isn't it?
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:30.040]   Yes.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.360]   But Tweet Deck actually does-- it was updated.
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:37.560]   So it has group DMs and emoji--
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.560]   Group DMs.
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:39.160]   What a concept.
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:40.880]   Emoji support.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:43.840]   It's the little things, right?
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.760]   Twitter for Mac does not have those things yet.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:46.600]   They promise them.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.120]   It's kind of the moving forward and understanding
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.640]   that maybe they should be putting a lot more effort
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.520]   into their native apps, rather than relying
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.840]   on third-party developers.
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:01.560]   Or in this case, with Tweet Deck, a company that initially
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.920]   started out as a third-party developer,
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:08.520]   but then was included under the Twitter umbrella.
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:09.280]   Jury's still out.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.640]   Again, like I said, I'm a Tweet Deck loyalist.
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:12.600]   I'm all about it.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:16.360]   I use the dark mode because I think I'm cool.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.200]   And I think it works really well for me.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.640]   But it all depends on what they really want to do.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.440]   And I think that this is them saying, not only
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.440]   are we investing in our apps, but also investing in developers
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.960]   to create more with our SDK and with our API
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:40.680]   to do more and to make Twitter as exciting as it should be,
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.400]   given how big it is, given how big the platform is.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.880]   The fact that they've been shut off to developers for so long
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:48.280]   now, it's kind of remarkable.
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.520]   Do you think, though, that developers now, once bitten,
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:52.680]   they'll be twice shy?
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:56.080]   I mean, I would be nervous to make a new Twitter client
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:56.600]   at this point.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:58.800]   I might move on to some other thing.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:03.880]   That's true, but there's so much information and data and value
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.680]   that Twitter has sort of stored away
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:09.880]   that I think that there will be some people who are really
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:13.160]   interested in creating something, even if it's just
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:13.880]   other companies.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:17.600]   I mean, imagine what somebody could do by integrating
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.760]   Twitter and Slack that I would never have to leave my computer.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:22.760]   Never.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.880]   You know, put that thing on some Google cardboard.
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.880]   And I'll just live my work all the time.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:30.200]   Twitter and Slack, that's everything for you.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.280]   That and K-pop and scrambled eggs.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.800]   And you got life nailed.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.280]   Yes.
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:39.880]   Hug co-pilot.
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.240]   We're working on the PUG.
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.400]   You're an aspirational PUG.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.840]   I'm an aspirational PUG owner.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:44.400]   This is true.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.040]   But you are the one and only Lauren Hawkins.
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:48.440]   And there is no one else you'll find her on the next web
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.440]   or on the Twitter at l-h-o-c-k-e-n-s-o-n.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.160]   That is great.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.840]   Patrick Bejai is also here.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.920]   You'll find him at frenchspin.com or @notpatric, which
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:03.920]   is very confusing on the Twitter.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.120]   Don't know what you're thinking there.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.200]   He does own his own high LPR-40, though.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.600]   That, to me, that's status.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:13.920]   And a lot of scarves and scarves.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:14.560]   Also with this--
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.240]   Oh, there's one right here.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:18.640]   Look, Mark Villian.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.760]   Mark Villian from Bloomberg Business.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:23.280]   A week I showed it, they brought to you by a square
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:24.760]   space.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.640]   I love square space.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:28.600]   Square space is hosting plus the best software
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:31.640]   to give you an incredible experience
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:36.200]   as a website user, somebody who's creating a website.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:39.680]   And I give your users an experience that is second and un
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:40.680]   fact.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:43.240]   My Leo Vill site is now in the square space.
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:44.400]   And I just feel--
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.200]   I just love it.
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:48.960]   This is the new Squarespace cover page feature,
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.960]   which is fantastic.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:54.280]   You can use it to give your visitors
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.920]   a quick glance of who you are.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.360]   Actually, if you take the lower third down, Jason,
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:01.520]   you'll see I also have links to my social networks.
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.880]   And it links right into my blog.
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.360]   Look at this animated GIFs.
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.840]   I'm going to see if I can put the 360 video on there.
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.160]   That would be awesome.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:13.800]   For blogging, for your e-commerce, for your business,
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.160]   Squarespace.
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.360]   And the thing is, if you all-- everybody watching right
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.320]   now went to Leoville.com.
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.200]   Not only would I be happy, but you would not
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.320]   be able to bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.280]   It is so robust, is so strong.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.240]   That's your view right there, Lauren, by the way.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:30.640]   It's exactly what you're seeing right now.
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:34.640]   Squarespace.com-- there's my old friends from Toronto.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.440]   There's my old friend from the screen savers.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.480]   Here's the deal.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.120]   It starts at $8 a month when you sign up for a year.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.200]   You can build the most beautiful websites
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.680]   using state-of-the-art technology.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.240]   You'd be crazy to try to do this on your own.
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.880]   They've hired the best designers
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:50.120]   to make great templates.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.360]   They're all mobile responsive.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:53.080]   That's not easy.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.080]   They've got it done for you.
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:56.200]   They all have ear-commerce.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.760]   They have sites for a variety of different types of businesses.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:01.840]   If you're a band, for instance, they've got sites for bands.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.200]   They've got sites for restaurants.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.840]   They don't look cookie cutter.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.320]   They don't look like anything else.
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.480]   They look like you, like your ethos, your style.
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.320]   And that's what's so great about Squarespace.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:16.440]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.440]   In fact, it's easy to try.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.400]   You don't even need a credit card.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.440]   Just go to squarespace.com and click the Get Started button.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.160]   You have two weeks to play with it.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.160]   Pick the template.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.200]   Change the template.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.560]   It's so easy to change the template.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.600]   You just click a button and the content stays
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:30.520]   and then suddenly you look different.
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.080]   So easy to redesign your site to make it look exactly as you
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.960]   wanted to with drag and drop.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.160]   They have a developer platform.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.160]   So if you are an HTML, JavaScript, CSS guru,
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:43.280]   you can do the sky's the limit.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:45.800]   An incredible 24/7 customer support
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:48.320]   and a great support site too to make sure
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.280]   that if you have any questions, they will get answered.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.560]   Try it for two weeks.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:53.120]   You can even import some of your content
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:54.880]   to see what the site would look like.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:57.320]   It's a great way to get an idea of what Squarespace can do
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:57.840]   for you.
[01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.200]   And then if you decide to buy 10% off when you use the offer
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:02.160]   code TWIT.

[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.120]   squarespace.com Squarespace.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.120]   Build it.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.600]   Beautiful.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.880]   Hey, if you missed this week on TWIT, you missed a lot.
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:20.800]   Take a look.
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.800]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:24.640]   I don't do relatives computers anymore.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:29.560]   I say, if you insist on buying a Windows PC, I'm done.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:32.240]   Thank you very much.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.600]   Before you buy.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:37.920]   Now this is a much awaited the Nexus 5X.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.120]   It takes all the things you loved about the 5,
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:42.240]   really good specs, really affordable price,
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.480]   and a pure Nexus experience, and puts it
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:48.600]   into your brand new device for 2015.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:49.520]   Know how.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:52.960]   One of the most requested things has been how to get rid
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:54.600]   of the Windows 10 NAG screen.
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.680]   So we're going to show you how to get rid of the Windows 10
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:00.200]   NAG, at least until Microsoft counters it.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.600]   Tech News today.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.600]   New reports reveal that police have successfully used DNA
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:07.440]   information from ancestry.com as part of their police
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:10.600]   investigations, raising privacy concerns about access
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:11.600]   to such data.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.240]   I think this case was such a kind of a CSI kind of--
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:17.760]   No.
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:20.760]   That's what happens when you work at PopSci.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:23.280]   I just got attacked by a grown twin.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.720]   That was not planned I swear.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.840]   Don't make me come back there.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.160]   Brian, you know the NAG, right?
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:34.320]   I do know the NAG, and I was able to get rid of it
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.880]   by upgrading the Windows 10.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.200]   And Mike Elgin is here with a look at the week ahead, Mike.
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.080]   Coming up this week, the new Apple TV
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.280]   goes on sale tomorrow, which is Monday, October 26.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.600]   And shipments are expected by the end of the week.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:51.600]   Motorola will unveil new droid phones at an event in New York
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.680]   City on Tuesday, October 27.
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.440]   Apple Twitter and Alibaba also release earnings on Tuesday.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:00.280]   Google launches its YouTube red ad-free subscription
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.280]   option on Wednesday, October 28.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:05.120]   Also on Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will conduct
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:08.520]   one of his town hall Q&A sessions, this time in India.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.120]   OnePlus will unveil its third smartphone in London
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:12.880]   on Thursday, October 29.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.640]   Thursday is also another big day for earnings,
[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:17.680]   expected to hear from Samsung, Sony, Nokia, LinkedIn,
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:19.400]   and Electronic Arts.
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:23.320]   And on Friday, October 30, the Microsoft Band 2 fitness
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.760]   watch ships.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:26.400]   For all this and the rest of the news this week,
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:29.920]   subscribe to Tech News today at twit.tv/TNT.
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:31.000]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.920]   Do you read Cara Swisher's latest in recode?
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:42.280]   Cara, of course, has made her living with leaks from Yahoo.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:44.240]   This may be the last one.
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:47.600]   Yahoo Talent Exodus accelerates as Marissa Meyers
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:51.120]   turn around flounders.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.400]   Apparently Yahoo's been trying to cover this up.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.160]   In fact, Marissa's not been too happy about it.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:59.000]   Either she had a recent company wide,
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.720]   meaning she put up photos of purple kittens
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.360]   to indicate a successful period of no leaks
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:06.160]   about the company's internal issues,
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.520]   including staff departures.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:10.280]   But that never stopped Cara.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.520]   Apparently many executives leaving,
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:19.080]   there is this sense of doom, according to her, at Yahoo.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.320]   Marissa Meyers attempt to turn around the company
[01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:26.080]   is now being viewed inside as failing.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:30.200]   The Yahoo situation is troubling, says one source.
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:31.960]   And others worried about the ability of managers
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:35.920]   to staunch the flow of valued employees.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:38.160]   And boy, when you read about it,
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.760]   two senior women execs left just last week.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.520]   Development had Jackie Reese to--
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:47.640]   or Ressus to Square, marketing partnership had Lisa Licht.
[01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:53.600]   The CMO, Kathy Savid, who was brought in by Meyers,
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:57.120]   just close to Meyers, now is left.
[01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:00.280]   Mike Kern's SVP of homepage and verticals left in April.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:03.320]   I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:10.320]   People, even people who just arrived,
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:13.320]   departing very quickly.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:19.320]   So I don't-- you know, I feel like Yahoo has so much value in it,
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:21.320]   but I also feel like it's been such a challenge.
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:24.320]   And Marissa Meyers was hired as CEO to turn it around.
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:27.320]   And you cannot say, looking at it in any way,
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.320]   there's been a turnaround at Yahoo.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:30.320]   Right?
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:33.320]   I think it depends on what you would consider
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.320]   to be the turnaround point.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:39.320]   I guess I read something in the San Francisco Chronicle,
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.320]   I believe it was an AP story regarding the possibility
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:47.320]   of Yahoo getting into the fantasy sports.
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.320]   They have actually--
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.320]   They have.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.320]   They have the good strong fantasy sports.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.320]   Or you mean the new thing.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.320]   Yes, the actual real money betting,
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:56.320]   which they've just--
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.320]   They just started--
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.320]   They just started--
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.320]   Yeah, they just started real money betting.
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:03.320]   And it could be a really big boon for Yahoo sports
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:08.320]   because it was a huge fantasy sports.
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:09.320]   You know, bash it.
[01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:12.320]   And it's been for so long until DraftKings and Fandils
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:15.320]   started eating its lunch and started getting real money payouts
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:16.320]   from it.
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.320]   I think that, you know, there is--
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:23.320]   there are ways that Yahoo can sort of pivot
[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:27.320]   or really push into new areas.
[01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:32.320]   But I mean, that really comes at the behest of Meyer's judgment
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:36.320]   and what she sees as the image for the company,
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.320]   which to be frank, I don't know if I see a clear one right now.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.320]   I feel like--
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:46.320]   And this ties into Jonah Peretti's company-wide memo.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:49.320]   Yahoo is very old school, right?
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:52.320]   The monolithic portal content company,
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:54.320]   content services company.
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.320]   And then you look at what BuzzFeed is doing,
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:58.320]   I don't know if it's going to be successful or not,
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:01.320]   but very, very-- almost the opposite.
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:05.320]   BuzzFeed creates content that they don't put on their own site.
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.320]   They put everywhere else.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:13.320]   And I thought this was a great memo from Jonah Peretti,
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.320]   the founder and CEO of BuzzFeed to his staff,
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:19.320]   which he then later put on the BuzzFeed blog,
[01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:22.320]   in which he basically said, "We've been hiring like crazy.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:25.320]   We've got talented reporters and storytellers
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:29.320]   and business people and engineers.
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:31.320]   We are building a global--"
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:34.320]   It's interesting that he has to, in the memo to the company,
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.320]   explain what the company is doing,
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.320]   a global cross-platform network for news and entertainment.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:41.320]   Kind of the opposite of Yahoo.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.320]   If Yahoo was a monolithic portal,
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.320]   BuzzFeed exists on Facebook and YouTube,
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.320]   and everywhere else, wherever potential viewers are.
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:55.320]   He says, "We see a post like 26 problems only anxious people
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:59.320]   will understand, which got 10 million views on our site,
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.320]   evolve into multiple videos with 10 million views
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:06.320]   across YouTube and Facebook, which turn into a comic on Instagram,
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:11.320]   then on our Snapchat Discover channel, and on and on and on.
[01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:15.320]   It's a story, it's global, it's a multi-platform."
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:19.320]   There are virtues to both media strategies,
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:23.320]   and there is our drawbacks to--
[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.320]   BuzzFeed's entire model is to some extent built around
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.320]   capturing lightning in a bottle and having--
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:33.320]   You never know what's going to go viral.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:36.320]   You can get an idea of what works and what doesn't,
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.320]   but you can never really know when you've got the dress,
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:45.320]   for example, which is a phenomenon that still doesn't make any sense
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:49.320]   to me, how people saw different colors of the dress.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:51.320]   Yeah, exactly, I can gold.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:59.320]   Whereas Yahoo has the advantage of Sunday's NFL game
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:01.320]   that aired in London is on Yahoo.
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:06.320]   It's a perfect example of taking something that's incredibly boring,
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:09.320]   the worst game of the week, Jaguars versus Build,
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:13.320]   at 6.30 in the morning in San Francisco,
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:17.320]   and driving tens of millions of people to it, likely.
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:19.320]   They haven't announced numbers yet,
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:21.320]   but driving millions of people to it,
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:23.320]   I think your phone's ringing.
[01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:25.320]   That's somebody in my front door just ignoring that all the time.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:29.320]   Being able to drive millions of people to an extremely uninteresting event
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:32.320]   because they put the video everywhere and make it auto-play
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.320]   and they can create their own phenomenon.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:37.320]   They can also monetize it, right?
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:39.320]   Because it's a lot easier to monetize that
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:43.320]   than it is a post on Facebook or a post on you.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:47.320]   Yeah, arguably they didn't do a great job monetizing this particular event.
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:49.320]   They had to undersell some of the ads, I think.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:55.320]   I think, though, the point that Buzzfeed is making is that people no longer go to a site.
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.320]   No, many people do.
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.320]   Definitely it's going in a different direction,
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:03.320]   but Yahoo's homepage still drives many, many millions of people.
[01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:08.320]   Well, I'm certainly so I think that people are going to go to because they're on a mission.
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:11.320]   But it must be challenging for somebody like the New York Times,
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:14.320]   where people don't go to the front page and browse the Times.
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.320]   They go to links that they see on Twitter and Facebook and follow those links.
[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.320]   And that's what Buzzfeed is trying to capitalize on.
[01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:21.320]   I'm sorry, Patrick, go ahead.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:24.320]   And I think that's what Buzzfeed has been doing really well,
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:32.320]   first because they manage against all odds to capture some amount of lightning in a bottle
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:36.320]   because they do get very good viral videos.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:39.320]   Viral videos, I've never seen anybody so good at it.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:42.320]   It's incredibly exploitative.
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:49.320]   They make those kinds of listicles that honestly make any serious journalist,
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:52.320]   but really any journalist kind of roll their eyes.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.320]   Well, it almost feels algorithmic.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:59.320]   It feels like they're applying a computer algorithm to make something be viral.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:04.320]   I'm sure they are. They have formulas, but beyond that,
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:09.320]   I think they look at the way the articles are taking off
[01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:13.320]   and then they're pushing the ones that really start taking off a lot more.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:16.320]   And you see them everywhere.
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:21.320]   And what you're right, Leo, the lesson is for a lot of publications,
[01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:29.320]   they have to sort of divorce themselves from this idea of content ownership.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:34.320]   It's a very, very dangerous and counterintuitive thing to do,
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:41.320]   but you have to be willing to let go and to put your content everywhere people will want to see it,
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.320]   because if you don't, people are just not going to see it.
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:50.320]   And ironically, Buzzfeed has been starting to do actual investigative journalism
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:53.320]   that is, you know, they've had some pretty substantial articles.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:56.320]   As his vice, another company kind of built the same way.
[01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:00.320]   Lauren, you said it though. You don't go, oh, you need a slack in Twitter.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:05.320]   You don't go, you don't open your browser and go to your homepage, your, your my Yahoo page.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:08.320]   No, I don't, but I think that it brings up an interesting point, right?
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:11.320]   When you look at something that's across platform like Buzzfeed,
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:16.320]   what you're seeing is a division between two different kinds of Buzzfeed reader.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:20.320]   You know, the people who click on those Me Too listicles or like I like to say,
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.320]   I actively say to my computer, oh, that is so me.
[02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:26.320]   All those posts that make you go, that is so me.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320]   So me.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:31.320]   Buzzfeed is really known for. They want you to click on the article that is so you,
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.320]   that's so about you.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:36.320]   But at the same time, there are other different ways of news gathering.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.320]   I mean, I spend my time on Twitter and I follow different news sources
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:41.320]   and I get it directly there.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:45.320]   And every once in a while, you know, I'll see something from another social site
[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:51.320]   or it'll come up in my RSS or however, you know, I choose to get news at that specific moment in time.
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:54.320]   What Buzzfeed is trying to capture is this instance where it's like, sure,
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:56.320]   I'm not going to click on Me Too posts on Facebook.
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:00.320]   I'm not going to click on, you know, ten reasons why, you know,
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:03.320]   girls who went to college in Boston love coffee.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:04.320]   Like, I don't care about those things.
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.320]   That's so you.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.320]   Yeah, it's so me though.
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:09.320]   It's so me, but I don't want to click on it.
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:13.320]   I think that what we see is we see those people in there on Facebook,
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:17.320]   what we see, you know, people on Twitter who perhaps are searching for, you know,
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.320]   specific news sources and may follow Buzzfeed.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.320]   We're seeing people on YouTube or on Instagram or on Vine who are following Buzzfeed
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:28.320]   or they're going on Snapchat Discover or they're going through Buzzfeed's, you know, native app.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.320]   What we're seeing is this idea that Buzzfeed is saying, which is just,
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:34.320]   why do we need to have a site for all of this?
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:36.320]   How can we, you know, integrate it more?
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:40.320]   And I think, you know, that we're seeing it, you know, in a real way being played out, you know,
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:43.320]   by another media company and that would be Business Insider.
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.320]   They have their insider.
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:49.320]   IMSS. Insider.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:50.320]   Insider.
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:51.320]   That's different from Business Insider.
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:53.320]   It's different from Tech Insider.
[02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:54.320]   Yes.
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:55.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.320]   It doesn't have a website at all.
[02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:01.320]   It doesn't have, it's really hard to search for because you just want to.
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:02.320]   How do you search for it?
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:05.320]   Yeah, but it's just there, you know, it's one of those things.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.320]   Because nobody is supposed to go to it.
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.320]   Yeah, it's just called Insider.
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.320]   The Insider.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:10.320]   I think that might be right now.
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:11.320]   That's wrong.
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:12.320]   That's another Insider.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:16.320]   So what you're seeing is that they have this thing, it's called Insider, and they have, you know,
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:20.320]   Instagram, and they have other methods that they're delivering.
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:21.320]   You can't find it.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:22.320]   I know.
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:27.320]   But part of it is that they're, then, well, that has to do with the fact that Google doesn't
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:30.320]   allow, you know, Facebook or Twitter searches.
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:35.320]   But the idea is that you're going to come across this stuff natively, and you're not going to want to
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:37.320]   spend a lot of time bouncing around a website.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:45.320]   You don't want to consume that video or that news into, oh, here we go, techinsider.io/ladest.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.320]   Techinsider.io/ladest.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:52.320]   Techinsider.io/ladest.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:59.320]   But what it is, it's designed to be that sort of native experience.
[02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:03.320]   Whether or not that that's something that's effective, I mean, it's untested, it's yet to be proven.
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:06.320]   And the reason they don't care if you go to that page, you're not supposed to go to that page.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:09.320]   This is supposed to be linked from everywhere else to that, right?
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.320]   You're supposed to find it on Facebook.
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:13.320]   I believe that they also have other stuff.
[02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:14.320]   I'm not exactly sure how it works.
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:17.320]   I'm not really that hip on the ti.io.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:29.320]   But what I do know is that they're really trying to push to make this native play and trying to get people who are actively within those social networks.
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:30.320]   Listen to the headlines.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.320]   They're just viral.
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.320]   Absolutely viral.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.320]   It looks like Aaron Sorkin's new Steve Jobs movie is a flop.
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.320]   Why is it impossible to try Google's new great phones?
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.320]   The man who helped create the iPod reveals the moment he and his wife decided to leave Apple.
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:47.320]   I mean, I've caught the viral infection.
[02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:49.320]   People are carving trumple lanterns.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:50.320]   Apple just went out and was...
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.320]   Making me feel dirty.
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:56.320]   How does Stop Windows 7 from constantly asking you to get to Windows 10?
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.320]   These are 10 of the best wildlife pictures taken in the last 20 years.
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:02.320]   These five Game of Thrones characters recast and you probably didn't even notice.
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:03.320]   Yeah.
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:04.320]   And on and on.
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:05.320]   And I think that...
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:07.320]   I bet it's really successful too.
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:10.320]   Well, it's the separation between content and news and...
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.320]   Pizza is the key to this strange economic principle.
[02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.320]   How could you not click that?
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.320]   How could you not click that?
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:19.320]   I don't know.
[02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:21.320]   But if it's not about a pie chart, I'm out of here.
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:27.320]   Steve Kovac, though, who's a regular on the show is the guy who wrote the iPhone 6s screen is so sensitive it can weigh things.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:28.320]   Oh, no.
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:29.320]   That's the best one.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:33.320]   Scientists have an idea of why everyone is obsessed with bacon.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:37.320]   Bacon is automatically viral.
[02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.320]   Just put the word bacon in.
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:44.320]   But I think that it comes down to the fact is whether or not these sites, what their end goal is.
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:52.320]   If it's to create thoughtful reporting, which Buzzfeed does time and time again, especially, you know, even in its tech section, I mean, shout out to Matt Honan.
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:54.320]   He's great at what he does.
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.320]   Yeah, Matt breaks stories like crazy.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:59.320]   All the time and they have Natasha Tiku over there now and they just have people...
[02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:03.320]   But you almost feel like that's them trying to cover up what they're really up to.
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:10.320]   Like, yeah, let's hire some prestigious reporters, break some news, then nobody will pay attention to what we're really trying to do, which is basically up worthy.
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:12.320]   Yeah, basically.
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:23.320]   So on the bacon article, there are two C also articles that actually have a picture of the American flag made out of bacon.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.320]   I think that sort of proves the point.
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:29.320]   Okay, don't tell me the URL because I got to do an ad right now and I wouldn't want to be distracted.
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:33.320]   We'll talk about the GIF election or is it GIF election?
[02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:34.320]   We can fight over that.
[02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.320]   I think it was a black dress.
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:41.320]   But first, a word from Linda.com, the online learning platform made for you.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.320]   You're curious. You want to learn. You're smart.
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:47.320]   You want to make things happen. Get a better job. Get better at your job.
[02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:51.320]   Have a... Get better at your hobby, photography or coding.
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:06:00.320]   Linda.com is everything for the curious mind. If you're interested in photography, you want to take better photos, you got to check out LYNDA.
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:03.320]   Two new courses that are fabulous.
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:10.320]   One of them taught by a good friend of mine who is one of my favorite photographers, Ben Long, the introduction to photography, getting started with photography.
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:15.320]   They do a five day photo challenge to help improve your composition skills.
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:26.320]   And for the high end, heavy duty folks, new courses on things like color correction, making selective adjustments in Adobe Camera Raw Lightroom, essential training, the fundamentals of Photoshop.
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:30.320]   There's been... Look at, they get the best teachers.
[02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:33.320]   These guys are passionate about their subject. They teach well.
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:37.320]   They communicate their passion. And these are videos that are shot professionally.
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:41.320]   These are not YouTube videos. This is great content.
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:47.320]   You get a transcript so you can search right to the part of the show you want, or you can go beginning to end.
[02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:51.320]   You can download your tutorials and watch them on the go.
[02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:58.320]   I just love Linda.com. What we've done is we've set it up so that you can experience it for 10 days just like you were a paying subscriber, the run of the place.
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:01.320]   That's one of the things I like. You pay a flat monthly fee.
[02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:08.320]   And you don't have to choose ahead of time what courses you want to take. You can take any of them. More than 3,000 courses. You can take any of them.
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:13.320]   So dabble all you want. No need to pick a major.
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:18.320]   Just go to Linda.com/twit2 and have 10 days to run around and see the stuff you can see.
[02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:21.320]   Learn the stuff you can learn. Certainly enough time to take a few courses.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:26.320]   But what I want you to do is get an idea of what Linda.com can offer you so you can sign up.
[02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:31.320]   Linda.com/twit and the number two for your free 10-day trial.
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:37.320]   They've also got courses on business skills like resume building negotiation and how to run businesses.
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:46.320]   Two leadership skills. LYNDALinda.com/twit2.
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:53.320]   I did not watch the 11-hour marathon of Hillary Clinton testifying before Congress in the Benghazi investigation.
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:59.320]   But I did think what was interesting is Matt Boor's article about it on Medium, of course.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:07.320]   He's pointing out now that apparently Clinton has become a master of the GIF.
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:24.320]   The animated GIF. And it does seem to be. There are a few moments in the testimony where she was clearly aware that she was creating a moment that would be spread virally.
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:30.320]   It's not just Jonah Peretti who's figured out that the best way to get attention is to go viral.
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:34.320]   I think Donald Trump's figured that. She is the cross-platform candidate.
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:43.320]   Look at this. The brush it off. You don't think that that was unconscious. That was very clearly conscious.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:51.320]   That's made for a GIF. So I think what he's pointing out in his article is,
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:57.320]   by the way, here are some of the headlines. "Eight times Hillary Clinton didn't care in GIFs."
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:02.320]   Hillary's testimony before the Benghazi committee in GIFs.
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:09.320]   This is the greatest Hillary Clinton-Bengazi reaction GIF ever image.
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:14.320]   He says, "Gifts matter. A fast traveling GIF bite will prove devastating.
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:23.320]   For candidates unable to preemptively supply the public with jiffable reactions and gestures to fit the campaign's narrative."
[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:33.320]   This is the election we're heading into, folks. Nixon's sweating. Bush checking his watch to caucus in a tank.
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:41.320]   This election will produce GIFs that will negatively shape the perception of candidates until the day they leave the Earth.
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:46.320]   I love this. He says, "Canets need to sit down and address their GIF plan."
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:50.320]   I don't know. I'm saying totally believe this.
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:59.320]   I wouldn't exactly say that Hillary is the master of the graphics interchange format. I believe that that would have to go to Drake.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:02.320]   Okay. The rapper Drake. I'm not saying she invented it.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:06.320]   But she's the first politician to think about this and consciously manipulate it.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:11.320]   Drake, little known, he invented the image format. He almost called it the "Diff."
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:16.320]   It was the Drake interchange format. He was too busy on Degrassi. He couldn't work it out in time.
[02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:24.320]   Actually, though, when you look through something like your Twitter stream and you see Hillary Clinton, Hotline Beng.
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:26.320]   Huge. Hotline Beng.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:40.320]   All the, I say "Giff" as well. But "Giff" GIF, the GIF or GIF of Drake dancing is pretty...
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:44.320]   You put GIFs in your Twitter feed in reaction.
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:47.320]   Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah.
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:54.320]   Yes. I have his folder. It's on my desktop. It is separated by feelings.
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:57.320]   What? No. Yes.
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:59.320]   Are you kidding me? No.
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:03.320]   So you have on your desktop folders for different feelings.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.320]   Yes. And when you tweet and you want to express a feeling, you will look in that folder and find the right GIF.
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:11.320]   Yes. Except for... I got to start following you.
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:20.320]   Except for... I actually have a job on Twitter and that is to provide a very specific image to Alex Wilhelm, who is also a friend of the show.
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.320]   Love Alex. Yep.
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.320]   Did he put you up to this?
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:25.320]   No.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:34.320]   But I have... I said when the other day, which is... I believe I just captioned it Thursday. It's all the way down, I think.
[02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.320]   Because I tweet a lot. Apparently.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:40.320]   I tweet a lot. I was sick this week too, which is remarkable.
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:46.320]   That's one. I didn't actually make that one. But there's one further... That one I made.
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:50.320]   So what folder is this in?
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:55.320]   That's the dancing folder or the working folder, depending.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:59.320]   Do you have a folder on your desktop?
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:00.320]   I don't have any folders.
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.320]   I feel like you should do this.
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:03.320]   Jiffs are pretty popular in our Slack.
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:06.320]   Oh, we take the... It's Slack that created this problem.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.320]   The automated GIF bot.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:10.320]   Slack for Patchets the problem. I don't know if it created...
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:15.320]   Yeah, the Jiffy bot, which is our... We take the lazy shortcut, which is...
[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:20.320]   You can do slash Jiffy and then you just type in any keyword and it pulls up a random one.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.320]   Usually it makes no sense. The options that it chooses.
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.320]   I wonder if... It's part of the fun.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:31.320]   See, so I first became aware of Slack when I was working with our developers in Austin for the new website.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:36.320]   And this is what they use. And apparently they're very aware of all of this.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.320]   So what is it? It's...
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:38.320]   Jiffy.
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:39.320]   G slash Jiffy.
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:40.320]   PHY, right?
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:41.320]   This really doesn't help the panel.
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.320]   That's a gifty.
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:44.320]   Yeah.
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:47.320]   Oh, I'm not allowed to use this command. I've been blocked.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.320]   Ouch.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:49.320]   I've been Jiffy blocked.
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:51.320]   You must have abused it.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:53.320]   Holy cow.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.320]   Thanks for Kitchens blocking me from the Jiffy.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.320]   I might have done that to myself because I think there's a command you can say.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:03.320]   I don't want to see those Jiffs anymore. I think I might have done that.
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:04.320]   Awesome.
[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:06.320]   So Drake, if any of the Jiffs...
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:12.320]   No, he... I think that what you see here is the phenomenon that Hillary is also doing with
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:19.320]   doing, which is that you have these specific actions or reactions that you can use really
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:24.320]   easily and share them really quickly. And it can mean a lot. You can put that up and you
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:28.320]   can just say like that face when you've had it.
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:32.320]   She's not a stranger to the meme. There's that picture of her with the sunglasses looking
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:38.320]   at her blackberry, right? Wasn't there a whole meme of her in the situation room?
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:39.320]   Yes.
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:45.320]   It was Hillary Clinton checking her blackberry, I think was the official name of the meme.
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:51.320]   But I mean, I browse Reddit a lot. I use and tweet Jiffs as much as the next guy.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:55.320]   But does that do anything for her though? Is that something you can control?
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:00.320]   And it's just as likely that it's going to damage her image as it is that it's...
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.320]   Not if it's specific Jiffy.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:07.320]   Yeah, so if you... Yeah, but I'm telling you, that's why you got to take control.
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:09.320]   How?
[02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:13.320]   Because you got to spin it because... So you need to...
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:18.320]   I don't know how, but I don't know how Buzzfeed does viral videos either.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:24.320]   I think there's a way to win over the Jiffing population.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:29.320]   I think it has a very strong Venn diagram overlap with the "that is so me" population.
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:33.320]   I think that that... I think that comes to come to bring it back.
[02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:37.320]   But I think... How about Boomerang? Does that count?
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:40.320]   The new Instagram app, the one second back and forth.
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:43.320]   That seems like somebody a lazy Jiff strategy.
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:50.320]   It is the easiest way of creating Jiffs that anyone has found on mobile.
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:54.320]   People have been trying to crack that knot for a year now,
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:57.320]   and I think Boomerang is the one that comes the closest.
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.320]   I like the Google Photos auto-stitch. If you shot a bunch of photos,
[02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:05.320]   then they'll recommend it.
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:07.320]   Jiffs, those. Yeah, those are good.
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:09.320]   So here's... Apparently there's a site...
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:13.320]   Text from Hillary Duck, a tumbler.
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:15.320]   So here's Joe Biden.
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:20.320]   He's talking to the president saying she's just going to love the new Justin Bieber video,
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:23.320]   and she text back to her voice.
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:25.320]   I think that's good.
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:28.320]   I think it's good for her in a certain demographic.
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.320]   It's my second favorite.
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:32.320]   But she didn't. What's your favorite?
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.320]   Hey, man, I've got to find out what her favorite is.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.320]   Then you could talk Patrick.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.320]   Joe Biden needs ice cream.tumbler.com,
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:40.320]   which is just pictures of Joe Biden needing ice cream.
[02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.320]   A lot of ice cream.
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:44.320]   Sometimes he's eating two ice creams.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:47.320]   Go ahead, Patrick.
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.320]   While I search for Joe Biden needs ice cream.
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:52.320]   I want to see that too, but it's like, you know,
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:56.320]   Kim Jong-il, or is it Kim Jong-un looking at things.
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.320]   It's the nature of virality.
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:00.320]   There's no way you can control it, first of all.
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:07.320]   And certainly Hillary Clinton didn't do anything special to create that bad-ass,
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:10.320]   text-sending persona for herself.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:17.320]   And I don't think that anyone can create positive shifts in the campaign.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:19.320]   This is such a bad-ass picture.
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:21.320]   Joe Biden flashing a 20.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:24.320]   While he's eating ice cream and wearing two Hamilton's.
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:26.320]   Two Hamilton's, sorry.
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:28.320]   Two Hamilton's in a vanilla cone.
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:30.320]   Apparently he eats a lot of ice cream.
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:31.320]   He does.
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:33.320]   Yeah, you're pointing some out here so I won't miss any, right?
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:35.320]   There's one where he is eating two ice creams.
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:38.320]   Seems to go more cone than cup.
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:41.320]   Yeah, I'm more than a cup kind of guy.
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:44.320]   This is a more than one page tumbler.
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:45.320]   Oh my God, yes.
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:46.320]   This goes on and on and on.
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:47.320]   There, he got older.
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:48.320]   Yeah.
[02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:49.320]   There it is.
[02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:50.320]   There's a lot of these two.
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.320]   Joe the double-fisted ice cream meter.
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:53.320]   He's eating two.
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:54.320]   That's my favorite.
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:57.320]   I love, I love, I love text from Hillary.
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:58.320]   Don't get me wrong.
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:02.320]   I think that that's what she's really good at is making these like reproducible and
[02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:04.320]   and shareable situations.
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:07.320]   But for my money, it's all about Joey B with his vanilla cone.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:09.320]   Two Hamilton's in a cone.
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:16.320]   He's not running, but this is the platform he could run on.
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:17.320]   I'm telling you.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:18.320]   Joe eats ice cream.
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:21.320]   I'm telling you, if you are a modern day politician, what are you doing?
