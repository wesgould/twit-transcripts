[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.280]   Oh, Doctor has a theory about the Sony hack.

[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.520]   Here we are, the first show of 2015.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.960]   Joining me, Jason Snell from Six Colors.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.880]   - Fairly out.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.440]   - Good to have you.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.720]   Sixcolors.com is his new website, former--
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.400]   - It's great to be here.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.000]   - Editorial director at IDG at Macworld and PCWorld.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.520]   It's really good to have you.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.160]   Happy New Year.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.920]   - It's a pleasure, Happy New Year.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.760]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.800]   This is my first podcast of the year.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   So I'm happy to be up here.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.400]   - Me too, me too.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.120]   Also here, Owen J.J. Stone.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.280]   Oh, Doc Dada from OwenJ.Jstone.com.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.120]   And he's got--
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.480]   - Just for you.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.480]   - Just for you.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.000]   - He's got some shaving cream.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.200]   Actually, you're on for--
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.240]   Well, you're on 'cause we love you 'cause you're great.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.200]   But you're also on to give me some advice because--
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.480]   So we did a-- you may know, we did a 24-hour broadcast.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.280]   Great success on New Year's Eve to--
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.960]   We call it the 24-hours of 2015.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.680]   Second year in a row, we've done it.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.080]   In which we say Happy New Year in every time zone,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   all 27 time zones in those 24 hours.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.800]   In fact, we had collars for many of the time zones.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.440]   It was great fun.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.960]   But what we did differently this year
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.640]   was we were raising money for UNICEF.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.480]   I think a really great cause, the United Nations Children's Fund,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.400]   helps kids all over the world who
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.280]   need inexpensive things like mosquito nets, more elaborate
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.960]   things like education, helps kids be safe from violence
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.560]   and exploitation.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's really a great cause.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.600]   Charity Navigator ranks them among its highest charities.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.200]   That's why we wanted to use it 'cause it was global.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.560]   So everybody who's watching all over the world can get behind it
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.160]   and because it is such a really well-run charity.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.880]   But we had planned-- we thought we'd raised $20,000.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.680]   That was our goal in the 24-hours.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.840]   Because I thought, well, this first time we've done it,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.160]   we have really no idea, but let's say $20,000.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.560]   Jeff Jarvis, who's-- oh, of course,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.480]   a wonderful host of This Week in Google--
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.640]   very kindly said, well, let me get things started.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.600]   I will shave for the first time in 42 years.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.400]   I will shave my beard if you raise $20,000.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.640]   Amazingly, we raised $20,000 before noon.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.960]   So Jeff kindly let me shave him his beard,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.120]   which I did a terrible job.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.680]   He had to go back and fix it up.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.280]   But then that-- and this is my-- I'm saying this is an excuse
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.000]   'cause then I got swept away.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120]   And I said, well, if we make-- first then Sarah Lane pitched in.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.400]   She said, if we get to $30,000, I'll sing my--
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.280]   the song I hate more than any other song with a passion--
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.640]   "Bear Naked Ladies" one week.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.200]   And she did.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.320]   We did and she did.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.040]   And that was great.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.320]   So I got-- I said, I have to-- I have to end it up.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.960]   I have to pony up.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.240]   I have to participate.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.440]   So I said, if we make $40,000, I'll shave my head.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.720]   And if we make $50,000, I'll-- and this, I thought,
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   there's never going to happen.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.000]   This is safe.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.560]   I will get a tattoo.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.920]   You see those of you watching a video, I'm padding.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.920]   Padded part of my anatomy.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.360]   Touching the sensitive area.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.040]   That's where the tattoo went.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.200]   So yeah, we got $40,000.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.720]   And ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing left up top.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.080]   And we also got $15,000.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   $50,000.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.960]   In fact, we ended up-- in fact, you can still-- you can put us over--
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.880]   I think we're well over 70 now.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.760]   If you go to unisefusa.org/twit, we're at 61,000.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.880]   But there's more than 10,000 from our auctions.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.960]   So we're well over 70.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.320]   I'd love to get even higher.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.480]   We're going to keep that site open if you'd like to help out.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.560]   unisefusa.org/twit.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.660]   So I had to-- actually, initially, we had my head
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.200]   and I had my clip.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.840]   And a number of people said, you know, that's not shaving.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.720]   Now, you're full of Lex Luthor now.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.240]   I am well.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.240]   I am Lex Luthor.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.740]   I am--
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.560]   You're co-jacking him.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.920]   I am the one who knocks now.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.960]   And now I understand.
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.800]   Oh, and you're here to help me to give me advice,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.760]   because I prefer to call it Black Bear and Polar Bear.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.800]   If you were only here, I wish you were.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.680]   Man, the best part is we could rub our heads together
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.320]   and create static electricity.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.280]   Friction on what happened.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.160]   All got like some--
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.160]   So it exploded.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.880]   How long have you been bald up there?
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.160]   I have been shaved my head since I was 23.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.200]   I don't know how old I am now, but it's probably like 10 years
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.280]   or so to do it too.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.160]   I am googling.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.840]   Last night, I'm googling--
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.000]   First time you shave your head, what you did.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.360]   I'm googling.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.860]   I know.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.360]   The best part--
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.860]   The best part?
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.000]   People come up and want to rub your head, like--
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.240]   Oh, it was worse when it was--
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.280]   It was worse when it was kind of short.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.600]   Then it was like a little teddy bear.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.440]   And everybody wanted to rub it.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.600]   Now, it's a little scratchy.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.920]   It's like number one grit.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.440]   Oh, yeah, it is.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.240]   It's a little sandpaper.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.120]   And then, well, in two weeks, it'll be soft and fuzzy again.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.960]   It'll be a little teddy bear.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.520]   Well, that's what I'm counting on.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.800]   Because this-- unlike the tattoo--
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.480]   and I did get a twit tattoo on my behind--
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.280]   unlike the twit tattoo, this will come back, I hope.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.000]   What if it doesn't?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Well, then I'll be you.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.200]   I'll just grow-- I'll grow used to it.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.920]   I did-- I was freezing last night.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.280]   I realized that you need a cap.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.760]   Do you wear a night cap?
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   Yeah, I have hats.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.560]   I have to wear a hat.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.220]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.320]   And when you go outside--
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.160]   I wear a night cap.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.520]   I'm a wearing a night cap, dude.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   And I think, frankly, now this is-- for the first time ever,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.360]   this pork pie hat looks good.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   This was-- this was-- you know, this is the breaking bad look.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.640]   I need to grow a goatee.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.480]   So now I decide-- I'm not going to shave either.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.120]   As long as I'm scritchy, I'm going to let it all grow out.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.320]   See, we'll have a race.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   See what grows faster.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.680]   See what grows faster.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.960]   My beard or my head?
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.920]   Let it be all even.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.600]   Then you can turn it to a wildebeest man.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   Anyway, props to those of you who do this every day.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.640]   Because I did actually go down to the Boulevard Barbers.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.320]   And they are very good.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.360]   They knew exactly what to do.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.240]   The barber there, Sarah, used a straight racer on me.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.200]   Have you ever used a straight racer?
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.000]   I've had it done.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I've never used one myself.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.800]   I am terrified.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.320]   I wouldn't do it myself.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.840]   I have a very, very eloquent old gentleman that
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.960]   opens his barbershop like 3 o'clock in the morning.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.320]   And I go to him and he does it.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.880]   And I'm just scared what I'm sitting there.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   But it feels amazing.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.560]   It is the best kind of shave.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.200]   It was great.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.400]   She used essential oils, orange and stuff,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.560]   and just scraped it.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.840]   She made you feel special.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.920]   But that's it.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.840]   I'm done.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.120]   I'm growing it out now.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.360]   I don't think there's any rule that I
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.920]   had to keep a frame like the time.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.440]   That's totally fair.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.400]   I'm humiliated now sufficiently.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.160]   Grow it out all year.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.320]   Don't get a haircut and then donate it to end of the year.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.440]   Start all over again.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.720]   At the end of the show, I'm going to give thanks.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.800]   Because boy, I'm the one in front of the camera.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.120]   And of course, we had lots of guests.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.360]   But it's really people behind the scenes who
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.840]   worked the hardest, like John Slanino, who worked 48 hours,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.760]   not 24 hours getting this thing ready, getting the ball drop,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.880]   going and everything.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.840]   So I have a list of a lot of people
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.680]   that think will roll those credits at the end of the show.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.520]   We'll use up the time now.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.320]   You're not going to CES on JJ Stone?
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.120]   No, I haven't gone to CES in like four years.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.360]   I've really found it pointless.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.960]   They push so much stuff at you, half of its crap.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.480]   And doesn't--
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:03.960]   It's never ships.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.880]   --and never doing anything.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.840]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.000]   So you go there and you're like, I need that in my life.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.560]   And it's like, oh, we're never going to make that.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.760]   We just brought it here and put it on the table
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.440]   for you to not touch and want.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.720]   I bet you, Jason Snow, because you were at IDG,
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.800]   you had to go every day.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.480]   Yeah, in fact, I had arguments with my boss multiple years
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.760]   about whether I needed to go or not.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.800]   And they're like, no, no, you have to go.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.000]   Last year, I negotiated.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.880]   Like, I only had to go for a day.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.840]   This show--
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.280]   This show, the first show of the year,
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.360]   is the--
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.320]   aren't I glad I'm not going to CES show?
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.120]   I was saying on Twitter earlier today
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.640]   that I am totally qualified to talk about CES today
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.480]   on Twitter because I'm available.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.200]   I'm not-- I'm not in Vegas.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.240]   That qualifies me.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.720]   Almost everybody who--
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.560]   almost everybody who goes says, it's great.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.280]   And almost everybody who's not going says, thank god,
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.560]   I don't have to go.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.400]   Those of us who've been more than 10 times.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.520]   And if you've been more than 10 times,
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.800]   then you have the right to say, you know, I'm done.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.560]   Do you know what's great about things?
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.800]   Other people are there with you.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.240]   It's not great that it's there.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.040]   It's great because a massive amount of people
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.800]   you know in your industry are there.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.400]   And you can pick and needle and choose
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.880]   and talk about a subject.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.000]   That's the awesome part of it.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.400]   Otherwise, it's pointless.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.560]   That's totally true.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.720]   I would even throw in there.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.800]   It's not valueless.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.880]   There are lots of interesting things to see.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.240]   The problem is there's so much there
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.720]   that the interesting things are this tiny fraction,
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.080]   and you've got to get through a million people to get there.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.640]   And it is not a pleasure to go to CES, I would say.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.280]   For me, I never liked it.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.560]   I don't really like going to Vegas.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.680]   And Vegas, when it's completely at capacity with tech people,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.560]   it's kind of insane.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.560]   It's so hard to get around.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.360]   It's not as if there is an interesting stuff there.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.120]   And in fact, some of the best of it, CES, is the weird stuff.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.200]   It's not the press releases about things
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.480]   that are new TVs that are kind of boring.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.160]   It's the totally crazy stuff that you end up stumbling into
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.400]   and being like, why does this exist?
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.480]   Why is this here?
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.920]   And often, there isn't a good answer to that.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.040]   I want to break it down a little bit
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.960]   because there are some categories.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.520]   There are categories you won't see at CES this year.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.320]   Some categories that have been big in the past.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.400]   The smartphone industry, the phone industry in general,
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   has gone to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.840]   And so as a phone show, CES now is actually kind of terrible.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.920]   It's not for phones anymore like it used to be.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.080]   Right.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.480]   It used to be a lot of cars went to CES.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.560]   Less so this year, although--
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.280]   It used to have a huge, one of those conventions
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.600]   that are buildings which are full of cars and car stereos.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.280]   Although I have to say, the one category that might be interesting,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.640]   I would love to see more of.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.040]   We've seen it in past years, but I think
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.960]   this is going to be the big year.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.200]   It's autonomous vehicles.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.080]   Look what Audi posted on their Instagram.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.280]   This is an A7 that's designed to be driverless.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.440]   And they say, you're a pilot to CES today.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.080]   And I'm wondering if they might even use that to pilot some journalists around CES.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.200]   Oh, wouldn't surprise me.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.320]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.360]   Google is supposedly also going to have some stuff there.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.440]   I remember a couple of years ago, Chevrolet had some autonomous urban vehicles.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.240]   They were very small capsules that just had two seats.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.360]   But the Google car is done.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.520]   I have a feeling they'll be there.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.080]   It's sort of a small car too.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.040]   Well, Nevada is essentially lawless, right?
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   So Nevada actually is autonomous vehicles.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.480]   I know it's one of the states.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.200]   One of the states where I think it is legal.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.800]   I think they do a lot of testing there.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.360]   So that's going to be kind of interesting.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.480]   There will be TVs there.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.080]   So we are going to send three reporters.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.800]   Robert Ballis there.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.840]   Father Robert will be there.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.440]   Oh, nice.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.360]   Dicty Bartolo, who always goes and does the junky stuff, the bottom floor.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   That's the Chinese pavilion.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.720]   Oh, that is the greatest.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.920]   He always looks for the weird and interesting stuff.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   So he'll be doing that.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.080]   He also is doing showstoppers tonight.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.600]   Right.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   They have, I'll explain that in a little bit.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.680]   And Scott Wilkett's in our home theater guy.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.960]   He's going to be there and talk to the TV things.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.480]   Now, in the past, it's always been Sony, Panasonic, LG, Sharp, and--
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.320]   Samsung.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.320]   Samsung.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.160]   The Korean Japanese companies.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.320]   But you know what?
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.560]   Well, we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.400]   There are some new stuff like quantum.technology and 4K
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.840]   that those companies are bringing out.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.240]   But I'm also hoping he'll go over-- and I know we will.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.400]   We're going to send him to TCL in high sense.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.080]   The Chinese companies, just as the Korean companies took over
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.480]   from the Japanese companies.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.680]   When Samsung and Lucky Gold Star said, you know what?
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.400]   We want the premier business, the profit business, and took over
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.720]   and really have put great pain to the Japanese TV manufacturers.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.520]   They're all losing money on TVs in Japan.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.160]   In that same way, I think China is hoping to supplant Korea.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.040]   And high sense and TCL, both Chinese companies,
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.960]   and both are doing some really interesting stuff.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.240]   So we're going to get Scott to-- so we will have coverage.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.360]   We just won't have the big booth.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.560]   But you know, mobile nations, Renee Richie's company
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.480]   is doing a big booth with GeekBeat TV and Tom's hardware.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.280]   They're actually taking our old location in the South Hall.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.840]   Yeah, I was talking to Serenity Caldwell.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.880]   Serenity would be a damn.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.760]   She's going to be on there.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.920]   So they'll do that.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.720]   He cost us hundreds of thousand dollars.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.920]   And I didn't feel like-- I felt like you actually
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.960]   can get a better look at CES by staying at home
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   and letting everybody feed you the stuff.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.600]   The internet makes CES, frankly not that useful,
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.520]   if what you're going to do is find out the new stuff.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.480]   If what you're going to do is hang out with Owen and Jason.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.920]   Live the dream.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.440]   Stuff.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.600]   If it's a party, it's not-- you know,
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.360]   expense accounts aren't what they used to be.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.840]   I remember going with Gina Smith on the Ziff Davis
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.640]   expense account.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.600]   That was living.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   Sweet.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.760]   You could-- it didn't matter what you bought.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.840]   As long as it was for a client, it was OK.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.360]   So autonomous vehicles, we're expecting
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.040]   some interesting TV stuff like Quantum Dot.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.080]   The story of TVs at CES in the last five or 10 years--
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.080]   I mean, it really has been, what do we do now that HD?
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.480]   The HD conversion has happened.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.160]   Because that was the big thing was HD conversion.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.920]   We're going to do that.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.200]   And now it's sort of the quest for what else can we
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.960]   do to sell TVs?
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.280]   Because everybody just bought a TV.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:49.920]   So what do we do?
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.440]   And so--
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.040]   So it was 3D?
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.200]   They tried 3D flop.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.640]   Kind of a flop.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.480]   They've done the curved screen thing.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.360]   There's some OLED stuff that is early, but is kind of interesting
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.360]   that is to replace the plasmas.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.560]   Because they don't like plasmas anymore.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.920]   I got the very expensive Samsung curved OLED a year ago,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.960]   more than a year ago.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.040]   And it's still my best TV.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:08.680]   I love it.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.640]   But it's only 55.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.400]   It's not giant.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:10.720]   Right.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.880]   It was very expensive.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:11.920]   It was very expensive.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.720]   It just did an OLED TV review and said
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.800]   that it was the best picture they'd seen.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.120]   It is.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.520]   That wasn't a plasma.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:17.880]   It is.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.920]   And I have the old V-A-Ras, which were the great Panasonic
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.720]   plasmas.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.400]   And they've discontinued those.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.920]   Now, some are saying-- so what's out there really right now
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:26.960]   is OLED and LCD.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.000]   And OLED is prohibitively expensive still.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.520]   It's coming down.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.320]   But it's-- yeah.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.680]   LCD is kind of the technology that they're really pushing.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.440]   They're pushing 4K.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.600]   And then this quantum dot.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.080]   Now, I'm going to read you--
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.520]   this is what Wikipedia says quantum dot is.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.440]   It's a nano-crystal made of semiconductor materials
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.840]   small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:53.280]   Its excitons are confined in all three spatial dimensions.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.720]   OK.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.520]   I wish my excitons were confined.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.680]   Did Jordy LaForge write this article?
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.840]   Is that what's happening?
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.080]   This is the Marvel universe of television.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.640]   Like, you just start coming in and telling me about quantum
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.920]   phasas and protons.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.120]   Like, I don't care about-- like, the only TV
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.160]   that I even care about, which I don't know why I do,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.440]   because I hate Sony TVs anymore.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.120]   But I want a Sony TV, because now I
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.320]   could put my PlayStation on my Sony without another PlayStation
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.840]   in the world.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.200]   Sony--
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   Sony--
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:19.960]   --with these PlayStation.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.120]   Sony made the first quantum dot TVs.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.200]   The XPR in 2013.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.400]   Because that's why I don't buy Sony anymore.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.200]   Sony's always first with this.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.920]   Oh, this space ads magical module--
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.420]   That do.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:30.920]   It doesn't do.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.560]   --or a instant turtle thing.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.640]   And guess what?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.520]   The quality of the image that you put to the TV
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.280]   is the same quality of the image you put to TV.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.240]   So unless I got quantum physics DVDs or Blu-rays,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.400]   what's the difference going to be for this television?
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   What is it going to do for me with my crappy Verizon
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.960]   files cable that's pushing out 720p on 80% of the channels?
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.120]   Oh, I can't take it.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.800]   That's the problem with the 4K stuff.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.560]   That's the same thing.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.360]   It's like, yeah, it's a 4K TV.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.320]   What can I put on it?
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.160]   Nothing.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:55.720]   Nothing.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.320]   Nothing.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:56.800]   Nothing.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.360]   Nothing.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.440]   So the upshot of quantum dots, according to Scott Wilkinson,
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   is black or blacks, better contrast ratios, more even lighting.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.160]   But the proof will be in the pudding
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.000]   when we see the quantum dot TVs this year.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.600]   And he'll have the reviews of that.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.840]   We also expect more OLEDs and lower priced OLEDs.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.400]   But that's it.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.640]   I think those are the two technologies that are survivors.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.440]   I think the way the quantum dot technology works
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.240]   is that every show that's possibly on your screen
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.680]   is on your screen in a parallel universe.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.720]   And then one of them is the one you see.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.560]   That's good.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.440]   I'll take that.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.400]   It's all parallel universe now.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.120]   It does sound you're right, Owen, a little bit
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.600]   like a marketing term.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.960]   They're trying so hard to find a way
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.760]   to get everybody bought an HDTV in the last 10 years.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.760]   And those don't turn over.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.920]   TVs don't turn over very fast.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.240]   And all those companies are like,
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.000]   what do we do now to sell new TVs?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.320]   And they still haven't really figured it out.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.280]   The best thing they could do to sell new TVs is say,
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.840]   hey, we sold you a crappy TV last year.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.680]   Trade it in with us.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.160]   We'll give you this new TV for three quarters of the price.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.000]   - Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.920]   - 'Cause that's something that even makes me,
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.840]   'cause I'm like, I have three 55-inch TVs in my house.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.720]   My daughter's got a 47-inch in her room.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.320]   What do you have to do to get me to take it out of her room?
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.400]   You gotta take this TV from me.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.160]   'Cause I'm not gonna sell it to my friends for $200
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.400]   after I spent $1,215 on it.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.480]   Like, what do you do with all these TVs?
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.560]   You keep them because they're still good.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.840]   So a buyback program, people,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.120]   that's how you get me about a new TV.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.720]   - It's like selling mattresses.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.200]   We'll take your own mattress away.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.040]   - We promise. - Exactly.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.640]   - We should explain that while you're,
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.240]   so this isn't a way, this is your preparation
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.480]   for what you're about to hear all week,
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.280]   'cause people with quantum, it's still an LCD.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.120]   - Yeah.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.640]   - It's just a different kind of backlight.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.920]   - And maybe it'll be better, maybe it not.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.800]   It's an LED backlight.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.120]   It's light emitting semiconductor nano crystals.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.920]   - Somebody watch Guardians of the Galaxy this summer,
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.840]   like everybody else did, and they wrote a pamphlet on the D-Mig.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.680]   - Yeah.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.520]   - That's what happened.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.840]   (laughing)
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.320]   - We'll wait with interest to see what those look like.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.640]   Autonomous vehicles, wearables probably will be big.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.080]   They were big last year, but they were all horrible.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.240]   Maybe now we're in the second or third generation
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.320]   of wearables, I think Android wears come a long way.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.160]   But just like previous CES's, Apple's not there,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.320]   except in spirit.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.760]   In 2010 at CES, all they could talk about was the iPad.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.640]   In 2007 at CES, all they could talk about
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.760]   is the iPhone.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.640]   This year it's gonna be iWatch, Apple Watch.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.120]   What is Apple gonna do?
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.880]   And here's everything that we can think of on the shelf,
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.880]   and we just hope that, you know,
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.000]   is, I feel like Android Wear is pretty close.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.960]   There will not be a new Pebble this year at CES, I'm told.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.080]   They may be, I'm wondering if they're kind of
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.680]   sliding behind a little bit.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.920]   - LG has a really nice watch that they're putting off.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.120]   I forgot what it's called, but that LG watch looks really nice.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.080]   - And not the JU watch are the round one.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:49.920]   - Yeah, that one.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.760]   - Yeah.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.600]   - That looks nice.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.760]   - That's a pretty watch.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.840]   And it doesn't have that stupid thing like the,
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.400]   it doesn't have the flat tire.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.920]   We call that the flat tire, yeah.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.520]   - Okay, yeah, it's horrible.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.360]   - I don't mind it.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.560]   You know, I have a flat tire.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.240]   Red talks about the flat tire.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.880]   Like here I have a, a Tog here,
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.720]   what do you say?
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.560]   How do you pronounce that?
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.560]   - Tog for your, or your watch face.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.000]   But of course unlike any Tog,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.280]   there's this little black bar at the bottom.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.760]   - But does the black bar do anything for you?
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.280]   Like do you swipe up with it?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.120]   - Does it not?
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.600]   - No, it's just because they couldn't fit it.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.040]   - I want full value for my money, okay?
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.480]   I don't want to watch with a 10% of it missing.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.480]   I want a whole service of my watch.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.320]   - That's good.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.160]   - Like the new watches.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.400]   - You know what you have to do with the design watch faces?
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.160]   You have to take the six off.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.240]   - See, that's horrible.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.080]   Look at that.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.080]   Take the,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.280]   say that I watch what eBay right now
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.120]   and go get a LG--
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.040]   - There's no six allowed.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   - Oh, wow.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.920]   - I still this watch in terms of pure utility,
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.200]   it doesn't bother me.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.320]   I can live with it.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.240]   - You can call me and I'll tell you what time it is.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.880]   - You know what this does that the Apple.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.480]   (laughing)
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.440]   Hey, oh, and what time is it?
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.360]   It is past six o'clock because you wouldn't know
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.920]   if I did that.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.480]   You know what this watch does that the Apple watch won't do?
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.320]   I don't,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.800]   unless well, maybe you know better, Jason,
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   'cause you cover Apple pretty closely.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.560]   Will it have these kinds of different watch faces?
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.400]   - Yes.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.240]   - It will, okay.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.080]   - Yeah, yeah, there.
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:07.920]   - But they'll all come from Apple, I'm guessing.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.520]   - I think there's of either the promise-to-face builder kit
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.000]   or there is one.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.040]   - Yeah, I think-
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.880]   - The only reason they might not-
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.720]   - There's third party store.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.160]   - The one to do that is that Google and others,
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.560]   Google's getting in trouble for allowing Todd Hoyer,
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.800]   this is obviously fake, I could also get a Rolex.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.040]   - Yeah, well, and Pebble had that same problem.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.120]   - These phony-
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.040]   - Right, but no, Apple's got some that they've,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.800]   Apple's got a whole bunch of faces that they've-
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.600]   - But they'll be licensed.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.000]   - And I think there's a third party program for that too,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.120]   but yeah, you know, it's Apple,
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.040]   they're gonna have to approve it
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.640]   and they'll probably say, you know,
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.200]   make sure that you have the rights to this-
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.040]   - They won't get in this kind of-
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.520]   - Intellectual property.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.760]   - I like the idea of being taken pirated.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.840]   I mean, nobody's gonna, let's be,
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.200]   nobody's gonna say, oh, Leo, you got a Todd Hoyer.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.480]   I gotta, they know it's a fake watch face.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.120]   - Right, I guess I would say if I'm Todd Hoyer,
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.520]   I might wanna make a really good-
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.360]   - What a petty-
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.000]   - Or make a really good face for these things.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.320]   - Yeah, Rolex.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.600]   - Yeah, I had a Domo face for my Pebble for Hages-
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.440]   - Right, right.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.520]   - That was totally not licensed.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.360]   - Not licensed.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.680]   - And they finally did one that was licensed,
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.480]   and it's great, or they licensed that one.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.520]   What else will CES bring us?
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.440]   By the way, it's not the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.880]   Again, this year they reminded journalists,
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.360]   CES doesn't stand for anything.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.440]   - It's like DVD.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.280]   - Just remember.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.920]   And you're supposed to say international CES.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.760]   - International CES.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.920]   - What else will international CES bring us?
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.840]   - It doesn't stand for anything, it'll fall for anything.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.120]   - How about home automation?
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.040]   Apple, again, this is an area where Apple,
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.640]   we're pretty sure it's gonna do an Apple TV
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.080]   that will be a hub.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.080]   The Dish folks, Echo Star, has already announced
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.640]   that just as they introduced Hopper,
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.320]   which kind of revolutionized DVRs a couple of years ago
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.960]   with a giant inflatable kangaroo,
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.160]   they plan to do something called Sage,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.840]   which is a home automation hub,
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.040]   along with your DVR and set top box.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.400]   So they own sling box, they have Dish,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.040]   and they're gonna use this Sage platform,
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:07.320]   I presume Hopper as well, to do home automation.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.640]   I think home automation.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.040]   I'm sending Father Robert over to the home automation
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.880]   for the beginning of this year,
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.040]   'cause I have a feeling that.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.400]   In years past it's been disappointing,
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.720]   'cause you have all these different standards,
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.480]   nothing talks to anything else.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.160]   Samsung's gonna introduce appliances
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.120]   that talk to its smart things hub this year,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.760]   so you can tell your dishwasher,
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.640]   hey, wash those dishes, I'm on my way home.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.800]   I don't know why you'd wanna do that.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.640]   - I don't know either.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.680]   - Because people are lazy, and they want things timed out,
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.840]   I wanna get home and have my dishes warmly out.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.320]   (laughing)
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.680]   I have my home automated, and I do it the exact way
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.520]   you just said not to.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   All my stuff is separate.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.800]   I got a Nest, I got an Iris thing from Home Depot,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.240]   I got Phillips Hue lights, I got a thing from,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.080]   you know why?
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.000]   Because I don't want these robots taking over me.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.280]   I don't wanna go and get Samsung smart home,
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.480]   and then Samsung comes and says,
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.600]   "Get the heck out of your house."
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   We own it now, and I'm like, "Wait a second, what happened?"
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.000]   And they're like, "It's actually good."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.800]   - It's actually good if you're worried about Skynet,
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.760]   it's good if the robots don't talk.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.960]   - Yeah, so I don't wanna talk to you,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.560]   'cause I wanna control the lights,
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.400]   I wanna control the heat.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.800]   I don't want the heat to talk to the lights,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.840]   they're gonna be doing something without me knowing.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.840]   - But what if-- - 'Cause that's not cool.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.360]   - What if the heat and the lights hate each other,
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.520]   and the lights turn on and try to heat things up
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.800]   to get the heat shut off?
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.360]   You could have a robot war in your house.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   - In your home.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.800]   - Then I could sit back and do it a show,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.920]   but I do one thing, one person ain't gonna take,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.720]   you know that one commercial they got with the robot,
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.200]   that's the thing, and they're trying to turn you
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.400]   into home automation, but the robot's creepy?
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.480]   - Yeah. - Like during the bedroom,
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.920]   that's the problem. - Yeah, don't like that.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.720]   - 'Cause you get one system that takes everything,
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.400]   that robot's just like, "What do you mean
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.000]   "you're gonna replace me?"
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.840]   (laughs)
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.560]   - Oh my God, you're right.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.960]   You're right, we should cripple these guys
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.720]   and not let them talk together 'cause they might plot.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.080]   - They might plot me up.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.720]   - Here's a picture from-- - The car is driving themselves.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.760]   Robots are making you drinks,
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   they're making that microwave thing from Star Trek
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.040]   that like just magically 3D printers food now,
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.400]   like I don't know Leo.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.280]   - I want my hue lights to talk to my nest,
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.520]   thermostat to talk to my Sonos speakers,
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:04.280]   to talk to my set top box, to talk to my alarm sensors,
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.200]   my lights out front.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.280]   I think they should all talk together.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   - All right. - That's right,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.120]   that was Dr. Morbius reminds us of the very good sci-fi
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.360]   story, I think it was Ray Bradbury,
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.400]   they will come soft rains.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.960]   Do you remember that?
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.640]   When the house takes over, it's computer-controlled house.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.320]   Oh, that's a great, and that was 2026.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.200]   - There's only 11 years from that.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   - Right, so in the next five or 10 years,
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.920]   this stuff will become more interrelated
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.840]   and that'll be useful.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.560]   And then in about 11 years, it'll kill us.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.560]   But for the next 10, it'll be pretty sweet.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.680]   Be pretty sweet that my nest knows,
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.000]   you know, whether I'm in the house or not,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.640]   and the lights can turn themselves on.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.600]   - Enjoy it for now, we know it's over soon anyway.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.440]   - Yeah. - Actually,
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   this will come out of the rains.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.720]   The house does everything.
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.000]   It's actually very kind of beautiful.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.320]   The house is working and cooking stuff,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.840]   but there's no, soon you realize there's no people.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.240]   And then he goes to the outside of the house
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.560]   and you see the silhouettes of the family
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.200]   burned in the paint because they were killed
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.480]   in a nuclear war,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.840]   but the house lives on.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.680]   That's a wonder.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.800]   If you haven't read that story,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.160]   - Spoilers. - I did just spray.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.000]   - I did just spray. - For Ray Bailer.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.640]   - But it's a great story.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.520]   So here's something very exciting.
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:16.280]   Sony Walkman, big banner out front of the CES Hall.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.360]   Sony's bringing back the Walkman for CES.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.040]   (laughing)
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.360]   - Is it like Zoom's older cousin?
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.800]   - Well, they do, they did a Walkman.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.560]   We had it for review on before you buy this year
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.200]   that does HD tracks, which is nice.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.080]   It does the high res music.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.280]   I don't know, this does, I don't know what this does.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.360]   As you can see there on the left, a gold headphone jack.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.400]   I don't, and there's the Walkman logo, isn't that great?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.160]   - Unless it's super small and it fits on like
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   my wrist or my shoulder for the gym,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.000]   what is the point?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.920]   I have a phone.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.240]   - Yeah, I don't know what the point is.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.320]   - My phone plays music.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.640]   - Sony, every phone plays music.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.040]   - Right, that's what happened in the iPod.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.840]   - Exactly, so what is the point of this?
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.200]   - Why'd you do it?
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.320]   I'd rather you bring out a tape deck
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.240]   and do something nostalgic for me as opposed to that.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.960]   - What's funny is that Sony does make phones, right?
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.360]   I mean, it's not like they don't have the Xperia.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.760]   Here's the video.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.920]   - They're making pretty cool phones.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.440]   - This is called Welcome to the New World.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.760]   And she's writing in an elevator,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.320]   but the elevator is going up and she's licking a lollipop.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.000]   Wait a minute, is that Android 5?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.480]   But no, here's music and sound.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.440]   And then there's a lizard, 5.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.360]   Brilliant, the Eiffel Tower.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.800]   Shadows, hands, rainbows, double rainbow,
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.080]   iris, eyeball, eyeball looking.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.440]   What's the eyeball seeing?
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.800]   It looks like a Walkman.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.760]   Now she's smiling, now her hair's standing up on her arm.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.360]   Oh my God, she's crying.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.640]   - She's so beautiful.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.880]   - That's a giant belly and a small child.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.120]   That used to be his home.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.640]   Now he lives in a curtain.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.000]   Welcome to the New World.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.840]   - Sony.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.640]   I think we just got programmed to kill ponies.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.640]   I don't know what that video did.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.120]   That was a college student.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.480]   - Oh my God.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.240]   - That video did absolutely nothing for me,
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.000]   but maybe hate Sony in the back of the end
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.840]   to a Sony on it.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.400]   Like you put a small child on a baby's belly.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.720]   That was only a nice thing in that video.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.920]   I had to feel some kind of redemption in my heart.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.520]   Just stupid, who paid for this stuff?
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520]   Call me Sony.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.080]   - Sony, face on. - Sony, face on.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.320]   - I was gonna say, that video proves JJ's
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.040]   a whole theory about how our world is about to come to an end.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.840]   Actually, that's a little portrayal
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.040]   of the machine control future
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.560]   we all can look forward to.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.040]   - I really feel like something bad should happen.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.440]   I feel like I just got programmed to do something.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.680]   - Like there was a little bit of messages.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   - Little bit of crap. - Little bit of crap.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.920]   Oh, and JJ's doing a rush for kicking ponies.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.240]   - Shake your head.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.280]   - Okay, just like that.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.960]   - Well, you guys are more susceptible to the brainwave.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.960]   - Shake your head.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.280]   - Mind control.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.040]   - You're the only guy with hair on this show.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:49.880]   - That's right.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.920]   - I'm scaring the children now.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.240]   - We are.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.440]   - That video scared the children.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.280]   - Yeah.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.800]   - I was really though.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.560]   I mean, what did that have to do with anything?
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.120]   - It's visionary. - Anything.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.920]   - The new one of what?
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.760]   Rainbow's?
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.600]   We haven't had rainbows. - Rainbows.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.440]   - What?
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.280]   - Rainbows.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.440]   - And at the end, there's a Sony Walkman.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.400]   - Yeah.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.040]   At the end of all that.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.880]   - There was a Sony Walkman?
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.720]   I don't even see it.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   - No, there was. - No, no.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.400]   - Actually, there was.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.240]   - That's gonna be the big review.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.000]   - In the reflection of her eye.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.360]   If you look, I'm not kidding.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.360]   If you look very closely,
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.640]   you could see that little Walkman
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.480]   in the reflection of her eye.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.640]   - That's why she was crying.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.480]   - Yeah.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.560]   - Because Sony still hasn't got anything new for 2015.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.240]   - 'Cause nobody buys.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.440]   - Sony's a troubled company, actually financially.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.480]   - I told you a couple weeks ago,
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.000]   Sony's a big, big trouble.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.920]   Big, big trouble.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.040]   - You heard it here first, folks.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.920]   Sell your Sony stock.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.080]   - Is Sony a stock?
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.480]   - I don't know.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.320]   - We're the wrong people.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.440]   - Sell your metaphorical.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.320]   - Sell if you had Sony stock.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.160]   Let's take a break.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.080]   We're gonna come back with more ONJJ Stone.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.400]   Oh, doctor!
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.240]   Is here.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.080]   Wake up.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.480]   - I'm awake.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.320]   I'm upset about this video.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.200]   - You're so relaxed.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.920]   Hey, by the way, I saw the beautiful pictures on Instagram.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.400]   You gotta follow O'Doctan Instagram.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.200]   Of your daughter playing,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.000]   'cause we sent you, last time you were on,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.920]   we had the little bits kit,
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.880]   and we sent you one,
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.520]   and you gave it to her for Christmas, huh?
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.360]   - Yes.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.200]   - You, she loves it.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.040]   - All right, so.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.600]   - I upgraded, okay.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.440]   - Oh, good.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.280]   - You guys sent me money.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.120]   - You got more.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.320]   - And I doubled what you gave so I could get her more.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.240]   - 'Cause what she did,
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.400]   she made like, what did she do?
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.760]   What was that thing?
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.120]   - The first project that she wanted to do,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.480]   they show you how to make a hand buzzer.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.760]   Actually, the first thing she made was the feather,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.120]   'cause we actually bought feathers.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:31.960]   We bought their kit,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.640]   and it came with all the little extra stuff.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.840]   So she made the tickler,
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.800]   but then she made a hand buzzer,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.640]   where you shake the hand,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.080]   and it makes a buzzer sound.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.680]   But on her own, she attached a light to it,
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.960]   and then drew it up her sleeve,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.840]   and then she put it in her hair.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.640]   So when she buzzed,
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.640]   it made the buzzer and her hair lit up.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.680]   So I was like, man, she is doing it.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.000]   - How old is she?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.840]   - She's seven,
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.680]   she did all by herself.
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.800]   - Oh, yeah, that's so cute.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.440]   Seven years old.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.080]   Go down her arm a little bit there.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.320]   You can't see it 'cause of the,
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.200]   yeah, look at there's all the little bits.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.640]   - So then once you put her,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.560]   this was the test run,
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.640]   but after that we put it underneath her sleeve,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.600]   and it ran up through her hair,
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.120]   and she just ran around her friends.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.600]   She was like, "Shake my hand!"
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.080]   - Awesome.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.800]   I have, there is hope for the children of the future.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.040]   - I love it.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.320]   - Well, I'm glad that's great.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.480]   Also here, Jason Snell,
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.560]   his new Venture Six Colors.com.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.080]   How many podcasts are you doing?
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.720]   - It's so many, too many to count.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.560]   - A lot of them.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.400]   - About four a week.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.240]   - That's great.

[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.680]   Then I don't think they have,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.800]   like, how to cave care for your shaved head.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.000]   I don't learn that that come.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.280]   Oh, and you should teach that class.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.080]   - I should teach that class.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   I'll call you up and we'll do a practice run,
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.760]   make sure you don't cut yourself.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.720]   You're not trying to shave again.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.640]   - I'm not gonna shave again.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.760]   I just wanna keep the darn thing from hurting
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.880]   and being cold.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.760]   I understand hats.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.280]   I had no idea
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.680]   how much hair does for your head.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.440]   It keeps you warm.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.560]   It keeps the sun off.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.760]   I can see now, I completely understand I'm breaking bad.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.200]   Why?
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.080]   Brian Cranston, after he had his chemo and he lost his hair,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.360]   he went out and got the pork by hat.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.640]   That wasn't an affectation.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.800]   You need it.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.720]   Oh, Leo.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.920]   - The way you just took your hat off,
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.280]   you looked like a stooge.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.120]   (laughing)
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.120]   - You look like a stooge.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.280]   (laughing)
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.960]   - There you go.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.440]   (laughing)
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.280]   - I definitely have the curly look at this point.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.520]   (laughing)
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.760]   - Wow.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.600]   Wow.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.800]   - Burke says, "Hair is a hat."
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.640]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.960]   Side note, people keep yelling at me
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.000]   'cause my website is down.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.840]   Yes, my website is down
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.320]   because I'm in a heated evil battle with GoDaddy
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.840]   and I'm trying to escape the evil clutches.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.520]   And it is not a good situation right now.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.760]   - Get rid of GoDaddy.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.960]   - I've got like two domains
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.240]   that they do not wanna let go.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   - I know.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.520]   - Hover.com in.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.280]   - Get on over there.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.200]   - As soon as I get free,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.000]   I will be going somewhere.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.080]   - They act like they can't get a hold of my account.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.360]   They can't find it 'cause they wanna sell my domain.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.680]   - I know.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.920]   I know.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.760]   - Are they terrible?
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.680]   - It's an issue.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.600]   And I've got like 30 things hosted with them and they want two.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.960]   I know that there's two that they want
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.240]   and that's why they won't let me transfer everything.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   So I don't know what I gotta do.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.440]   - Is it like a really good name?
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.480]   Do you have like, you know?
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.880]   - It's my daughter's first name.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.200]   I have lea.com.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.240]   - Neat.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.080]   - Yeah.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.920]   - Why would they want that?
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.040]   - I don't know, someone wants it.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.480]   I've had people offer me 25K for it so far.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.320]   - Oh.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.880]   - It's their daughter's name too.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.280]   - Or is that chick from, it's a Disney chick named Lee,
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.120]   I think, that one's a--
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.440]   - Oh, sure.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.200]   - Somebody powerful wants it and they're just like not
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.040]   playing games with me.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.280]   - Oh, that's it.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.720]   That's exactly it.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.920]   - I'm gonna focus next week on getting it fixed
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.720]   so I can't stand anymore. - Okay.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.160]   Compose Simonite says, "If you and I stood next to each other,
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.520]   we'd be two thorns of a pawn shop sign."
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.760]   (laughing)
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.360]   - Moving right along.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.640]   (laughing)
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.720]   - Did you guys have a good Christmas in New Year's?
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.200]   Did you have a good holiday season?
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.040]   So did Apple.
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.880]   - Yes.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.720]   - Yeah.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.560]   - This kind of surprised me.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.960]   Flurry does these measurements.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.280]   Actually, I don't know Yahoo owns Flurry now.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.080]   - Yeah, all those guys got bought up.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.120]   - Flurry was, what was, you probably covered them for years.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.240]   Tell me what Flurry did, what, what are they?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.200]   - Well, I mean, the biggest thing they did is you would embed
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.600]   their code in your app.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.120]   And it was like, you know, you go to a website
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.480]   and there's a little thing in the code that--
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.320]   - Give you metrics.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.080]   - Things, Google Analytics, and you can know
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.240]   how many pages you got.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.080]   Well, this was that for apps.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.840]   So Flurry would be integrated into an app.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.120]   And then basically when you launch it,
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.680]   and people don't know this necessarily,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.720]   it would phone home.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.480]   It would like ping their server and say,
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.800]   "I just got launched," or, "I just tapped this button,"
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.640]   or, "Last time I launched, I crashed."
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.280]   So the developers can see who's using your app,
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.440]   how often they're using it.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.240]   All the stuff that the app platform itself
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.120]   doesn't or didn't offer you.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:07.960]   So it's like--
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.720]   - So Flurry has now more than 600,000 apps
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.560]   doing the analytics.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:14.760]   So that's a pretty good sample, I would guess.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.040]   Are they as strong and Android as they are on iOS?
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.480]   I guess they certainly have some clients about this.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.880]   - I don't know.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.280]   And I don't know how much of that Google has started
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.400]   to put in their developer tools.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.440]   'Cause that's the next trend is to actually build this stuff
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   into the tools.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.400]   - Presumably they've normalized for, you know,
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.320]   the Android version of iOS balance.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.000]   But according to Flurry, the top five device activations
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.560]   by manufacturer, and this I think is global,
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.320]   51% of all device activations,
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.400]   December 19th through Christmas Day,
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.960]   51% were Apple, iPads and iPhones.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.520]   Only 17.7% Samsung.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.440]   The real surprise here is Sony and LG,
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.400]   but the Nokia, which is a Windows phone platform,
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.280]   5.8%.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.760]   They're in there, they're number three.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760]   They're not, you know.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.840]   - Huge, but that's still pretty good.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.640]   - Last year, it was the issue of,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.840]   I per example, my friend, who's not really a tech person,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.160]   the father had an iPad, but he bought
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.280]   the whole family Kindle fires.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.600]   The wife has three kids, he bought on a fire age day.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.920]   This Christmas, he went out and bought the wife
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.760]   and all three of those kids iPads,
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.520]   and didn't even do anything with the Kindle fires,
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.600]   he just kept them.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.840]   And I'm like, so he's like, I made a big mistake.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.760]   He's like, they were only $100.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.120]   I thought that it wouldn't matter, but it matters.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.120]   And I had to go and get the things for the apps for the kids.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.560]   So people realize like, oh, I can get these cheap
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.640]   Nokia, Windows, whatever, because some people can't afford
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.360]   for a hundred hours for an iPad.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.160]   And then a year later, they'll be like, holy smokes,
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.560]   I need, I messed my iPad, and I can't,
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.040]   this is not the level I need.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.400]   - How much of that though is that the kids
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.560]   are very brand aware.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.960]   It would be like if you gave them Air Jordans
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.600]   and they wanted, you know, Air Force ones.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.800]   - The kids are brand aware when it comes to,
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   I can go play with Osmo on my friend's iPad
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.280]   and they don't make it for it.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.000]   Oh, they don't have that for this?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.680]   Well, what, Dad, how come I don't have,
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.080]   why did you give me this thing?
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.840]   Dad, it doesn't do anything.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.160]   It doesn't do what my friends do.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.080]   - But it doesn't mean, come on.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.160]   You can watch movies, you can watch if you play games.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.560]   - If Dad had an iPad, that means they've been,
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.960]   they've been probably using games on his iPad.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:28.520]   And even if they could get some of those games
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.920]   on those Kindle fires, they have to buy them again,
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.680]   which means probably Dad didn't say,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.720]   oh, I'll just buy all those apps again for you kids.
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.560]   I gotta buy them again.
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.960]   - Let's point out that that's barrier.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.800]   - That's barrier.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.600]   - $400 more for the iPad than it was for the fire.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.680]   I mean, each.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.680]   - It is, I have a fire and I have a Samsung Tap 3.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.840]   My iPad's just faster, it's just better.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.960]   And that's not saying anything about brand awareness.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.800]   It's just better.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.320]   And when apps come out, they come out three times soon
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.920]   or four iPhone or iPad than it does any other device.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.760]   And it usually is not as buggy.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.680]   Like, I don't know, there's pros and cons
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:05.920]   'cause I like a lot of the free stuff you can get
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.880]   like on my Android, but it's not the same.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.360]   - In fact, replacing your iPad apps on an Android device,
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.040]   yes, admittedly, or some gaps, but most of them you can.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:15.880]   - No, that you can't.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.520]   I'm talking about some different things on the fire.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.560]   - It's not much more expensive,
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.200]   especially now with freemium.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.560]   - Yeah, I just met from Amazon.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.880]   Like going from Amazon to an iPad,
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.080]   it's a whole new world.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.160]   - I have to admit, going from the Android store
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.960]   to the Amazon store is a little weird.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.800]   - Yeah.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.360]   - So iPad Mini 2 is $2.99.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.960]   And that's actually a really good kid choice.
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.800]   - That's a good kid choice.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.200]   - That's the last year's retina model, but it's a good,
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.520]   it's a good, that's what I still use.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.560]   - So it's only three times more expensive.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.840]   - Yeah, it's more expensive, but you know.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.640]   - As long as you don't get the 16 gig version,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.120]   I mean, who's gonna do anything with that?
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.200]   I mean, that's true too.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.760]   You'll be down to three gigs for the time.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.880]   - In fact, a lot of people couldn't go to iOS 8
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.440]   'cause they had 16 gig devices
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.760]   and there wasn't enough free space.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.800]   So, Flurry does say that the reason you pay attention
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.040]   to the Christmas buying week is
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.320]   in the Christmas present opening week in Hanukkah
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:03.880]   this year, present opening week,
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.960]   is 'cause that's a bellwether for the rest of the year.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:06.800]   - Interesting.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.320]   - You can kinda tell what's gonna happen.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.920]   Here's an interesting graph that's a little hard to read.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.680]   This is by screen size.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.520]   - Oh yeah.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.520]   - So, I'll describe this for you looking at home
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.200]   and I'll try to get this kind of described this
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.640]   in some way that people listening can understand it.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.040]   It shows three years, 2012, 2013, and 2014.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   In 2012, 16% of the devices that were activated
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.760]   were full-sized tablets this year, 11%.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.320]   Small tablets had 17% of the market in 2012.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.400]   This year, 11%.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.600]   Fablates, the giant phones went from 3% to 13%.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.040]   Medium phones, I guess that'd be five inch phones,
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.400]   58% to 64%, and then the small phones
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.960]   which are 7% of the market of the active new activations
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.800]   in 2012, probably iPhone.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.360]   Let's see, 2012 would be iPhone 4S.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.080]   Is that right?
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.920]   - No, five. - Or no, five.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.080]   - Right.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.480]   - 7% down to 2% this year.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.960]   So, I think the takeaway here is that
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.880]   the growth area is in this big phone.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.960]   - Well, I think it's-- - That's a tablet.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.200]   - You're looking at percentage of distribution.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.400]   So, I think what we know about the tablet market is
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.640]   it's roughly flat.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:28.320]   So, it's not actually going from 16 and 17 to 11 and 11,
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.200]   but that's how much more the phone market is growing
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.560]   than the tech market, right?
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.240]   - Okay, so sales aren't down, they're just not growing.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.800]   - We're gonna assume that maybe the tablet sales
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.560]   are flat or up slightly or maybe down slightly,
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.680]   but something in there.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.440]   But on the phone side,
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.920]   phone sales just continue to grow.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.960]   That trajectory just hasn't stopped.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.240]   And we see now that phablet sales seem to be way up
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.040]   and that medium phone sales just keep motoring along.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.320]   - Yeah.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.480]   - Yep, yep.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.400]   People want big phones.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.520]   Between medium and giant phones,
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.440]   that's 77% of all activations.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.520]   That's a big chunk,
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.120]   three quarters of all activations.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.440]   - Also, what I'm talking about,
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.600]   people don't have money.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.200]   So, a lot of my friends bought us six plus
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.120]   because they were like, oh, I always wanted a tablet
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.080]   or iPad, but I couldn't justify spending $500 on it.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.640]   But you go and get a 128 plus six.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.560]   Now you feel like you got yourself an iPad too,
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.680]   and it's your phone.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.720]   So it's like an all-in-one purchase that cuts down
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.520]   on a lot of overlap for regular consumers.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.080]   - Yeah, we heard, I was talking to somebody at Apple
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.240]   when the new phones were announced,
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.680]   who said very much the same thing
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.360]   that what they've found is there are lots of markets
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.440]   where the people who buy the big phone,
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.160]   it's their only mobile device.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.040]   In some cases, it's their only computing device.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.760]   They don't even have, in some places in this world,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.680]   they don't have a computer, they don't have a tablet.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.840]   They've got a phone.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.000]   And if you've only got one device, make it a big one.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.840]   Right?
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.840]   And you need it to be a phone.
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:56.680]   - Yeah.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.920]   - So there you go, it's a big phone.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.960]   - Big change in music as well.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.360]   According to Nielsen Soundscans,
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.600]   streaming music in 2014, streaming, not downloads,
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   streaming, grew 54% Spotify, RDO, Rhapsody,
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.960]   moving from 106 billion songs in 2013
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.640]   to 164 billion in 2014,
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.440]   traditional sound song downloads dropped
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:24.240]   as well paid downloads for full albums to climb 9%,
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.040]   individual songs 12%.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   Although, 257 million albums sold in 2014,
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.880]   106 million downloaded digitally.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.160]   - I think this is gonna be one of those roller coaster moves
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.160]   because I remember distinctly reading something
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   about four weeks ago, one Taylor Swift dropped off her stuff
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.920]   off of Spotify and then her record was like the number one
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.280]   breaking record, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.840]   'cause people couldn't get anymore, so I had to actually buy it.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.800]   Two, Pharrell got a check for $3,000
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   for like 180 million plays of happy on Pandora.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.640]   Like, and I'm like, wait, what?
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.760]   And he's like, yeah, so he pulled it off of Pandora.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.440]   And I'm like, well, how does that work?
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.800]   If you're not getting paid the money, like, you know,
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.200]   and Spotify is quick to say,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.880]   well, we spend 95% of our money paying royalties.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.120]   Well, if those royalties are coming out to $3,000 checks
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.160]   because you got hundreds of thousands of artists,
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.600]   that doesn't mean anything to the artists
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.040]   when they could have got somebody to buy it for 99.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.360]   You could have sold more happy for 99 cents
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.680]   than the $3,000 check you got from Pandora.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.320]   - This is, I think the greatest threat
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.640]   to the music streaming services
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.320]   is they're gonna turn into Netflix.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.520]   If Taylor, and I'm not saying this will happen,
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.200]   but it's the fear is that more artists,
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.680]   A-list artists like Taylor Swift
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.600]   are not gonna play ball with them.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.120]   And then we're gonna get into the situation,
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.360]   like there are not new releases on Netflix.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.720]   In fact, there are not new home video releases on Netflix.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.000]   You have to wait for that after you get off
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.680]   of everything they're selling and renting,
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.920]   everything goes on pay cable.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.480]   It eventually comes to Netflix.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.360]   If that's what happens with the music services
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.120]   where they've got the catalog,
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.440]   but nothing from the last year is on there,
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.400]   that would be a big problem.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.720]   - I think the music and the movies are very different.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.240]   So first of all, a couple of points.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.160]   Pandora is not the same as Spotify.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.000]   - Right.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.160]   - Pandora is a radio station.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.200]   So I would bet the Pandora royalties
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.280]   are a lot closer to radio royalties
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.000]   in the sense that it's a discovery medium.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.080]   Now the record companies don't like this.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.160]   They've always said, oh, no, no,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.240]   internet will never be like radio.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.080]   Radio is where people discover music,
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.880]   which of course, if that's their current plan,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.760]   they may wanna rethink that.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.280]   (laughing)
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.800]   So I think Pandora is, 'cause you don't control what you hear.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.280]   You say, I wanna station and you're gonna get what you get.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.760]   So it's discovery, much like radio.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.600]   You didn't control what you hear,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.200]   but you'd have a sound style
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.400]   that you'd pick the country station
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.200]   or the progressive station.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.760]   Second, I would point out that music sales
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.520]   are driven by the new stuff, right?
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.000]   And if you don't get discovered,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.400]   that's a challenge that's gonna tank.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.920]   There's no catalog
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.080]   if the album wasn't popular when it came out.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:52.920]   - Right.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.760]   - So it's really, music has a long tail
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.280]   in the way I think probably movies don't,
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.480]   and discovering and getting excited about an album
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.960]   when it comes out is critical
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.680]   to the long-term success of that album, I would guess.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.480]   - I don't know, I think they're a little more similar
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.000]   than that, I think, you know.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.320]   But I'm not saying that they're right,
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.000]   that the way that it works with Netflix is even right, right?
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.360]   I mean, we can make the arguments that movies
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.720]   should come out day in date on Video on Demand,
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.120]   like the interview did.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.360]   And that this is all artificial,
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.160]   but I just, when I see Taylor Swift
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:29.720]   with holding her album and selling well,
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.520]   it does make you wonder
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.080]   if something's gonna have to give in the relationship
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.160]   between the artists and the streaming services.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.240]   - But that's a unique situation
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.560]   where she has such a strong community
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:40.720]   that they, and they're so,
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.080]   the demand is so high for whatever she puts out
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.240]   that that works for her.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.440]   It's not gonna work for a new artist at all.
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.280]   - Oh, I agree about that.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.320]   - But a new artist, people aren't gonna want their music either
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.200]   'cause they're a new artist.
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.800]   But established artists that are going to demand
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.480]   that market is a huge issue for that.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480]   You know, when you say the new people,
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.560]   yeah, they wanna be on everything.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:59.640]   They wanna be on your mom's radio station
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.440]   anywhere they can possibly be 'cause they're new.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.960]   But established people when they pull their product off
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.760]   or when Jay-Z goes and makes an exclusive deal
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.640]   with Samsung and says, "Anybody who buys this phone
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.000]   "gets my album and any stuff's five million albums
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.680]   "in one day because people want the phone."
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.520]   Like there's a lot of moves for artists to do
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:19.080]   that don't include a Spotify or Beats royalty check.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.840]   - Why did Taylor Swift not pull her videos off of YouTube?
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.600]   Do you think?
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.560]   - Well, those are all through Vivo.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.000]   I mean, they're monetized.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.960]   There's ads in front of them.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.680]   So she is actually making money on plays.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.520]   - Yes.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.360]   - I'd like to see how much money, you know what I'm saying?
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.240]   And I would like to see what her contracts are.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.520]   And what her contract says about Pandora versus YouTube.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.200]   - I think there's, or Feral, I think,
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.480]   you know, I think the labels have something to do with this
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.960]   as well. - Sure, sure.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:51.880]   If there's no doubt.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.960]   - By the way, I just played Shake It Off.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.200]   I don't see an ad.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.040]   - Yeah.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.520]   - It started, oh, wait a minute, I'm sorry.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.120]   That's because I pay for Google and Wall Access.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:05.000]   So I don't get an ad, but I give her eight bucks a month.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.720]   But that's the same, I give, I mean,
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.760]   isn't that the same I'm paying to Spotify?
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.640]   It's actually a little less.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.840]   - Right.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.720]   - So I just, you know, I think that this is complicated.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.560]   Bob left this. - It is.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.000]   - Who is an industry analyst and an observer.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.560]   And often, I think very right on says this.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.440]   And I wonder what you guys think.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:26.880]   The prediction for 2015, the major labels
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.760]   will only get stronger.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:31.280]   We live in a money economy,
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.400]   and the only ones willing to invest in artists
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.160]   are the labels.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.440]   Furthermore, they've got the relationships at radio,
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.800]   which are key to developing acts.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.520]   The players want cash.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.520]   The major labels have it.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.160]   No one else will get involved because the returns are so bad.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.840]   The majors have gotten a second win.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.800]   They have adapted to the internet.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.760]   All the hogwash about disruption was just that.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.280]   He says, "May not be forever, but it's certainly
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.200]   for now you agree."
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.120]   Now this is a guy, this is what he does for a living.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.080]   So he, but he's also old school.
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.960]   And I just think that that may be true
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.360]   if your model is the old model of superstar artists
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.120]   producing record LP.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:12.000]   When do they call it now?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.760]   - Music. - Records.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.600]   - Records, fine.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.800]   - Excuse me. - It's not a record though.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.160]   - The world bends to us, Leo.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.200]   We don't bend to that.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   (laughing)
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.840]   - So artists produce music, sells it as a album
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.680]   like Taylor did with 1989.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:28.760]   They hate single sales.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.480]   They want to sell the whole album.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:35.040]   And the record labels somehow have marketing clout,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.280]   radio play, I don't know how important that is,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.280]   but they somehow have marketing.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.560]   You have to discover it somewhere.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.040]   I wonder. - I think there's a different model.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.080]   There's a model like a Jonathan Colton or Pamplamoose
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.680]   where these are artists, unsigned artists
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.240]   who market using social media very effectively.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:52.040]   Actually, by the way, Taylor may be giving her record
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.440]   like more credit than the deserves.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:55.960]   She does the best marketing I've ever seen on Instagram
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.880]   and Twitter and everywhere else.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.560]   - Sure. - Brilliant social marketing.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.640]   - But the joke hose of the world are not,
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.280]   you know, they're, I think, a great little niche group
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:08.320]   of artists, but that's not the same as,
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.760]   I got a 13 year old daughter.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.240]   How does she find music? - Well, how does she find it?
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.360]   - Well, some of it's Pandora, actually, I think.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.880]   - Yeah, Pandora is important.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.520]   - But when we have satellite radio in the car
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.000]   and she will turn it to one of the hit,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.160]   the pop hit stations, the New York or LA pop hit stations.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.840]   And so I think it's a little bit of a pop.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.040]   So I think there is still some radio, believe it or not.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.520]   And then the rest of it is. - It's satellite,
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.840]   but that's not a concept. - But it's a lot of discovery.
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   And then she will go on Spotify and listen to stuff
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.000]   that she discovers, but discovery is step one.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.960]   And I think that's where this prediction
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.880]   about the labels is true, is to break through the noise
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.440]   and reach a 13 year old or a 15 year old
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.440]   with a new artist takes money.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.520]   'Cause you gotta find them, who knows where.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.680]   - You don't think it takes a skill on YouTube
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.280]   and Instagram and I mean, you gotta build where you are.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:52.880]   - That's another way to do it.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.720]   - I feel like there's got to, there is another avenue.
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.640]   - There are many paths.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.880]   - Every once in a while I gotta remind you
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.360]   that you live in a bubble of technology, okay?
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.080]   Most of the world-- - You live in New Jersey, so.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.080]   - I live in the real world.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.960]   I'm not hearing these trees with these people
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.720]   living this dream crawling through the mud, I understand.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.400]   Most people don't, I have satellite radio.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.760]   Most people get in my car like, wow, what's this?
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.600]   I'm like a satellite.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.720]   - I don't think satellite's that user.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.240]   What do you think? - What do you think?
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.320]   It's a radio station. - What in your world,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.320]   how do they discover music?
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.680]   - Most people listen to the radio still.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.840]   They still listen to the radio
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.680]   and you know what else is really huge?
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.080]   YouTube, you know what I first time I heard shaking off?
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.600]   I saw four stay at home miles posted up,
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.320]   shaking off that day. - That's what I like.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.480]   - I guess I'm shaking it off.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.600]   And then they put up the, whatever they put up,
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.680]   but they put up those songs
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.120]   'cause they wanna share them with their other--
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.400]   - That's right. - Oh, it's good for your daughter,
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.600]   it's good for your son. - That's right.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:40.040]   - So there's a lot of ways to discover,
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.760]   but the radio is still huge. - Yeah, I agree.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.960]   - You know why? 'Cause it's free.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.520]   And if it's free, it's for most people.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.160]   My kids don't even have a radio.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.600]   - But not everybody's balling out of control
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.520]   with me. - Where are you listening
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:52.520]   to the radio? - See, my car's got radio, Leo,
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.760]   every car. - But are people listening in the car?
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.560]   - This is what I thought was my daughter.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.920]   And like I said, if we didn't have the satellite radio,
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.960]   she'd be listening to the local hit station anyway.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.280]   It's easier for her to find the hits on the satellite radio,
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.000]   but bottom line is she's listening to the radio.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.080]   I don't listen to the radio.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.720]   I mean, we have satellite radio.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.200]   I'm an '80s on eight kind of guy.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.840]   I have to admit it, lots of '80s music.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.440]   But my daughter's like, forget that.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.320]   And she turns it to the hits.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.360]   She's listening to the hits.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:17.720]   So radio is still a thing.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.680]   And YouTube, you're totally right, YouTube is a thing.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.320]   We talk about Taylor Swift not putting our album on streaming.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.560]   I mean, not only did she put Shake It Off on YouTube
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.640]   with a video, but Shake It Off was on streaming
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:28.480]   because what is that?
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.600]   That's a teaser for her album.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.280]   That's the first single of the album.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.000]   And then you wanna hear more?
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.680]   - And go buy the album. - You gotta buy the album.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.160]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:38.760]   - I guess what I would say is that
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.560]   there are many roots now.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.400]   - There are many. - More than ever before.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:45.240]   Reliance on the big labels is probably foolish,
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.040]   especially if you're an up and coming young band, right?
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.600]   - There are a lot of people who are doing it independently
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:51.160]   'cause they don't wanna be in that debt
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.600]   of working to deal with the devil.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.680]   But at the same time, if you think that you can get over
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.520]   the hump with a little bit of help,
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.240]   because a lot of people are tricked into one hit wonders.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.880]   They come in, they shovel all this money
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.680]   at the radio stations, they put it out there,
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.520]   they put it blitz out, you buy this person out
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.080]   and you never hear from them again.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.960]   But they made a little bit of money off the person.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.360]   So there's still a market for it, there's still plays for it.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:12.600]   And the digital world we live in is a special world
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.400]   and there are some people that are rocking it very well.
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.680]   - Yeah.
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.480]   It's complicated, it's hard.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.200]   - It's much more complicated than it was.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.040]   - Totally.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:23.880]   Yes.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.440]   There's more avenues, there's more options.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.760]   - I do feel like YouTube is really important.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:31.640]   I watch my kids and that's really where they see stuff.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:32.480]   And it's social sharing.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   - 'Cause you watch.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.680]   Word and mouth is still the best way, right?
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.720]   You learn from your friends who, you know, we all--
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.680]   - Where do you hear them singing?
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.000]   I hear my daughter sing and stuff and I'm like,
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:40.840]   what song is that?
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:41.680]   And I'm like, what?
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.440]   - And I think if you were to rely, if you--
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.440]   - Stop.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.880]   - If you were to rely on the major labels and radio,
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.800]   you would get what pop music is, which is a lot of crap.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.640]   Now, I feel like that's not the best music
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.800]   being made out there right now.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.920]   Or is it?
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.600]   - It is very repetitive.
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.520]   'Cause I still listen to radio.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:03.240]   It is excessively repetitive, but I do use it for discovery.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.440]   'Cause sometimes I just turn it on,
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.160]   I turn it on at nine o'clock, on nine o'clock at night,
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.240]   Power 99 does the top 10 songs.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.560]   And when I'm in the car at nine o'clock, I think,
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.400]   oh, it's nine o'clock.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.000]   I should go listen to what the top 10 songs are right now.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   - Do kids have Spotify accounts nowadays?
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.120]   Do they have streaming accounts?
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.640]   - My daughter has Pandora.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.560]   - She has Pandora.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.400]   - My daughter has--
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.760]   - I buy all my free spotify and Pandora, yeah.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:23.840]   - Okay, free spotify.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.600]   - Yeah, we've got back and forth, but you're free in the pay.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.760]   - Everybody can have free spotify, sure.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.640]   I feel like that you can use that for discovery very well.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.280]   They have Explorer, they have new stuff.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.200]   - Yeah, I don't know, Pandora is pretty great at it.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.120]   I mean, I have to regulate how much I use Pandora
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:41.800]   because as somebody who still buys music,
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.320]   I listen to Pandora for a couple of days
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.760]   and I bought like way too much because I discover it.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   It's great for discovery.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.600]   It's dangerous.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.160]   - Will there be another Beatles ever?
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.440]   Could there be another Beatles in this era?
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.280]   - Totally.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.120]   - Yes.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.360]   - Taylor Swift is everywhere right now.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.840]   - I'm gonna say Taylor Swift was a Beatles.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.400]   She broke a lot of records with that album
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.720]   which was justified her coming off spotify.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.320]   When she put off spotify, everybody's like,
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.800]   "This is a huge thing, you don't know what you're doing."
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.360]   Next thing you know, she's breaking all kinds of records
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.760]   which I know for a fact she wasn't a broken
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.600]   because one people wanna rally behind her
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.600]   as much as they did.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.360]   And two, they had no other place to get her music.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.800]   - But having a community,
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.480]   having a big supportive community,
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.600]   boy does that make a difference.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:20.440]   - Totally.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.960]   - Whether you're big or small as an artist,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.440]   having that audience is the,
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.280]   you gotta find the audience.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.720]   That's the key to breaking any artist, right?
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.600]   It's breaking by having an audience discover them
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:30.600]   and love them.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:33.200]   - Side note, iTunes Radio isn't terrible either.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.240]   - No, it's really good.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.560]   I don't think anybody knows about it.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:37.280]   - Now, the only problem-- - That's why Beats
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.800]   is so important to Apple.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.120]   - Well, he just brought up as the biggest thing
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.800]   I don't listen to is 'cause it makes me wanna buy everything.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:44.000]   When I listen to iTunes Radio,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.960]   I really have to stop by myself and press now,
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:47.600]   but just are connected to my credit card.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.320]   And it's over. - So dangerous.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.960]   - That's the one reason I stay out of it honestly
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.520]   'cause I'm like, man, I really like that.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.360]   What is that?
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.520]   They had a, I put a little by me, it's going for my daughter.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:59.440]   They had a Jay-Z lullaby album
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.000]   where it's like lullaby Jay-Z's music
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.160]   but it's played to like soft piano lullaby.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.600]   I was like, this is so gangster.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.640]   And I'm like, why am I buying this?
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.560]   I'm not a child.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:08.960]   It was so cute.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:09.800]   It almost got me.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:13.200]   I almost spent $14.99 on this Jay-Z lullaby album.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.520]   - Now you got a brilliant,
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.760]   and that's where Beats does make sense.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.640]   You got a brilliant combination.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.160]   You have free radio with an easy buy button,
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.720]   perhaps a subscription service too,
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:28.280]   and all of it ties to a store that it's one click and buy.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.120]   - Yep.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.160]   - That is a good, that seems like a good model.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.120]   - It was a smart purchase.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.160]   I realized that when they did it.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.640]   I realized why they were doing it.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.320]   It wasn't for the headphones, it was more for that
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.240]   because they know more than anyone
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.400]   what their roller coaster ride is
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.280]   as far as people buying music.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.240]   They have their finger on.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:44.200]   - Well, and they saw it coming
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.640]   'cause 14% drop in iTunes sales this year.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.720]   They saw it 'cause they knew it was,
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.360]   they saw the train coming.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.200]   - Yeah.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.560]   - All right, yeah, I was very skeptical,
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.280]   but I didn't understand what was going on in music last year,
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.960]   and it was a big shift towards streaming.
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:00.800]   All right, we're gonna take a break,
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.880]   JJ Owen, JJ Stone, O-Dokta is here
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.280]   with a website that won't work.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.240]   Thank you, GoDaddy.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:12.440]   And it's from sixcolors.com.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:15.480]   Great friend of the network, Jason Snow.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.320]   Love having you here.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.120]   Just down the road, he comes up,
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.240]   whenever we demand it.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.080]   - Yep.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.920]   - You're missing the football game.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.160]   - You press the red button, you don't care.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:23.680]   - You press the red button and I appear.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.640]   - JJ, at least you have to worry about your Eagles.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.800]   - I don't, I'm sitting there watching the Cowboys lose,
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.840]   and I, oh, Jimmy Christmas, they better lose.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.800]   - You do not like those cowgirls, do you?
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.040]   - Oh, no, I don't.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.960]   You take, there's another great reason
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.040]   to follow Owen on Instagram.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:42.640]   He will, unless you're a cowboys fan.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.360]   - Yeah, my cowboy bashing is strong.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.640]   (laughing)
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.240]   My hatred for the Cowboys is strong.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:51.040]   The cowboy bashing is strong in this one.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.880]   Let's see if I can.
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:53.680]   - I have a friend who's a crazy Eagles fan
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:55.360]   and he actually has a second Twitter account
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.160]   for his Eagles rants because everybody followed him
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.160]   was like, why do you go crazy every Sunday?
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.760]   And he's like, well, it's the Eagles.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.120]   So now he has his Eagles account.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.600]   You can just follow that.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.800]   - For four hours, you look like a psychopath.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.360]   I try to stay off the internet,
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.760]   like reasons like that, 'cause I do realize
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.920]   when I see other people I'm like, man, this woman,
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.680]   seems so mom-mannered all week long,
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.880]   and then the Jets come on, this F-Derson F-Derson.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.240]   I'm like, oh man, I'm gonna have a grandma, calm down.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:21.520]   (growling)
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.600]   - That's something to people.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.200]   - This is my favorite one.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.680]   This was from last October.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.720]   (laughing)
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.920]   That's just mean.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:30.760]   - Cowgirl.
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.520]   That's just mean.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.920]   - Yeah, I was a bad day for me.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.760]   We beat them.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.160]   I was loaded for bear.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.560]   I had a whole folder full of cowgirl stuff
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.680]   for certain occasions to pop up.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.880]   - As cyber-salt reminds us in the chatroom,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.760]   fan is short for fanatic.
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:50.720]   You know who's fanatical about the servers they run
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.920]   and the service they give you,
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.920]   those great folks at Squarespace?
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:57.120]   Absolutely fanatical about having 100% uptime.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.400]   You can nobody can do 100% uptime,
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.040]   but the lengths of the folks at Squarespace do
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.280]   go to to keep your site fast and flowing.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.480]   Oh, and you gotta move here.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.320]   You're gonna love it.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.880]   Plus the best software for creating your website.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.640]   State of the art software.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.680]   This new Squarespace 7 makes it so easy.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.160]   You can live edit on one screen,
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.040]   no more preview, site manager preview.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.920]   You can see how your changes will look on your tablet,
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.760]   on your mobile device,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.440]   'cause every single one of their gorgeous designs,
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440]   there are over 30 of them is mobile responsive.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.840]   That means it looks great on every size screen automatically.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.520]   Plus now some of the templates are designed
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.320]   for specific professions.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.160]   If you're a musician,
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.520]   this is a great place to go to make a website
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.320]   to help build that community or an artist or an architect,
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.000]   a restaurant, e-commerce.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.720]   Take a look at the page for musicians.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.280]   It gives you Aviator, is that it?
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.040]   No, that's the business template.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.400]   The musicians template will give you,
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.320]   there it is on the right there, isn't that it?
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.600]   Yeah, it gives you a shop, a tour dates,
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.360]   it gives you a shop where you can sell your music.
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.240]   It is so cool.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.680]   I'm such a fan of Squarespace.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.920]   I know you will be, cover pages, 10 new templates,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.360]   perfect for creating, look at that,
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.720]   embeds a sound, what is that?
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.040]   Soundcloudcloud.com into there.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:14.960]   It's awesome.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.120]   Cover pages give you, are great for the personal identity,
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.440]   that single page thing,
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.920]   but that can be integrated with your website.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.240]   Google Docs are integrated too,
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.240]   Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets, Drive, Calendar.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.560]   Squarespace 7 can easily link branded email accounts
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.960]   to your domain as well.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.480]   And their mobile apps are second to none.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.200]   The portfolio, the note, the metric, the blog apps.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.640]   By the way, note and blog are now available
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.320]   in Android as well as iOS.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.760]   They just keep getting better and better.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.840]   Look how that looks on a phone, spectacular.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.680]   That's what's so great about Squarespace.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.600]   And if you are a developer, you can do anything.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.000]   In fact, some of the world's top digital agencies
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.320]   use Squarespace and the developer platform
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.560]   to make sites for their clients.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.200]   Plus you get $10 access to Getty Images,
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.080]   e-commerce in every template, social media is being built in.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.120]   The next Taylor Swift,
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.120]   you gotta know about Squarespace.com.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.880]   Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube,
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.320]   Pinterest and more.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.840]   And of course, the best help and support
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.400]   with a really great portal for webinars
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.280]   and information, live chat and email support
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.240]   from their Squarespace offices 24/7.

[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.880]   eight bucks a month.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.200]   But the beauty part of this is Squarespace
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.480]   lets you try it free for two weeks.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.200]   You don't need a credit card.

[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:12.280]   If you're a Squarespace site, I'm just saying.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.080]   What's the score now?
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.640]   - I'll make one. - I'll make one.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   - I'll make one. - I'll make one.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.480]   - I'll make one. - I'll make one.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.840]   - 20 to 17's close. - It is?
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.680]   It's a little too close.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.840]   - Oh, and if you want to leave and watch the game,
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.880]   I wouldn't hold it against you.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.720]   - It's okay.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.800]   I got multiple screens going on.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.680]   That's why sometimes I look at you directly in the eye
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.520]   and I look cross-eyed.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.680]   I got a monitor over here.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.680]   I got some jellyfish look out here.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.560]   - I want to see the setup.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.120]   I want to see how Owen, look,
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.080]   I live in a secret fortress in Sow 2.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.080]   You know that.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.160]   (laughing)
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.840]   You know I don't put my address on that.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.280]   That's why I put my fake A16 or Dusty Drive glass road
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.240]   or away to A, 'cause that's not my real address.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.360]   You can send me free stuff.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.200]   I'll take it.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.560]   Can we talk about who hacked Sony now?
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.720]   - Oh, all right. - Can we get any close
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.240]   to that story? - This story is not,
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.080]   is the story that just keeps on giving.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.400]   It's the perfect story for the Christmas season.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:06.080]   President Obama and the FBI say somewhat premature
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.480]   and announced that it was North Korea.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.480]   And immediately every security expert in the world said,
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.400]   what?
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.040]   How could you know so soon?
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.720]   Norse security is the most recent,
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.520]   norstashcorp.com.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.520]   They met with the FBI.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.000]   Norse said has been very open to the idea
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.280]   of talking to other security firms.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.400]   So now, you know, this is Norse talking.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.920]   They said, you know, we called them up and they said,
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.760]   yes, come in and talk to us.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:42.040]   Norse says its research leads to laid off Sony staff,
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.480]   not North Korea.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.280]   Last Monday, the FBI took a three hour briefing with Norse.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.400]   Of course, we've heard many security experts,
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.240]   including the guy at CloudFlare.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.080]   It was Bruce Schnire as well who said,
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.280]   I'm not so sure it was North Korea.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.480]   Almost all of them seem to think
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.280]   that it's much more likely an inside job.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.480]   But here's the problem, and we've said this before,
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.280]   the government, the US government says,
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.120]   we have information we can't share with you
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.760]   because it would compromise our spies,
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.160]   basically our intelligence operation to tell you
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.120]   that it's conclusive.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.520]   And we just, all we can say is, well, okay,
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.960]   'cause they won't tell us,
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.040]   do you trust the US government?
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.400]   - I do not trust the US government.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.720]   They have made major mistakes before,
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.680]   which I won't bring up,
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.120]   'cause I sound like a conspiracy theorist,
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.360]   but I'm just saying somebody told me
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.240]   there were weapons somewhere,
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.520]   and there wasn't a weapons yesterday,
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.720]   tell me it's a company. - WMD,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.960]   that was the secret intelligence.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.160]   - 'Cause they wanna go to North Korea,
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.160]   and this was some people who kicked you
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.840]   to the internet after five minutes after calling Obama a name.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.720]   I don't know what's going on,
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.840]   but I'm gonna tell everybody right now.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.840]   The person who did this atrocity is Michael Mann.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.640]   Look 'em up, Google it, the name is Michael Mann.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.480]   - What? - If you don't know who Michael Mann is,
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.040]   Google 'em, you're gonna know who Michael Mann is.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.760]   Michael Mann is the Sony hacker.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.800]   I know this for a fact.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.320]   Okay, well, you know why?
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320]   - Hey, man, he's a great director.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   - Is he a director? - He's a director.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.720]   He's a director.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.200]   He is the director and the screenwriter
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.920]   for Black Hat coming out next month.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.080]   - Black Hat is the greatest. - Black Hat is coming out next month.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.360]   You people keep telling me,
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.720]   oh, it's a thing to try to bring people in to buy.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.560]   No, nobody wanted to download that stupid movie
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.920]   to interview that movie ain't nothing,
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.080]   but you know what, a whole lot of people
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.880]   gonna be sitting around watching Black Hat.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.720]   - Black Hat.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.360]   - I don't want them to break in a nuclear basis,
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.400]   and they're really doing it.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.880]   They took down Sony, they took down--
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.720]   - No, no, no.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.600]   So you are going along with the people who say
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.200]   this was an inside job by Sony to promote a movie.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.800]   - No, no, because people who say that are absolutely idiots
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   and must want to make it fun of them,
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.320]   because why would they release Social Security numbers
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.800]   of not only employees, but like cash--
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.640]   - Oh, yeah, but it was stupid.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.480]   - For a little in their business.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.320]   - Yeah.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.760]   - That's the best promotion in the world, right?
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.280]   To get out Social Security numbers, you have to knucklehead.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.640]   But I'm just saying, Michael, man,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.080]   I'm looking at him specifically.
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.800]   Can you buy Chris Hemsworth--
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.640]   - I'm not gonna be that.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.640]   - Can you buy Chris Hemsworth as an elite hacker?
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.960]   - Have you seen the ads for this?
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.800]   - Yeah.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.640]   - It is unlikely.
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.480]   So what--
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.320]   - What's the best-looking hack?
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.160]   - It's cyber worth it.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.960]   - It's between Universal Studios and Sony.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:02.800]   (laughing)
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.640]   - That's what I'm saying.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.560]   You don't believe it sounds more reasonable than North Korea.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.400]   - Yeah, maybe.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.240]   - I'm just saying.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.160]   It sounds a lot more--
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.560]   North Korea.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.560]   Half those people can't even--
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.080]   don't have food to eat, okay?
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.920]   So they're too hungry to be looking
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.400]   at computer screens acting for 18-hour street
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.280]   to get in and something.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.880]   But Michael, man, about to make this money, Black Hat.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.720]   - Yeah.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.560]   - The sequel is gonna be--
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.400]   - Check out the show.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.960]   - We just want to say that this show is parody.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.040]   (laughing)
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.280]   Not commentary that he doesn't really think Michael Mann did it.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.040]   I'm sorry, Universal, please, don't sue me.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.840]   And here's a, and in recoupence,
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.960]   here's a trailer for the movie--
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.800]   - For Michael Mann.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.640]   - For Michael Mann.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.840]   - Producer of Miami Vice comes a tale.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.680]   - Can I just tell you one thing?
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.520]   - Not set in Miami.
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.000]   - When the movie, when any movie comes out in January,
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.360]   that's where they bury the worst movies of the year.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.440]   That's when the stinkers come out.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.040]   I always say, don't go see a movie.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.960]   - It's the world's most dangerous hacker.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.200]   - Chris Hemsworth. - It's Thor.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.040]   - Thor?
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.400]   - He is so good looking.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.880]   - Where's his hammer?
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.720]   - He is a good looking feller.
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.720]   - You get that good looking
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.440]   when you sit hunched over a computer
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.800]   for a 10 or 20 hours a day.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800]   - Oh no, he went to prison.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.800]   He's been lifting.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.640]   He looks good.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.760]   - But he's got a prison tattoo.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.600]   Like me.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.440]   - Does he have glasses?
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.280]   Why does he have glasses?
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.120]   - He's got the matrix.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.720]   - The guy who are doing take out a--
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.720]   - Yeah, that does not look good.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.600]   - Here's the real question about this movie.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.320]   - Computer nerds, Uncle Udd and Ostero.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.160]   - No.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.000]   - You're looking?
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.080]   - Yeah, sexy.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.200]   They could be anything.
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.960]   You know, here's the question though.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.720]   How good will the technology be in this?
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.040]   Because, you know, going back to,
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.600]   what was that Robert Redford film Hackers, right?
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.160]   And then Halle Berry and Sneakers.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.480]   - No way around.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.320]   - It was the other way around.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.160]   - Yeah.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.040]   - Man, Halle Berry and Sneakers would have been something.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:46.880]   But no, that was Robert Redford.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.280]   - Yeah, Robert Redford and Sneakers.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.000]   Halle Berry and Hackers was it, yeah.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.840]   - The net.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.680]   - The net.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:53.840]   - Senator Bullick and Dennis Miller.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.320]   - It was a terrible technology.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.560]   It was embarrassing.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.240]   But wait a minute, let's go back a little bit.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.080]   Let's go back.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.200]   Let's look at this screen that he's looking at here.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.600]   Let's see if we can tell.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.600]   What is that?
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.280]   'Cause sometimes you can tell our good friend,
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.360]   John Graham Cumming, that looks like HTML.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.200]   I'm sorry, wait a minute.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.040]   - There's the CSS.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.920]   He hacks the CSS of the internet.
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.760]   - Oh.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.600]   - And it's what changes everything.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.440]   - What is he--
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.280]   - Swordfish.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.120]   - Okay.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.200]   - Okay, function declaration.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.040]   Swordfish, that's the one.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:19.880]   - That's your diswordfish.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.720]   - Very good.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.920]   - Yeah, we gotta look at this.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.360]   Okay, I want test, compile, and C code.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.600]   I want everybody to look at this code
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.480]   and tell us, you know what you should do?
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.360]   And this is what John Graham Cumming does.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.800]   He Googles the code here.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.520]   And it's almost always like open source code
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.160]   for a library than Linux that does things like,
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.960]   you know, let's Google this code here
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.840]   and find out what it really is from.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.120]   'Cause you know, it's not real, right?
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.480]   Entry point, H instance.
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.000]   - We just did that on the Uncomfortable.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.680]   We did an episode about Terminator
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.560]   and one of our panelists freeze framed,
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.800]   HD of the Terminator in his eye.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.640]   And it's like--
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.480]   - It's shell, right?
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.760]   - It's like test code from something.
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.200]   It's just like whoever wrote that code, congratulations.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.680]   Your crappy test code is immortalized forever
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.840]   in the eye of the Terminator.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.720]   - Wait a minute, Houdini Seven, Craig Mulaney
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.040]   who wrote Shift Key Software, who wrote the Twitter app,
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.440]   says it's his code.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.680]   - It is, it is, it is, his code is Shift Key
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.520]   and it's--
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.680]   - It's quick code.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.520]   - And it shows like 16K of available memory
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.680]   in the Terminator.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   So that Terminator is super efficient with a code
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.720]   is what I'm saying.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.560]   - The-- - I'll call this, by the way,
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.360]   they call it playback and, oh, an NSA breach, shocking.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.600]   And we actually have fans of our shows
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   that do the playback for TV shows.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.720]   We've, Twit has appeared on the newsroom
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.400]   and it has a tab in the browser on Silicon Valley
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.080]   because the people who do the playback
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.600]   for those productions snuck it in.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.800]   So, you know, it's these guys are getting,
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.520]   I think they're getting, they have to get a little bit better.
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.080]   - Well, yeah, they have to get, the Terminator,
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.480]   the people who did the Terminator code
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.840]   didn't ever expect that there would be
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.760]   some high resolution format where people would be able
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.360]   to stop the frame and look at the code and say,
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.200]   oh, is that code?
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.160]   - They're reading the code.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.560]   - It would be horrible if it actually did something.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:10.040]   They would be like, oh, well, you know,
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.600]   we didn't mean to give up national security on the movie.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.600]   - Just put the Sony employee
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.800]   social security numbers in there.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.000]   No one will see it.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.400]   - I think we just will never probably know
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:23.400]   the details of the Sony.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.240]   - It seems to me.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.320]   - I wish we could, but we won't.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.280]   - I don't think all of these things are mutually exclusive.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.920]   I think it would be very easy that there was an employee
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.760]   who was upset at the layoffs and stuff at Sony
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   and that they then approached somebody in a, you know,
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.920]   in a chat room somewhere and said,
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   I have information about these servers
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.880]   and I wanna sell it or I wanna give it
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.920]   because I wanna hurt them.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.960]   And then who knows, the people who,
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.760]   and they were saying maybe it was Russian speaking people
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.040]   who were-- - They did a syntactic analysis
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.000]   of all the text and they said it's a much less likely
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.240]   Korean speakers, more likely Russian speakers
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.760]   based on the idioms they use.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.200]   - But that doesn't, even that doesn't preclude it
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.880]   from being that North Korea paid the Russian hackers
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.400]   to take the information from the Sony employee.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.000]   I mean, it's all interconnected potentially.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.160]   - That's why it was a little spy, went to Russia.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.000]   - Like a man.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.800]   - Contacted the person who got fired
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.160]   and then released information.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.000]   We all know sign it worked.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.800]   - That's why it was a little shocking
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.200]   for the security community when the US government
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.320]   so quickly, within weeks, it's North Korea.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   They said you can't know, you just could not know that fast.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.880]   Unless they had signals intelligence,
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.520]   maybe they've got a tap on Kim John Un's phone
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.960]   and he said, "We got 'em good,
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.000]   "we're good, wasn't that, that's good?"
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.600]   And by the way, I saw the interview, terrible movie.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.200]   Maybe that's the smoking gun, we don't know.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.480]   - He called Putin and said, "That was totally me,
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:48.320]   "I did that."
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.160]   - I did it.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.000]   - I did it.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:50.840]   - I did it.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.120]   And maybe he was lying, right?
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.400]   Maybe he was boasting the Putin.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.600]   It's so hard to know this.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   There is a scenario because we do know
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.400]   that Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked in the spring
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.280]   in March and decided to ignore the hack
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.480]   and not announce it, not tell anybody.
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.520]   It could very well be that the initial attack got in,
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.920]   then collected passwords and server names,
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.840]   walking around the network and created a craft today,
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.200]   a targeted attack which within was launched later in September.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.280]   So it's completely, I mean, there's lots of scenarios
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.520]   you can think up.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:25.160]   It's a question mark and I would love to know what happened
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.520]   but I don't think we'll ever know.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.240]   It doesn't seem sensible and this is what most,
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.840]   many people have said, that if a government like North Korea
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.640]   had this trove of information,
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.400]   that they would just give it away.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.120]   It seems much more likely that they would use it
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.560]   for propaganda purposes over time
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.000]   than they would just say, "Here, here's a paste bin.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.480]   "Here's a torrent, have fun, have at it."
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.760]   However, job done, they embarrassed Sony
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.520]   but the movie got released, did you see it?
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.560]   - Yeah, I saw it, I didn't pay for it but I saw it.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.880]   - Yeah, it's fine.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.960]   These are the North Korea, what did you think?
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.400]   - My friend liked it and I just,
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.200]   the more he laughed at the more I didn't laugh
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.040]   there are like three funny parts on it.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.400]   - We saw them all in the trailer, didn't we?
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.160]   - Pretty much like they hate us 'cause they ain't us,
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.320]   they just peanut butter and jealous.
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.160]   (laughs)
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.320]   - Really, those are the jokes?
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.120]   - Yeah, like they hate us 'cause they ain't us.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.240]   No one says that, they hate us 'cause they ain't us.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.400]   Say it, it's not.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.360]   - They hate us 'cause they ain't us.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:24.000]   - There's a tiger in it, that was funny.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.840]   - I'm told Mike Galgan and his wife saw it
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.000]   and they said that the woman who played
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.080]   the Korean interpreter was very funny.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.440]   - Yeah, she was awesome.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.000]   - Okay, she was awesome.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:34.840]   - All right.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.160]   - But it's the interview.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.480]   It wasn't, it was not a gig,
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.400]   it was like Schindler's List or anything anyway.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.960]   It's a funny stoner movie.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:41.960]   - It's a stoner movie.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.200]   - Great, great.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.400]   - Here is John Graham Cummings, Tumblr.
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.320]   It's called Movie Code.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.680]   I think this is his.tumbler.com,
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.720]   which he talks about source code appearing.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.000]   And look, they already have the black hat code.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.880]   They say it's a lot of variable declarations in C++.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.220]   Mostly int and bool, can't find the source yet.
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:08.040]   So this is a great blog
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.440]   where they actually try to source this stuff.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.480]   Is this John Graham Cummings, I can't remember.
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.480]   Digimon, Digital Monsters episode five.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.200]   Here's a little basic code.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.040]   - Nice.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.280]   (laughs)
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.280]   - This is the HBO remake of Westworld.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.520]   The code is from serial port testing software for CellBot,
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.760]   a tool for controlling robots via cell phones.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.280]   It just lifted.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:33.000]   It was probably a trap in the back door
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.240]   I used to infiltrate the system.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.080]   I'll infiltrate the normal operations again
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.000]   and determine the location of the train car.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.360]   It's Ruby.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.200]   It's all in Ruby.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.040]   Great site.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:44.880]   Ruby on Rails.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.720]   - Perfect for the trip.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.240]   - Yeah.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.400]   PHP script.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.960]   Jack Ryan, Shadow Recruit.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.360]   - At least the movie industries learn one thing.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.200]   - What's that?
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.840]   - They're keeping the font small.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.520]   The way it normally is on a display.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.520]   - Yeah, I remember eight years ago.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.360]   I was like, let me hack into the system
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.800]   and it's like 40 point font on this.
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.640]   - You're hacking into this.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.440]   - Prodded the G, what is it you're hacking into?
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.280]   - Would you like to hack it?
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.120]   Why?
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:11.960]   - It answered.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.120]   It lied to us.
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:13.960]   - Except.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.720]   - This is John Graham Cummings Tumblr.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.720]   It's movie code, dot tumbler dot.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.560]   - Nice.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.400]   - Come, nice job.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.840]   Hey, speaking of bugs, there was a fairly significant,
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.120]   well, no, I should take that back.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.600]   There was a bug in Windows 8.1,
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.840]   a bug that would require someone
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.160]   with a physical access to your computer,
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.320]   but then he could escalate.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.360]   It was a privilege escalation.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.760]   The bypass UAC allowed somebody logged in
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.200]   as a standard user to get administrative users,
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.040]   but again, as Microsoft pointed out,
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.480]   you had to be at the keyboard.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.080]   Google discovered this three months ago,
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.000]   they often are, they're probing for bugs a lot
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.200]   and they find these.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.480]   Told Microsoft three months ago,
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.640]   Microsoft did not patch it,
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.440]   so Google this week released it, including sample code,
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.200]   suitable for somebody to take advantage of it.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.600]   Microsoft says, okay, okay, we'll patch it.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.200]   This is kind of normal practice.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.760]   Nobody's upset about this, right?
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:02.600]   Or are you?
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.760]   Should Microsoft, should Google have kept it quiet about this?
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.600]   - Nope.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.440]   - It comes at time when you have,
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.600]   if the company doesn't fix it,
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.760]   bad guys are gonna get it,
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.880]   the public has a right to know that there's a flaw.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.120]   Now, it does complicate things
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.920]   that Google and Microsoft are kind of at odds
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.760]   with one another.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.760]   - So what's the benefit in Google announcing this?
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.360]   If there are, are there steps that somebody can do
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.080]   as a user to protect themselves from this,
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.040]   or do they literally just have to wait for Microsoft?
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.920]   - The best step would be not let somebody sit down
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.960]   on your computer.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.520]   - Yeah, maybe that's it.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.880]   - Microsoft says we're working to release a security update
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:38.600]   to address an elevation of privilege issue.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:41.080]   It's important to note that for a would-be attacker
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:42.440]   to potentially exploit the system,
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:45.040]   they'd first need a valid log on credential,
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.280]   be able to log on locally to a targeted machine.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.400]   Of course, if you're logged in
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.160]   and they get to your machine while you're still logged
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.600]   in, that would count.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.280]   We encourage customers to keep their antivirus software
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.920]   to date, install all available security updates
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.000]   and enable the firewall,
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   which by the way, none of those have anything
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   to do with this hack.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.840]   - Right, so Google then said that they notified Microsoft
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.080]   at the end of September.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.840]   So this is partially Google sort of shaming Microsoft
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.680]   into action.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.720]   - I think you could make a case that it's good for Google,
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.240]   which makes its own operating system,
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.200]   which is not vulnerable to this, Chrome OS,
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.560]   to say, look, Microsoft, you've got a flaw.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.400]   But on the other hand,
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.360]   security researchers have always done this.
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.320]   And a 90-day clock is not unusual.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.640]   - Right, I mean, that seems perfectly reasonable
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:30.520]   for Google to say, look, we notified you 90 days ago,
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.280]   you took no action, we're gonna let the public know.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.640]   - The Google said this public's right to know.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.840]   - Yeah.
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.680]   - All right, let's take a break.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:38.520]   We'll come back more.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:43.080]   Jason Snell, sixcolors.com, when he left IgG,
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:46.360]   and you left on your own feet,
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.080]   they didn't kick you out the door.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.680]   - We came to an agreement, I would say.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.960]   They knew I wanted to leave,
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.800]   and they were--
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.520]   - They kept you there for longer than you wanted to stay.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.280]   - And they were, yes, and they were making a lot of cuts,
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.440]   and the last thing I wanted to do was keep somebody around
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.280]   who didn't want to be there.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.960]   So it all worked out for the best.
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.920]   - Yeah, and I highly recommend his new enterprise
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:08.520]   and his new podcast, it's all at sixcolors.com.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.080]   Let me just look at the podcast,
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.480]   'cause upgrade is the official podcast with you and Mike Hurley.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.320]   - Yeah.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.960]   - Clockwise with Dan Moore, and I love Dan Moore,
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.000]   and you talk about technology for--
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:18.840]   - Yeah, that's a 30 minute--
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.040]   - 30 minute-- - Fast 30 minute talk show
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:21.880]   with four guests.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.840]   - You and Serenity and others do the incomparable,
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.760]   which is lots of fun.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.280]   That's kind of pop stuff.
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.720]   TV talk machine with Tim Goodman, who is great.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:30.560]   - Yeah, so yeah.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.400]   - Do you know Tim?
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.240]   - Yeah, I know Tim.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.560]   - Well, obviously, wait a minute, that's a dumb question.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.400]   - Now I'm doing a show.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.240]   - Now I'm doing, yeah.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.160]   - But I used to read him in the chronicle room.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.080]   - In the chronicle room, I loved him.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:38.920]   - I've known him for a while,
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.120]   and that's one of those perfect cases
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.360]   where he's got a lot to say, and he knows so much about TV.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.600]   And I can be the one who puts him on a regular schedule
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.280]   and edits the podcast and posts it for him,
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.880]   'cause that's the stuff that he's not good at.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.720]   He's good at the content, so I'm kind of in the--
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.560]   - I'll have to start listening to this.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.920]   - And the facilitator for that one.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.880]   - I've always thought he was one of the best TV reviewers out there.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.720]   - Yeah, he's great.
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.080]   - Yeah, now at Hollywood Reporter,
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.040]   which means he's got all the inside stuff.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.480]   - Did you guys talk about Sony at all?
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.440]   - No, he's a TV critic, so he is not doing the reporting
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.080]   of the news, he's doing the reviews of all the shows.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.880]   So it's very much like what shows are worth watching
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.720]   and what were watching.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.720]   - It sounds like a great job until you have to watch.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.200]   - Well that's exactly it.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.480]   - You know, modern family, all 30 episodes a year.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.120]   - Yeah, he does a lot of passing off
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.120]   of like reality shows to other people, I think.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.640]   He's like, "No, no, no, just take that."
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:30.320]   - And then Total Party Kill, which is a D&D podcast.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.440]   - Yeah, that's the coming of thing now.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.240]   We were a little ahead of the curve now.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.480]   There are a lot of people playing D&D in podcasts now,
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.840]   but you know, people seem to like it.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.200]   I don't think we expected anybody to want to listen
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.120]   to us play Dungeons & Dragons, but they do, and it's fun.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.600]   - It's amazing what people listen to us.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:46.600]   - It is what a world.
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.080]   - It's like the Lord every day.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.000]   - What a time to be alive.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.960]   - Actually, you know what, if you watched our 24-hour show,
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.360]   I think this was the pinnacle of what we built this studio
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.200]   for, what we put together an amazing staff for.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.200]   They did such an incredible job.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.800]   And I know nobody watched all 24 hours except us
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.280]   because we were here.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.760]   I was here starting at three, little before three,
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.480]   I am doing yoga.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.480]   And then Zach, who did my yoga class,
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.920]   told me he'd been studying yoga for two days.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.000]   (laughs)
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.720]   But it was still fun.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.120]   And while yoga was going on, Simon Phipps,
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.160]   who was a host of our Floss Weekly Show,
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.560]   was in his beautiful English accent, reading poetry.
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.120]   (laughs)
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.880]   Perfect for three in the morning.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.440]   Let's see a little bit of what happened.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.920]   This year on New Year's Eve 2015.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.840]   Previously on "Twit."
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.160]   - Five, four, three, two,
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.680]   start the Vlogger Sheet, have a brilliant!
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:43.840]   (cheering)
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.000]   Welcome to "Twits" 24 hours of 2015.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.640]   And I want to remind you that this is not just
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   some gratuitous silliness.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.200]   We're raising money for UNICEF.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.040]   - Whoa!
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:00.440]   Happy New Year, New Zealand!
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.760]   - So far, thanks to your generosity,
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.720]   $23,885.
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.280]   If we get to $40,000 for UNICEF,
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.600]   man, I'd be so happy to share my head.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.160]   - Oh my God!
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.800]   - If we get to $50,000, I promise you that tattoo
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.360]   is going right up my tush.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.200]   - Oh my God!
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.680]   (cheering)
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.920]   - Let's get it in the air.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.640]   It's time for a game of drones.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.480]   - Oh!
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.240]   Oh man, and he broke the prize.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.000]   (screaming)
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.440]   - Oh my God, I feel it!
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.880]   - We're crazy here.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:37.880]   - How are we getting to that?
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.760]   - Oh my God, the moon is rising.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.360]   - Happy New Year, Korea!
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.800]   - All of the UK.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.640]   - Happy New Year, Melbourne, New York,
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.480]   - Hi, Jeff.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.400]   - Happy New Year, everybody.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.400]   It's 2015 from all of us at Twitch.
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   And thank you for joining us on our 24 Hours of 20 Fish Day.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.280]   - That was a lot of fun.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.360]   And you know, we had a really incredibly dedicated staff
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:09.840]   who pitched in on this, this long list of people,
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:13.920]   but they deserve some credit because,
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.760]   let's see, Anthony, we call him Iron Man,
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.280]   Anthony Nielsen, Ryan Marsh, our lighting guy,
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:23.560]   we call him Wizard, Alex Gumple, the Mad Scientist.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:25.920]   Burke McQuinn, one stop shop, Jason,
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.840]   see who's our newest employee, Jason Clanthes.
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.600]   And he did that great muppet version
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.880]   of the first episode ever of Twitch.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.240]   We call him the Rookie of the Year,
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:37.160]   Chris, who is our intern,
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.440]   but Chris was here for the whole time, high school student.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.800]   He was our Best Boy Endurance Cable Puller.
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.320]   Did you run cable the whole show?
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.080]   We burned through two camera operators,
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.920]   and you, you, you did the whole thing.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.400]   - Camera for Jerry at the end.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.200]   - And Jerry, finally, the second camera operator gave up,
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.680]   went home, he said, I can't take it.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.200]   But Chris never gave up, you write on.
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.800]   Debbie, Deb Delkeny, who's super mom,
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.760]   Jeffrey, needles the judge.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.440]   Jerry Waggley, graveyard camera man, late night,
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.280]   'cause no one else would do it.
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.640]   And all the folks at the Pixel Core
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.480]   who really helped us, we got all the Skype people ready.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:21.240]   And then our major producers,
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.880]   the four who really put it together,
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.440]   Tanya Hall, Carly Perkins,
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.040]   Carsten Bondi and Glenn Rubenstein.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:26.920]   Great job.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.920]   Guest Relations, Craig Burnett,
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.800]   and Mario Delkeny, thank you.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.160]   And of course, we flew out as many hosts as could make it.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.400]   A few of them couldn't make it,
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.160]   but Steve Gibson, Paul Therott, Jeff Jarvis,
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:44.160]   Mike Elgin, Chad Johnson, Randall Schwartz, Alex Lindsey,
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:48.600]   Sarah Lane, Dick D'Bartolo, Jason Howell,
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:52.880]   Renee Ritchie, Ron Richards, Brian Burnett,
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.160]   Mary Jo Foley, Scott Wilkinson, his wife, Joanna,
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.120]   Aaron Newcomb, Simon Phipps, Zach,
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.840]   I don't even know Zach's last name.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:05.600]   And of course, Lisa Kensil, our CEO,
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.480]   who actually wrote the checks.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.120]   - Dr. Ebel Zachary Smith.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:14.400]   - Zachary Smith, he has the name, Zach's name is Zachary Smith,
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.760]   the same name as the guy in Lost in Space.
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.480]   Danger, he used to,
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.320]   we'll rob you.
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.560]   - Yeah, okay, I'll remember his name from now on.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:22.520]   But you know, most importantly,
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.920]   and you didn't put yourself on this list,
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.720]   but Jammer B, John Slanina,
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.680]   worked 48 hours to get this team.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.520]   - Jammer!
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.440]   - together.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.280]   - Whoo!
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.520]   - Jammer B, thank you.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.200]   All of the episodes are up on our specials feed,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.040]   twitter.tv/specials,
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.040]   or youtube.com/twit.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.320]   If you wanna watch me get my head shaved,
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.600]   if you wanna watch me get my butt tattooed,
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.120]   if you wanna watch the gospel choir,
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.360]   they were amazing, the rock roll bands,
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.000]   the Dixie Land, it was really a lot of fun.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.280]   So thank you very much.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:59.200]   Really appreciate all of your hard work.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.880]   The staff were charted than I did.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:01.880]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:02.960]   Oh, and it's not too late,
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.440]   unicefusa.org/twit.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.520]   Currently $61,790,
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.920]   but we could raise more,
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.960]   and people have been going in there and putting more,
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.760]   and we'd really appreciate that.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.400]   More than 10,000 in the Twit auctions,
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.800]   I don't have a final total there.
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.840]   Then how much do you know what the final total on the auctions was?
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.360]   - When you get paid on the whole sale--
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.440]   - We're still waiting to get paid.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.720]   - All of them are paid up until we--
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.280]   - And then we'll give you a number.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.680]   It's over 10,000, though.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.720]   So over $70,000 raised for unicef.
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.800]   That's a great thing.
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:31.640]   I'm very happy.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.840]   Thank you all for doing that.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.280]   Unicefusa.org/twit.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.600]   More with Owen J.J. Stone.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.520]   Oh, doctor!
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:42.000]   - Uncle Leo, do you know what's the most over my shoulder?
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.160]   - Who's up? - You haven't noticed it.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.720]   But my Twitter's blowing up.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.160]   I see the UFC pad there.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.600]   - You got the Listerine.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.440]   - There you go.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.640]   What's next to that Listerine?
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.440]   - A bottle of brandy and Listerine.
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.280]   What is that?
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.120]   What is that for?
[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:54.960]   - Oh, no.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.360]   - Twitter's blowing up.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.360]   - This is that pure white Hennessy Uncle Leo.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.840]   - It's pure white Hennessy.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.520]   It doesn't look so white.
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:03.360]   - It's not white.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.600]   It's like a yellow, but it's different
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:07.640]   'cause I got it when I went to the Dominican Republic.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.080]   - Oh, neat. - And it's amazing.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.080]   - And is that-- - That's a brandy, right?
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:11.920]   - Yes, I put it.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.920]   It's a cognac.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:13.920]   - Cognac.
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:14.760]   - Cognac.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.320]   - Pure white cognac.
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.800]   - Yeah, I'll buy you a bottle next time
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.640]   I go on a trip to an island and send it to you.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.200]   - But did you have to go to the Dominican to get it?
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.640]   - Unless you want to buy it on Craigslist
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.360]   for like triple quadruple of the price,
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.960]   they don't sell it in stores here.
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.040]   So you have to get it like duty-free.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.560]   - Oh, it's like 200 bucks a bottle.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.160]   Holy cow. - Yeah.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.240]   But I don't like Hennessy at all, but this is amazing.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.280]   And I put it up there with the Listerine,
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.040]   just to see if anybody knows to pay attention.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.240]   - The internet does.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.280]   - Does everybody know tweet me like,
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.120]   what's the-- - Everything.
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.720]   - Listerine in the middle. - The internet knows everything.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.200]   - Well, there's a list of read in the,
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   but yeah, it's really good.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.640]   - I have to try it.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.480]   - Yeah.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.000]   - It's for cognac enthusiasts.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:51.840]   - Something.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:52.680]   - Something.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.520]   - They don't have any--
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.760]   - I only bought it 'cause I never saw it before.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.560]   I never even had Hennessy.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.440]   It was like, well, it's different.
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.640]   I tried it and I liked it.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.680]   - Wine searcher, let's see where we can get it.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.000]   A miniature is $20.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.200]   A full bottle is a lot more.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.040]   Wow.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.360]   - It was 40 bucks at the airport.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.760]   And I got home and I went with my family members
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.120]   and they were loading up for Barrow.
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:14.960]   And I'm like, what are you doing?
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.400]   I put this stuff on Craigslist.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:18.400]   And sure enough, like there,
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.960]   they sell like gangbusters 'cause you can only buy four bottles,
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.240]   but you could triple your money.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.400]   - Nate. - Nate.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.240]   - Also here, another Audible fan.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.080]   - Yes.
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.520]   - We share our love of audiobooks at audible.com.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.280]   Jason Snell, what you listening to these days?
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.760]   - Well, I always like to just promote something.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.200]   We read a lot of books for the incomparable book
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:44.680]   called Station 11, which is on Audible by Emily St. John Mandel.
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.000]   - You have the weirdest stuff.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.280]   Now, it's usually sci-fi.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.440]   - Yep.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.800]   This was on some best book of the year list, Station 11.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.080]   Spelled out, E-L-E-V-E-L.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:55.920]   - Oh, okay, there it is.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:56.760]   - There it is.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.680]   Emily St. John Mandel.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.280]   - Great, it's kind of apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic,
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.800]   but not in a really brutal way.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.000]   It's, you know, there's like the road, which is really dark.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:07.840]   It's not quite that dark,
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.080]   but it's about a group of traveling musicians and actors
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:14.320]   going from small town to small town in the Midwest
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.320]   after a flu, like the stand kind of that,
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.840]   where 99% of the people have died.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.200]   The technology has gone,
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.720]   and then these musicians and actors
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:26.520]   are performing Shakespeare and music
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.000]   and these little towns that are
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.320]   a varying degrees of safe in the Midwest.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.520]   And it's plus flashbacks to what happened before.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.400]   And it's kind of beautiful, and I really liked it.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.680]   - I am gonna add that right now.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.480]   'Cause for some reason,
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.760]   I really drawn to these end of the world.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.200]   - Yeah, there are a lot of them right now too.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:44.040]   - Yeah.
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:44.880]   - That's a good one.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.700]   - That's a good one.
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.160]   It came out in the 50s, and it's such a good book.
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.680]   And it's the first one I remember,
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.480]   although I imagine there's more.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.080]   So one of the nice things you can do with Audible
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.760]   is when you hear somebody talk about it,
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.120]   you gotta make an Audible account.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.080]   You can add those books to your wish list.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.400]   This is another one I'm gotta get.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.760]   The Complete Sherlock Holmes,
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.960]   narrated by one of my favorite Audible readers, Simon Vance.
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.840]   He's got the perfect British accent.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:07.960]   And he's a wonderful reader.
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.720]   Whoops, how did that happen?
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.160]   And go back to Audible here.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:16.240]   So when it happens all the time, you hear people,
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.320]   'cause that's one of the things, if you're an Audible,
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.280]   people are gonna talk and what are you listening to?
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.200]   What are you listening to?
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.280]   I think that's another one of yours,
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.120]   Anselaire Justice.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.520]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.560]   - I have my wish list is filled with stuff
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:29.960]   that you recommended, which is awesome.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.560]   - How many? - And Andy and I go.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.480]   So let me tell you how you get two books for free.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.880]   If you go to audible.com/twit2,
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.560]   you'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.600]   That's the two book a month subscription.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.240]   That's the one I use.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.760]   But I think two books is,
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.600]   this is for the serious reader.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.480]   And I love having all these great books.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.000]   Are you gonna go see the movie "American and Sniper?"
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.300]   Read the book that the movie's based on.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:59.040]   You're a fan of Amy Poehler.
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.640]   She's gonna be, isn't she?
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:03.440]   Oh no, she hosting the Golden Globes this year.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:04.680]   - Yeah, with Tina Fey. - Tina Fey,
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:05.920]   they're doing it again.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:07.520]   - Gosh, I love that.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.360]   So her book, "Yes, Please," is narrated by her
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.360]   with appearances from Kel Burnett and Seth Meyers and others.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.560]   These are, it's great stuff.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.320]   If you like showbiz, if you like fiction,
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.600]   if you like nonfiction, great science fiction.
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:23.240]   A lot of nonfiction too, really great stuff.
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:25.080]   I'm a big fan.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.800]   I try to, I do an alternate.
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.000]   I read fiction, nonfiction, fiction, nonfiction
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.960]   to keep myself fresh.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.000]   And I listen to Audible all the time in the car.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.920]   I wish I had a good commute, I don't anymore.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.960]   But I still listen, even if I'm just driving
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.120]   to work five minutes, I listen.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.440]   When I go to bed, I'll listen to Audible.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.280]   When I am in the gym, of course,
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.240]   I'm gonna listen to Audible.
[01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.040]   Walkin' the dog doin' the dishes.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:48.840]   I put Audible on the speakers in the house
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.000]   and listen all around the house.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.160]   It sounds crazy.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.600]   There's this big booming voice goin' out
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.520]   throughout the house on my Sonos.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.680]   Audible.com, look at this, Randall Monroe.
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.280]   What if serious scientific answers to absurd,
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.680]   hypothetical questions?
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.240]   I love Randall Monroe and Wil Wheaton.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:06.400]   There it's this one.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.240]   So here's the deal.
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.960]   It's hard to pick two, but pick two.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.800]   Then go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.040]   You're gonna get two credits.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:15.960]   Your first month is free.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   You can cancel in that first month, pay nothing.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.040]   But those books will be yours to keep.
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.320]   You'll also get the free subscription
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.040]   to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.040]   Daily Audio Programs.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.480]   Fascinating reading that will keep you engaged,
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.000]   that will make you happy.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.240]   I love this.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:35.280]   I like the cover anyway, "The Last American Vampire."
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.280]   (laughing)
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.820]   My Seth Graham Smith.
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.960]   I tell ya, it brought reading back into my life.
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.080]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.660]   Listen and enjoy.
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:51.280]   This weekend tech continues on Owen J. J. Stone.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.800]   You thought it'd be a nice short show to know.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.520]   No, I knew better than that on "Galeo."
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.280]   Even if we have to fill it with our delightful entertainment,
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:02.280]   the gray haired one wouldn't allow us to show early.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.160]   Not exactly gray haired anymore.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.840]   Hey, did the Cowboys lose yet?
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.600]   They're about to win, I think.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.720]   Oh no, the Lions are going down and--
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:10.880]   They're trying to make--
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:11.720]   Hold out here.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.680]   Come on, Detroit.
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:14.440]   Come on, Jason, don't put me in that hole yet.
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:15.480]   They're working.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:16.320]   They're working on it.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.640]   They're working on it.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.480]   It's exciting.
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:21.680]   Did you see the Lezards squad?
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:23.600]   Did Joe have you seen the Lezards squad?
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:28.600]   The Lezards squad is the hacking team that took--
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.520]   Sad, we did it.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.920]   We brought down on Christmas day.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:33.240]   We made a lot of kids cry.
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.640]   Oh, the real Grinches.
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.800]   The real Grinches are the lizard squad.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:42.360]   They brought down the Sony network and
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.720]   they brought down--
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:46.560]   Xbox.
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:47.400]   Xbox.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.280]   Xbox Live.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:52.860]   Brian Krebs, one of our favorite security guys.
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:56.900]   Uh, identified him.
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:59.180]   And now for 40 days, they're being--
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:03.340]   He's been bombarded by D-Dost,
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:07.260]   Brian Krebs site.
[01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.340]   Just jerks.
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.780]   Can I just say they're jerky jerk jerks?
[01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:13.900]   They ruined Christmas for people not just in the US
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.860]   but all over the world by D-dossing.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.580]   And by the way, it's a trivial thing to do.
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:20.900]   You don't have to have mad skills.
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:22.500]   They're just jerky jerks.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.980]   And then they said,
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.100]   oh, just go out and get some fresh air.
[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:27.580]   What are you, mom?
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:30.220]   You're a jerky jerk and you're talking like your mom.
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:34.660]   So Brian Krebs identified two members,
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:37.780]   a 22 year old British man called Vinny Omari,
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.340]   who immediately got arrested.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:42.300]   Yeah, enjoy that time in prison.
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:44.380]   You know what prisoners do to hackers?
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.580]   Ask them to fix their computer?
[01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.420]   That's right.
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:48.420]   Ask them to fix their credit.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.540]   That's the first thing you ask for.
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:50.380]   Forget my computer.
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:53.980]   The 16 year old Finnish boy, Julius Kivimaki,
[01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:58.820]   he's been questioned but not at this date arrested yet.
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:04.300]   They of course have joined in by mocking his hairline.
[01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:06.580]   Go ahead, mock my hairline.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.020]   I don't have one anymore, Leo.
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:09.580]   Hairline, what hairline?
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:15.780]   Anyway, good news is at least one has been arrested.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:19.060]   Allegedly, allegedly, we don't know for sure
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.460]   he's a lizard squatter.
[01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.100]   Yes, an alleged hazardous business.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.340]   A lizard squad.
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:24.180]   Arrested.
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:26.940]   Yeah, he kind of confirms it.
[01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.220]   The Daily Dot has the story,
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:30.740]   he even provided a photo of the search warrant.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.940]   They took everything.
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:36.060]   Xbox One, phones, laptops, computers, USBs, et cetera.
[01:35:36.060 --> 01:35:38.340]   Of course they did you nitwit.
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:39.540]   That's what they do.
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:43.860]   In some ways, isn't this the sort of thing
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:48.380]   that has to happen for some of this internet crime stuff,
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:52.180]   especially just trolling and doxing people
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:56.780]   and swatting people and doing these denial of service attacks?
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:00.780]   Isn't this the only way that there will be a cool off?
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:03.300]   Is if people, I remember when I was a kid
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.700]   and I had a computer and people were doing phone freaking
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:08.340]   and stuff like that where they're stealing,
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:11.020]   there was always that question of like,
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:11.940]   oh, will we get in trouble?
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.020]   Will we get arrested?
[01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:14.500]   They're like, nah, it's not gonna matter.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.780]   They'll never catch us, who cares?
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:16.620]   Something like this,
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.900]   I think there is at least a little bit of a chilling effect.
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.620]   I don't think it's ever gonna stop,
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:23.500]   but if some people actually get in trouble
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:25.580]   and might have an effect,
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.100]   might call you the truth though.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:28.420]   And this is why we'll never probably know
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.500]   what happens, Sony, unless a hacker is boasts,
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.460]   it's usually hard to catch us.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:35.060]   Very hard.
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:37.740]   But as soon as you go, oh, I did that, then, well, I think--
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:39.620]   And then the best people who were in the best position
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:42.380]   to figure it out are the people behind the wall
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:44.100]   who wanna keep everything a secret
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.860]   because they're working for a government.
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.900]   Here's the big argument.
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.180]   Yeah, right, that's why governmental hacks
[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:49.020]   and they would come out, right?
[01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:51.700]   We'll never know who did Flame or any of these governmental--
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.340]   Right, and they may know who did some of this stuff
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.340]   and not wanna say it
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.300]   because they don't wanna reveal why they would know.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.900]   Well, here's the funny thing.
[01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.340]   Lizard squads attack against a PlayStation
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:02.380]   that we're gonna Xbox Live apparently
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:04.500]   was to market their new DDoS service.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.380]   (both laughing)
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.820]   They call it Lizard Stressor.
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:11.500]   They launched it Tuesday morning
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:17.740]   and the prices are fair between, I think, $500 and $500
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:21.300]   and you can use it to a DDoS.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:23.860]   Any idiot can, again, can run a DDoS attack.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.940]   Don't give them your credit card.
[01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.940]   Yeah.
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:27.140]   They in Bitcoin, okay?
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:28.580]   Pay them in Bitcoin.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:32.660]   The most expensive tier offers 30,000 seconds of attack.
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:35.200]   That's about 20 days, costs $130 a month.
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.500]   So I expect that we will quickly be DDoSed by these guys.
[01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.620]   For $500, just kick it in
[01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:44.780]   'cause then you can launch unlimited attacks.
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:47.980]   Can't we just get better security?
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:50.700]   I mean, I didn't mind when my PlayStation 3 went down
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:51.820]   'cause it was free,
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.620]   but I'm sitting up here paying $50, $60 a year
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:57.220]   for PlayStation Xbox and it goes down on Christmas Day
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:58.620]   and two punks took it down.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.300]   That's a huge problem.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.300]   I can tell you the solution and it's so easy
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.220]   that this is embarrassing.
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:08.220]   It is, if internet service providers
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:11.860]   were willing to do what it takes, this would go away.
[01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.740]   The only way you can launch a DDoS attack,
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:17.140]   and there's some really good, by the way,
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.500]   and I don't know if they're using this amplification attacks
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.460]   that use known flaws and things like
[01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:23.140]   the network time protocol.
[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.380]   So one guy with a small,
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:27.020]   you don't have to have huge pipes anymore
[01:38:27.020 --> 01:38:28.660]   to do a DDoS attack.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:30.540]   You can take advantage of these amplification attacks,
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:32.220]   even if you're on a dial up,
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.180]   you could bring down massive sites.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:37.700]   A DDoS attack works by sending a packet,
[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:39.860]   a sin packet to a website.
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:40.700]   There are other ways to do it,
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:44.020]   but the basic idea is websites can't ignore sin packets.
[01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:46.220]   That's the knock on the door saying,
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.740]   hey, I wanna look at your site.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.300]   They come back with a sin act.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.820]   If you're trying to DDoS a site,
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:53.260]   you flood them with sins and you don't care about the act.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:56.580]   And the site is so busy handling all these incoming knocks
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:59.020]   that it doesn't have time for any normal users.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:02.060]   So you bring the site down by flooding its bandwidth
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:03.540]   with malformed packets.
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:06.260]   The identifying IP addresses in these packets
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.380]   are rotated, they're bogus, they're spoofed.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:11.220]   Obviously, you wouldn't want it to be your IP address.
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:12.660]   That make it really easy to catch you.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.020]   In fact, very easy to block.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:16.340]   So you have a different IP address for every sin.
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:19.540]   But the way we stop this is whoever the ISP is
[01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.380]   for the person launching the attack,
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:24.180]   all they have to do is they see all the outbound of traffic
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.460]   is say, well, is that an IP address from our network?
[01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.180]   It's not, and just stop it.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:29.700]   And there would be no DDoSing.
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:32.900]   This is from Steve Gibson, our security guy.
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.100]   It's that simple.
[01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:35.300]   - We need to fix that.
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:36.140]   - Because I--
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:38.220]   - ISPs are acting irresponsibly.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.060]   - Maybe that's why we need Google fiber
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:42.900]   to be spread across the land because apparently
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.060]   they like telling people about holes in there.
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:49.060]   - Well, I think you can guarantee if Google were the ISP
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.140]   that they would say, hey, is this coming from,
[01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:53.420]   is this IP address, does this IP address
[01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:55.940]   match the IP address of the user?
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:59.020]   Or is it within the range of our IP addresses?
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.140]   If not, just stop it.
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.860]   All DDoS attacks, they'd have to find a new way to do it.
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:04.380]   - I know we skipped it but real quick.
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:07.700]   I need to have CC to approve Google's request
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.300]   so we can get this thing cracked lacking
[01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:11.660]   and roll out nationwide 'cause I need Google
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:13.700]   and my life for my ISP.
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:15.740]   - Google wants to roll out.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.580]   Is that what it is?
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:18.580]   I didn't see it.
[01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:20.980]   Google wants to roll out the gigabit ethernet,
[01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:23.020]   the internet, the internet, everywhere?
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:26.260]   - Yeah, they file so they can become like a network player.
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.860]   - Higher, like Comcast.
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:28.700]   I just need it.
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:30.740]   - By the way, the cowgirls look like the cowgirls won.
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:31.580]   - They won, I know.
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:32.420]   - They won.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:33.260]   - They did.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.220]   That's why I need something happy in my life like Google.
[01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:36.060]   - Let me tell you something.
[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.380]   - It's okay, you can root against them next week too.
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:38.980]   - Right, let me tell you something.
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:40.900]   - The real way to humiliate a team is to let them
[01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:43.140]   get to the Superbowl and then have them loose.
[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:43.980]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:41:05.960]   - As a
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.840]   FCC is gonna be busy.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.600]   They're also, the Marriott has petitioned them to allow them
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:16.600]   to proceed illegally and block Wi-Fi access points
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.560]   on their properties.
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.320]   - Again, it's just like the people that made
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.800]   that stupid Sony video that told me to kick ponies.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:25.080]   Who sits in a room and has this discussion
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.320]   and comes up with this evil?
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.840]   Do you not understand that like general people
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:31.560]   will tell people don't stay there because not one,
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.800]   they charge you triple the price
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.200]   of other hotels charging your internet.
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.320]   And they won't let you use your own internet.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.200]   Like, why would someone do this?
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.320]   Like the nickel and dime of certain companies
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.200]   is just so idiotic over the broad span of the money
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.040]   that they would save with goodwill.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:47.600]   'Cause now other hotels are coming out saying,
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:50.400]   oh, we've got free internet, we've doubled the speed.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.640]   Come stay with us.
[01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:53.960]   And people say, sure, I'm gonna fight the enemy.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.160]   Just like I fought North Korea by downloading the interview.
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.880]   - So Marriott says that it's not their intent to do that,
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.600]   that they file this petition because they have,
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:06.720]   there are people doing like fake base stations
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.280]   that are matched up to their conference rooms
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.120]   and things like that.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.040]   They've got a whole story about it.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.440]   But the problem is what they're trying to do
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.280]   is erode this very fundamental idea
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.400]   that this spectrum is for the public use
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:16.360]   and that anybody can use it.
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.200]   - It's unregulate.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.600]   - And that it's legal to jam it or block it in any way.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600]   And they say, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.640]   you of course will be able to use
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:25.320]   your Wi-Fi hotspot in your own room.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.160]   But once they have the right to block it,
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.680]   they could block it anywhere.
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:31.760]   And it's just a terrible idea.
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.080]   It is a fundamental tenant that this is unregulated
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.120]   and it may not be blocked.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.080]   - It's a junk spectrum, right?
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.320]   It's supposed to be, yeah, exactly.
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:42.200]   - So the other thing the FCC is gonna do,
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.800]   they say soon is rule on this Title II regulation,
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:48.920]   the net neutrality regulation.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.120]   In a letter to the FCC,
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.000]   Google's Director of Communications Law,
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.840]   Austin Schlich said there could be a good thing
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840]   if we go with Title II,
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:01.040]   because that gives Google fiber access to utility polls
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.040]   and other essential infrastructure owned by utilities.
[01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:06.680]   Right now, the way that these companies
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.320]   can preserve the monopolies say,
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.920]   hey, and you can't use our infrastructure.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.880]   But if they're Title II, the FCC can say,
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:14.320]   no, you gotta open that up.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.080]   That's a good thing,
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.680]   'cause what is the best way to protect
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:19.320]   net neutrality competition?
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.520]   We all agree.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.560]   Nobody disagrees that the best way to do this
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.000]   would be have some competition.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.720]   The only reason I'm still a Comcast customer
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.960]   is 'cause I have no choice.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:27.800]   - Yeah, me too.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.560]   - And Comcast isn't buying Google.
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:31.040]   Lee's not in the foreseeable future.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.640]   - So on my site, six colors,
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.880]   a couple months ago, Glenn Fleischman wrote this piece
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:37.880]   that was about the same issue.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.800]   And he was saying, the tech giants really ought
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:40.640]   to get in this game.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.120]   Google has got the right idea here
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:44.560]   and that other tech giants like Apple
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.560]   should also try to invest in broadband
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:50.000]   only because the more competition there is
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.360]   and the more you don't have,
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.800]   the cable companies, is gatekeepers,
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:55.160]   the safer it's gonna be for people
[01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:56.600]   to build their businesses on the internet.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.600]   And I think, I'm rooting for Google fiber
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.600]   and I'm not, in some areas, not a big fan of Google
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.640]   but I am absolutely rooting for Google fiber
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:05.480]   'cause there need to be more options
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:07.600]   for broadband internet in the United States.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.200]   - Well, the other thing is that
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:15.000]   Obama proposed Title II, FCC's certainly considering
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.400]   declaring that broadband providers are common carriers
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.440]   but we have not heard anything from Microsoft and Apple
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.840]   and Google to Facebook's.
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.760]   These guys really should be stepping up.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.960]   This is the first indication in any way
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.240]   that Google supports this.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.960]   So that's, it's good news too.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:33.320]   I think the FCC's been waiting to hear from these guys.
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.320]   And in fact, there have been some of accused
[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.520]   the big companies of secretly fighting Title II
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.240]   with lobbyists.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:43.000]   - It's the mafia dude, like,
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000]   the reason some of these companies don't get into that space
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.440]   is because the old factory machine is kicking in a lot.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.280]   - That's right.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.120]   - They're new.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:51.960]   So to jump into bed with that,
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.120]   Google's gotta put their foot in the water and show
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.600]   that they're not gonna jump out.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.320]   And then other people might try and get in on it
[01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:59.440]   because everybody's got TV in their house,
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:00.280]   you know what I mean?
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.680]   So something like Apple coming in
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:03.480]   and being a direct pipeline in your home
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:04.840]   will be something they'd love to do.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.720]   But it's not something they're gonna step out
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.080]   and branch out to do like what Google might because,
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.920]   you know, they wanna try everything.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:13.560]   You know, they make stupid networks.
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.440]   They make all kinds of crazy stuff to flop and they don't care.
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.520]   So if anybody's gonna try and do something different
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:21.600]   and Google's the one to lead the way and I'm happy for it.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.280]   - And then Hollywood continues its war against piracy
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:27.880]   with a bizarre idea.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.720]   - They took down Pirate Bay.org.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:30.720]   - That day in the world.
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.960]   - Hollywood, according to leaked documents,
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.200]   when do they came from?
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.840]   Hollywood has a new secret weapon in the fight,
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.080]   a little known legal venue designed to take on,
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.960]   take new powers over the digital realm.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:45.240]   It's called the IITC, the International Trade Commission.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:47.200]   It's been around for a while.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.840]   It's the company that kind of prevents, you know,
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:52.720]   the fake Gucci bags from coming in to the United States.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:55.680]   But the IITC, and I don't know if many people know this,
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:59.600]   recently gave itself the power to examine data
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.160]   as it comes in, not merely handbags,
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.880]   but data, this goes back to a 3D printing case.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:11.760]   If the decision holds and, you know,
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.720]   the courts don't overturn this,
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.320]   it means that data could now be stopped
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.080]   like the Pirate Bay at the border.
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.400]   Fascinate, we'll watch this case with great interest.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.680]   There are a number of Supreme Court cases
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.440]   that are coming up this spring
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:27.920]   that are gonna be very interesting for the internet.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.760]   Google did release its top search terms.
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.120]   We'll talk about those in just a second
[01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:32.480]   before we do, though, a reminder
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:34.080]   that if you're doing meetings,
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:35.440]   you should be doing them online.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:38.880]   There's no reason, especially with clients and colleagues
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:40.160]   spread out all over the world.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.320]   No better way to do it.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:43.160]   It's frankly faster, more efficient,
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.920]   more effective, more fun than a face-to-face meeting.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.760]   It's go to meeting.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.840]   You know we've heard me talk about that forever.
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.640]   Good communication is critical for every business,
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.720]   especially with people distributed out over the world.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:55.160]   You need to stay connected.
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.760]   You need to meet with coworkers,
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:00.880]   brainstorm, breakthrough, log jams, and clients.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:02.040]   There's no better way to present.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.560]   They prefer it.
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:04.760]   That's why I'm really serious.
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:07.280]   Your client does not want to bring you to lunch.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.520]   They just want to hear your pitch and decide.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.560]   So a million is a small business professionals rely
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:13.440]   on go to meeting from Citrix.

[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.840]   but then you turn on the HD video conferencing.
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.960]   Now you're seeing each other face-to-face.

[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.800]   Trending people, Jennifer Lawrence, I wonder why.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.280]   Kim Kardashian, what are they looking for?
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.440]   Tracy Morgan, oh he had that car wreck.
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:45.760]   People were worried about him.
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:46.760]   Ray Rice,
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:51.640]   kicked off the, who's he playing for the Ravens?
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:52.800]   - Ravens, yeah.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.680]   He's playing for the home couch right now.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.320]   He's playing at home.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:00.520]   Tony Stewart, race car driver?
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.480]   Yeah, that's the guy he ran over somebody in a race.
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:07.600]   Oh, that horrible, horrible thing, yeah.
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.280]   Here's one, animated gifts.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.000]   What do you think the number one animated gift was
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.120]   for the year?
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.040]   I wanna see it, Miguel Herrera.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:19.040]   (laughing)
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.680]   He's the FIFA coach.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.840]   So apparently his hair is on fire and I don't know what.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.080]   - Yeah, Mexico, during the World Cup,
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.600]   he was the Mexico National Team
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.400]   and he was totally acting out on the sidelines, yeah.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.920]   - Here's a collection of Miguel Herrera gifts.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.520]   I'm not sure which one was the winning gift or GIF.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.360]   What do you say?
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:42.160]   - I don't wanna say because it'll just be a cat.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.000]   - People get mad. - People get mad.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:43.840]   - People get mad.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.680]   What is this?
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.680]   I have to sign up for something.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:48.840]   In the 80s, I learned that it was GIF
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.200]   and so I can't change it now.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.600]   - I say GIF 'cause it's graphics.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.120]   - I was about to say, Jason, I was gonna make you give an answer.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:53.960]   You have to take a stand.
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:54.800]   - Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.040]   Yeah, but that was, you know, I realized there's lots
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.400]   of evidence to the contrary, but it's too late now.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.280]   - It is forever. - It was forever.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:03.160]   - Luis Suarez, the biter.
[01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:04.520]   - The biter.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:05.920]   Madden.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:06.760]   Is he?
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:07.600]   - Okay.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.440]   - Is John Madden, is it a GIF of Madden?
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.200]   - Probably the-- - Godzilla.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.640]   - And the Shmoney Dance.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.840]   What's the Shmoney Dance?
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.640]   I don't know, should I click this?
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:16.840]   - Yeah, you can click it.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:18.240]   - What's the Shmoney Dance?
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.280]   Oh, is this Sh-- what is this?
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.080]   - It's a guy who does a dance 'cause he can't dance
[01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:24.320]   and everybody does it.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.560]   - I think I'm looking in the--
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.960]   I feel like I'm searching all the round places.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.440]   - You're not playing the GIFs anyway, so, or GIFs.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.760]   - I will, if I could find it.
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.600]   - GIF GIFs.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:39.600]   - I am kind of, I feel that I might be a GIF challenged here.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.040]   I don't--
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.720]   - I think it's the fact that you lost your hair
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.200]   and brain capacity.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.920]   Does it bring, that's actually something I've been asking.
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:49.160]   - The shave might have been too close, Uncle Leo.
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:51.400]   She might have took some spells with it.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:54.120]   - Elmo does your Shmoney Dance.
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:56.160]   Have you seen Elmo do the Shmoney Dance?
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:58.360]   - I've seen a lot of Shmoney Dances.
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.960]   This is a meme I missed.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.960]   - I'm gonna try and make a next month.
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:04.040]   - It's not in your wheelhouse, Uncle Leo.
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:05.120]   (laughs)
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.440]   - I'm gonna switch you up.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.680]   (dramatic music)
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:11.280]   - Is this for-- - Is this for--
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:12.440]   - Is this the Cowboys?
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:16.560]   - I'm actually surprised because usually when there's a dance
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:20.200]   crazy with videos on the internet, you do hear.
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:21.880]   - I'm here to do it.
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.400]   I do not know the Shmoney Dance.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:24.760]   I missed that one.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.920]   That was only number six.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.000]   Then Robin Williams, Ashley Wagner,
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.960]   Dancing Groot and Vince McMahon.
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:30.960]   - Oh, Dancing Groot.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.360]   - Gotta love it.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.280]   Number one actor, Jared Leto.
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:35.720]   He was great in the Dallas Buyers Club.
[01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.600]   I guess that's a hangover from that.
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.440]   Then Matthew McConaughey, okay, that proves it.
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:40.280]   - Detective.
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.520]   - True Detective and Dallas Buyers.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:44.520]   McConaughey, Caulkin.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:47.320]   Why is he the number three actor?
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.680]   The Home Alone kid?
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:50.560]   - They put up he died like three times.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.640]   - Oh, but he didn't, right?
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.480]   - No, he didn't.
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.680]   - Jennifer Lawrence, number one actress for obvious reasons.
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:57.760]   Renee Zellwigger, 'cause everybody's wondering
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:00.280]   what the heck and Betty White.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.120]   Is she dead?
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:02.920]   - She had Death Room where she had that's true.
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.880]   - Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson, Richard Sherman on Netflix.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:07.600]   - I love Betty White.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.440]   - Who doesn't love Betty White?
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:10.280]   - I don't know.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.120]   - Dad, people.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.000]   - I would love to hang out with Betty White.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.720]   - It's the number one beer on Google Bud.
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:18.960]   Then Corona, this I think represents America's drinking.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:20.720]   Keystone Miller and Blue Moon.
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:23.400]   We could do better than that.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:24.760]   Here's the number one beauty question.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.440]   How do I get rid of acne?
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.760]   Number two, how do I get rid of stretch marks?
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.760]   Number three, how often should I was?
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:31.760]   - Wash.
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:33.120]   - Wash my hair.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:36.640]   What do you do after you shave your head?
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.320]   - Yeah, good question.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.080]   - Do you need to wash your hair?
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.680]   - What is BB cream?
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:43.000]   I don't know.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.600]   I'm not going to click that link.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.800]   - This is a family show, Kalea.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:47.960]   You can't trust the internet.
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.720]   - I cannot trust the internet.
[01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:52.720]   - I cannot, number one, "Boy Snow Bird," never heard of it.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.600]   Number two, "Blood Will Out."
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.320]   These are probably all young adult, right?
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:58.120]   Number three, "Savage Harvest,"
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.360]   City of Heavenly Fire Flash Boys.
[01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:02.240]   "Calorie searches."
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.240]   You know, Google does that now.
[01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:04.480]   How many calories are in?
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.320]   What do you think?
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.200]   I'm going to reveal it.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:07.600]   Owen J. J. Stone,
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.040]   what is the number one search
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.800]   for how many calories are in?
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.760]   - Soda.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.560]   - I'm going to say donut.
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:16.920]   - Burger.
[01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:18.840]   - And the winner is banana.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.680]   (laughs)
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.520]   Banana.
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.520]   Banana.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.520]   Banana.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:23.680]   - You people are so healthy.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:25.080]   - Aren't you glad I didn't say donut?
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:26.520]   You know why it's banana?
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.800]   'Cause that was the example Google gave
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:30.160]   when they told people it could do that.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.760]   So we're going to throw that answer out
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:32.720]   and go to number two.
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:35.680]   Number two, "Pumpkin Pie."
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:36.520]   - This is horrible.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:37.360]   - What is America?
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:38.200]   What's wrong with America?
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:40.200]   - This is the worst game of family feud ever.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:41.040]   - Yeah, Apple.
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.160]   - And this is horrible.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.240]   - We're going to throw this all at.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.400]   What's number four?
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.720]   - Egg.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.560]   People are so--
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:48.120]   - Go to 15, get down to 70,
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.120]   get down to 70, get down to 70,
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:49.960]   come in life.
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:50.800]   - Cheeseburger.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:51.640]   - Cheeseburger.
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:52.480]   - It's number one.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:53.320]   - You win, 'cause it was the most.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.800]   - And Big Mac is number seven.
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:55.640]   You put those together.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.240]   - And Warren, the calories are sort of Big Mac.
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:53:59.400]   You want to go to Big Mac?
[01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.560]   - $6, $1150.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.400]   - What?
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.400]   - See, it's going to be stuff.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.760]   - How many grams of fat, Mr. Owen J. J. J. Stone?
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:09.760]   - It's stuff without a label.
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.040]   - That's disgusting.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:12.640]   - It's delicious, and they're taking it off the menu,
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:13.960]   apparently, so they're going to go get one.
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:14.960]   - What?
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:16.240]   - Now they didn't take it off.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.280]   Dad has big things,
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:19.120]   they're going to unsuper-sized stuff.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:19.960]   - They better not.
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:20.800]   - They better not.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.920]   - But, McDonald's is hurting.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.040]   Nobody eats McDonald's anymore,
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:25.640]   because they won't tell people what's in their meat.
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:27.400]   So, McDonald's better do something.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:28.720]   - I told this story before,
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:29.560]   I'm telling it again,
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.800]   when I worked at McDonald's as a young man,
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.640]   I was in high school,
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.440]   it was my first job, I worked at McDonald's.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.680]   Once, this is where my weight problem began, Owen.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:37.840]   I was working in the guy,
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.160]   I said, "You can go and break."
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:40.640]   'Cause they don't want to waste burgers, you know,
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:43.280]   they actually count how many don't get eaten,
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:44.160]   and they have to be eaten,
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:45.000]   there's a little timer.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:45.840]   When the timer runs out,
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:46.840]   they have to throw them in the waste bin
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:48.080]   and get counted at the end of the day.
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:48.920]   Guys, you go and break,
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.400]   but you got to eat all seven of these Big Macs,
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.520]   so I don't have to waste them.
[01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:52.760]   - Oh, I did.
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:53.600]   - And I did.
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:56.680]   - So, how many calories at 7,700 calories?
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:58.880]   - That's amazing, I love Big Mac so much, but I don't eat them.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:01.120]   - I do too, I love them, I crave them.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.480]   They got me hooked.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:03.320]   - Okay, let me tell you something,
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:05.240]   here's the fat man cheat on that,
[01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.000]   because you're gonna put the extra piece of bread in there.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.800]   You go ask for a double cheeseburger
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:10.000]   with Big Macs also on it.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.360]   - Yeah, baby.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:13.000]   I love those double cheese.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.680]   - Oh, he just got the Big Macs also,
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:16.400]   'cause that's all the matter.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.000]   Anyway, I'm sorry.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.280]   - You know, something happens when you lose your hair,
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.200]   your butt gets bigger.
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:24.040]   Ford, number one cars,
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:26.880]   Ford Jeep Dodge Toyota General Motors, boring.
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.640]   Celebrity pregnancies.
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.120]   Pregnancy's.
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:32.000]   - Milla, pregnancy's.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.440]   (laughing)
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:35.600]   - You're pregnant. - I got her more laces.
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:38.240]   - Hey, hey, you gotta go pregnant, right?
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.080]   You're pregnant?
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.480]   - Milla Kunis, she's her name is just fat.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:43.840]   - Sierra, Courtney, Kardashian, Kate Middleton,
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:45.360]   and Carrie Washington, celebrity weddings,
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:47.400]   Kim and Kanye, of course.
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:51.240]   Do they have a name like, you know how Brad and Jelena do--
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.240]   - Kim-ye?
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:53.640]   - Kim-ye? - Kim-ye.
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:54.480]   Kim-ye.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.520]   - That sounds like a South Korean street.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:00.280]   - I have some Kim-ye.
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:03.800]   George Clooney and that person no one knows.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.360]   - Oh, I'm all, all I'm wooden.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.120]   - We talked about music and the power of people.
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:10.080]   Kanye West put out a song on the internet
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:11.800]   and it blew up everywhere.
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:13.520]   He didn't release it anywhere or do anything.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.360]   But again, the power of Kanye,
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.600]   he did some song with Paul McCartney.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.200]   And next thing you know, I saw it on Twitter, Facebook.
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:20.600]   Everybody was talking about it.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.800]   No radio play, no nothing,
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.280]   'cause he put it out at midnight,
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:24.160]   day after our new year.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.840]   So, depends on the artist.
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:28.120]   - I saw it on the internet too, yeah.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.840]   - Is it a good song?
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.520]   - I like it 'cause he's talking about family
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:34.040]   and whatever, it's a crap song, but the message is nice.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.600]   - It's not Ebony and Ivory, is it?
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:37.640]   - No, he's just talking about having kids
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.520]   and raising kids and what he wants them to be when they grow up.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.640]   So, if you've got a kid, you feel like,
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:41.720]   "Oh, I can't believe it."
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:43.440]   - Oh, I remember, I listened to the first line
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.960]   and it was so auto-tuned, I said, "I can't listen to the rest."
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:47.880]   - Yeah, like I said, it's not a good song,
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.000]   but the message is a good message.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.880]   - Kanye does like his auto-tuned, Donnie.
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:54.040]   - You do.
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:54.880]   - You do.
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.400]   - Diets, number top five diets, paleo, Atkins.
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:59.560]   - Paleo, paleo.
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:01.160]   We're the wrong guys, that's about that.
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:06.000]   Paleo, Atkins, gluten-free, Mediterranean, and dash.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.080]   Don't know what that is.
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:09.120]   - Dash is on running to get this food, son.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.760]   - I want a Big Mac, let me dash out.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.680]   - You got seven Big Macs, I'll take 'em.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:18.320]   - Why do dogs-- - That sounds so horrible.
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.920]   - Top dog questions, why do dogs eat grass?
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:23.560]   Do dogs dream, why do dogs how?
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:24.440]   You know, I was really disappointed
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:26.840]   that Pope did not say dogs go to heaven.
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.600]   That was wrong, the top.
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:29.560]   - Have you seen the movie?
[01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:33.120]   - Donations donate to ALS, donate to Ebola.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:34.920]   I did that search, donate to breast cancer, donate to Ebola.
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.080]   - You should not donate to Ebola, it has a terrible virus.
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:40.280]   You should donate against Ebola.
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:41.760]   - Yeah, no wonder there's a problem.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.560]   People keep donating to Ebola.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:44.400]   - That's terrible to say.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.080]   - It doesn't need your money.
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:49.040]   If you do not donate to me, I will give you Ebola.
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:52.240]   I have Ebola, and I want my donations.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.080]   - Okay, this is it, we're gonna wrap it up.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:57.400]   How to questions, how to airdrop.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.680]   - Hello Apple. - 'Cause no one can figure that out.
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:01.400]   - Oh, now there's two different versions of it.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.160]   - That's a very confusing example right there.
[01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:05.440]   That's a problem, how to contour, what's that?
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.480]   Is that something, when is that?
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.400]   Contour, is that something the kids are doing?
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.840]   How to vote, how do I vote?
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.840]   How to kiss, how to craft, how to what block, color block.
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.240]   I don't know what that is.
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:22.400]   I'm not a crafty kind of guy.
[01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:23.920]   - Do you know what the best part about this is?
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:24.760]   - What?
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:25.880]   - Someone's gonna be making videos
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:28.040]   for all these trying to grab YouTube clips.
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.000]   - Uh huh.
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.280]   - 'Cause now we know what the top search terms are, don't we?
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.400]   - Right. - Yep.
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.560]   Natural events, places on Google Maps.
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:40.160]   The number most searched place on Google Maps, Walmart.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:43.840]   Then Starbucks, then Target, then McDonald's.
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.880]   See who says they're not eating at McDonald's anymore.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:49.240]   Best recipes, chicken recipes, then meatloaf,
[01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:52.480]   banana bread, pancake, and chili.
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:55.760]   And the number one podcast, what a surprise.
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:58:57.640]   - Cereal. - Cereal.
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:01.120]   Followed by Stone Cold Steve Austin, startup,
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:02.640]   John Bachelor, Shane and friends,
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.320]   True Detective, Night Vale, Ask Women, Tim Ferris, Strange.
[01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.000]   Can I go more than 10?
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:08.960]   Can I have another 10?
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.800]   No.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:12.560]   - Everybody knows where you already are, Leo.
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:13.480]   They don't need to search for you.
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:14.320]   - Nightvills are good.
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.240]   - Nightvills are great.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:16.080]   - That's good.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:16.920]   All of those are good podcast.
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:17.760]   - Yeah, I'm not gonna knock it.
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:19.120]   - No cereal.
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.880]   - Everybody loves cereal.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:21.720]   - Who did it?
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.040]   - Everybody knows, keep listening.
[01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:24.920]   (laughing)
[01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:26.000]   It's like, that's stuff like that
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.560]   is like the best gimmick in the world.
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.640]   I'm gonna tell you a tale that has no answer.
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.920]   There's a Sony hack.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:32.760]   Who did it?
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:33.600]   - We don't know.
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:34.440]   - Go on, yeah.
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:35.280]   - Oh, your mom.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:36.120]   - Endings are hard.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.760]   If you don't have to do one.
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.360]   - Yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:40.200]   - All right, there you go.
[01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.600]   The top charts, this is all into Google's website.
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:44.920]   The 2014 research, trillions of times,
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:46.200]   what do these searches say about us?
[01:59:46.200 --> 01:59:47.920]   They don't say what they say about us.
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:48.760]   They just say what they are.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:49.600]   You decide.
[01:59:50.440 --> 01:59:53.600]   - Anything else to talk about?
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:56.480]   Sony hack, we already decided that it was Michael.
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:57.760]   What is it, Michael Mann?
[01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:58.600]   - Michael Mann.
[01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.440]   - Michael Mann.
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:00.280]   - Okay. - Black hat.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:03.560]   He might have got some help from Thor.
[02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:04.680]   - His hacker.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.520]   - He put the hammer down.
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.360]   He put the hammer down.
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:09.920]   - I think that's it.
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:11.160]   I think we can wrap this sucker up.
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:13.400]   I think we have now covered the entire spectrum
[02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:16.800]   of great tech stories as we begin the new year
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:20.280]   with two great tech journalists.
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:23.200]   We love you, Jason Stell, sixcolors.com.
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.080]   - Thanks, Leo.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:25.960]   - Spelled out S-I-X.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:30.440]   And of course, Owen J. J. Stone, oh, doctor.
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:33.040]   Ben Thompson was gonna join us today from Stretecory.
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:34.640]   We apologize he wasn't here.
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:36.240]   He wasn't feeling well.
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:38.240]   We'll get Ben on next week or soon.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.600]   And don't forget, our coverage of CES is all week long,
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:44.800]   nonstop, wall to wall, no, it's not.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:47.560]   But we will have a lot of coverage.
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:48.720]   Do we have a week ahead?
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:53.280]   Mike Elgar will be doing that on TNT, 10 a.m. Pacific,
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:56.960]   1 p.m. Eastern time, 1,800 UTC, Monday through Friday.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.560]   Coverage begins there, but we'll have coverage
[02:00:58.560 --> 02:00:59.520]   throughout our shows.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.480]   A very special home theater geeks this week
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:04.920]   with Scott Wilkinson, visiting all the major TV players
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:06.680]   to see what's new in TVs.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:10.080]   Father Robert Ballisare, he's going to showstoppers tonight.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:11.720]   That'll be our first special.
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:13.680]   It'll come out tomorrow, but he's gonna look to search
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:15.160]   the show floor for interesting stuff.
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:17.080]   And of course, Dick Bitti Bartolo de Giz was,
[02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:20.000]   he looks for the silliest, weirdest, oddest,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.440]   even close to all the weird small booths.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:24.760]   I think by doing that, we cover the waterfront.
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.200]   We cover the waterfront.
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:28.040]   Oh, and what are you gonna do this week?
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:29.600]   Anything fun?
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:31.160]   - I'm actually gonna do some work this week
[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:33.040]   'cause I take the month of December offside.
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:34.880]   Do no work whatsoever. - That's so great.
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.200]   So you feel rested?
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.840]   - I owe Lisa an email, Lisa, I'm so sorry.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:41.760]   I'll have to, one day afternoon-ish,
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:44.800]   you will get an email from me 'cause I need to respond to you.
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.080]   And it is great not to work.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:46.920]   I like not working.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.440]   If I could get paid to sit here and look cute, I would.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:50.600]   - We will pay you.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:52.240]   We will pay you to sit there and look cute.
[02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:53.080]   - Okay, I have nothing.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:57.400]   - I have money in my pocket and I am prepared to throw it at you.
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:59.320]   - That's why I got all these singles over the road.
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.600]   - Oh, I mean, I'm here.
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:02.040]   - What are you gonna strip club tonight?
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.200]   What is that all about?
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.960]   - I'm a teddy bear, they paid for this.
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.880]   - That's your money.
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:09.920]   - You earned that money, they put that in your jock strap.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:13.000]   - Before you go, will you do the shmoney dance for me?
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.720]   - No, I'm not doing the shmoney dance for you.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.320]   I'm not adding up loop on the internet.
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.240]   I know better, I know better.
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.440]   And you know, you're so lucky you put the Elmo one
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:23.840]   'cause that song has very graphic love to pop it.
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:25.360]   And if you would have picked any other song,
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.880]   it was a good definition.
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:29.640]   - Shmoney, down here, snow, smack 'em.
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:32.080]   - We're gonna send you a case of delicious cream corn
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:33.800]   in your very own ham.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.240]   All for being on the show.
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:36.080]   Thank you everybody.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:36.920]   - If you can.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:37.760]   - If you can.
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:40.000]   (laughing)
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.320]   - Yeah, hold on, hold on.
[02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.200]   - Why you, I got you.
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:45.680]   (laughing)
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:47.800]   - If you can't watch live and it is fun to watch live,

[02:02:58.520 --> 02:02:59.360]   - It was a pleasure.
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:02.000]   - Jason Howell, honestly could not have done it
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.280]   without everybody's impact.
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.440]   - Thank you for all of those.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:05.280]   - Thank you for all of those.
[02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.560]   - Yeah, 'cause he wasn't here all week, all year.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.880]   - So thank you, Jason, I appreciate that.

[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.920]   We don't do an official twit app, we don't have to,

[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:53.520]   Tickets at twit.tv.
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:55.280]   I'm Leo Laport, thanks for joining us.
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:56.800]   We'll see you next week, another twit.
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:58.160]   - It's in the can.
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:00.080]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:00.920]   Off-slap.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:03.760]   (audience clapping)
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:05.920]   (upbeat music)
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:06.920]   - Thanks for having me, guys.
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.600]   - Always a pleasure, you look great in there.
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:10.080]   Look at that gangsta.
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:11.120]   - I know, next time.
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:13.480]   - I mean, he's got the little tilt on the hat.
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:14.880]   Should I do this in that, Leo?
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.200]   - That's 'cause my hat's too big, I can't, my dad's head.
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:20.440]   If I put this on like this, it's just,
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.480]   I look like a cowboy.
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.320]   - How about this?
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.960]   - I don't know, or like a FBI agent.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.800]   Oh, now you look like a locker.
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:29.060]   (laughing)
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:32.200]   Or a farmer.
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:33.880]   (laughing)
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:35.080]   - Got some sheep in the back for it.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:36.480]   - Where did you get that hat from?
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:38.280]   - Isn't that awesome?
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:40.760]   - What, who even makes a hat like that?
[02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:41.600]   What is the purpose?
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.120]   - Oh, this one's even better, you wanna see this one?
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:46.840]   - I got the whole collection here,
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:49.280]   so I could be ready for anything.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.880]   (laughing)
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:51.840]   - I got some more hats for you.
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:54.640]   - So those are, that's for the rostahair, obviously,
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.880]   'cause that's like a rostah hat.
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.280]   - I need dreads coming out of this.
[02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:58.680]   - Dreds and raised around the hat.
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:00.040]   - And this is the Amish hat.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.080]   I was doing a little like--
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:04.760]   - Oh yeah, gonna raise a barn, gonna turn some butter.
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:06.120]   - I like this, this is good.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:06.960]   That's like yours, I would.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:07.800]   - There you go.
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.800]   - Yeah, there you go.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:10.640]   - That's a nice hat.
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:12.560]   - It's a nice hat, it's got a brim.
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:16.280]   - Well, this studio is not lit for you to wear a hat, though.
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.120]   - No.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.680]   - You're all, like a man of mystery.
[02:05:18.680 --> 02:05:23.000]   - So it's better to have hats without brims like this.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.040]   I should've done a show, the whole show like this.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:26.360]   - Oh man, yeah.
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.720]   - I got my head shaved and then I got it leatherized.
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:31.240]   - It accentuates the egg shape of your head.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:32.240]   (laughing)
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:34.720]   - I'll tell you what, being a pilot is a very hard
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:36.320]   and technical skill to do.
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:39.160]   You got thousands of hours, hundreds of hours to learn,
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:41.560]   but you putting that hat on just the aviation back.
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:42.400]   - 300 years.
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:43.480]   (laughing)
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:45.800]   - Way back, way back, way quiet.
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:48.160]   I'm hunting rabbits.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.160]   I'm a footwoods ball too, wasn't he?
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:52.040]   (laughing)
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:52.880]   Show title.
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:56.160]   - Oh, wait a minute, I got a Jane hat.
[02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:57.760]   (sighing)
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:59.280]   (sighing)
[02:05:59.280 --> 02:06:01.160]   - What are you doing with all these hats?
[02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:03.840]   - I have thousands, you haven't been out here lately.
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:04.680]   - I know.
[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:05.520]   - I got comments.
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:07.120]   - I become the Howard Hughes of hats.
[02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:08.360]   (laughing)
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.440]   I've been collecting hats like crazy.
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:11.720]   This one is-- - You're preparing
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:13.160]   for this day.
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:14.560]   - I must've known somehow.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:15.960]   - Oh no, there we go.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:17.040]   (laughing)
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:17.880]   Now we're--
[02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:18.720]   - I can be in Bob's burgers.
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:20.160]   - That is the one you have to wear to bed.
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.280]   This is, that's your bed time.
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.840]   - You know, I will actually wear this to bed.
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:25.320]   I will wear this to bed.
[02:06:26.200 --> 02:06:28.080]   - That's a great idea.
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.520]   Lisa's not too happy with this,
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:31.680]   so I might as well just go all the way.
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:34.160]   - Does this stuff never get posted anywhere?
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:35.360]   'Cause this is gold, man.
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:36.720]   This is gold. - Comedy, gold.
[02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.480]   - You need, the special speed needs to have
[02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:41.720]   like the special like-- - I briefly had a Mohawk.
[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:44.560]   Wow, I got a lot of them.
