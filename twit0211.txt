[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.480]   Well, at least the stuff that I think is interesting or maybe that I just happened to notice in passing.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.840]   Joining us today in studio, very glad to have an old colleague.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.560]   She's young, but she's been with us a long time.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.840]   Former web producer for Call for Help Tech TV, employee now.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.120]   Intern, you were an intern?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.760]   Intern.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.400]   You never got paid?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.080]   I got paid, but not your best.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.440]   25 a day.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   Enough to pay for your best.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.000]   But you're lunching a bus fare.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.720]   And now an actual employee at CNET.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   What's your title at CNET?
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.920]   I'm an associate editor.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160]   I review cell phones and Bluetooth headsets.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.280]   And she was just in the area and I said, Nicole, you're going on the show.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.520]   I was surprised.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.200]   Because we need some female pulkertude to balance out John C. Devorak and Dwight Silverman.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.640]   Dwight Silverman, of course, from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   Hello there.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.560]   And a great friend of the show.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.960]   And actually somebody who does some work.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   Unlike me.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.880]   And found all the stories you're going to hear today on the show.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.080]   I just drag and drop.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   That's all I do, Leo.

[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.520]   And I actually, even when you're not on the show, I'm going to a shameful secret.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   I'm going to reveal here.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.360]   I always go to your link blog because you basically link to all the best stories of the week.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.040]   So I just copy everything there.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.200]   I do it for you, Leo.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   Thank you.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   I knew you did.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.240]   So here John C. Devorak couldn't do the show without him at the channel Devorak.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120]   Is that a contract you want me to sign, John?
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.600]   You're holding up a dummy contract.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.960]   I'd have it made if you signed this.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   You don't.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960]   You don't.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   Me, baby.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.040]   We're good to have all of you aboard.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.040]   We're going to talk about the week's tech news starting with.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.000]   I don't know if you saw it yesterday on Google, the flying saucer on the Google logo.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.400]   I love those Google doodles that they do.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   But yesterday.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   You're doing more.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   More than before.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   They are.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.760]   I saw the Michael Jackson one when it was his birthday.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   They did his shoes.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   Yes, they did.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   It was doing like the moonwalk.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   That's cool.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.440]   But you know, there's some controversy because Google, you know, chooses to honor some things
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   but not other things.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.520]   That's true too.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.800]   People say, well, why aren't you on?
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   I don't know.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   I can't remember what they don't honor.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.080]   But why aren't you honor Ramadan but not Martin Luther King's birthday or whatever it is.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.680]   But this one was just weird.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.880]   It was a UFO and it was beaming up the O in Google in the Google logo.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.680]   And then on the, I think it was a Google blog or it was a Google Twitter.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.640]   It was a Google Twitter, Twitter.com/Google.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.600]   They had a very cryptic numeric sequence, which was obviously encoded.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:15.160]   If you Twitter.com/Google and you go back a little ways, you'll see this 1.12.12, 25.15.21.18.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.160]   I mean, they're giving it away.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.040]   They're even giving you the word, the word things.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.600]   And then they have a link to a twit pick, which might be a little bit of a hint.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.040]   Oh, it's a no, it's a twit pick of the of the Google Doodle with the logo.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.200]   But that's just that's grade school cryptography.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.240]   That was it was the letters of the alphabet.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.680]   Yeah, it's just number and letter substitution.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.840]   Did you figure it out Dwight?
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.320]   No, Mr. Grade School Crypto.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.240]   It said Microsoft sucks.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.920]   Lotus ain't done.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.720]   Windows ain't done till Lotus won't run is what it said.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.640]   It said all your O's are belong to us.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.440]   Which is in reference to the all your base are belong to us.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.840]   Yes, exactly.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.640]   And finally, after, it took a while because there was a lot of speculation.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.880]   In fact, if you click the link, because always those doodles have a link, it went to it's
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.560]   searched into the Google search on unexplained phenomenon.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.800]   It really didn't.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.880]   And of course, the first first item on an explain phenomena was a article about the mysterious
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.000]   Google Doodle and what could it possibly mean?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.480]   Some wasn't very helpful.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.880]   I'm kind of around about it.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.480]   It turns out, I don't know why Google honored this.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.200]   It is the 20th anniversary of that game.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.240]   The game where the all your base are belong to us.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.240]   This is so strange.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.000]   At least no, I like it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.320]   It's kind of nerdy in a way, right?
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.200]   They should do a daily thing.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   Daily mystery.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   A daily mystery.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   Ooh.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   Go ahead, Dwight.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.120]   I don't know if I, you know, Google hadn't confirmed this.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:03.400]   The article that pulls the zero wing theory comes out of the telegraph UK.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.720]   And they don't talk to anybody who says, yeah, that's what it has to be though.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.840]   It was, yes, say, but it has to be.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.560]   September 5th, 1989, zero wing comes out.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.760]   The Twitter has to be, but what I like is the playfulness here.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.560]   And it's not tied to any big holiday.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.360]   I mean, who wants to commemorate the 20th anniversary of zero wing after all?
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   I would like to see the new.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.360]   All your base.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.160]   If that's what it is, I'm glad they did it.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.560]   But until they say it, I'm skeptical.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.800]   It's a very, so you don't think it's that?
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   Well, it may be that, but I want to see.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   I don't think they should say it.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.520]   They should, they should leave us like, they should leave it a mystery.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   Never tell us.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520]   Never tell us.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   Like the end of the sopranos.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   Right.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.480]   What did, what the hell was that?
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.280]   They didn't know themselves.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   They just finished it.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   We're done.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   We're done.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   You figure it out.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.440]   Whatever you think.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.000]   And now, Matt Weiner, who was a writer at Nussel's last couple of seasons is writing
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.360]   that show, Mad Men, which I love, but it pretty much every scene in Mad Men ends like the
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.160]   last scene in the sopranos.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.080]   Somebody wanders on every episode.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   No, every scene.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.800]   The show is the most cryptic show in history.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   Yes.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   It is cryptic.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.160]   It's like, huh?
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.840]   I think it must be a style that I just did.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.040]   I'm not seeing this season's admin as good as the past.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.680]   Oh, I like it.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680]   I'm a Mad Men fan.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.520]   I mean, I like it because I like the, you know, the period, the period is what I like.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   They do such detail.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.240]   The style is also.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.000]   They've reproduced the periods with such detail.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.120]   Yeah, but I think the story's going nowhere this year.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120]   Well, that's the style.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.640]   It usually starts out slow.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   Admin starts out kind of, you know, you're always going, where is this going?
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.520]   And then by about mid season, it picks up last year.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   A lot of people had the same complaint.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.120]   Where did you first heard it?
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.120]   Hopefully.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.920]   I'm the head of Mad Men, Leo.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   I don't know why.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   I just heard one from Twitter.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.520]   Like everyone's over friends were talking about it.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.160]   Everything now, the first time you hear about it, well, maybe just you and me.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   Well, I guess.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.520]   The first thing I hear about anything is on Twitter.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.040]   In fact, if I want to know what's going on in the world, it used to be, I would wake
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.640]   up to my clock radio set to KCBS, the news channel in San Francisco.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.400]   And that's how I, you know, I would know.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.960]   Ten, ten wins used to say that.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   Remember in New York City, they'd say, give us 20 minutes.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   We'll give you the world.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.440]   Now I just go to Twitter and I see what's happening.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.680]   I never have heard of Mad Men otherwise because it's on AMC, which I've never watched.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   Never watched.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.680]   And so.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.920]   Probably was HBO didn't pick it up.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   Yeah, that's.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   Which is, was nuts.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   HBO made a big mistake.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   Yeah, they walked away from it.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   Well, which is weird because they got nothing.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.120]   They got true blood.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.120]   That's good.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.120]   Don't you like fans?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.760]   Like one of these things every season.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.440]   Vampires, they're the hot thing.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.400]   They're so hot, man.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   They're so hot.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   Do you see, speaking of hot, do you see the viral video stealing 20 minutes?
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.160]   23 MacBook Pros, 14 iPhones, nine iPods, 31 seconds.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.920]   I think that was well planned.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.600]   It was a very well planned.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.840]   Well, I guess they must have known that there was a camera.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.240]   They must have known that there was cameras.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.760]   Because they're wearing hoods and everything.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.960]   I just think that bug me about it was they got no power adapters.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.880]   They took all these devices.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.880]   Fire.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.520]   And I can't go and get the adapters.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.520]   Get the adapters.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.000]   If you're watching carefully, you know, you, it's funny.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.720]   The video that's on YouTube is from channel 6 ABC.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.400]   They make two and a half minutes out of this 31 second video.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:30.800]   But you see the guard walking around, you know, typical, typical Apple store.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   Guards walking around.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   It's quiet.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.440]   Guys, guys throw a brick through the window.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440]   It must have been planned.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   I mean, they were good.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.120]   They, oh man, they're making a whole story out of this.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.880]   This is ridiculous.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880]   Local news.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.880]   Local news.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   Exclusive.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.880]   The robberies in the world.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.880]   Look at this.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   Well, it's because they got this great video, right?
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   Right.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   And the reporter gets more and more breathless and outrageous as it goes on.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.880]   I mean, by the end of it, he's almost yelling.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.600]   He's like, yeah, lo and order heists or something.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.640]   Your are Bob Toe witness exclusive firsthand surveillance footage of the spectacular smash
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.640]   and graph.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.640]   The same.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.640]   The Apple computer store.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   Exclusive.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   Prominent shopping center in Ephsham.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   It's after closing.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.040]   The security guard is seen making his rounds in the store.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.880]   But at 2.05 a.m., thieves hit the store as plain class 4 with a blunt object.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   Oh, they're good.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.520]   They bring it shattering down with one strike.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.440]   Then, with precision timing, the five mills enter the store and clean house like there's
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   no tomorrow.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.400]   Each one went in different directions.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   Get the adapters.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   They left the adapters.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   Pre-gram.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.240]   In all, they took 23.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.000]   They didn't realize that the adapters cost more than the machines.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.840]   And all in 31 seconds flat.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.640]   Later, the security guard is seen running.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.640]   Oh, good job.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640]   Well, brother.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   Hey, what's happening?
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.640]   He's hiking up his pants.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.640]   What were you doing, dude?
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.440]   So apparently the security guard was on his pee break.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.440]   They timed it really well.
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.120]   They must have scoped that out.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   He's very consistent.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.880]   Either that or he's in on the deal.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.720]   Either that always goes on the pee break.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   I think the exact same time.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.520]   Yeah, he's like, you know, that was well done.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   And they were covered.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   They must have known there were cameras in there.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   Oh, for sure.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.480]   I think it would have been better if they were wearing nicks and masks.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   That's still my favorite outfit.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.440]   Yeah, that's a good outfit when you're going to steal something wearing nicks and masks.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.000]   So is there any news this week at all?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.800]   It seemed kind of dull this week.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.200]   We've done two whole stories.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.880]   All right, here's another one.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.680]   Microsoft gets to continue to sell Microsoft Word.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.680]   That's a big story.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.680]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.000]   Oh, John, you just started hard to please this.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   That's tough audience.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Oh, I guess that's news.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.880]   Gmail fails for two hours.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.360]   That was big breaking news.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   It was.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.480]   I mean, if you follow if you follow what Nicole was saying, that Twitter is your source of
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.040]   news, then that was the biggest story of the year.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.400]   It's still annoying though.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.480]   After like an hour, I saw people saying shut up already.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   I know Gmail's down.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   Well, it was down.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   It wasn't leave.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.840]   It was down for a month, purchase.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   Say again.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.040]   The question is, though, it was down for a month.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.360]   Let me do that again.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   Say again.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.520]   One, two, three.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.120]   Okay, Dwight, you first.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.680]   Right.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.040]   It was down only if you had the web version.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:22.280]   If you were looking at iPhone or on a client and IMAP or pop, it worked fine.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.480]   If it's if you were trying to use the web version that it was down.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   Right.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   So some people didn't know.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.200]   Some people said, oh, my Gmail's not down.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.440]   Okay, John.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.040]   I can't get worked up about the story.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.920]   I just thought they were going down for a couple of hours.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.640]   I mean, I've had my email go up and down occasionally.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   That's the thing.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.960]   It's not abnormal for email servers to go down.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.040]   I guess it's only big news of your company and you relied on it.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.560]   But companies that happens all the time.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.120]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.960]   It's kind of stupid if you're a company and you're--
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   That's true, too.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.480]   You've outsourced all-- do companies do that?
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.960]   They say, oh, yeah, we don't need to use email.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   We'll just use Gmail.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.400]   We don't have to have a mail server.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   Let's just run Gmail.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.480]   Was it only Gmail that Google Docs work fine?
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   Google Docs work fine.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.480]   Everything else worked fine.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   Okay.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.000]   Google, I thought, handled it pretty well.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.600]   They have a status page and they were very quick to put on the status page.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   We know it's down.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   We're working on it.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   We should have it up in a couple of hours.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.120]   It does make me wonder how wide is Gmail used?
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.840]   How many users do Gmail actually have?
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.440]   It's the number-- I think it's 149 million users.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   Okay.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.160]   It's the number two or three after Yahoo.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.920]   Number three after Hotmail, Yahoo!
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.680]   It's as big as Yahoo! or Hotmail, right?
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.680]   Yahoo!
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.680]   Yahoo!
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   Yahoo!
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.680]   And yet, if Yahoo!
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.680]   went down for 100 minutes, would it be the biggest story?
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   No, but nobody would talk about it.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   It would be like--
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   I wonder if this even happened.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   It might have--
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:45.840]   Earlier this week, Yahoo!
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.160]   Man went down for five days.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160]   No one noticed.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   It's the one you.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.720]   Because the geeks use Gmail.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.280]   Yes, that's the problem.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   That's the--
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.880]   I wonder what the percentage of Gmail users on Twitter is compared to the rest of the
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   world.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   It's not thinking.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.680]   Yeah, they're probably more likely to be on Gmail than they are on Yahoo.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   And Hotmail's right now.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   It's the team right only.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.200]   No, no geek.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.640]   Self-respecting geek would be, you know, sexy geek one, two, three at Hotmail.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.640]   Hotmail.com.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.640]   That's just not a good title.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   That's not a good title.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   Unless it's your spam email address.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   Right.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.560]   You know, you don't follow your spam.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.680]   Did I mention that the Microsoft Word can be sold again?
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   That I mentioned?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.160]   Well, I got one.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.200]   Here's a story that's kind of amusing.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.640]   Microsoft calling on thousands to host their own Windows 7 parties.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.520]   What?
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   This is so ridiculous.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.040]   Go to HouseParty.com.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.840]   And apparently Microsoft isn't the only company that uses this as a service.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.680]   HouseParty.com.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.720]   Other groups like the Mexican avocado growers.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:55.800]   You use HouseParty.com to create to, I don't know why you would do this.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.600]   Maybe there's a whole subculture of people holding House Parties for commercial product
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   releases.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.920]   Or Taurus as a game day house party?
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.480]   Ford Taurus, game day house party, sponsored by Ford.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.000]   So here it is, Windows 7 launch party global sponsored by Microsoft.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.840]   Apply now.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.360]   And you go in here and you sign up and look at the prize.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:22.400]   You could win a $750 computer.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   It's such.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.160]   I'm going to throw a party.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.360]   I'm going to, I won the brand and I'll throw a party.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   They should do Microsoft's.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.440]   They had any brains, which apparently they don't anymore.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.840]   They would say, look, you throw a party and you get at least 40 people or whatever.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.760]   And you document the party and send us the invoice and we'll send you, you know, the
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.760]   30, 40 bucks ahead.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.920]   Well they do send the host a copy of Windows.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.920]   Big deal.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.560]   Invite a Costco for less money than you're just going to cost you to throw a party.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.600]   Well I wonder, I mean, what is the requirement?
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.120]   Do you have to have a certain number of people show up?
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.760]   Yeah, can you invite like your mom and that be a party?
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   I don't know.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.880]   I'm having my mom over and we're going to have a party.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.840]   You'll be a party in my pants.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.480]   Exactly.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.520]   You'll be assisted by House Party, the world's leading party organizer.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.240]   Pick a theme, then upload photos and videos, chat with other hosts, blog your experience
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.320]   and download fun favors from your personal House Party page.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.040]   No purchase necessary.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.320]   It is subject in all respects to the complete official rules available at Houseparty.com
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.400]   or Suic, it's kind of a sweepstakes, but it sounds like you don't really have to do
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.200]   anything.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.120]   You could just have a party, you could, you could have a party in your pants.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:46.440]   It doesn't say, as long as you don't send them the video, it doesn't say that you have
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.880]   to, you know, how to enter during the entry period, go to the host section, drawing, they're
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.240]   going to have a drawing, which means one person gets a $750 computer.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:02.200]   Oh no, 64 people are potential prize winners from all the eligible entries.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.160]   What is a $750 computer?
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.920]   Yeah, tell us what it is.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.120]   Don't just say it's a PC that's worth $750.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   Is it a running at an atom chip in Unix?
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.320]   It's probably a piece of crap, yeah.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.600]   Publicity general conditions, it doesn't say you actually have to have anybody show up.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   At the party, but nobody showed up.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.600]   Okay, all hosts will receive one limited signature edition Windows 7 Ultimate, one deck of playing
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.560]   cards with a Windows 7 desktop design.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   Wow.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.200]   One, one, one puzzle with a Windows 7 desktop design, one poster with a Windows 7 desktop
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.480]   design, 10 tote bags.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.640]   You get 10 tote bags also included in the USA Party packs, one package of streamers for
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.960]   decoration, one package of balloons for decoration, one tabletop centerpiece.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   I'm having a party.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.840]   I'm going to do this.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.440]   We'll have it right here.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.440]   Oh, we'll have it right here.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.280]   The Twit College, one package of Windows 7 napkins.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   Oh yeah.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.360]   Now you're convincing me.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.720]   Oh, I'm joining.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   I'm doing this.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.680]   We're going to have a party right here.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.480]   There's a coffee shop in Houston that's kind of gotten a lot of notoriety for being kind
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.000]   of the web 2.0 central coffee grounds.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.880]   They've actually been written up in a few stories about businesses using Twitter.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.360]   The guy who runs it has applied for, to do one of these, and he wants to make a big
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   deal out of it.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.240]   So, they're businesses who are actually taking this seriously.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.760]   But yeah, I want to do it just to get the napkins.
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.760]   I don't want napkins.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.040]   It does 7 napkins.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.240]   I'm signing up right now.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.720]   Oh, gosh.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.240]   I can use Facebook Connect to do it.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.240]   That simplifies.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.320]   I've read and agreed to the terms and conditions.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.520]   I'm reading and agreeing to the terms and conditions.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.040]   And now, I guess it's probably going to spam my Facebook account right now.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.680]   You can't sign up with your Windows Live account.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   It's huge, right?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.680]   It doesn't sound.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.880]   All events from Houseparty.com will be...
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.680]   Houseparty.com will be able to create and modify Facebook events on your behalf without
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.920]   your approval each time.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   Sure, why not?
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.920]   It's only Facebook.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   Do you have to be a Facebook person to do this?
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.120]   No, it's just to allow RSVPs.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.480]   It's just a quick and easy way to do it.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.640]   Let me see if you...
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   Other ways to do it.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   Facebook Connects.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.960]   That's the Windows 7 party.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   This is it.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   I'm getting the Windows 7 party.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   I'm getting one too because I need those napkins.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   I want streamers.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:23.960]   I want balloons.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:30.360]   I was going to say that they have special themes they want you to do.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.560]   And you can choose from one of four.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.600]   Photo, Palooza, Media, Mania, Setting Up With Ease.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.000]   That's mine.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And Family Friendly Fun.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.400]   I don't understand.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.920]   Oh, here's a party address.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.080]   I'm going to put in my address here.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.240]   Cannot ship to a PO box.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.320]   Okay, I'll put in this studio address.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.440]   Oh, this is so exciting.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440]   When should we have...
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440]   I guess you should do it on Twitch.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.960]   We'll do it on a Twitch for that week.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.280]   Yeah, you have to do it sometime between October 22nd and 29th.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   It would have to be...
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   Sunday for that.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.720]   Yeah, that'll be perfect.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.040]   It's a very special Twitch.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.080]   All right, I'm going to finish the sign up.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.080]   I'm going to do it on Squarespace.com.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.800]   Before we do all of that, I want to pause briefly to mention my good friends at Squarespace.com.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.400]   A great place to sit up.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:30.440]   Your website, your blog, your photo site, your Windows House Party site.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.440]   Go to Squarespace.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.640]   That's where I'm going to set up mine.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.240]   I'm going to do it on Squarespace.com.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.120]   Go to squarespace.com/twit right now.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.760]   You can try it free.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.920]   See how you like it?
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.840]   I think you're going to be blown away by how easy it is to set up a site and how great
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.560]   the sites look.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:55.560]   They have incredible templates to start with, but then using Ajax, simple drag and drop to
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.440]   resize columns, you can move it around.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.160]   Great social media integration.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.320]   There's an iPhone app, incredible statistics.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.920]   You're just going to love it.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.200]   Import all your data from Moveable Type, WordPress, Typepad or Blogger and export it so you're
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.200]   not trapped.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   It's not a roach motel.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.580]   No, 14 days free.
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.280]   No credit card necessary when you go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.560]   And I'm going to set up my Windows House Party site.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.920]   So next week I'll tell you where my Windows House Party site is on Squarespace.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.080]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.140]   By the way, if you decide to sign up for Squarespace, you get 10% off.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.920]   This is great software, great hosting.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.960]   It's designed to handle any amount of traffic.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.280]   You can get Doug/Dotted, Twitted.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.160]   Doesn't matter.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.240]   Squarespace can handle it.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:51.560]   And I'll call it Leo's House Party.squarespace.com or something like that.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.680]   And I'll have my House Party on Squarespace.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.160]   Do you have a personal blog, Nicole?
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.160]   Yeah, I do.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   What's your personal blog?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   It's not a Squarespace blog.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.160]   What?
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   Where is it?
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.160]   Sorry.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.720]   It's N-E-E-K-O-L-E.com.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.600]   That's not how you spell Nicole.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   No, I know.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.760]   Someone likes us.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   Someone else says no.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.840]   Oh, that's a cute sign.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.000]   I like that.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   What are you using?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.360]   I just want WordPress.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   You should try it.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   You should really try Squarespace.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   That's a story.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   WordPress story.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.360]   It's a word you just...
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.360]   Yeah, it's a word you just...
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   No, I haven't yet.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360]   Don't tell the world that.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   Don't tell the world that.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.360]   I didn't say that.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.360]   I didn't say that.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   I didn't say that.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.360]   I didn't say that.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360]   I didn't say that.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   Man, don't announce that.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]   Big deal.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.600]   The global was furious because...
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.440]   Well, he hadn't updated WordPress.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.800]   He was a couple of versions back.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.200]   There's a very big bug in WordPress that lets bad guys get in, spam your account, create
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.960]   phony administrator accounts so they can come back later.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.960]   Really delete data, trash it.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   I mean, just...
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.720]   He says, "I don't feel safe with WordPress.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.960]   Hackers broke in and took things."
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:01.280]   He says, "It feels to him like it did when he was a kid and his house got broken into."
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   I think that's probably his house.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.640]   I've had sites hacked before.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.800]   It does feel pretty awful.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   So you've got...
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:20.360]   Here's a guy who works for Rackspace, which is a service that lets you host your website
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.520]   and presumably you can do...
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.240]   They want you to do backups and he didn't have a backup for any of his...
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.240]   Oops.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240]   Any of his vlog.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.480]   Which he says he's talking to again, but you think Rackspace wouldn't have backed him
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   up on him.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:39.520]   Well, I'm not going to throw stones because I'm on SoftLayer and I had Evolved, which
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.440]   is a backup technique and I had all the stuff and it's just something had gone wrong and
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   hadn't backed up.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.760]   So when a bad guy put a PHP script in my site, I created the hole, by the way.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.800]   Foolishly, I allowed uploads to an open directory, bad mistake.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.240]   So he uploaded a script which I later found and I have called...
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   I didn't warn you Dwight.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   I have it called c9.php.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   There was a really interesting script.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.680]   So if you upload it, he could then execute it.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.720]   It does a lot of very clever things, looks through MySQL for passwords and stuff.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.200]   So he got in and he deleted a forum site.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.280]   He deleted a couple of things.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.040]   He deleted a blog.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.440]   We had Google caches and stuff, so we were able to get everything back.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.400]   The forum we were not able to.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.440]   I had to go back to my last backup, which was a couple of weeks ago.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.120]   But this is bad when the staff is really scary.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.000]   So what was this person?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I don't know.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   He sent me a note.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.440]   Gosh, I can't remember what country he was from.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.760]   He didn't know who I was.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.680]   He just sent me a note saying, "Hey, I found a hole in your site and I've trashed everything.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   I thought I let you know."
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.160]   It was nice of him.
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160]   So I sent him a note back.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   So what did you do that for?
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.360]   He said, "Well, you know, I just...
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360]   'Cause I could."
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.120]   He wasn't like a bad person.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.520]   Well, he was just really insane.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.520]   He just took a new site.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.520]   Not a bad person at all.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.800]   He trashed it pretty good.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:02.080]   It was just like somebody walking in your door, throwing the garbage around, kicking over some
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.640]   chairs and leaving.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.720]   And then calling you later and saying, "Hey, I did this to your house.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   You should probably take better care of it."
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.720]   Exactly.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.720]   What kind of person does that?
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   Exactly.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.320]   He said, "Hey, you left the back window open so I crawled in and trashed your house this
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.320]   morning."
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   Yeah, that doesn't...
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   I learned my lesson.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   But I have the script still, which is very interesting.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.160]   One of these days I thought maybe I'd go through it and show people how hackers work.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.400]   It's a script, Kitty.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.960]   It's not a hacker, obviously.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   But 2.8.4, make sure your WordPress is updated.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.800]   If you use WordPress.com, this was kind of interesting.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.240]   Matt Mullenweg, who was a...
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.960]   I believe created WordPress.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.960]   Yes.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   He created it.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.800]   He said, "I do not own WordPress.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.520]   It is an open source project.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   I'm not responsible for WordPress.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.400]   My company, Automatic, runs WordPress.com.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.400]   We never had the problem there."
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.720]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.280]   He almost disavowed.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.160]   He said, "WordPress.org is an open source project.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.520]   A lot of people work on it.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.960]   WordPress.com is safe."
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.240]   I thought that was kind of an interesting point of view to take on.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.800]   I always consider him the guy who created WordPress.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:15.560]   Anyway, if you have an updated do update, and these things happen all the time, although
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.480]   it seems like I update...
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.160]   One of the reasons WordPress is at 2.8.4 is because they do frequent security updates.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.160]   That's true.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.160]   At least they do that.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   Do you update...
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.760]   I mean, the new WordPress, if you've upgraded to 2.8, it will say there's a new version
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.240]   and it's a very one button upgrade.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.760]   It's actually very easy to upgrade.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.800]   You just click one button and it will do it for you.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.680]   So you should be doing it.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   Google has patented his homepage.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   What?
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   What?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680]   What?
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   What?
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   Google's homepage.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.920]   Because it's so patentable.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:55.600]   Apparently, well, somebody thinks it is and filed a patent application in March 2004.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.240]   It was approved on September 1.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.160]   The patent is for the simplicity of the homepage.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.600]   Well, then let's go back into the late '90s and take a look at the Yahoo page.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.080]   Which was pretty simple.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.840]   As prior art.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:20.360]   Graphical user... US United States patent 599-372.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.160]   Graphical user interface for a display screen of a communications terminal.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.760]   I love the archaic language that they use in this stuff.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.920]   Claim.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.000]   The ornamental design for a graphical user interface for a display screen of a commercial terminal
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.760]   is shown and described.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.360]   Approved.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.160]   Approved.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.640]   Huh.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.240]   Now, I got to say you're right.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.440]   It seems like there'd be prior art to a simple white page.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.720]   It looks like the page on my novel.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   I wonder if this has to do with Bing.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.280]   Do you think that this...
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.080]   Well, you know, but Microsoft's MS in live search was very simple too.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.320]   So Bing is actually complicated by comparison because it has the big photo.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.720]   Maybe Microsoft can patent a photo.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.000]   I have to say, I like that photo and you hover the mouse over different parts of it and there's
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.760]   little searches.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.240]   I like that.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.200]   It's their response to the Google Doodle, I think.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.400]   You go to that page, otherwise you would have no reason to go to that page.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.960]   You just use the search bar.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.120]   It changes daily, right?
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   There's got to be...
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:37.880]   I think there's going to be a little, maybe a war to get people to go to the page as opposed
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.080]   to just use the search bar.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.240]   Because nowadays, nobody ever uses a search bar.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.520]   Right, a little search field at the upper right of it.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.840]   So today, I don't know what that is.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.040]   It's a very close up, looks like an electron microscope photo.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:57.840]   But then if you move stuff around, oh, behold, one of the most pervasive life forms on Earth,
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.840]   can you guess what it is?
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.840]   This makes it kind of fun.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   You want to go there, right?
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.760]   Leo, you said you don't think people use the little search bar on the browser?
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.040]   No, I think they do, as what I'm saying, instead of going to the web page.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.840]   You can now go back and see homepage images and hotspots from the past week with our new
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   homepage archive.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.800]   However, you need to install Microsoft Silverlight to see.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.840]   And that's taught about a gratuitous requirement.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:27.200]   Well, if you install Silverlight, maybe we'll let you see our previous home pages.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.800]   Do people still use the "I'm feeling lucky" button?
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   This seems so...
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   No.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   Is it still on there?
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   Yeah, it's still on there.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.040]   Because nobody goes to the Google front page anymore, right?
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   Yeah, it seems so.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.840]   I use Google toolbar and I've started using Safari a lot more and I'm coming from a
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.920]   problem that there's no Google toolbar for Safari.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.440]   But the thing I like in Google toolbar is there's a button for searching just the site
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.480]   you're on at the time, which is really useful.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:30:01.560]   And I would love to have that button in the little search area on say Firefox or Safari.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.800]   That's one of the most useful buttons I think.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.680]   You know, I just use site colon in the site name, but that's a lot of extra typing.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   That's all it's doing, essentially.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   Right, right.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.680]   It does that for you.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:12.680]   I'm like...
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   I actually use Google Quick Search to a little, what do you call it, a utility?
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.120]   You can install the little application.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.840]   It's kind of like Quick Silver for the Mac.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   It was written by Alcor.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   It was the guy who wrote "Quick Silver."
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.400]   He now works at Google and he wrote...
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   So I use Quick Search.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   Do you like it?
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.560]   I quite like it.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   It's basically like "Quick Silver."
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.640]   Although not quite as feature rich yet, I have a feeling that's...
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.960]   Alcor no longer develops new features on "Quick Silver."
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.840]   I think he's put all of his energies into that.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   Good.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   Now I've installed...
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.640]   While we've been talking, I've installed Silverlight.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.640]   Ooh.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.640]   Ooh.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.000]   Why not you?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Now I can...
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.200]   This shield never runs fast again.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   How many...
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.040]   Anybody upgrade to Snow Leopard in the group here?
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040]   Yay.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   You have.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   Yes.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   Dwight now.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   Did you upgrade your flash?
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   Oh.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   Yes.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.160]   Yes, it did it the other day after I saw that story that there's a...
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.800]   They shipped it with an old version that had a...
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   They've done it the flash.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   They've done it the flash.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   Well, that's the big thing.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   I mean, it's not unusual.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.200]   In Apple's defense, they went gold just like a week or two after flash was updated.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.000]   So I understand why they wouldn't want to include the new version in the gold master
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.520]   because they had no time to test it.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:33.600]   But it's kind of unheard of to downgrade somebody's stuff to a less secure version and
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   not tell you.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   It's really bad.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.320]   So anybody who's using Snow Leopard out there...
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.320]   Was there a reason?
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   Like, is that...
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.320]   Well, because they...
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   Because the exploit was discovered and patched just two weeks before they went to gold master.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   So in Apple...
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.120]   Again, in Apple's defense, I could see why they might not include it.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.720]   But it is a little bit bad behavior to downgrade somebody.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.680]   Well, you know, in Snow Leopard, the web browser Safari runs in the 64...
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   It's a 64-bit application.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.880]   Yep, that's true.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.400]   And so if they're replacing the 32-bit in Leopard when you do the upgrade, they might
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   strip out all the plug-ins.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.200]   But here's something interesting.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.360]   There's no 64-bit version of Flash, right?
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.400]   And so how are they running a 32-bit version of Flash inside a 64-bit operating system
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.400]   and a 64-bit application?
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.280]   Microsoft has that exact problem with Windows.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.560]   If you run 64-bit Windows, you cannot run 64-bit IE if you want Flash.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   Right.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.840]   And you can't install the 32-bit plugin for Flash.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   Right.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.960]   And I get this call all the time because it's really confusing end users who, you know,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.600]   they shouldn't have to know 32 from 64.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.520]   But nowadays, everybody is selling 64-bit Windows.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.920]   That's kind of the default pre-installed.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.280]   And they try to run in an ed Explorer and Flash won't install.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.080]   They go, "I don't go, huh?
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.000]   What's going on here?"
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   So this maybe...
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I don't know if this is related.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.200]   I think Apple has figured out a way to run a 32-bit plugin within a 64-bit browser.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.720]   Well, they're running a 32-bit kernel in a lot on most of these things.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.720]   That's the default.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.720]   Right.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   Right.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   What is your...
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.160]   You know, we talked about this last week and I've kind of beaten this dead horse.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.320]   I'm not going to beat it anymore.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   But just...
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   I haven't talked to you about this.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.320]   What's your...
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.640]   One more whack at the horse.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.200]   Well, it's a leopard, not a horse.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   What?
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.200]   It's a leopard.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.480]   I was a little perturbed by the general media and all the Mac media, but even some of
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:30.000]   the general media like David Pogue and Walt Mossberg, David Pogue said this is a must-have
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   upgrade.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.200]   Everybody ought to run out and do it.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   And I thought...
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:39.000]   And he even said, "Anybody who says this is a service pack is a hater."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.120]   And I thought, "David, I don't think this is something everybody should run out and upgrade
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   to."
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.920]   And this is just one more reason why it was a bad idea to run out and upgrade.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.360]   Was he doing a vocal imitation of George Bush?
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.200]   Gonna run out?
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.360]   Gonna install it.
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   Must install it.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.840]   That's the other George Bush.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.520]   Oh, I don't do George W. Bush.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.240]   You see, you gotta say the dub.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.120]   Do you do a George W. Bush?
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.440]   No.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.360]   You might, Dwight, you're from the same area, the same neck of the woods.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.880]   I'm not gonna touch that.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:13.440]   I mean, it might might be a version of John Stewart's.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.400]   Oh, he did.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.200]   John Stewart is a fantastic George.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.000]   But it just seems like you're the force or against this kind of thing with a comment
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   like that.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Just...
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   I've found it very...
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.800]   And now this brings us to a story because the New York Times ombudsman, they have an ethicist.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   Is this typical of papers?
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.560]   Does the Chronicle have somebody like this?
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   Dwight?
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.120]   I don't think so, but some papers have had to do it because they're so influential.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.160]   So the Houston Chronicle doesn't?
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.400]   We have a...
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.440]   We had, for a while, a reader rep.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:57.640]   We are now kind of farming out questions to individual editors whose area...
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.640]   We have it.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   It falls in.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   And then you would publish a story or...
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   But we should look at a...
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.640]   So you would publish...
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.040]   If you felt there were a conflict, you would publish a story explaining...
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.640]   He had a blog and we would deal with it often in that blog.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.240]   It's because the New York Times calls it their public editor.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   I don't...
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.400]   Does this appear in the print edition or is it only online?
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.960]   I think it's in the print edition.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.400]   Yeah, it is.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.720]   So the story is...
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.280]   It's Clark Hoyt, the public editor.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.320]   The story is he works for The Times, too.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.000]   And apparently there were some complaints.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.720]   David Pogue, who was writing and reviewing Snow Leopard in a glowing fashion, by the way,
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:42.720]   happens to also write manuals and has a missing manual for Snow Leopard coming out soon.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.880]   And that seems to be a pretty parent conflict of interest because...
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.880]   I'd say.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.720]   Certainly he has some interest in Snow Leopard being a success.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.680]   I don't have that.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.120]   You know, I don't have a problem with the conflict.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.280]   It's really interesting to a point with the guy who writes books about a topic and he's
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.880]   really in love with the product, except for the fact that the New York Times, in particular...
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   I mean, Pogue, if he was writing for a computer magazine, it would be so what.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:17.640]   But the New York Times is so incredibly snooty about having all these ethical checklists
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.000]   that the fact that Pogue gets away with this is amazing to me.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.880]   He writes, "But it creates a tricky ethical terrain.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.880]   No Times journalist is in quite the same position as Pogue, reviewing products and simultaneously
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.160]   writing guides to them."
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.480]   He said he makes more money from the books than from The Times, as if that just...
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.040]   Oh, that's okay then.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.040]   Well, all right.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   Oh, yeah, okay.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   Fine.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   Okay, then keep doing that.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.040]   Pogue and his editors say they talk...
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.320]   I make more money as a hooker.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.800]   Oh, no.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.160]   I make more money selling cocaine, but that doesn't stop me from doing this show every
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   darn Sunday.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160]   Geez.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.960]   But Nicole, if you want me to hook you up just on the way out, just let me know.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:02.920]   Pogue and his editors say they talk frequently about how to deal with his varied interests,
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.120]   and the editors praised him as a straight shooter.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120]   And that's true.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:13.840]   He points out that he says, quote, "sabbaged Apple's Eye Movie '08 in his Times blog,
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.240]   blog, even as he was writing a missing manual for it."
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:24.800]   Ultimately, they decided this is not an issue, but they have said in future they probably
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   should say something about it in the article.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.480]   And they also say, "It's good The Times addressed the issue now.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.360]   Windows 7 is being released within a month.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.040]   Pogue is planning to review it.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.640]   The missing manual is already for sale."
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.600]   Yeah, he also...
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.760]   He actually started the missing manual series.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.760]   Right.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.920]   It's grown into quite an empire.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.720]   He also does the...
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   He does Windows 7.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.320]   I've got copies of his stuff here.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   He does OS 10.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.600]   Whenever there's a new one of those, he did Leopard.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.360]   He's done a switching to the Mac.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.680]   Copy if I'm wrong, but don't a lot of tech journalists do books on the side?
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.080]   I think you do, Dwight, don't you?
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   I do.
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.600]   I've written two tech books.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.360]   I've done one, a book with Larry Maggid on Windows Vista.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.320]   And I've written one about running Windows on the Mac that deals with virtualization
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   and bootcamp.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:22.800]   So it's the issue here because Pogue is also a reviewer.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.520]   He reviews the product and he sells a book about that same product.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.120]   Well, see, I'm a reviewer too.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.040]   Yeah, so I review them and I also write these books.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.040]   Right.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   Is there a solution?
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.320]   The way we've dealt with it, the way we've dealt with it at the Chronicle and the way
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:44.080]   that they are dealing with it in this case is their disclosing openly that he writes
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   these books.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.080]   Right.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.760]   I think if you read his stuff, he's pretty much an Apple fan boy, but he is a straight
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   shooter.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.600]   He'll lay it out if he doesn't like something.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.840]   I do the same thing.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.520]   You can't read any of my reviews and say that I'm looking at anybody's boots.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.840]   In fact, even in the books that I've written, I will say when I think that something is
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.840]   not a very good is an executed very well.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.040]   So I think so long as you're open about it and you're not, you're being straight about
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.880]   it, let the readers make up their own mind.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.400]   When we did the columns, whenever I write a column about Vista, whenever I would write
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:29.160]   about virtualization, we would put a disclosure at the bottom that I had written this book.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.840]   It was funny was that some people thought, "Oh, he's pimping his book at the bottom of
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:34.840]   his column."
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.840]   It does look like that.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.600]   It's not in his, it's not in his claimer.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   It's an ad.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   Right.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:44.840]   I haven't, I haven't made any money off those books, but you should put that available at.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.960]   I mean, in the remainder bin, disclaimer, but this is something that's going to come up
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.440]   more and more nowadays because there are, these lines are absolutely blurring.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.920]   God, you know, it's over.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.720]   Everything's corrupt now, so that wouldn't worry about it.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:04.560]   I don't think this is, well, it's funny because in past days saying, "Oh, but no, read my
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.560]   reviews.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   I've been critical.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   It wasn't a defense."
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.560]   Right.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.200]   I mean, that's new, that that's a defense that, "Well, you could read my reviews.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.200]   You could see I'm independent."
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.360]   I mean, I use the same defense, but I don't, but I don't, you know, I don't know.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.360]   It's...
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.360]   You know, here's what it is.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.400]   The guys, I mean, the folks probably writing makes more money on his books.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.840]   He probably makes a fortune on his books.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.240]   Of course, he uses the New York Times to leverage book sales so that that can't be a minor
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.240]   issue.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   Right.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.520]   And the fact that he does that, I think the Times has a complaint that's valid.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.800]   I mean, I don't think at the same time, they'd rather pay, you know, a pog less money, but
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:44.700]   then they pay a regular full-time reporter and get his content for a discount and let
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.120]   him go make money on the side on his own dime.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.960]   That's how New Media does it.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.600]   And I think, yeah, I think exactly what's happening right now.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.760]   I mean, he just likes to stick in prices.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.560]   Because these cheap bastards that run these newspapers don't pay people enough money,
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.960]   not to have to do books.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.960]   Right.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.160]   I mean, David's a good friend.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160]   I've known him for years.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.760]   I know he's ethical.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.320]   So here's the deal.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.880]   So since we have Dwight here and he just told us about his two books.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.840]   So I've got this thing here in front of me.
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.240]   It's a contract.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.720]   It's a dummy contract.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.760]   So I have to ask Dwight, do you sign the dummy contract?
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.800]   Um, that's enough.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.200]   Never mind.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.440]   What is the dummy contract?
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.000]   I don't, maybe we should define terms.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   What is that?
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   What is it?
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   The dummy contract is what it is.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.320]   The contract that this is an in music business, the book business, any business that where
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   they publish you is a contract that they throw in front of you.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   That's the first contract.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.400]   So we want to do your book.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.360]   We want to, you know, here's the contract.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.680]   They give you a dummy contract, which is a contract for idiots who've never done a book
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   or anything before.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.520]   And they usually sign it.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.560]   And the dummy contract, of course, is called the dummy contract because only a dummy signs
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:04.920]   that anybody with any experience will, or as a lawyer working with them, will say, you
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.640]   know, we can't sign this and they have all these different changes.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.960]   And of course, when you, the big, the big shocker, the big surprise you, you discover
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.120]   when you're working with publishers or anybody who throws a dummy contract out at you is the
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.200]   first thing they do is they don't even flinch.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   When you say, no, we can't do this.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.200]   We can't do that.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.200]   We can't do this.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   No, this is different.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   They go, okay.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.880]   Yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.160]   And they just chain make all the changes almost like without argument unless you do something
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.480]   really crazy.
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.680]   But generally speaking, there's a little bit, they know what the leeway is and you get,
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.120]   you get the deal you should get.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.960]   It's almost like, oh, you caught us.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.960]   Okay.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   We'll give you that.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.960]   I've never signed the dummy contract.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   My agent makes sure I don't see his agent.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.960]   Now that's not necessary.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.040]   I don't know what to ask who your agent is, but there's at least one agent I know of.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:54.000]   He was really popular with the publishers because he has his writer signed the dummy
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   contract.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.480]   This is a she.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.120]   So no, I'll tell you, I never had an agent.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.520]   I had, I had, I signed every dummy contract they put in front of me as a result made absolutely
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.680]   I made money on the first book and made no money on the rest of the books.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   And I'm proud of that.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   I'm proud of that.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   And so you can never.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.580]   The problems that you probably ran into was just, which is one of their classic tricks,
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:24.160]   which I think every new author gets suckered into, it's called cross collateralization,
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.140]   which you got to get out of the contract almost immediately.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.460]   And cross collateralization is why they give you, they'll give you a big advance on the
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:33.720]   first book and they say, we're going to do a three book deal.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.200]   And then they say, you know, here's your money for the first book and then we'll give
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.340]   you some for the second and the third book, but they, but they've got this cross collateralization
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:41.340]   thing in there.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:46.560]   So in other words, if your first book doesn't pay out, which it won't, they take the royalties
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:51.580]   from your second book and attribute it to the first contract and put you in the hole.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.660]   And by that, and then they take the third book and it goes in there until you make up
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:59.380]   all this money that was, you know, squandered on the first book and you just write basically
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.700]   three books and you get whatever you got for the first book and that's it.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.420]   And the whole thing is just a scam.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.460]   I got an idea, John.
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.700]   You should write a book called dummy contracts for dummies.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:15.980]   I wonder if it's time to dummy contract to get that book published.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.960]   So, uh, okay, go ahead.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.400]   There's good stuff in this dummy contract.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:24.200]   I mean, this one is one of the, it's very onerous.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:30.040]   Um, for example, United States book sales, 10% of actual actual terms there.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.680]   If you ever got in Dwight knows is when you get to your publisher's statement, they send
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   you a, this, this computer print out that nobody can decipher.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.640]   I have no idea what it says.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   So, I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   I'm going to give you a couple of things.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.280]   You probably get it that, you know, for a 10 buck book, you'd probably get like a nickel.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.640]   But this is a classic, this dummy contracts one of the best in terms of for dummies.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.120]   He's, he's saved it all these years.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.200]   Well, I've got a bunch of these, but this one's actually quite good.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.400]   I may, uh, do you want to say who it's from?
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   Yes, it's a side-backs.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   Side-backs.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.800]   Side-backs doesn't, you know, they're, but you know, there's like every other dummy contract.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.980]   If you want to do a deal with side-backs, you wouldn't sign this contract, but they
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.640]   take it to an extreme.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.840]   I mean, if you're going to put together a dummy contract, let's just make, see how dumb you
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   are.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.840]   All right.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.000]   I want to know what John's shirt says, but I'm not going to let you know until after
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   we come back.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.720]   So John, if you'd like to take a break, anybody else wants to take a break, except for you,
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.320]   the listeners, you must stay here.
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.160]   Well I tell you about go to meeting.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.840]   Go to meeting is that great service from Citrix that lets you meet on lot.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.840]   What are you laughing at?
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.720]   What do you mean online?
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:09.400]   Where you want, so you don't have to go travel all across town or even across the country
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.800]   to get those meetings going.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.360]   You can just, you know, sit where you are, wear your jammies even if you want, make a
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:19.920]   conference call, but a conference call that is every bit as good as an in-person meeting.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.120]   You'll do more, you'll travel less, you won't have to jump in your car and drive two hours
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.280]   for a one-hour meeting.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.720]   No one has the time for that.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.440]   All you do is you go to go, you can do it right now.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.120]   Go to go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.720]   You'll have it installed before I'm done talking.

[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.000]   Sign up.

[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:07.800]   You know, drawing or slide or PowerPoint or spreadsheet or, you know, whatever it is
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.680]   you've got on your desktop.

[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:18.400]   They're seeing what you're showing them.

[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.080]   Let me show you my screen."

[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.360]   No, no, you should do this.

[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.640]   Oh, Don is gone.
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.000]   He took you at your word.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   There's the empty chair.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Look at that.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Oh, here he comes.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   He's coming back.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.960]   What is that behind his chair there?
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:31.040]   If you're listening to this, you're missing a pretty unusual thing, which is we do video
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.040]   of this show.

[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:42.720]   Pacific, which if I'm correct is 2200 UTC, live.twit.tv.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.200]   And so we get these guys to get their-- oh, we got a glass of wine.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   Oh.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.520]   Happy Armistice Day.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.960]   Happy Armistice Day.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   Is it Armistice Day?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.960]   Oh, look at that.
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.440]   What is that behind you?
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.600]   Is that a shop back behind you?
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   A shop back?
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   What is that behind you?
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   It looks like a shop back.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   You see, hold on.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   You look at their picture.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   He doesn't know.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   You can't really see it now.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.760]   You're blocking it with-- it's kind of the orange thing down on the word left show.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   What is that?
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.760]   Well, that down there?
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   Yeah, that down there.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   That thing down there.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   It's just a light reflecting up somehow.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.440]   It's just the specular highlights.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.800]   So your shirt says what?
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   Gee?
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   Gee.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.080]   Gee cake.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.520]   It's in a-- it's a red background.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   But wait a minute.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.520]   Now, there's something about that-- that shade.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   That shade.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:32.520]   That shape.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.160]   It looks like a float chart or something, diagram.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.160]   It says geek.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.920]   It's from an Intel shirt.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   Oh.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   Oh.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   I like that.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.440]   Have you seen-- I love those Intel ads where they highlight like the inventor of USB.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.440]   And he's like a rock star.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   Can you cheer him on?
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   I love those ads.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.680]   It makes me proud to be a good person.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.560]   And I thought that ad was kind of creepy.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   Really?
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.960]   They haven't done any others.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.960]   They did the one, I think.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.320]   That's all I can remember.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.480]   I looked a little too much like Vivek Kundra.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:04.440]   You still got that thing for Vivek, huh?
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.880]   Let me see if I can-- I love the guy.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:12.360]   Something like, our rock stars aren't anything like your rock stars or something like that.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.800]   And all the women are going crazy over him.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.360]   There we go.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.080]   I love the music, too.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.240]   He does look like Vivek Kundra.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   Here he comes.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.200]   Oh, oh, the women are going wild.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.480]   Ajay Bhat, co-inventor of USB.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.120]   Who's that?
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:36.360]   The thing is you don't really get the scissors at the bottom of his pants are off.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.760]   Our rock stars aren't like your rock stars.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.760]   We are Intel.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.040]   But you know what I really like?
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.720]   And actually, I watch this ad every time.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.120]   Is that chorus going bum, bum, bum, bum?
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.520]   I love that part.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.320]   Because they're looking at each other.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.800]   They're just kind of talking.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.240]   We are Intel.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.000]   And then all of a sudden, they just start singing.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.120]   Sponsors of tomorrow.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:57.600]   Don't you see--
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.200]   Yeah, that's the way it is already Intel.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.840]   When you go to the Santa Clara offices,
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:02.800]   Jack, what it's like.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.760]   They just launching a song.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.440]   Bum, bum, bum, bum.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.880]   They don't air that in Texas.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.240]   They don't air that in Texas.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.240]   You've never seen that out?
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.600]   No, they don't.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.400]   Nah, nah.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.040]   But we have AMD commercials that are really boring.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.000]   Oh, yeah, because that's right.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.840]   Texas is home of AMD.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.280]   That's right.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.640]   And Dell.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.960]   It was a little Dell left.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.320]   A little Dell left.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.000]   A little bit of Dell left.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.960]   A little bit of Dell left.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.320]   So actually, that raised an issue.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.240]   What was I going to--
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.480]   Oh, I can't remember now.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.560]   What?
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.560]   I just said something that made me think of something
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.280]   and I can't remember.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.440]   It was a good story.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:41.240]   Well, I can talk about--
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.880]   They can't raise a story, Leo.
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.320]   Yeah, you got a story for us.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.240]   Yeah, the Apple finally--
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:49.560]   and Ehrrether AT&T finally saying that we're
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.920]   going to do MMS on the iPhone.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.400]   Wow.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.000]   Is that big news?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.080]   Somebody wrote big news.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.400]   It's big news for iPhone owners, for every other--
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.880]   for owners of the Razer.
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.960]   It's not a big mall.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.120]   Somebody wrote welcome to 2006.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.760]   It's a big deal.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.320]   Well, you cover cell phones that's seen it.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.920]   I mean, how important is it--
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.600]   I don't even understand what is it that I can't do
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.840]   because I don't have MMS?
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.040]   Well, a lot of phones don't get email.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.200]   And that's one of the primary ways to send pictures and video.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:24.000]   You send it to your mom's cell phone who doesn't have email
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.400]   in her phone and you can send her messages,
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.960]   multi-meter messages of your grandkids or whatever.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.480]   Right.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:30.680]   And it's really easy.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.120]   It's just a phone number instead of an email address,
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:33.840]   essentially.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.760]   So if somebody sends me an MMS on my iPhone now,
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.240]   will I not get it?
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.920]   No, you will get a link to a web page where--
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.720]   Oh, I've seen that.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.240]   I hate that.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:44.440]   Yeah, it's a pain in the butt.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.800]   I hate that big pain.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.360]   So now I'll just-- and vice versa,
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.960]   if somebody, if mom has a razor, actually my wife
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.680]   has some non-smart phone.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.160]   Right.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.760]   And they send you an MMS.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.200]   And then--
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.040]   She's never taking a picture on that phone in our way.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.200]   Not once.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.200]   And by the way, Leo, it's now called a feature phone.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:04.520]   Oh, oh.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.320]   A feature phone.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.400]   A dumb phone is a feature phone?
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.200]   It's in between a smartphone and a--
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.320]   There's no in between.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.920]   They're calling everything a feature phone,
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.160]   except the phones that don't actually exist.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.160]   Which is what--
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.160]   The phone's--
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.000]   If the phone--
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.720]   If the phone is a thing is a phone that's just a phone anymore.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.400]   They all have little features.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.520]   But its features are short of being smart.
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:26.840]   Right.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.160]   It's just like it plays a couple of games.
[00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   It has a camera.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.320]   I don't know.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.040]   I don't know.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.520]   Samsung Instinct or something.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.440]   The Instinct's the smartphone, isn't it?
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.040]   Wouldn't you call that a smartphone?
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:37.600]   I don't like it.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.120]   The LG Dair.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.720]   LG Dair.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.440]   There's a good example.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:40.920]   There's a good example.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:41.920]   It's not a smartphone.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.760]   It's not a smartphone.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.400]   It doesn't run like very good email, I think.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.560]   So it has to have-- what does it have to have to make it smart?
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.360]   I think it has to have like a third party operating system,
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.760]   like Windows Mobile or the OS.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.400]   I don't know.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.880]   Symbian, Symbian.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.400]   Right.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.400]   One of those advanced operating systems, like BlackBerry.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.000]   I'm trying to get--
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.200]   The interesting thing about this, though, is that AT&T, you know,
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:03.800]   delayed it.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.160]   They promised it at the end of summer.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.000]   And they're doing it actually the date falls and early fall.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   September 25th.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.720]   Well, it's only three days late.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.600]   Summer and September 22nd.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.280]   That's close.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:16.520]   That's a little bit--
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.320]   No cigar.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.680]   Thought horseshoes.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:19.160]   You know what?
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.480]   I'm going to defend AT&T.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:21.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.080]   This is something you've never heard from my lips before.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.760]   Oh, let's record this.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.240]   No, wait.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.240]   I want to defend AT&T.
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.360]   This is astonishing.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:28.800]   Why?
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   I thought their explanation was pretty good.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.520]   In fact-- and I put a link to it in our list--
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.840]   there's something to be said for the fact that--
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.480]   Poor--
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:38.960]   Oh, boy.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.760]   I never thought I'd say poor AT&T.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.240]   Poor.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.560]   Poor AT&T.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.080]   Poor AT&T.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.160]   Well, I've got a new book coming out, by the way.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.200]   AT&T for diamonds.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.360]   No, poor AT&T didn't know what it was biting off
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.240]   when it got the iPhone.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.520]   Yeah, the iPhone's been fantastic for AT&T.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.120]   Right.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.560]   Tens of-- how many of millions?
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.640]   10 million more.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.120]   Phones have been sold.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.960]   A third of all new iPhone owners are new to AT&T.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.280]   So it's been a boon for them getting new owners.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:07.920]   But what they did--
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.040]   They have more people that hate them now.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:10.760]   That's true too.
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.320]   What they underestimated is that iPhone users--
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.840]   and I'm one of them--
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.200]   you do way more with our phones in terms
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.440]   of sending pictures, sending videos.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.920]   I mean, we're using a bandwidth like nobody's business.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.960]   And so AT&T, I think, was taken off-guard a little bit
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.640]   by this, and they've been upgrading the network.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.080]   They said, look, we didn't want to release MMS
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.200]   until we could support it.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.240]   But we know that you iPhone people
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.320]   are going to send pictures like crazy.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.280]   So we had to upgrade.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.280]   I think-- am I crazy, but I think that in their defense,
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.520]   that kind of makes sense?
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.480]   No.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.560]   I disagree, because I think--
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.320]   I mean, if you can't have MMS on a regular--
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.080]   like a razor, like you said, why--
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.080]   I mean, every other smartphone on the market
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.800]   has MMS from the get-go.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.240]   Why do we have to wait three years?
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.000]   Because we use so much more bandwidth.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:01.400]   I think--
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.360]   Yeah, but they wouldn't have known that at the get-go.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.400]   At the beginning, what she's saying--
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.280]   They knew that.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.680]   No, they didn't know that last year.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.480]   But the iPhone couldn't do MMS last year.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.080]   It could only start doing MMS with the 3GS.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:16.680]   It wasn't even capable of it.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.080]   Yeah, why was that?
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:18.640]   Why is that?
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.040]   Because Apple didn't build it, and I'll tell you why that is.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.240]   Because Steve Jobs said, what are you talking about?
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.160]   We gave you email.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.960]   What do you want MMS for?
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.360]   Steve didn't get it.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.160]   So only the 3GS did MMS.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:32.880]   At that point, when Apple goes to AT&T,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:35.400]   he says, we're going to put MMS in the thing.
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.160]   AT&T says, ah!
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.520]   We were already choking, and everybody in San Francisco
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.600]   bitches about AT&T because there are more iPhone users
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:42.920]   per square inch than in San Francisco anywhere.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:45.000]   It's just really funny when they had that announcement
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.200]   at WWDC.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.280]   And when they had the list of carriers up on the screen,
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:50.600]   you could see Vodafone on there.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.520]   You could see Orange, UK on there.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.040]   But you couldn't see AT&T, and there
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.880]   was a collective gas before all the developers.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.600]   Yeah, they said, what?
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.200]   Your US carrier is not going to do this?
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.600]   So I think that you're probably right, Leo.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.200]   Wow.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   Wow.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.560]   I hope I'm recording this.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.560]   I'm recording this.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:15.040]   I usually have an alternative theory that's a little more
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.280]   interesting, but I can't argue with the theory.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.600]   You're probably exactly right.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.920]   The sequence makes nothing but sense.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.280]   They just-- I mean, I feel so far.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.560]   You don't have to milk it now.
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:25.080]   OK.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   I'm done.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:27.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   You're in Houston.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.160]   You're in Houston.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.000]   AT&T announced last week that they spent $30 million
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.640]   to upgrade the network.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:39.080]   Here alone, they doubled the backhaul capacity,
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.360]   and they added the 850 megahertz spectrum,
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.280]   and they tied it to the MMS.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.680]   I mean, they essentially said that this will help with that issue.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.920]   And MMS is like SMS.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.440]   It works on the control channel, right?
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:54.120]   Oh.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.720]   Doesn't actually use the bandwidth.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.240]   It's not--
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:56.960]   It's not used data.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.240]   It uses the text messaging plan, whatever you signed up on,
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.760]   like a 200 plan or--
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.240]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.240]   It doesn't actually use the data network per se.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:06.800]   So if they--
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.680]   Well, it does, but they don't list it that way.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:11.880]   They don't bill you that way, I think.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.360]   So here's a question.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.440]   If it actually does-- it uses a separate control channel.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:20.400]   If you look-- if you go look up how SMS works and how MMS works,
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.680]   it uses a different network than the 3D.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.840]   That's because these technologies are older, SMS and MMS
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:29.080]   are older than data itself than GPRS.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.600]   So they had to do something that a regular phone
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.320]   and a regular cell network could send this data.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:33.800]   Is that it?
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.400]   Would I?
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.280]   And yes.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.320]   And here's a question.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.880]   If you instead now have the option
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:44.640]   to use a different data stream for sending a picture,
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.040]   you're not going to use email.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.560]   You're going to use MMS.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:52.640]   Could it possibly take a load off of AT&T's 3G network?
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.120]   Could it end up distributing the data so that it's not so choked?
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.080]   But they probably had to upgrade this control channel,
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.280]   because this control channel never
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.520]   was designed with this kind of traffic in mind.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.040]   Right?
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:04.480]   Well, on this--
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:04.960]   Real interesting.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.560]   Well, on this topic, can we try to get--
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.040]   does anybody there want to just make
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.600]   a short-- some short predictions about Steve Jobs
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:14.480]   on the September 9th announcement?
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.520]   What is it going to be there?
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.680]   And what the announcement might be?
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.600]   I think we speculated on this last week.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.880]   So September 9th, Wednesday.
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.040]   Apple will be at the Arbo Buena Center for the Arts,
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.800]   which they've used before for iPod launches.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.520]   It's a very nice spot.
[00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:31.240]   The event email that was sent out, the invitation,
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.640]   which I didn't get, but others, did you get one?
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   Nicole?
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   My colleague, Donald Bell, has seen it.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.160]   Donald, Donald.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:37.920]   Did you get one, John?
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.080]   I didn't get one either.
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.440]   Did you get one, Dwight?
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.680]   No.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.440]   So we're always--
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.760]   OK, it makes sense.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.000]   So anyway, this invite, which I didn't get--
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.240]   but I noticed in Gadget Cut, so I went to a gadget's page,
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.080]   has a woman dancing around a typical iPod ad fashion,
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.120]   the silhouette with the white headphones.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.760]   And it says it's still rock and roll to me.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.200]   Only rock and roll or something.
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.120]   Which, by the way, is a Rolling Stones lyric.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.240]   I thought 9909 was all about the Beatles.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.040]   So anyway, we know it's going to be an iPod announcement.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.640]   Prediction, no way Steve Jobs shows up for an iPod announcement.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.280]   I agree.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:14.920]   You agree, Nicole?
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.800]   You're nodding your head.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.080]   I agree, but I would be a little disappointed, I think,
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.880]   because we're all waiting to see Steve Jobs--
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.200]   I'm not.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.040]   I wasn't invited.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.120]   I'm going to sit on that side saying, hey, did Steve--
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.280]   hey, Steve, did Steve show up?
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.480]   Hey, were you in there?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   Was Steve Jobs in there?
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.280]   I do agree, though, that they're saving
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.720]   Steve for the yet unknown tablet announcement.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.240]   Maybe.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   Maybe they're--
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   Yes.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.840]   Here's one of the things that they
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.400]   have to concern themselves with.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.360]   Unless Steve bulks up a little bit,
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:53.320]   Steve himself will distract from the announcement.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:53.800]   That's true.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.400]   Because all you're going to get is speculation about his health,
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.400]   again.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.480]   So you may not want to even show up at the tablet announcement.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.480]   Unless he bulks up, maybe they could shoot him up with something
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.240]   and make some kind of chubby for a day or two
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.880]   when he'd go in there, come on there, and pump it up.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.640]   Some could happen.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.320]   Because they want the headlines to read Steve Jobs is healthy
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.440]   and well, and working on this new tablet from Apple.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.880]   Of course, that would probably invite even--
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.240]   whatever Steve Dick-- because he's been away so long,
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.520]   even if he comes back looking great,
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.320]   he's going to create a whole other buzz about Steve.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.880]   You're absolutely right.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.000]   If you're smart, you show up as Steve Jobs
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.240]   at somebody else's event.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.120]   You show up at the Windows 7 launch
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.320]   and steal the thunder from Windows 7.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.240]   He could come to my house party.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.280]   Steve, Steve, you're invited.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.600]   Come to my house party.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.960]   We'll serve chopped liver.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.080]   We'll serve liver pet.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:45.600]   No way to do it.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.000]   No way to do it.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.440]   That's better.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   Oh.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.320]   No way to, man.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.440]   What kind of a joke is that?
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440]   It's awful.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.080]   It's a low blow.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.320]   That was awful.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.360]   Who told--
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   That was terrible.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.360]   No.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.480]   No, he's a vegetarian.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.080]   We'll serve all--
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:58.880]   He's a vegan.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.280]   Yeah, well--
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:01:59.640]   He's getting right.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.200]   He's from Vegas.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.040]   We'll serve all--
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:02.760]   He's a Vegas.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.400]   --vagus food all the time.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.000]   One thing that--
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.200]   This is mostly shrimp from what I can tell.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:08.600]   Really?
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.720]   Vegan is not shrimp.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.200]   No, it's a vegan.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.680]   Shrimp has a face.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.280]   Oh, Vegas is shrimp, yeah.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.640]   Vegas is shrimp in the beef.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.360]   So Dwight, you didn't weigh in on this.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.200]   Will Jobs show up?
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.640]   Well, I think that--
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.000]   I don't think he will, but with one caveat.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   You know, this is kind of a--
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.280]   In terms of Apple's products, it's a light event.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.720]   You know, it's not a Mac.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.920]   It's not a--
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.880]   It's not the tablet.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.080]   It's not the iPhone.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.720]   And maybe if they don't want to stress him out too much,
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.640]   they might bring him out for this or even--
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.320]   Yeah, this is easy.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.200]   --for possibly--
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:41.680]   Right, right.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.800]   This will be easy.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.040]   All right, I'm going to ask the chat room.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.760]   This is our famous chat room poll,
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.080]   where the chat room gets to tell us, yes or no.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:53.800]   Will Steve Jobs show up on 9/9/09 for the big--
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.040]   what we presume is an iPod announcement.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.120]   What you mean by show up is going to show up on the stage.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:02:59.760]   Yeah, OK.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.000]   Yeah, not just in the back of the room.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.640]   Yes, he will.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.040]   Yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   Unless the Beatles--
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.320]   This is funny to watch.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.800]   Now, here's an interest at 42.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:12.800]   Somebody said 42.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.360]   Don't care is another one.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.040]   Now, here's an interesting question.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.000]   There is a chance he would show up
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.560]   if it's a Beatles announcement and Ringo and Paul show up.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.040]   Will they?
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.480]   Well, I think Paul's a vegan.
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:28.840]   That's right.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.760]   He doesn't need anything with a face either.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.640]   So that's an interesting speculation.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.080]   OK, so this is my speculation.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:36.480]   This is it.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.720]   9/9/09 Beatles, right?
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.240]   Number nine.
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:39.960]   Number nine.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.680]   It's the day the Beatles rock band comes out.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.960]   It's the day the mono remixes of the Beatles.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.080]   The CD's come out.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.120]   It is Beatles iPod.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.200]   Well, if the Beatles have never been available on digital download,
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.800]   what if Apple says we have an exclusive digital download
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.680]   exclusive on iTunes for through the rest of the year?
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.520]   The only place you'll be able to digital download
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.760]   these remixes of the new of the Beatles stuff.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.800]   And ladies and gentlemen, to tell us all about it, Paul
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.000]   and Ringo and Steve.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.600]   Well, I think that just about a month ago,
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.880]   didn't a month ago, didn't the Beatles say that the negotiations
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.200]   for digital rights are still ongoing?
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.520]   They were ongoing.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.960]   Yeah, so I don't think--
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.080]   I think that that was a signal that it's not going to happen.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.160]   No, no, no.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.680]   That was a red herring.
[01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.480]   Why would you not?
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.040]   What negotiations?
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.520]   For crying out loud, release the damn things.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   Everybody's downloading--
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.080]   In fact, if they haven't announced it yet,
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:42.440]   you can say they're ongoing when, in fact, it's been a done deal.
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.720]   But it hasn't been announced.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.160]   So it's still something that's still ongoing.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.640]   I think there's just weasel words.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.320]   You know, John-- not John.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.400]   No, John didn't show up anywhere.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:58.040]   Paul and Ringo showed up at a Microsoft event at E3,
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.240]   remember, to announce Beatles Rock Band.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.480]   So it's not unheard of that if Microsoft can afford him,
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   that he might show up at another event.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.360]   They might show up at another event.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.480]   Well, they're cheaper for Apple.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.280]   Well, the question is whether they're
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.480]   going to even release the Beatles digitally, right?
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:14.840]   Right.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.360]   That's what we were saying.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.320]   That deal has not--
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.000]   I have it on pretty good authority
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   that the Beatles stuff is going to come out.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.040]   I think it's got to be the case.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.240]   And now, if you're Steve Jobs, you want to show up for that.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.080]   And you're--
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.560]   If John-- you're right, if Paul McCartney and Ringo
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.760]   and got maybe--
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.800]   He loves the Beatles.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.720]   And Yoko--
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.240]   What if Yoko shows?
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.880]   Well, then it's-- there you go.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.000]   Steve's got a merrier.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.800]   Yoko shows I'm not going.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.760]   That's why they didn't invite me, because Yoko was going
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.080]   to be there.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.040]   You know, I would then be really hurt if I didn't get
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:48.840]   invited if the Beatles--
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.320]   There you go.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:49.840]   The Beatles show up.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.320]   The remaining Beatles showed up.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.480]   I'm now going to be hurt.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.880]   Although, would they show up at Yoko Buena Center
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.760]   for the Arts?
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.560]   It is a smaller venue.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.000]   Show up at Efrickin' 3.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.240]   Talk about a small venue.
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.320]   It was an aircraft hangar.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.240]   Now, here's my theory.
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.360]   I think this is taken off of what--
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.920]   was it John who said this?
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.000]   That Steve does not want to make his appearance be the story.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.680]   He's not going to--
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.200]   That could be it.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.320]   He's going to have to show up somewhere where it's not--
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.720]   It doesn't matter if his health overshadows the story.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:24.960]   The iPods absolutely are that kind of announcement.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.360]   Aren't they?
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.560]   The announcement has to be big enough to overshadow it,
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.360]   I guess.
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.560]   It has to be a big enough announcement.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.040]   Well, it won't overshadow, but it's not
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.320]   the end of the world even if it doesn't.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:35.820]   Right.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:36.120]   So what?
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:36.880]   There's no iPods.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.320]   Big deal.
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.400]   What that's not a big story.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.960]   Well, if Steve could get a hold--
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.040]   remember the talking heads in that one video they did
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.440]   where they wore that big giant suit?
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.760]   Steve could get a hold of that thing.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.720]   Stop making sense, suit.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.240]   You'd have to--
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.720]   That's bulking up.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.320]   That's true.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.920]   No, that makes anybody look skinny.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.640]   If I'd look like I was dying in that suit, the giant suit--
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.200]   let me see if I can find that.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:04.960]   Stop making it.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.120]   I think it's here.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.400]   I'm saying, this is not the world.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400]   That is.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.320]   That's the number one.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.240]   Doesn't look that giant.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:15.960]   That's not it.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:17.400]   It's a big giant suit.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.960]   I think it's huge.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.240]   Maybe the wasn't wearing a suit.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.600]   I think giant suit for the giant suit.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.200]   What am I going to get if I do a search for giant suit?
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.680]   What kind of weird stuff am I going to get?
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.840]   Giant suit.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.480]   Let me look, giant suit.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.400]   I'll do talking.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.480]   Oh, no, David burned giant suit, right?
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.800]   David burned giant--
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.040]   We just hope that people tag things properly.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.920]   Just pray.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.920]   Here it is.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.280]   Giant Japanese armored mech.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.840]   No, nothing.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.040]   I got nothing.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.600]   Well, somebody in the chatroom must have a link to it.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.600]   Yeah, I'm sure they'll send us something.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.000]   It has to be from the concert, right?
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.240]   Because that's where-- no, it was the movie.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.320]   It was in the movie.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:04.480]   It cares.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:04.980]   I'm done.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.560]   I'm over it now.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:05.960]   We're done.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.920]   We're next story.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.720]   What's the next story?
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:08.320]   Moving on.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:08.840]   Moving on.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.160]   Moving on.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:11.680]   Let's see.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.400]   Did I mention that Microsoft's going
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.560]   to be able to sell Microsoft Word now?
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.120]   Yeah, you did.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.360]   You mentioned that this is one, two, three, four times so far.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.600]   Spiderman is now a Disney property.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.600]   Yes.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:24.960]   I wonder--
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.040]   Does anybody but me-- can I do a little editorializing here?
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:29.560]   Yes.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.280]   So Disney has to be the family friendly and all
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.200]   this other kind of thing.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.760]   And then some years ago, they changed
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.480]   Tomorrowland from kind of a looking forward, kind
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.040]   of a cool place with the Monsanto House of the Future,
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.800]   which today would be some sort of round up thing.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.880]   And they're kind of a bright, cheery future.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.280]   And then they changed it in the Disneyland in Anaheim
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.000]   to this kind of grim, kind of dysfunctional looking
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   dystopia, kind of creepy based on things like Mad Max,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.520]   or that kind of grim future.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:04.720]   And now instead of these happy characters,
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.040]   which we've all been used to seeing,
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:10.480]   the dwarves running around and the crazy mad
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.000]   hat and all this stuff, now we've
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.760]   got these incredibly creepy adult cartoon characters.
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.520]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.040]   You basically would scare a little kid.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.480]   Spiderman?
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.240]   No, Spiderman.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.840]   Well, Spiderman's kind of creepy, but the rest of them,
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.040]   these are not things that little kids are going to warm up
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:28.880]   to the next one.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.880]   It's not done.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880]   It's not done.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.880]   Leo, Leo, two words.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.880]   Mickey Hulk.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.880]   Oh, he's green.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   But doesn't Disney own Miramax and Pixar?
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   I mean, Miramax is fairly adult.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   That's true.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   Pixar is not a doll per se, but he has pretty good content.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.880]   It's not necessarily just for kids.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:56.880]   You're saying it's smart diversification.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880]   Maybe.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.880]   Marvel, they spent $4 billion in stocking cash.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   I don't-- seems a little bit overvalued.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   $4 billion is a lot.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   But how much money do these Marvel movies make?
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.880]   They're doing very, very well, aren't they?
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   That's true.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880]   What do they make?
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.880]   The X-Men movies?
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.880]   X-Men, Hulk, Spiderman, Hulk, Wolverine.
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.880]   All of these are doing that really, really well, I think.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.880]   I don't know, $4 billion, well.
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.880]   But that's what-- I mean, Disney's a movie company nowadays.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.880]   Really, if you think about Pixar, Miramax, Disney is really
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   become a movie company.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.880]   And if you're a movie company owning the rights to all those
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.880]   Marvel characters, we seem to have an insatiable appetite
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   for superhero movies.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.880]   It's getting to be that way.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   Absolutely.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.880]   Because our lives suck so bad.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   Here's speaking of-- here's the giant suit.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   There it is, the giant suit.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   Giant suit.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.880]   Now Steve Jobs had that giant suit.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.880]   How could he-- he could easily come out on stage.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.880]   What it does, though, is it makes your head look really small.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880]   It does.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880]   David-- David Burns had his really small--
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   Oh, well, there you go.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   That suit is actually normal.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   It's a normally sized suit, and he is a tiny, tiny person.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   It's the way it is.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:06.880]   I don't know.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.880]   He's getting interviewed by somebody.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   Very strange in this.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.880]   I don't know where this video came from, but there he is in
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.880]   the giant suit.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:15.880]   So-- wait a minute.
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.880]   The person's changed.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.880]   I don't-- this must be from somebody.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880]   What are you watching?
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   I don't know.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   This is a link.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   This is a link sent to me by the chat room.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   These people have strange taste.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880]   That's--
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.880]   According to a fun crunch in the chat room, she says that David
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.880]   Burns designed the suit because he has a big head.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880]   Oh.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   To make it look smaller.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   Oh.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   See?
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880]   See?
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   Counterintuitive.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   Oh, that was him introducing an interview himself.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.880]   He was all of those characters.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   Oh, that's so creepy.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.880]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:50.880]   Come back with more.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   You are listening to This Week in Tech with Dwight Silverman
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   of the Houston Chronicle.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:59.880]   The Chronicle Tech blog is a must read at blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   Nicole Lee from CNET.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   She's their expert on cell phones.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   And her blog is Nicole spelled funny.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.880]   And I-- is it-- spell it funny?
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   N-E-E-K-O-L-E dot com.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.880]   N-E-E-E.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880]   I see.
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.880]   I even I spelled it wrong.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880]   E-col.
[01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:15.880]   N-E-col dot com.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.880]   I just-- it's a personal blog.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.880]   So there's nothing really exciting on there.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.880]   Oh.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   Well, where would you like people to go to find out more about that?
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.880]   Yeah, so I do-- we do a cell phone podcast on CNET as well.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.880]   And I'm on that.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:28.880]   Tell me about that.
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.880]   Yeah, it's on-- it's at dialedin.cnet.com.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   That's the name of it?
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.880]   Yeah, dialed in-- all one word-- dot cnet.com.
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.880]   Oh, I will use that from now on for your lower third.
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880]   We'll use that.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.880]   And then, of course, John C. Devorak, a channel devorak.com.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880]   It has so many podcasts.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   See only, you know, you only really-- just go to that website.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   And the channel devorak.com works.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.880]   That's the place to go.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:59.880]   Any of you are-- any of you into audiobooks at all?
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   Gosh, you oughta be.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:05.880]   You're missing such-- how can I get you to-- maybe if I had a free offer or something.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   Maybe if I could give you free-- two free audiobooks.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.880]   That would be sufficient to get you to checkoutaudible.com.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.880]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twit two.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.880]   Now, that gives you the access to the Platinum account.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.880]   The Platinum account is two books a month, which is what I use, because I go through two books a month.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   Easy.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   And if you do that, you get the first two free, and you get to keep me, but if you don't stick around.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.880]   So this is fun, although it becomes a challenge because now you gotta pick two books.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:40.880]   And it's so-- oh, man.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.880]   You just go to audible.com with 60,000 choices.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.880]   And it's hard not to, you know, just go crazy on here.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.880]   Stephen King, Dan Brown, Nora Roberts, Dean Coonce.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.880]   Just huge.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   This is great.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880]   They've added some social features.
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   The most popular books on your fellow listeners, Wishless.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.880]   John Irving's a prayer for Owen Minney, Pat Conroy's south of Broad.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.880]   Oh, Jerry Pornell's "The Moten Gods."
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:07.880]   How we gotta get Jerry on this show again?
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   He has been on an age-- the book he wrote with Larry Niven.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.880]   Top five.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   Wishless books.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.880]   There's a bunch of great sci-fi now on Audible.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   Thanks to the Audible Frontiers program, including Lucifer's Hammer, which is new.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   They've just added that, another Jerry Pornell.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880]   That's a great book.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.880]   Isn't that great?
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.880]   That's an awesome book.
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   If you've never listened, look at this.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   The sci-fi stuff is just fantastic.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:36.880]   Audible.com/twit2, that's the place to go.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   Whether it's business, classics, fiction, and nonfiction.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.880]   Whatever you're interested in listening to, you're gonna find it at Audible.com.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.880]   I'll tell you what, I'm gonna put Lucifer's Hammer.
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.880]   See, I've got two books, two credits right here, but Lucifer's Hammer in there.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.880]   'Cause I want to listen to that.
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   That's a long one, too.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880]   That's 24 hours.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.880]   I like long books.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.880]   That's one in there.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880]   And then you can figure out what the other one is.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.880]   We'll make that our recommendation.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880]   Maybe "The Moten Gods Eye."
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.880]   Another great Jerry Pornell fan.
[01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.880]   I didn't know you were Jerry Pornell fan.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   Well, we'll get you on with Jerry.
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   Oh, that'd be great.
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.880]   I love Jerry.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.880]   I grew up.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   I mean, I grew up.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   I was an adult, but I mean, right?
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.880]   Bite magazine's Chaos Manor column he wrote for years was really what got me into computers.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:28.880]   I love it when he kind of blusters into the press room at CES.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.880]   He's a presence.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   Well, we'll get him on, and I'll get you back on.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   We'll do an old-timer show, 'cause that's always fun.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.880]   I want to be on during the Windows 7 house party.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.880]   You want to?
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.880]   All right, deal.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:43.880]   Join our house party.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   We'll get everybody in.
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.880]   Except for you.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.880]   Let's send me some napkins, though, before we go.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.880]   I'll get you some napkins.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.880]   I am so excited about that house party.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.880]   It's so much fun.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.880]   We'll set up a date for that.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.880]   Meanwhile, get your Audible account right now.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:59.880]   "The Moten Gods Eye" is our pick and Lucifer's hammer.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:03.880]   Two great Jerry Pornell classics with Larry Niven.
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.880]   Audible.com.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   Your first two books are free when you go to that URL.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.880]   If you haven't started listening to audiobooks, just start.
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:13.880]   Just do me a favor.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.880]   Just start.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.880]   You will thank me.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.880]   I get email every single day from somebody who said, "I heard the Audible ad.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.880]   I finally broke down in the hearing it for a long time, and I cannot thank you enough."
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.880]   It just saves your life.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.880]   Long airplane flight, long commute.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.880]   Stuck in traffic at the Bay Bridge waiting for four days for them to fix it.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:32.880]   Audible.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:33.880]   You won't even mind.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.880]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   We thank you for their support of This Week in Tech.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.880]   Let's see.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   I had another story.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.880]   Oh, are you losing weight, Leo?
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.880]   No.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880]   No, I'm just wasting.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   Wasting away.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   Why do I look thinner?
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   Do you think I look thinner?
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   Do you think I look good?
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:56.880]   It's, you know, maybe I'm, I don't know.
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.880]   I don't think I'm actually losing weight.
[01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.880]   I just think I'm getting old.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:06.880]   You know how you get old and drawn and everything starts.
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.880]   I've heard of it.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   I think you have my song on there.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   You think so?
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:11.880]   Oh, gosh, I'm liking this show.
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.880]   We're going to have you guys back.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   So I know what I was thinking of when I, you were talking about, um, uh, Anna, an anniversary
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   or a date.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.880]   There is a debate, and I'm very curious what you guys think about some media outlets were
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.880]   saying.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   In fact, my wife came to me, uh, on, uh, on, on Wednesday.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.880]   She said, "You know, it's the 40th anniversary of the Internet."
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.880]   I said, "What?"
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   Yeah, that was a good story.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.880]   What is that?
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:33.880]   Well, it isn't.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880]   That's how I understand.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   That's why you didn't miss it.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.880]   It isn't.
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:47.320]   Uh, for some reason, uh, I guess because semantic did a press release or something, media outlets
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.120]   have decided September 2nd is the 40th anniversary of the day the Internet was invented.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.880]   In fact, not even close.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:01.840]   Um, Leonard Kleinrock, who ought to know better, says on his site, it was October 29th, 9th.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:11.080]   1969, when that famous first message was transmitted, uh, uh, to, uh, SRI from two computers
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.840]   in SRI in Menlo Park.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.200]   Yeah, but wait.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.600]   But wait, there's more.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.600]   But wait.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.800]   But wait.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:24.680]   That was the first use of what was already in place, which had to be in place before that
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.120]   message was sent.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:31.960]   And before it was in place, it had to have been conceived and invented, thus the Internet
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.960]   itself in terms of its, the way, you know, the way it was conceived, is that the, should
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.240]   you basically, this is like being born, you know, if you're being born, your birthday is
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.800]   not when you first start crying or when you say, mom, it's when you were born, is that
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.200]   really the date of the Internet's birth?
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.800]   Well, we should be celebrating.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.800]   Okay.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.800]   We were talking about conception.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.800]   You're talking about conception.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:54.800]   Wait, you know, I mean, come on now.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800]   I mean, I'm not going to say that.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:14.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   I'm not going to say that.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.800]   I'm not going to say that.

[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:03.800]   This is an investment group, which reminds me a lot, John, of when Ziff Davis was sold

[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   These guys, these investment groups don't want to hold it, right?
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   They're going to pass it along and make a little money.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.800]   Yeah, they're just jugglers.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.800]   It includes the Canadian pension plan investment board.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.800]   Mark Andreessen's new startup.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800]   This guy wrote Netscape.

[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.800]   Silver Lake and Index Ventures.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:29.800]   They put in that $1.9 billion in cash.
[01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800]   I think this is preparatory.
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:33.800]   Don't you think to passing it on to the Sky Founders originally?
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800]   They're going to get it back.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   They'll get to keep $500 million, half a billion here or their big deal.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.800]   Now they're happy.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.800]   Does the presence of Andreessen mean anything in this?
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.800]   I mean, he might he do anything more interesting with it?
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.800]   He has such a, you know, this is deluded amongst all these guys.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   You think he has...
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:50.800]   It's just money for him.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.800]   The whole thing is weird.
[01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:59.800]   So I ran into Meg Whitman's campaign manager yesterday.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:00.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.800]   She's running for governor, isn't she?
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.800]   Yes, she is.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.800]   And of course, you got into trouble by praising that guy that just quit the Obama administration.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.800]   So they put out a bunch of fires about that.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:15.800]   But they're very serious.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:16.800]   Really?
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.800]   I don't think...
[01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:19.800]   I don't see anybody beating Jerry Brown, but you know...
[01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.800]   Jerry, you think Jerry Brown's going to make it as governor again?
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.800]   The real question is why would anybody want to be governor of California?
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.800]   It's the worst job in the world.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.800]   You have no power.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.800]   Everybody blames you for everything, even though you can do nothing.
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:34.800]   Yeah, but Jerry Brown seems to relish that sort of thing.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   He was also the mayor of Oakland, as you recall.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:37.800]   Oh, another bad.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.800]   Same kind of thing.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.800]   Well, he has nothing to lose.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   I mean, he's already...
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.800]   She was CEO of eBay through March 2008.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.800]   I think she did preside over the year.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:48.800]   She did do that.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:49.800]   She did, really.
[01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.800]   She has an energy that was sent to me.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.800]   You have a point then.
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.800]   I mean, that's not what I would call a good executive.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:30:59.800]   She bought the dummy contract.
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.800]   Exactly.
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:01.800]   Okay.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.800]   This title for this episode, Leo, the dummy contract.
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.800]   I signed the dummy contract.
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:08.800]   The dummy contract.
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:09.800]   All right, kids.
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:10.800]   Hey, thanks so much for being here.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.800]   Dwight Silverman, you're the greatest from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.800]   Blogs.cron.com/techblog is the place to go.
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:23.800]   To read Dwight every single day in his link blog, like I said, is really the source for this
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:24.800]   show.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.800]   You don't need to listen to Twitch.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.800]   Just read Dwight's blog.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:28.800]   Pretty much done.
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.800]   No, do listen to Twitch.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   Oh, all right.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   And I will have you...
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.800]   Don't forget, Leo, that Microsoft now gets to sell Word.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.800]   This news just in.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.800]   Just in.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.800]   We'll have you for our house party, Dwight.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800]   All right.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.800]   I think we're going to have a big one.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.800]   I think we might have like 20 participants.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800]   We're just going to really...
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.520]   We got balloons for 15 and all the napkins.
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.640]   So I think we're set.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:58.320]   Also don't forget to catch Nicole Lee's podcast, Foolish Me.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.040]   I forgot to mention dialed in.cenet.com.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.520]   Nicole, you're great.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:06.960]   Nicole and I worked together at Tech TV and it's just great to see you again.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:07.960]   Very good.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.720]   I still have my Tech TV badge.
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:10.720]   Do you?
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.720]   I turned mine in.
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.720]   They didn't ask me to.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:14.720]   I made the mistake of turning it in.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:15.720]   I should have kept it.
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.720]   I have to have that.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.680]   That would be a great memory.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:21.440]   Somewhere I scanned it or took a picture of it.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:25.200]   So somewhere on the internet, a picture lives of my Tech TV badge.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.560]   Another former Tech TV or John C. Devorak.
[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.800]   Like the rest of us, he's moved on to bigger and better things.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.040]   You can find it all at channeldevorak.com.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.040]   He's a geek.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.840]   At least he's got the shirt.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:39.840]   They used to make ties.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.680]   Now they're down to the shirts, T-shirts.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.560]   Remember those great Intel silk ties?
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.200]   They got these to have.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:47.080]   Yeah Intel, they still have Chachkis.
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.720]   That means just me, whatever.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720]   Chachkis.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:55.960]   Don't forget I am on Bobby Llewellyn's carpool this week.
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:03.960]   If you want to see me drive around in a Prius and give Bobby a tour of Petaluma, my hometown.
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:08.120]   That's at loutube, L-L-E-W-T-U-B-E.com.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:13.000]   Which by the way is the best looking website in history because it's designed to look
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.720]   like a 1984 magazine.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.720]   I love it.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:16.720]   I love it.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.720]   Isn't that great?
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.720]   It's got the waist baskets and everything.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   He's full of down to show what they have.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.720]   Isn't it great?
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.720]   I love it.
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.200]   Loutube, L-L-E-W-T-U-B-E.com.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.720]   Thank you Bobby.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:31.920]   The only reason I'm plugging this by the way is because he says, "My God, you got more
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.360]   downloads than Stephen Frye and I just want to kill Stephen Frye dead."
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.360]   Dead.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.960]   He's doing as much twitter followers than you.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:41.960]   Well, it's true.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:42.960]   It's got more twitter.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:43.960]   Everybody has more twitter.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   Wait, I'm just waiting on this.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:45.960]   It's not.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:46.960]   It just doesn't even matter.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:47.960]   You can watch this show live.
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:53.760]   As I said, every Saturday or Sunday afternoon, 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific, 2200 UTC at
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.760]   live.twit.tv.
[01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.920]   In fact, we do all of our shows live.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.560]   So just keep live.twit.tv on 24/7.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.840]   You're sure to see something you're interested in if you are a geek.
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:03.840]   Or download it.
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.440]   We've got it on iTunes, the Zoom store and everywhere else.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.480]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:10.400]   We invite you to come back again next week.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:11.400]   Another Twit.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:12.400]   This is amazing.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.400]   Thank you.
