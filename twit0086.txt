[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Well, not that late, but after work we've got Patrick
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and Robert over at DLTV.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   The lights are dim.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Everybody's gone home.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   It's just the two of them.

[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   And I'm just here looking at the rain, looking out the window.

[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   >> Finally.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Got rid of all of you.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   >> Wow.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   >> You were here last week.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We -- and in replace -- we replaced the curmudgeon seat.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We have a special seat just for the curmudgeon with Adam Currie.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And that was quite an experience.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   >> Yeah, I got mixed reviews.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Some people -- it's funny.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I have a little -- I'm sure you do too.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Radar goes up.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   When you get -- all of a sudden I'm getting all these letters.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Very similar letters saying how great Adam was.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> Adam bans.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   >> Yeah, it kind of -- my radar goes up like, is this a campaign or
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   is this spontaneous?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Doesn't feel spontaneous.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Anyway, I don't know if -- you know, he might have said something
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   on the daily source code saying, hey, tell him how much --
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   >> Again, I can't imagine Adam himself would be organizing such
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   a campaign.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   >> Not that he would ever do anything like edit his Wikipedia
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   article already.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   >> Well, you know, I can see -- editing the Wikipedia article
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   doesn't really bother me all that much.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   >> I don't see why anybody should care about that.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You should be out of your own stuff.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   >> Well, this is an interesting story then.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Microsoft is kind of in the doghouse right now.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   It offered to pay an Australian blogger to change articles on
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Wikipedia.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I mean, at least they had a sense to know they couldn't change
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   them themselves.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   >> No, they could change.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   What is they thinking?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   They could change it themselves.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   >> During the OS2 wars, OS2 was battling against Microsoft's
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Windows, they would have these munchkins, as we like to call them,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   scattered around pretending to be the skier, that guy, and
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   whatever, invading the forums and causing all kinds of havoc.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I mean, they have the skill set to do this.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Why don't they just send somebody --
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   >> Well, the issue is, will they be objective?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Here's a quote from --
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   >> Of course they won't be objective, but who cares?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> What is objective?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   What is this objective?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   >> You speak of yours.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Wikipedia has an entry -- I'm quoting Wikipedia.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It has an entry to open XML, it has a lot of slanted language,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   and we'd like for them to make it more objective, but we feel
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   it would be best if a non-Microsoft person was a source of any
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   corrections.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Actually, I'm sorry, this is coming from Microsoft to this
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   blogger saying it's slanted now, we would like you to unslam it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   >> Right.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   That was -- the irony to the story is that, apparently, it was IBM,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   or at least it's rumored.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   That's IBM that put the slanted language in because, you know,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   they're promoting Linux.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I don't know whether that's true or not, but I have a lot of
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   people that come onto my Wikipedia entry and they put
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   slanted language in, you know, and I have to go in there and clean
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   it out.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> It's supposedly -- you know, there's no rules.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's not like there's -- but it's supposedly kind of not done
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   to edit your own biography.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I've done it too.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> You have to do it.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   They get the dates wrong.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   They get all kinds of information that's both --
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   what are you supposed to do, wait until somebody who happens to
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   be a mind reader, a psychic that happens to know this and that,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   these crazy details about your life that happen to be up there
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   and inaccurate.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   >> I don't think anybody argues that you could -- you know,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   somebody put in my article that I'd written an article for
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Hustler, so I changed that.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Nobody's arguing that.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It's more when you go in there and you kind of slant things.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> Oh, you talk about how great you are.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> Or you take out negative stuff, which is apparently fairly
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   -- >> Well, something negative stuff, a lot of the negative stuff
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   is questionable.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> I want to take a look at -- I mentioned this, by the way,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   on cranky geeks, and I'll mention it again.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   If you want to see a site that's obviously done by minions and
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   probably the guy himself, go to the gnome chompsky entry in
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Wikipedia and take a look at it and tell him this is not one
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   giant advertisement.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's funny.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   I mean, that gnome would do that or his minions would do that.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's kind of ironic.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   >> But it's inaccurate.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   >> I mean, is this a flaw with Wikipedia?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   >> You know what, you obviously must be some flaw because they
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   formed this new thing, right?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   But let me just say before we go on about the -- is it accurate
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   or not?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah, I don't see any evidence that it's not accurate, but it's
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   like me, for example, if I took every column, I've written at
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   least over 4,000 easy, and listed each one of them, and when
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   they ran and where they were running, which is what the
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   gnome chompsky thing is.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   >> Right.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   >> Every one of them is so so well it's accurate.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But who needs it?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I mean, who wants to see it?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   >> Well, I'll put it this way.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Somebody has gone -- there's an article on Wikipedia that has
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   everybody who's ever appeared on Twitter.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   >> I didn't do it, obviously.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I don't have time for that.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   >> Everybody has ever been on Twitter.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> What do you mean?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   >> And that's an article on Wikipedia.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   There's an article -- I mean, there's all kinds of stuff like
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   that.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I mean, I love Wikipedia.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I have to say -- >> Well, what we're talking about, you know,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   the spin-off citizenomnaby -- whatever that all about.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> What's that new thing?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   >> Jimmy Wail's new thing.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> Yeah, the guy who started one of the guys --
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   >> I'm trying to get Jimmy on one of the shows, actually.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   >> He's decided that to take the advice of some people, like
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   myself included, although I'm semi-serious about it, and
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   then creating another Wikipedia clone that is moderated to
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   a greater extreme so you don't get these kinds of --
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   >> Oh, I don't think that's Jimmy doing that.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   You're right.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   >> No, no, this is the other guy.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Let me look it up.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I have it on the blog.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   >> Already forgotten.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   >> I have a more moderated Wikipedia, I guess.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   An expert Wikipedia.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   >> Yeah, it's called -- >> I use Wikipedia all the time,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   though.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I have to say.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I mean, I don't use it -- it's great for things like you're
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   looking up an actor's name or TV show.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I mean, it's one -- what do you use it for, Robert?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   >> Technical information sometimes.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   >> Yes.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   >> For lawyers.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   >> Is it for lawyers to expect to deal with?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Sometimes the best resources for having all that data in one
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   place is right there, and it's also usually the most
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   updated -- frequently updated source I use.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   >> I would have -- I mean, I always confirm what I read there,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   but generally speaking, it works out for me really.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   >> So what's the story?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> It's a -- it's a -- it's a -- it's a sangre, Larry sangre,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   who's -- who's a fork.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   This is a fork, you know, for a common thing that happens in
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   open source anything, and it's called "Citizenium," which is
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   a horrible name.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   >> Terrible.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   >> I mean, which I think is going to kill it if they don't
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   change that name.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I don't know where they got that idea from.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Maybe they read one too many Dan Gilmore books, but whatever
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   the case is, it's -- you can go to citizenium.org and -- or even
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   in Wikipedia, they actually have a citation for this thing.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And it's -- you know, this began in November as a pilot
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   product, and it has expert editors and expert authors, and,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   you know, it's essentially creating an open source version
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   of the real encyclopedia Britannica, where you don't have
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   the public and the secret experts, but you have, like,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   you know, official experts.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And I -- I don't know.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I've actually bought into the wiki idea to a point, and I don't
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   know if this is going to fly.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   >> You know what's great about the net, though, is it doesn't
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   matter.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Go ahead and do it.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   There's -- it's not like there's a lack of room.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   You know?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   I mean, you just do it, you know?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Do whatever you want, and if it sticks, it sticks, and if not,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   it just goes away.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   >> Well, he's willing to bail if it doesn't work.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   >> Yeah, give it a shot.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   I think I like the idea.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But again, I find Wikipedia, in most cases, "Citizenium" is
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   very accurate and very useful.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   >> Yeah, I find it weird, though, that you're not supposed to
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   edit your -- well, that's like the consensus that you don't
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   edit your own --
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   >> Yeah, I --
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   >> -- on its point, though, makes complete sense to me.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It's like, look, I've -- I see misinformation on there, and I
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   want to change it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Maybe it's something written about me, but, you know, who else
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   will do it?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   >> I mean, I could see Microsoft approaching that blogger
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   because the person is considered an expert in the field or
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   happens to do something that -- that happens to represent a
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   viewpoint that Microsoft agrees with.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   But it's -- you know, you think if Microsoft wanted to modify --
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   wanted to modify, you know, Wikipedia, certainly, they have
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   enough intelligence and talent and money to just, you know,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   secretly pay someone to modify things for them.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I mean, there's --
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   >> Why do you not have to keep --
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   >> -- there's marketing companies that are -- what's that?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   >> Patrick, just assign somebody.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm sorry, just assign somebody.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   >> Yeah, that's what I mean.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   >> I mean, if you have to go outside, maybe they want to use
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   outside -- you know, it's just -- it's so obvious.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It seems so simple, you know?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   >> Because another prize will look at it to where if there's
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   any kind of ambiguous information or where are the
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   references for this information, it will get picked apart in
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   that reference by the community itself that looks at that
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   content.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   >> Right.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   >> So I don't see a huge danger of self-editing, but --
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   >> You know, there's no danger.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And I guarantee that every major corporation that has a large
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Wikipedia entry has somebody assigned to dog that entry and
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   to make changes as necessary.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It went bad, false or erroneous, or even slanderous information
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   shows up from some disgruntled employee.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   >> You'd be foolish not to, of course.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   >> It's interesting.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I mean, I'm looking through the rules.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I don't see any explicit rules saying you can't edit your own
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   page.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It just seems to be that's a cultural --
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   >> -- I've asked Jimmy about that.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And he said, yeah, that's kind of accepted norm.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   >> But I think the biggest thing about the whole Adam Currie
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   incident was that he was -- they were sort of in this
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   argument over who invented podcasting or who invented
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   podcasting or who had the first.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   >> Yeah, he was taking credit.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   >> Anyway, I thought Adam was a great guest.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   He had a lot of great value to it.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   >> I think --
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   >> And you -- you know, I have to say --
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   >> You disagree on a couple things.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   >> Well, and one of the best parts of the show were the places
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   where you and he really went back and forth, and I thought
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   that was really valuable.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   A lot of people thought it was great.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   >> Excellent.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   >> And then there are people who hate -- you know, Jason
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Calicanis is on another twit -- on "Twill" that this week
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   in law this week.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And boy, you just say the name Jason Calicanis and every -- the
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   people come out of the woodwork.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   >> I will not listen to a show with Jason Calicanis.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   They don't even give them a chance.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   They don't even listen.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   >> I wonder what -- you know, that's -- yeah, it's pretty
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   weird.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I mean, I actually have that element that's always out there
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   like leaning around you.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   >> People do that with you.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But they don't do it to the extreme that they do these.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I mean, at least once they hear me a few times and they
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   realize that I'm not like just a Mac Basher or a Microsoft
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   shill, which I get accused of, when that's by as far from the
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   truth as you can get.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   You know, they kind of backed off and they -- I don't -- they
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   actually don't see too many negative comments.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Maybe I'll encourage that now.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   >> I was going to say that might be a bad sign.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   But thing, most people just, you know, they appreciate the
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   fact that I'm going to just have a different perspective.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   >> So what's the deal with AACS, the official AACS body now
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   admits that AAC -- well, they say it hasn't been broken.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   They say it's kind of a fine line, a fine distinction.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   >> Compromised?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   >> Yeah, they say the keys are getting out now.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   But for whatever reason, you're seeing HD DVD and I think
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   soon Blu-ray movies in full quality on BitTorrent now,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   on BitTorrent's trackers.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   >> They are?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   >> Are you seeing Blu-ray too, Robert?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   It's all out there now.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   >> So both of them.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   >> It's both have been cracked.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   >> The encryption has not been broken.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   It's solid.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's simply that the -- they found the weakest link and that
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   happened to be the player software currently available.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   >> Well, but it's always the link in this kind of thing.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Because in order to play back any protected content,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   the player has to have the key.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   >> True.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   >> So the key is in there.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   You know the way they found it, it's actually kind of cool.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   They take a memory dump of the -- they know what a key is
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   supposed to look like.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   They take a memory dump of the machine as it's playing back
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   the protected content and they scan through it until they
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   find the key.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   >> There you go.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   >> Well, actually you can do it, you know, do it side by side
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   and parallel, somebody taking two memory dumps to two different
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   graphics.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   There would be another way of doing it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   >> That's a real easy way to see some differentiation.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   But, you know, the funny thing is there was another story there
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   around which is kind of like this one, which is the fact there
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   was a study done -- and I'm not the solutions research group
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   or this is that claims now that -- and I find this to be
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   bull.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   I just do not believe it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   That there's this huge number of Americans just in general
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   that are downloading copyrighted movies.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I haven't even downloaded a copyrighted movie.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   >> And they say it's not that they're dishonest.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   They're cheap.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   That's why they're doing it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   >> I know a lot of them like that.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   >> Oh, they are.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   >> Okay, wait a minute.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   >> They're not going to get you a district.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> Oh, come on, a few guys are doing a lot of it and then
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   nobody else is doing it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   >> Who on this panel has -- I'll be the first -- I've
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   downloaded movies on the Internet.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   >> Yeah, you were talking about myself.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   >> I don't get all three of you downloaded a movie.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   >> You download a movie.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   >> None of you guys are typical users.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   >> Well, are college students typical users at this point, John?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Would a college user be considered a typical user of the
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   -- >> They know how to do it.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   >> What are college --
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   >> Okay, so some college kids are downloading these movies.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   >> There's a lot of colleges.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Let's say there's only what?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Maybe 20 million people using -- torrents.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   >> I just think that this is exaggerated.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   I'm not saying that college kids aren't doing it because they
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   can't afford the time they got the connection they put it on
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   overnight even though a lot of colleges block this sort of
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   thing which makes it impossible.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   >> They make it sound like the average Joe who just picked up
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   a computer at best by a few weeks and goes downloading
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   movies and said he could even figure out how to do it.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   >> It's not that mysterious.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I agree with you the vast majority of people aren't.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And I think the studies like this are maybe more aimed at
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   trying to drum up more support for anti-piracy.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Then they are really true studies.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   But I think a lot of people do it.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   More than the movie industry would like.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   So what do you think?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   >> The two people doing it is more than they'd like.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   You search any torrent site and it's pretty easy to find that
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   content.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   >> Pirate Bay, by the way, is not going to buy C land.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   They've raised $20,000 but the guy who owns C land, the old
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   coot who owns this gunnery platform out in the C is not
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   responding to their email anymore.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I don't know.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   >> The guy could be out there dead for all they know.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   >> He might have fallen.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   >> It's like what's the last time anyone has seen this coot?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   >> Fell off.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   So anyway, they've decided now they're going to buy an island.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So I don't know.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   >> Well, you know, I like the thing I talked about in
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Krypton, the problem when you were on an island is whether
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   or not somebody will cut the communications of that island
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   if you piss them off bed.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   >> Right.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   >> Moving into a space-based platform.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   >> How long before the MPAA has an army?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   A little navy has a boat shop.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   >> They may not have already.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   But I think satellite links will work and also I think just
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   ways of getting around.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   >> They can't cut a satellite link.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   >> That's true.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   >> I think there'd be better off selling passports personally.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   >> Probably Chinese just shot a satellite out of the sky.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   >> Oh, really?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   >> Wow.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   >> Was it a lot two weeks ago?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   They had their first successful test of a --
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   >> Oh, it wasn't like trying to --
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   >> They were just testing it.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   >> No, no, they were blowing up one other round.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   >> They had an old dog up there.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   They had to shoot it out.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   >> Take it down.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   >> No, you know, if you talk to people in the satellite
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   business, if anybody wants to know this, most of these
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   satellites have got enough fuel.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   They have to be repositioned constantly.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   So they're loaded with fuel and they get to move them here
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   and there to back it up.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   >> Yeah, successful.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   >> And, you know, for example, if you have satellite
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   TV like either Dish Network or the other one, you --
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   the satellite once in a while, especially what's the other
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   one?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   >> Direct TV.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   >> Yeah, direct TV.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   >> Direct TV.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   >> I had that for a while.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And their satellites would always be moving out of position.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It would take them a few weeks before they move them back.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   You could tell by the deterioration of the signal.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   >> Interesting.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   >> Anyway, so they move it back and forth.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And then when they get near the end of their life cycle, which
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   is really only a limited number of years, they leave just
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   enough fuel in them to blast them into space so they don't
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   come down.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   >> So they once they get to the -- they're losing, you know,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   their fuel is depleted.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   They have just enough to launch it into deep space, and
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   that's the end of them.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   We -- actually, the U.S. government and the Chinese
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   apparently -- now I had to do this -- apparently somebody
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   screws up and they leave the thing up there, and it's got no --
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   it's either never had fuel to begin with or it's just one of
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   these things orbiting or whatever.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   They don't really want it to come down for whatever reason.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   >> Yeah, but if you shoot at what happens, it comes up.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   >> Blow it up.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Then it comes down to lots of little pieces.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   >> Yeah, but those pieces all blow away.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   >> Well, the concern we had was that all of those little pieces,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   it's like a shotgun effect again.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Suddenly you have where there was one solid object,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   bigger object.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Now there's 500, 700 little objects all flying around
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   at 17,000 miles an hour.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   >> That would be bad.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   >> Yeah, they're a satellite.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   >> They have a satellite.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   >> Well, whatever the case is, they --
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   >> It's in space is big, though.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   >> That they claim it wasn't, you know, they weren't.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   >> You just want to know if one of those satellites is going
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   to start the International Space War, the Inter-Universal
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Space War, they're going to planet Terry.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   That would guess be the one in Space War.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   >> Reading too much science fiction, Patrick.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   >> Yeah, you say that now, but when that big ship goes.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   >> I'm ready.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   >> Where is that wormhole?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I need a wormhole.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   >> So, back to HDVD Blu-ray stuff real quick.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   I just don't see that even those files being posted online,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   the file sizes are so big and blank media.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   >> They're not losing money.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   >> If you wanted to burn that, it's like --
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   >> They're losing money.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   >> They're losing money every time I build this there.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   >> The original movie itself, so --
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   >> Right.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   >> It's impractical on all fronts to deal with that kind of context.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   >> Has anybody tried the new Netflix watch movies instead of
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   renting them?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   >> We've had several viewers reporting to us on D.L.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   TV on their experiences with the Netflix streaming system.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   >> I'm a Netflix subscriber, but they're rolling it out slowly
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   through June, and they haven't rolled it out to me yet.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   >> From pretty much everybody's side, it's very similar to the
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   existing online movie streaming systems.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Netflix apparently spent $40 million developing this one to
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   behave almost like every other one.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It's real early so far.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   We had one fellow that was kind of right up a few hundred words.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   And basically he said, "It looks really good.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Some things stream in like 30 seconds.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Others take like 20 minutes," which sounds a lot like all of
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   the other existing systems out there.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   The way they charge, I think, is the biggest difference.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   >> I wonder if 90% of that $40 million went toward content
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   licensing or something, because I don't picture any back end
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   you're setting up cost in that much.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   >> Well, you set aside the streaming fees and the bandwidth fees.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   >> It's not downloadable.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   You have to be online to watch it.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   There's no caching.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   >> It sounds like a loser.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   >> You could switch around.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   You get an hour from every buck you pay in subscriptions, an hour
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   a month for every buck you pay in subscriptions.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   >> I think we give them a chance, John, as if they're starting
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   with a user-paid base of what?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Six million people?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   >> I think it's significant in the sense that it's, you know,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I mean, Netflix needs a second axe, don't they?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   I mean, DVDs aren't going to be here forever.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I don't think they're going to be disappearing any time soon.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But what was this thing that the Skype guys are doing, Leo?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   >> Well, I'm juiced is another way to do this.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   It's hard to get a juiced token.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I'm lucky enough somebody, one of our listeners sent me one.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   If I had more invites, I would send them out, but I don't have any.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   >> Actually, if anybody has a juiced token, can you send it
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   to dl.tv@ziffdavis.com, please?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   >> So here what happens --
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   >> After you send one to John@devorek.4.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   >> Amber, well, thank you on the show.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   >> Amber covered it on her TV show in Toronto, and they sent her
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   like 40 tokens.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I was stuck.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   >> Amber's famous.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   We're just some schmucks.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Hey, I just want to tell you, I'm one of the 25 top web
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   summer others.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   >> Influencers?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   >> Some of the runs.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   >> You've been getting marketing computers again?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   >> 25 more.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   >> No, wait a minute.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   It's on Forbes.com.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I'll tell you what I am.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I am a web celeb.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I'm one of the 25 web celebs.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   >> What's this?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   >> Forbes.com.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   You've heard of them?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   >> No, those guys.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   >> Oh, you know, this is just another one of those lists.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   I know, and it's really stupid.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   >> You know, it's Forbes.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   >> How these lists are done again in my Patrick's book.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   >> I know, I know.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   >> You have a meeting, you sit around, use you over lunch,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   and you start dreaming up what those lists should be,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   because it's all vested interests, and then you start
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   jockeying for...
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Why?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I think you should be number one.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   No, no, he was number one last year.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   We can't do number one the same guy twice.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Let's do...
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Let's make him number three.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   That'll shake things up.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And then you make a phony baloney list, and you publish
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   and everyone pants.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   >> Actually, I'm reading this list.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   >> John, I'm reading this list, and they're not doing that bad.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   >> All right.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Matt Drudge, Seth Godin, Amanda Cogdon, Robert Scoble,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Mike Arrington.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   >> Yeah, but you skipped...
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Leo, you skipped Jessica Lee Rose, Perry's Hilton, and
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Marco's "I Can't Spell His Name."
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   >> Zuniga.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   >> Jessica Lee Rose is a lonely girl, 15.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Perez Hilton is a blogger, right?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   >> She's number one.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   >> Well, is it an order?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   >> Well, I guess it says "rank two."
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   So you're right.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Perez Hilton's "Celebrity Gossip Bloggers" number two.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   So I don't like the order here.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Marco's Molitsas Zuniga is a political blogger.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   He's Daily Coase, which actually is a great site.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Matt Drudge, I thought he was like Web 1.0.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   >> Drudge Report is...
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   >> Is this a Web 2.0?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   This is Web.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Is this...
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Is it...
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   Drudge Report still significant?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I think so.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   >> Is this based on traffic numbers?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   >> No, it's just...
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   >> No, it's based on...
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Hello, it's based on a meeting they had where they sat around.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   >> DrudgeReport.com, how many websites does this make?
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   >> Who is Hinderrach?
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   >> Never heard of him.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   >> Have you ever heard of him?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   >> All right.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Well, hey, I just was glad to get on the list.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Any list, believe me.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   >> Who's Violet Blue?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I don't know who these people are.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   >> She's a porn person.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   >> Oh, I read.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   I've actually...
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   >> Amanda Cogney.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   She was the Rocket Bloom.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Robert Scoble, we know he's been on Twitch.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   In fact, you know, it's interesting.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   >> Poor Doctor Ozzini Jardin.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   >> Yeah, at least four of these people have been on Twitch.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Jimmy Wales has been on a Twitch show.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   >> Well, how come they only put two of the boing boing people on there instead of...
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   >> They left front over a lot.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   >> Front over a lot.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   >> Yeah, hair front over.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   >> She needs Shardin.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   I just like Shardin.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   >> Shardin.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   >> Shardin.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   >> Merlin Mann, our good friend, another Twitter.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So we actually are well represented in here.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   >> Obviously, whoever made this list is a Twitter listener.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   So thank you.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Thank you very much to you.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   >> Wait, how do you get that, Leo?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   You're the only one listed that's a real true Twitter.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   >> Well, that's true, but all of these people...
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   >> Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   >> All right, why isn't a Dvorak on there?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   >> No, I don't really want to be on there.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   >> Yeah, yeah, you say that.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   >> But I think, you know, if we're all on the way, there's...
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I bet you we could put a better list together.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   >> We should.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   >> How does Jessica Lee Rose become number one?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   >> She shouldn't be...
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And the lonely girl 15, I don't get why she would...
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   >> She was a gimmick.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It was like a short-term phenomenon.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   >> Well, she's an actress.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I don't think she probably knows how to post a video.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   >> Right, she didn't do it.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   >> Right.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   >> Ouch.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   >> Well, she's 19.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Probably she doesn't...
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   >> She's huge.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   >> ... have a download.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   >> Yeah, she's huge.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   >> Well, you know, it's interesting to thought, how many people, you know, how many
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   bazillions of people who've watched the YouTube video she was in total.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   >> Hey, what's this video?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   >> No, it's not that good.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   >> Okay.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   >> It's a girl who can get a camera.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   >> Yeah, don't get talking.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   >> Don't get excited about...
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   >> You know, where's Michelle Mulkin on this thing?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   She gets bigger numbers than anybody in the top 10 of this list.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   >> Who's Michelle Mulkin?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   >> Oh, brother.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   >> I'm sorry, I'm out of it.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   >> She's the one of the top right-wing bloggers.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   >> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Actually, you know, there's a little controversy going on.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   >> She has huge numbers.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   >> Well, where's Arianna Huffington?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I mean, there's a lot of people...
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   >> Oh, how do you think that you have sharpness?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   >> She's got huge numbers.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   >> Jarvis is good, yeah.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   >> Jarvis is good, yeah.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   >> He's the only person older than me on this list.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   >> Okay, let's ask the real big question.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Where's Kevin Rose?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   >> He's not on this list, and that's why I like it.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   He's on every other tag-nabbit list.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   >> Beside the point, whether you like Kevin to be on every list or not, he should be on this list.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   >> You're right, he should be on this list.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   I don't know why he's not.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   I'll tell you why he's not.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   They said, "Ah, he was on the cover of Business Week.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   We can't use him."
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   >> That's exactly why when they had the meeting.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   >> They said, "Nah, I can't do it."
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   He's on, you know, he's already been done.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   He's been done.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   We need new people.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   >> So this is it.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   >> Yeah, they chose TechCrunch instead of Dig.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   >> Let's manufacture some news.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   >> So getting back to Juiced, the neat thing about Juiced is full screen streaming.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   What I really like is the interface.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   They have these kind of transparent widgets on top of it that allow you to, it's actually
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   very modern because they allow you to chat while you're watching the TV.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I mean, it's very interesting.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I think it's quite good.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   >> That sounds cool.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Right now they don't have much content.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.920]   There's like World Poker Tour and much music, the Canadian MTV.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.800]   But they're, they're, they're, they're pointed.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.000]   This is not pirated video unlike, you know, as you might expect, because these are the
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.640]   guys who did Kaza.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.680]   The point of it is, is to get deals with real content creators to get up on there.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.040]   I'd love to put call for help on there.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:52.000]   But the problem is you can't because cable companies would then say, "Well, yeah, but
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.200]   you're undermining our business, right?"
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.000]   So that's the wrong--
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.960]   >> No, who who?
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.960]   >> Well, the business models got them, got it changed, doesn't it?
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   You have, I mean, if it's an advertising based business model, it shouldn't matter who watches
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   or where or how, as long as the advertisements are still in there, right?
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   >> That's, that's--
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   >> Strikes me as so?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:17.120]   But it's not true if you are a cable channel, as Patrick Well knows, that was always an
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.320]   issue for us, right?
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.640]   >> So talking about, yeah, you actually get better numbers on the net than you do on those
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   cable channels.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.640]   >> Oh, I--
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.640]   >> So what--
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.940]   >> We get better numbers on that than in most mainstream media.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.940]   That's the dirtier little secret of the net.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.940]   >> Boy, you don't get to the 10 million.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.940]   >> No, you don't get Seinfeld numbers.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.940]   >> No.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.940]   >> Did you get--
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:35.940]   >> No.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.940]   >> You get CNN numbers?
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.940]   >> Oh, yeah, definitely.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.940]   CNN numbers are the reasons you get to.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.940]   >> Well, that's really--
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:40.940]   >> Yeah, exactly, that's my point.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.940]   >> Now, talking about that, there's a-- you're talking about numbers.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.940]   This story kind of jumped up at me.
[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.940]   Vince Serf saying that one quarter of all computers are now part of a bot net.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.940]   >> Wow.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.940]   Can you believe that?
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.500]   When he says one quarter, he's saying there are 600 million computers out there.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:01.380]   He guesses, his guesstimate is 150 million co-opted computers sending spam or attacking
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.540]   other computers.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.820]   >> Does anyone but me think that actually may be a low estimate?
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.820]   >> Yeah, I do.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.820]   >> Really?
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.820]   >> No, it's--
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.820]   >> It's probably half.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.820]   >> Half of all computers.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.820]   >> Half of all--
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:18.020]   >> I'd say half of all personal computers in people's homes contain some kind of malware,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.020]   definitely.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.020]   >> Holy cow.
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.620]   >> It's just-- it's too easy nowadays.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.740]   People aren't as critical about what they click on anymore or if they ever were to begin
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:31.700]   with, but it's with the way social engineering works nowadays and how easy it is to craft
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.660]   a site that looks like one thing and does another or poorly worded dialogue box or a
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.940]   well worded dialogue box just to get you to click yes and suddenly boom.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.820]   And it's not about destroying information anymore.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.380]   It's about taking a system over and doing it in a way that maybe you won't even notice
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.380]   it.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.260]   And it becomes then a profit making machine for a four-third party.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.300]   >> Well, it's a very good example of that just happened in Norway.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   Did you see this?
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.700]   A bank admitted that it's lost millions and millions of dollars to a Trojan horse that
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.420]   was created by a well-known hacker from Russia.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.900]   His name is the corpse.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.300]   I am the corpse.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.820]   >> That's awesome.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.100]   >> How does he longer the money that he steals from the bank?
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.100]   >> Well, here's the deal.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.340]   He doesn't actually do it.
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.340]   He writes the Trojan.
[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:21.780]   In fact, he'll customize the Trojan if you should ask.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.060]   And then what happens is it's a key logger.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.140]   So somebody goes to him and buys it.
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.140]   He has a website.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.140]   You can go on.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.140]   I'm not going to give you the address.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.340]   We can go online and buy these Trojans.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.700]   Get them customized should you choose.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.380]   In this case, it was customized to attack that particular bank.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.100]   They collected a lot of passwords.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.020]   Now, here's the problem is you do have to kind of go in and get the money at some point,
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.620]   whether it's at an ATM or in the bank itself.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.620]   >> Always an issue.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.620]   >> They have been arresting some people.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:58.020]   So the corpse makes his money selling the tools to bad guys who use the tools.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.620]   I think it was a huge amount of money.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.620]   It was a huge amount of money.
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.620]   It was $15 million or something like that.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.820]   >> Your time is reporting it as $1 million.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.820]   >> $1 million.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.820]   All right.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.260]   What's telling is that the bank's admitting it.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.220]   Because you know this happens all the time and banks don't admit it.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:18.220]   >> I was thinking I was at CES.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.940]   A unique idea of this is, of course, not that unique, not I mentioned it.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:27.180]   So you go into the press room and there's all these computers that are wide open.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.260]   And they're letting people log on.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:36.700]   If you just put key loggers on all those machines, you'd have passwords up the wazoo for these
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.420]   different guys that are logging into the New York Times and everything else.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.020]   >> Doesn't anybody know what it seems to think that this is like a problem?
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.020]   >> Actually, a lot of them will avoid.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.820]   >> Will they have smarter are these so-called journalists?
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.820]   >> Wow.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.820]   This is the caddy edition.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.820]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.820]   >> Exactly.
[00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.020]   >> I was thinking it took a back seat a little time ago.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:07.140]   >> Don't you think that most tech journalists are, you know, they're very casual about this
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:08.140]   stuff.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.140]   They don't, you know, go through a bunch.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.140]   >> I think so.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:15.180]   I mean, you know, it's, I mean, how many?
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.340]   >> For every Steve Gibson, there's 10,000 people to-
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.340]   >> Sure, but I mean-
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.340]   >> Randomly click keys on keyboards.
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.340]   >> And I'll tell you, I know, because we do this security now podcast.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.340]   Most people think Steve is kind of crazy paranoid.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.340]   >> I don't think-
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   >> Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that there aren't-
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.340]   >> People are trying to get-
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.340]   >> Yeah, after you.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.340]   >> I think you're-
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.420]   >> No, I mean, I don't, I don't put any, I don't use any, you know, I mean, it's interesting.
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.100]   I'll use, you know, my Google stuff on a secure connection, you know, and if I can see, if
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.860]   I can see the keyboard on, if I'm using a public machine, I usually, you know, see where
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.540]   it's connected into the back of the machine.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.660]   But yeah, I mean, I guess I figure who's going to want to read my email.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.660]   But it didn't-
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.100]   >> But then they have your email login forever, because how often do you change your email
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   login?
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.100]   >> A weekly.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.100]   >> You do?
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   >> No.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.100]   >> I was going to say I'm impressed.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.500]   >> Steve, I'm sure Steve Gibson does.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   >> We do.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.500]   >> That's a sweet random password generator too.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   >> Yeah.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   >> It's probably not remembering, you know, QX7 pound, four, three, spiral, spiral, tilde,
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.500]   seven, eight.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.140]   >> Do it at the time, you'll remember it.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.260]   >> Yeah, the problem is you won't next week when you change it.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.340]   >> You know what's bad for me is the darn biometric thing on my IBM ThinkPad.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.540]   I've gotten so used now to swiping my finger that I'll forget what the password was that
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.940]   I originally had set it up as.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.100]   So it's like I'm now being encouraged to change my domain password for here at work.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:42.660]   >> You know what I use that I love and I will recommend this is from Zarati Labs.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.380]   It is a password, a JavaScript password generator that's fantastic.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.020]   Chris Zarati does it.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:53.940]   If you go to labs.zarati, Z-A-R-A-T-E.org, what it does is you give it a master password
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:58.740]   and then it generates a unique password for every page you visit.
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.740]   You don't have to remember it because you remember your master password, but you're not
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.380]   giving it to anybody.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.660]   You're just using it to generate a unique password every time you go.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.020]   Does that make sense?
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.500]   >> It's very handy to actually use it all the time.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.860]   >> That sounds good.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.300]   >> It's a good way to do this with stuff, but yeah, you're right.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:21.060]   I mean, now you can get into Canada if you let them scan your eyeball.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.100]   I watched somebody do it when I was going up to Canada last week.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.540]   >> That's arguably my favorite biometric device I've ever used personally.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.220]   It's just I've had a machine scan my eye from probably 10 feet away and I didn't even
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.220]   know it was happening and it was tied into an ATM machine.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   >> Are they accurate?
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.260]   >> No, it's just apparently they're the most accurate way to go.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:47.060]   I mean, far more secure than using a fingerprint in terms of hackability.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.780]   It'd be a lot harder to create an iris and get it to scan that way as far as I know at
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:56.180]   least compared to say every other week you're hearing about somebody else creating a fake
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.420]   finger or lifting a latent fingerprint off of a glass and recreating that gel.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.620]   >> I think you're seeing those on movies because you keep watching them.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.900]   >> Hey, but they're high-def movies and they look good on a big screen.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.740]   >> Actually, you know what's interesting about this, that bank story to go back to the security
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.740]   aspect?
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:19.540]   >> According to New York Times, Nordia Bank is saying that only computers whose customers
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.820]   were not protected by antivirus programs to become victims and the virus was distributed
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:28.460]   with spam, e-mail, a program to infiltrate home computers of customers at several years.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.460]   >> There's a lie in there.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.460]   >> You're being an American bank.
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.580]   >> There's a lie in there where one of the bank officials basically says our customers
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.700]   are stupid and that's why this is happening.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.700]   What is the responsibility?
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.220]   That's a very good question though.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.940]   >> Well, according to the article, the bank is compensated all of its clients.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.660]   Thieves using the program in Sweden to fraud a 250 customers of Nordia's online banking
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.820]   service over a period of 15 months says in the New York Times.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.620]   >> And they only got a million bucks.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.820]   >> This notion that the customers are stupid is really kind of reprehensible.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.660]   The fact of the matter is why is the public supposed to be able to, are they all supposed
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.660]   to be IT experts?
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:09.020]   I mean, people buy these machines thinking that they're just a functional thing that
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.820]   does what it appears to do.
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.420]   They don't expect that they have to become like, you know, listen to security now all
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.420]   the time and become analysts and do whatever they have to do.
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.820]   It's just, I think it's crazy to call them stupid.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.220]   They're ignorant maybe, but only because these machines are kind of crummy.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.420]   >> I agree with you.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.260]   But the good news is Tuesday Vista comes out.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.460]   We don't have to worry about this anymore.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.820]   >> Which brings us to the more interesting story.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.580]   >> Which is Bill Gates appearing on The Daily Show.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.580]   >> Oh, yes.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.580]   So can't wait for this.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.020]   That's going to be awesome.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.780]   >> Now, which would be better for him to be on The Daily Show or Colbert?
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.820]   I don't just, I mean, who's going to be tougher on Bill Gates?
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.900]   >> Well, you know, Colbert stuff's always political.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.300]   So, you know, I think Colbert, not you mentioned it, might be a more funnier interview.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   Or funnier interview.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.580]   >> He'd be willing to dance around him and make Bill look silly.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.940]   I have to say, I don't think John Stewart's going to do that.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.780]   >> No, he's going to play it straight and I think it's going to be, it'll be interesting
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.620]   to see how it works because I think we should come up with a drinking game before it happens
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:14.900]   because we got to see how many times Bill says really, really with the two relis together.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.900]   He says that all the time.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   >> So that's a drinkable set.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.860]   >> And then another one is, we'll see.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.860]   >> I'm going to say innovation.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.860]   >> Oh yeah.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.700]   >> And he'll have a bunch of, it's about five buzz words that he uses over and over and
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.700]   over again.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.620]   >> If he says, "Zoon," you have to stop drinking for the rest of the show.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.100]   He's not going to say, he's not going to say.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:37.340]   >> I don't think "Zoon" is the most sobering word in Bill's book, "Habbular."
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.540]   I think Windows Home, Windows Personal Server or is it Windows Home Server?
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.540]   >> The cheap version.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.540]   >> They announced it.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:47.420]   Yeah, the Home Server is cool.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.420]   I love that.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.420]   Do you like that Home Server?
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:50.420]   >> Great idea.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.420]   >> I've never used it.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.180]   The problem with this interview, by the way, is that John Stewart is not a computer geek.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.780]   I mean, he serves the net and that's about it from what I can tell.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.300]   >> Well, yeah, but that should be enough to, you know, that in a room full of talented
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.860]   writers should be enough to give John Stewart enough.
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.460]   Okay, well, how many people do you don't have it had a problem with a computer that they
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.460]   wouldn't want to blame on?
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.100]   >> Well, maybe he's more of a geek than you might give him credit for.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   >> I bet he has a good question.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100]   >> I bet he does.
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.980]   Let's talk about this Windows Home Server.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:18.980]   Do you not like that?
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.700]   Patrick, I thought that looked like a pretty cool product.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.380]   >> I think the idea is there.
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:31.300]   I just think it's funny that I just, you know, having recently been through some Windows
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.780]   servers that got savage issues.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.820]   >> The idea is it's network attached storage that is smart, right?
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:39.820]   You just plug it in.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.820]   >> Yeah.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.540]   >> And I mean, like any of a number of, you know, I mean, I'm sitting here thinking like,
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.940]   you know, there's got to be a, like, yeah, it's the future.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.940]   Right?
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:49.940]   Everybody's getting networks and all this.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:51.820]   >> Well, nobody, yeah, nobody wants to configure a NAS.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:56.940]   >> They should have backups in place, you know, people want to stream media.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.580]   And this is certainly something that, you know, all our nerdy friends have been doing
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.740]   forever.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:06.860]   But it just, it's, I just keep thinking, you know, it's just one more Windows box to
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   get rooted.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   >> Right.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.860]   There's a cool thing that it does.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.820]   It also monitors the health of your computers on the network.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:17.820]   So it actually, you get this dashboard, you could see how all the computers are doing
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.700]   whether the antivirus is working and so forth and so on.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.700]   >> Yeah.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.740]   Well, antivirus working is not necessarily enough.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:24.740]   >> That doesn't mean much, doesn't.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.740]   >> You know what I mean?
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.940]   >> It always goes back to the end user.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.980]   I mean, if they click on the file, there's nothing you can do to stop that.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.780]   >> Well, that's what the bank was saying is that, you know, if they're going to, if
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:37.420]   they're going to fall for phishing scams, I have to say though, every bank now is using
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.620]   this stupid, almost using an expletive site key.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.780]   Have you been plagued by the site key?
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:46.740]   You know what that is?
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.380]   When you go to your bank, Bank of America does it, I've seen another one of my--
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.100]   >> Well, Fargo doesn't, as far as I know.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.580]   >> You go there and they show you a picture that's a unique picture, you know, a donut
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.380]   or a ski boot and they say, "Remember this picture.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.820]   If you don't see this picture, you're not on your banking site."
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.660]   So that way, if you go to phishing scam and I go to Bank of America and I don't see the
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:11.540]   donut and then there's a phrase that goes with the donut that you're supposed to say,
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.820]   "You know, something like--"
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.820]   >> Oh, this is E-I.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.980]   >> This is my donut.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.660]   So that you'll see the donut and you'll see the phrase and say, "Oh yeah, okay, this
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.660]   is my bank."
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.780]   So I inevitably write stupid, effing site key image.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.540]   >> You know what the thing is, is that this is like--
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:28.540]   >> It's treating people like--
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   >> It's like--
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.540]   >> It's like--
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.540]   >> No, no, it's like--
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.540]   >> Well, which is it going to be?
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.900]   Is it going to be easy to use with things that people who study, how people remember
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.820]   things and put together at the request of banks with 50 pockets?
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.580]   >> Now, you're missing the point about these kinds of things.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:50.220]   This is like the little holograms they put on credit cards for a while.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.820]   If you went into any place-- so you had a credit card number, a credit card machine
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.620]   that could crank out, you know, just punch the numbers onto the card and put, you know,
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.620]   bank of whatever.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.140]   It doesn't make any difference.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   With or without the hologram, they still go through the system the same way.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.460]   You know, the hologram doesn't have anything--
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.460]   >> Well, no.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:13.540]   >> It's a bad-- oh, whatever they use that thing.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.540]   This is to that.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.540]   What's that?
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.540]   >> An analogy.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.540]   >> An analogy.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.540]   >> Thank you.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.260]   It's a bad analogy because in this case, the hologram is being-- you know, basically what
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.460]   would happen is you would have to come to the-- the hologram is being hosted by the bank
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:32.380]   and you only get a chance to approve the hologram, you know, when you log into the bank.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.380]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.540]   This is-- you're not relying on somebody else's pay attention.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.540]   >> Are you talking about the site key?
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.540]   >> Right, right.
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.180]   Well, what-- I mean, that's-- the hologram is like the CSC now.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.620]   Everybody asks you for that three digit number on the back of your card.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:47.220]   Like, that's somehow magical and no one could get that number.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.580]   I don't understand these security--
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.580]   >> Well, no.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.580]   What's important about-- well, yeah.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:55.460]   I mean, what the thing that's magic about that number is that number doesn't show up
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.500]   when somebody's doing a credit card flimsy.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.500]   >> Right.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.820]   >> So they can't like, you know, write down all the credit card numbers.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.500]   >> So they had to make sure they randomly call them.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.500]   >> Right.
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.500]   They just have to flip it over.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.140]   >> Yeah, they get them in the restaurant when they take your credit card to the back and
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.140]   write it down.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.140]   >> Right.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.620]   >> That's along with your-- your accurate home phone number, your address.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:19.020]   >> Are you the kind of person when you leave your car with the valet only gives them the
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.060]   car key or do you give them the whole key ring?
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.620]   >> I can-- I give them the-- I don't have-- I'm going to pick up truckers.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.620]   I mean, anything with a lockable truck.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.020]   >> No, but the reason-- the reason you're not supposed to give them the whole key ring
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.980]   is because then they get your registration out of the car.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.980]   They get your home address.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.180]   They get copies of your keys to your house.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.340]   And then later they rob you.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.940]   >> Yeah, I saw that Miami Vice episode two.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.940]   >> My car key is the only key on that key ring.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.100]   >> See, you see, you're smart.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.100]   That's good.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.740]   >> I keep that totally separate from us.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:50.900]   >> Keep it totally separate.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.900]   So--
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.660]   >> Like you didn't know anybody at Yale that was doing this kind of stuff with their gig parking
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.140]   cars at the restaurant.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.940]   >> I know, of course not.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:02.180]   So a teacher is in trouble for being dumb.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.580]   In fact, actually, this is a pretty serious story.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.580]   A teacher's facing--
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.700]   >> Yeah, horrible story.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:15.460]   >> Teacher's facing 40 years in prison because she had pop-ups on her computer, showed pornographic
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.460]   images.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.340]   >> It was a porn storm old fashioned old school.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.780]   >> She was convicted by a jury of four counts of risk of injury to a minor.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.780]   >> Yeah.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.540]   >> And then she was sentenced March 2nd because she let the filtering system lapse.
[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.540]   Somehow she's--
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.660]   >> No, no, it's even worse than that.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:41.620]   She went to tell, I guess, the administrators at the school that the filters weren't working.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.620]   And it's just--
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.620]   >> Ah.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.620]   >> It's just it's wrong.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.220]   >> She's a substitute teacher.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.220]   It's spyware.
[00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.900]   It wasn't that she went to a porn site.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.980]   This jury clearly doesn't know the distinction.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.460]   This woman could go to jail.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.940]   >> Well, her attorney was obviously incompetent.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.940]   >> Well, that's seriously.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:57.940]   >> Yeah, what kind of--
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:58.940]   >> That's the one out of the computer.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.940]   >> What is the DA thinking?
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.660]   I mean, the state attorney that apparently-- or the state prosecutor that covered this
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:07.460]   made the comment publicly, which we have-- you can read this on the blog, by the way,
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:08.660]   of a pretty good analysis.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.020]   But it was like-- the guy says, well, she could have unplugged the computer.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.260]   You know, most people don't-- you know, it's not-- it's not that-- if you're a substitute
[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.100]   teacher, you don't think about unplugging the computer if you don't know anything about
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.660]   computers because most people would think, well, maybe I'll ruin it.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.660]   >> Well, you don't know what's going on anyway.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.660]   How many of you have-- we've all had a porn storm.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.660]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.380]   I think they're pretty rare now.
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.380]   I haven't seen one for a long time, but they can happen.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.540]   >> Well, this also-- I mean, this happened in 2004, by the way.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.540]   >> Yeah, that's when the porn storm--
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.540]   >> Yeah, that's when the porn storm--
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.540]   >> --is running through the war system.
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.740]   >> Yeah, by the way, the prosecution says she actively visited these sites.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.740]   >> Oh, bull.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.820]   >> And even if she did, though, so what?
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:47.820]   How is this a crime--
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.820]   >> Well, it's because she--
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.420]   >> Well, you don't visit porn sites while the kids are watching.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.780]   >> They're not sitting in a school as a substitute teacher visiting porn sites.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.940]   I don't think it makes no logical sense.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.940]   It's bull.
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.900]   >> Even if it were all true, if that's the worst thing that ever happens to these kids,
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:03.460]   please-- I mean, it's just--
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.260]   >> Well, you should even make this assumption that if it was-- if it was not true, this
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:11.380]   is obvious, this woman has been railroaded, and we should put up with it.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:16.460]   >> A computer consultant who was an expert witness but not allowed to fully testify says
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.140]   if there's an appeal and the defense is allowed to show the entire results of my forensic
[00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.660]   exam in front of experienced computer people, including a computer illiterate judge and
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.700]   prosecutor, she'll walk out of the courtroom as a free person.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.700]   That's the problem.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.500]   These people are completely illiterate.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.580]   >> Yeah, it sounds like the substitute teacher is not that bright either for whatever the
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.380]   legal representation-- >> That's the point, but why should she go to jail for 40 years
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.380]   because she's not too bright?
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.300]   >> Well, even her-- >> What is that a crime?
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.500]   >> It's like, well, it sounds like a simple, open and shut case for any decent attorney
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   to get yada, so--
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.140]   >> Well, first of all, as someone who comes from a family of teachers, substitute teachers
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.980]   make jacks, so she probably can't afford a decent attorney.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.700]   >> Sure, it's a very important-- >> Second of all, the RTV.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.700]   >> Second of all, the RTV.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.700]   >> Second of all, the RTV.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.060]   >> Yeah, but the RTV director, you know, you read articles about this and the RTV director
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.300]   is telling the school board that the software hadn't been updated because Symantec hadn't
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:14.660]   since the updated license for the software, which for me it says that the school's not
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.740]   using the filtering software that should be running or it's not maintaining the filtering
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.260]   software that should be running.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.420]   >> The-- >> It's just a mess.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.500]   >> The expert said that the evidence was she went to crayola.com and then after that,
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:31.620]   somebody went to a site about hairstyles which loaded a JavaScript that spawned the pop-ups.
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.980]   So she didn't go to a porn site.
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:39.220]   This is ridiculous and the fact that that testimony wasn't allowed and-- I mean, a miscarriage
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.940]   of-- >> This case is gonna get thrown out.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.420]   This is just beyond--
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.620]   >> Yeah, but you know, has it already wrecked this woman's career?
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.180]   >> Well, there she was convicted.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.700]   I mean, she's been convicted of this.
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.260]   That's appalling.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.980]   >> It's sad is what it is.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.660]   >> Well, politicians and judges apparently aren't keeping up with technology.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:58.820]   >> Oh, what's in the should be?
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.620]   >> Yeah, welcome.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.220]   That's been pretty obvious for a while.
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.100]   So how many of you VISTA comes out Tuesday?
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.540]   How many of you are going to rush out and buy a VISTA computer?
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.180]   >> Not a computer, but--
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.180]   >> Okay, I know you don't buy them.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.180]   >> I've got VISTA installed.
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.620]   >> I didn't want to copy the OS though.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:18.540]   >> How many of you want VISTA?
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.540]   Maybe I should ask that.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.180]   >> I'm gonna wait.
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.540]   >> Patrick, you already have them, sure, on most of your machines, yeah?
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:27.340]   >> Yeah, I'm not really qualified to answer this question.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.340]   >> You've been VISTA fine.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.540]   >> I have to run-- yeah, I have to run VISTA so I can answer all the questions about VISTA.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:32.540]   >> Right.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.540]   >> What do you think about it so far?
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:34.540]   What do you think?
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.540]   What do you guys think about it?
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.540]   >> It's like-- >> Should we go on--
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.540]   >> Only it's shiny.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.340]   >> I got to show a lot of good stuff.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.900]   >> Watch T.L.T.B. on Tuesday, John.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   >> I love it.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.900]   I love it too.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.140]   I think there's a lot of good stuff to search.
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.780]   I mean, just the fact that you could search the start menu for one thing.
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.180]   But you know what, really, and I wish this were being covered more, I think the bigger
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.540]   upgrade, the more important upgrade, and frankly, the more impressive upgrade, is office.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.780]   >> Yeah, why?
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.020]   >> I think the new office UI is--
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.020]   >> Magnificent.
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.700]   >> It's gutsy as hell on Microsoft.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.300]   >> I've both got it two or three times for you the last year.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.780]   >> You've used it for a while.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:10.300]   It's brilliant and you know what, it's gutsy because you're taking a well-known user
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.300]   interface.
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.780]   I mean, I was shocked.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.820]   And you're throwing it out, but it's a much improved user interface.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.700]   >> Well, you can still get to what is effectively the old interface, a shinier version, but
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.980]   the ribbon and what they've done, they spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:31.260]   make the functionality more accessible, easier to judge, easier to basically preview things
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.500]   that have to destroy your document in the process.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.580]   It's a pretty amazing job.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.740]   I mean, I wouldn't think Microsoft could pull that kind of an interface job.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.740]   I like it.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:46.180]   >> I'm blown away and I think in many ways it deserves more attention, frankly.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.460]   I mean, it's important, but I think that-- and by the way, the guy I'd like to get on the
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.580]   show at some point to talk about this is Jensen Harris.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.860]   He's kind of been responsible for this UI and I think deserves a lot of credit.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.060]   He really knows what he's doing.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.060]   He's a blogger.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.100]   If you can read his Microsoft blog.
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:11.820]   Speaking of Microsoft blogs, Microsoft finally responded to the Peter Gutman Vista Content
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.780]   Protection article and they corrected a few things, but mostly they just said, "Well,
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.340]   that's just the way it is."
[00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:25.780]   Their attitude is, "Well, you know, you kind of have to put up with it if you want to
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.580]   watch high quality content."
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:34.900]   Anyway, Jensen Harris' blog is JensenH.
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.820]   Logs.msdn.com/jensenH.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.340]   And he talks about some of the new features in 2007.
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:45.500]   It's worth taking a look at just to kind of see what can be done with the room.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.700]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.460]   Any other stories anybody wants to talk about?
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.500]   Anything in the blog, John, that caught you around?
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.140]   >> There's something that came up just recently that was kind of interesting.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.980]   Oh, yeah, this is good.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   Hold on.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.980]   >> Juicy.
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:02.980]   Is it juicy?
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.340]   >> Well, it's this story that Diane Feinstein is now pushing.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:17.620]   In fact, there's a bunch of people pushing a new bill S256 to make the internet radio ruin
[00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:19.100]   it basically.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.580]   And this other story that we ran is, "Don't help grandma write her will or you might be
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.260]   sued for practicing law without a license."
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:30.820]   This is going to be very interesting because apparently somebody using a quick and will
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:37.500]   maker or something from no low press, they ended up getting their inner ringer for practicing
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.940]   law without a license, which makes no sense.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.940]   >> Oh, man.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.020]   Why didn't into it get in trouble?
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.780]   Why did the guy get in trouble?
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.620]   >> He was using the Intuit software.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.980]   >> That's just a good point.
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.900]   >> That was the ones who were impersonating the lawyer, not the guy.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:58.460]   And then the other story that came up last night, I noticed, was the Sony denying that
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:03.540]   this, that there was a bunch of rumors or gossip or allegations that Sony wasn't going
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:08.620]   to let Blu Ray run porn and they said it's bull.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:09.620]   >> Good news.
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:10.620]   Vivid is now introduced.
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:11.860]   The first Blu Ray porn title.
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.020]   >> What's the name of it, Leo?
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.780]   >> I don't know, but I'll look it up for you.
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.180]   >> It's got some really weird names.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.180]   >> Does it?
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.180]   >> Yeah, I think I'm going to go with this.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.180]   >> Let me Google it.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.180]   >> That's kind of scares me, which you know that much about it already.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.180]   >> You know why I know?
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:28.800]   Because somebody sent me an email saying, you know, I get so much email saying I'm a fan
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.420]   boy on one camper another.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.300]   >> You HD DVD fan boy, you said that porn wouldn't be on Blu Ray.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.540]   Will I defy you to correct you, Sam?
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.940]   >> Well, Sony originally said they were going to support it.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.900]   >> That's getting close to the comic book guy's voice.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.500]   I want you to work on that a little more.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.820]   >> I'm going to defy you to correct you, Sam.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:51.220]   So I'm looking for the name so we can correct.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.300]   Vivid is, I know it's vivid.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.300]   That's all I know.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.300]   I don't know what the name is.
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.300]   >> Yeah, they have the hottest chicks.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.300]   They've been wicked.
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.300]   >> They do?
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.300]   >> I really don't want to have this conversation.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.300]   >> I do.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.300]   >> I think it's Debbie does Dallas again.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:10.300]   That was the huge poster right across from us where we were shooting D.L.TV in Vegas.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.860]   >> For six long days.
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.140]   >> It was 40 foot by 20 foot poster of that DVD and it right at the bottom or that movie
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.100]   and right at the bottom it showed both the HD DVD logo and the Blu Ray logo.
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:21.660]   >> And it will be on both.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.660]   >> That's right.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:23.660]   Blu Ray and HD DVD.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:30.380]   >> Here's another story on the blog.org/blog for any of you who haven't visited.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.060]   Have a drink.
[00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.140]   Apple declares, or Norway declares Apple's iTunes illegal.
[00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.540]   I thought that was pretty funny.
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.700]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.860]   The Norwegian consumer counselor.
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.100]   >> Well, the very sweet one is for consumer protection.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.180]   >> The consumer protection here?
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.180]   >> Yeah.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.180]   >> No, we do not.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   >> No, we do not.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:59.180]   >> The consumer, Ambudzmann, and the Ambudzmann returned with a ruling that in fact Apple's
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:05.220]   iTunes store is illegal under Norwegian law because if you buy a song there you have to
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:10.060]   play it on an iPod and they're saying Apple, if you want to keep doing business in Norway,
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:15.020]   you have to allow other manufacturers, you either have to open your DRM or allow other
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.540]   manufacturers to license it.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.620]   Which means Apple's just going to say, "I see you later, Norway."
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.260]   How many songs could they possibly sell in Norway?
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:26.540]   >> Well, I don't think this is a sea, you know where I problem because it's France and
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:27.780]   Germany and Norway.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.780]   >> Okay.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:29.780]   >> And possibly-
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:30.780]   >> So that's now a thousand songs.
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:32.460]   >> The whole EU could go that way.
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:33.460]   >> The EU could go.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.460]   >> Yeah.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.460]   >> That's a good question.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.740]   >> Does that one, Apple starts to care?
[00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.620]   >> Yeah, I think Apple cares now.
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.620]   >> Yeah, I hear it.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:44.780]   >> Apple's probably got fleets of lawyers going now because if we lose Europe, we lose the
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.780]   United States.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.780]   >> Yeah, it's World War II, man.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.780]   >> Geopolitics.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:52.580]   >> Apple has until October 1st to open fair play, that's the DRM.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:59.300]   Other companies are face finds and the threat of iTunes being closed in Norway.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.300]   What is their choice?
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.620]   I mean, they're not going to open fair play, are they?
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.620]   Or are they?
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.860]   >> Did you get your junk or you had a fair play?
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:06.860]   >> Yes.
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.740]   >> Compatible encryption scheme so you could then?
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:09.740]   >> He did.
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:11.740]   >> I don't know if it's legal or you're ever going to get your tune on iTunes.
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:12.740]   >> It's not.
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   You're not going to see Sony putting on their MP3 player.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.740]   But yes, there's a way to do that.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.780]   >> There's a way to do everything.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:24.100]   >> You know what, you can't load up in iTunes with music any other way than using the iTunes
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.740]   software or an iPod using anything else but the iTunes software?
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.740]   Is that true?
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.740]   >> No, that's not true.
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.540]   There's actually quite a few media ape, I think, is one.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.380]   There are many programs that will sync your eye.
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.380]   >> Okay.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.780]   >> I mean, but again, you have the issue of if it's copy protected, nobody else.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:41.780]   You have to use iTunes.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.780]   >> Okay.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.300]   >> But if it's just standard music, you don't have to.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.300]   But that's true Windows Media Player.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:50.940]   If you have protected Windows Media files, you have to use Windows Media Player in a licensed
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.940]   player, right?
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.940]   >> Certainly.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.780]   >> Well, the difference is, of course, that Microsoft licenses its DRM.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.660]   >> So I think we're done.
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.660]   >> We're done.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:06.620]   I'm going to be heading off for New York to do Regis and Kelly, not at the same time.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.620]   I'll be doing it on Tuesday.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.620]   >> You're going to do the show, you mean?
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:09.620]   >> I mean, the show on Tuesday.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.620]   >> Yeah, I can't wait to get out of here.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.620]   >> Did you say something?
[00:53:11.620 --> 00:53:18.420]   I said it was blank memory where something John responded to went.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.940]   >> Yes, you missed all the fun.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.380]   I'm sorry, Patrick.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:27.060]   But good news is Debbie does Dallas again is on Blu-ray.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:30.260]   >> How old is this woman, Debbie?
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.260]   >> We should put it in.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.260]   >> Come here, boys.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:37.100]   >> Since the new Debbie's been right.
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:41.700]   >> We've gotten her rained a little bit recently for bringing up the whole subject of porn,
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.700]   but it's one person.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.700]   >> One old bitty.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.340]   >> We're not, we're not.
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.060]   >> It's a viable outlook, Roger.
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.060]   >> We're talking.
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.820]   >> Excuse me, Robert.
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.860]   >> Roger's making faces at me through the night.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.380]   >> Roger there, I invited Roger.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.780]   He never, he, what does he not want to be on the show anymore?
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.780]   >> He hates you, Leo.
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.780]   >> Yeah, pretty much.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.860]   >> That's because I'm a top 25 web celeb.
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:06.860]   >> Yeah.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:07.860]   >> It's just jealous.
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.900]   >> Remember, the same people you meet on the way up with the people you meet on the way
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:12.900]   down.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.940]   >> I'm trying to figure out which direction I'm going.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.940]   >> Going sideways.
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.940]   >> sideways more.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.340]   >> No, actually there's some good news.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:21.940]   The KFI radio show I do is going to be nationally syndicated.
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:26.500]   I did a deal with Premier Radio Networks, which is the number one syndicator in the country.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.220]   They do Dr. Laura, they do Rush Limbaugh.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.380]   They do all the big shows.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.980]   >> Oh, those two my favorites.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:36.780]   >> I don't know if they do like us.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.460]   >> I should, I should get a list.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:41.940]   >> Anyway, I'm very pleased.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.940]   You know what, they really get it.
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.740]   I'm very happy and we're going to be starting that in a couple of weeks.
[00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.980]   So call your local talk show, talk station and say, "I want to Leo."
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:54.500]   And you guys, I'm all the twig guys, I'm going to appear on the show too.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:59.220]   I'm going to have Steve Dusicurity, Devorac, a drinking game, I don't know, whatever.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.060]   Well, Robert, Robert can review Blu-ray porn movies.
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.060]   It'll be great.
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.260]   It's going to be really, it's a big, a big party.
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:11.180]   DL.tv will have a special show on Tuesday to celebrate Vista.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.180]   Vista?
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.940]   >> Or they help you survive.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.180]   >> The Vista Survival Guide.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:21.380]   I'm actually going to show Vista on Regis and Kelly on Wednesday.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:26.340]   >> You know, I'm going to watch Regis and Kelly just until I can watch that whole scene.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:31.260]   >> The three minute Vista demo on Regis and Kelly, it should be quite interesting.
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:32.980]   >> Tell us everything about Vista.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:33.980]   >> What is Windows?
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.980]   Why don't you talk about it?
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.980]   Why do I need this?
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.980]   Why do you need this?
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.980]   >> John is at his blog, John C. Devorac, of course, is the owner, the author, the editor,
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:46.500]   and the guy with the good pictures on devorac.org/blog.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.860]   We didn't say it enough this week.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.260]   >> Yeah, I'm losing my touch here.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.380]   >> I don't know about you, John.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.100]   I mean, there's a lot of sober people listening.
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:59.700]   >> I keep forgetting to do it on the Cranky Geek show and I'm, you know, coasting here.
[00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:00.700]   >> Oh, yeah, Cranky Geeks.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.700]   Let's plug Cranky Geeks.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.500]   >> Yeah, PCMag.com and also Marker Watch.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:07.140]   I'm very happy to say that we had a little trouble.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:12.820]   I never really wanted to be in the rag trade and I think the initial version of the Twitch
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:15.220]   store was, let's face it, a complete failure.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:20.100]   We're going to work on a way to refund everybody.
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:23.780]   Any bad merchandise, if you're unhappy with your merchandise, let me know and I'll refund
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.460]   your money totally.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:28.220]   But the good news is that Scott Jordan has stepped to the plate.
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.980]   He does the great Scott Eves stuff.
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:34.220]   We're going to do some Scott Eves twit fleeces that were going to be gorgeous.
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.900]   They're going to be sold on ThinkGeek.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:39.660]   I mean, these are the two biggest brands in my mind in this area.
[00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:43.740]   So we finally got a good vendor.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.980]   Look for those sometime in the next few weeks.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:49.820]   I'm going to, we're going to take next week off because I'm going to be on a geek cruise
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.660]   but we'll be back in two weeks.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.020]   And if John has his way, we'll do a best of next week.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.220]   I don't know how that's going to happen.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.980]   Send me a best of.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:01.580]   Everybody listening, send me a best of and I will post it.
[00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:02.660]   How about that?
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:03.820]   Let them do the job.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.820]   What should the topic be?
[00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:09.380]   I think we should do a wrap up with it last year, the best of 2006.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:10.380]   That would be good.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:11.380]   We haven't done that.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:14.060]   You know, just a hit from each show throughout the year.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.060]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.820]   Okay, that's your challenge.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:21.620]   Editors get to work the best of 2006 next week on Twit if somebody does it for me.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.060]   And they'll also get a credit on the show.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:28.620]   They'll get a credit on the show and I will give them a Scott Eves twit fleeces.
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.620]   There we go.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.420]   Now we're up in the ante.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:32.420]   And infamy.
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.420]   And infamy.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.420]   Hey, thanks everybody.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.420]   It's good to talk to you.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:37.420]   We will see in a couple of weeks another twit.
[00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.420]   This is amazing.
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.420]   He's in the can.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:58:07.380]   I have to be careful what I shoot at last time I was shooting around.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:14.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:22.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:25.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:29.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:32.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:39.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:47.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:52.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:57.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:04.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:12.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:18.380]   I'm going to be in the game.
