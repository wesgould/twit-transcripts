[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Nope, nope, that's wrong.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Hello there.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Thank you for laughing.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Ben Brunch, Brock Johnson is here all the way to my right.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   He's a senior producer at WBUR.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Great to see you, Ben.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He's in his tiny.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   He's in his tiny.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   He's trying to be back.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Well, we love having you.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You know, it's a rotation, my friend.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   It's a rotation.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   No, I love being in the rotation.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   You were on the DL, but we brought you back.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   He's in the cut.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   In his tiny, you say this is your tiny studio, your tiny partner.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's behind me.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The tiny pie.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Oh, look at that.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, it is tiny.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   There's a little cat.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   There's a tiny little cat back there.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Is a cat podcasting right now?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Oh, that's so cute.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That's burn and debt.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Burn and debt.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And she's surrounded by soundproofing.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   She probably loves it in there.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   She has lots of feelings about foldable phones.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Get ready.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Good.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   We're going to need that.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Also with us, he is the creator of nine to five Mac, nine to five Google and electric magazine,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and it's a great day.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's a great day.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's a great day.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You're welcome.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh, it's a great day.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So it's a great day.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm going to be a little bit closer to the city.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more interested in that.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.240]   >> Yeah, Anti and Occult bought one last year
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.560]   and he encouraged me to move to it
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.760]   and I decided to move to it
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.320]   and I installed it last night.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.960]   It has a real physical remote,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.600]   I don't have to use my phone if I don't want to.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.760]   I could just talk into it.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.940]   >> I have a squeal, the NVIDIA Shield,
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.460]   which is a great Android TV device.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.440]   >> It still is after all these years.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.080]   >> I do feel dopey, though, using a game controller
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.040]   to change channels, it's just kind of weird.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.060]   >> It's great using a remote, I missed it.
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.920]   >> Nice, the remote's back.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.120]   >> Lawrence, of course, a host of all about Android
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.360]   and you yesterday were at, not yesterday, Wednesday,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.560]   were at the Samsung event where they announced
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.320]   the about eight phones and--
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.160]   >> At least eight.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.360]   >> A dishwasher, I don't know what else.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.520]   They did it pretty quickly.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.480]   They breezed through it and they did something
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.280]   opposite of Apple.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.600]   Usually Apple saves the best for last one more thing, right?
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.280]   They launched with the phone, the Fold.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.640]   They also did something that, I don't know,
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.720]   maybe this was good, maybe bad, they announced the price.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.160]   >> And then everybody audibly booed in the--
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.320]   >> Cash.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.640]   >> Yeah, April 26th, it's actually the second foldable phone
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.080]   after the Royal.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.680]   But it's from Samsung, so it'll be nicely made.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.200]   It has a Samsung makes a screen.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.040]   >> It's just plain manufacturer.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.880]   >> Did you get to see it?
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.720]   >> Nope.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.680]   I saw it in DJ Co's hands very far away,
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   but again, that was very far away.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.680]   >> So it wasn't in the demo room.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.520]   >> Absolutely not.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.360]   >> All the other stuff was, in fact,
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.840]   you brought us some Buds,
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.120]   I don't know what's called Google Buds,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.280]   they're Samsung Buds.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.120]   >> Buds.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.920]   >> Those look pretty sweet.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.200]   And those have a wireless charging case,
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.640]   unlike the Apple AirPods.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.480]   >> They're magnets, they work.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.880]   >> Oh, and they have magnets to hold the things in.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.720]   So when they announced that the Fold was $1,980,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.120]   there was an audible gasp.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.160]   >> It was a whoa.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.440]   >> But it's not even the most expensive folding phone now.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.280]   >> It's not.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.720]   >> Today, Huawei announced the Mate X,
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.560]   which fold, so, you know,
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.920]   the best way to describe,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.960]   tell me if I'm wrong on this,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.640]   but the best way to describe the Galaxy Fold
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.680]   is to take two phones and put them together.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.960]   It's gonna be thick like that.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.120]   And then you, then one side,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.200]   put the screen on one side,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.600]   so it's a little, it's a small screen,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.840]   but a foreign screen on that.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720]   And then you open it up,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.200]   and that's the bigger screen.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.360]   But if you do that, you realize,
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.880]   that big is kinda squarish big.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.920]   >> It's tablet sized nearly.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.280]   >> Well, nearly.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.720]   >> Some of them go into eight inches,
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.320]   some of them go into seven inches.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.920]   >> So that's the Galaxy Fold,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   but then the Mate X goes the other way.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.520]   >> Oh, it goes like a temple.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.360]   Oh.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.200]   >> It's so weird.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.360]   So you see both screens on it.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.480]   We've created a mockup to help you understand it.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.840]   I don't know how this is better in any way.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   >> Well, it's a little easier to eat up to.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   >> And it's a little confusing
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.960]   'cause it seems to be made of old iPhones,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.760]   but I'll hide the Apple logo.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.840]   So the screen goes all the way around the outside.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.920]   >> Which is- >> Is there a piece
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.000]   cut out of that one, Leo?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.240]   Like 'cause it sort of folds into itself, right?
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   There's a little line where the cameras are on.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.800]   >> Yeah, it's a tri-folds. >> For the Mate, right?
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.200]   >> Yeah. >> Yeah.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.440]   It's kind of weird.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.360]   It's weird, but I kind of like it.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.480]   Don't you worry about the hinge though,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.880]   see where that screen is?
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.720]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.560]   >> Isn't it gonna- >> Well, that's why
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.040]   they're not letting anybody look at it.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.480]   >> Same thing with a galaxy fold.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.360]   >> How- >> These are polymer screens,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   so they're flexible, but I worry how,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.080]   you know, you can be able to open it 10 times
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.920]   and then it breaks.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.040]   >> That's what I'm thinking too.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   Like an old Trapper Keeper.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   >> They were made of plastics.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.640]   They would fall apart halfway through the school year.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.280]   >> It's a galaxy Trapper Keeper.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.120]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.240]   (laughing)
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.520]   >> That's actually a better name.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.600]   >> I think that's a better name.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.440]   >> You know, nostalgia's very hot right now
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.480]   from my generation.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.160]   You wanna sell it to me, right?
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.880]   We're the spenders right now, so.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.160]   >> Yeah, but that's, I think even your generation
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.800]   ain't gonna spend three thousand.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.720]   I didn't mention.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.760]   >> We don't have the money.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.040]   >> So the galaxy folds 1980, the Huawei,
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.760]   what was it, 2600 bucks?
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.040]   >> 2300 for the base model or whatever.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.520]   >> Yeah, and it'll make the American government look at you.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.360]   >> Well, that's the thing.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.560]   You won't be able to buy it in the US,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.400]   so you don't even have to think about it.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.360]   >> Well, if you happen to bring it over from overseas
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.920]   or buy it on AliExpress.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.720]   >> You can buy, I bought a P20,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.000]   even though it wasn't sold in the US.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.200]   I was able to buy it through some sort of online thing.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.280]   The carriers won't sell it,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.560]   and Huawei doesn't officially sell it in the US.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.920]   I asked Huawei about that, and they said,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.080]   "If you don't have a carrier deal in the United States,
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.760]   "there's no point in marketing a phone,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.360]   "you're not gonna sell an appreciable number."
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.200]   >> That's very true.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.840]   >> Tell that to Google though, they've done all right.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.680]   I guess the Pixel has Verizon
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.200]   and T-Mobile carrier deals, so maybe that's not possible.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.160]   >> One plus was the one that--
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   >> They tried.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160]   >> The reservation system.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.200]   >> Well, no, they're with T-Mobile now,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.680]   and they work on Verizon, which has been great for them.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.720]   I mean, that's really helped their--
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.320]   >> Yeah, you need that.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   So Seth, you're the richest guy here.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.800]   (laughing)
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.640]   >> Excuse me.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.280]   (laughing)
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.600]   >> We're just podcasters, which is, you're a publisher.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.720]   Which is the, is either of these foldable funds,
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.680]   I think there's more, right?
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.520]   This isn't the only one.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.200]   There's gonna be a ZTE foldable fund.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.000]   >> And a TCL.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.840]   >> TCL.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.840]   >> TCL, I always wanna say TLC.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.200]   That's just my favorite.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.040]   >> That's just my favorite.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.880]   >> These are left I-lo-peds.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.520]   >> Yes, I always wanna say tickle.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.400]   >> Didn't show me how to trifold.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.240]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.920]   >> Their CEO in a tweet sat there unfolding and folding it,
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.000]   but that, to me, that doesn't really count
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.080]   as even a prototype.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.000]   It's just--
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.840]   >> It's just--
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.320]   >> Well, these things are barely prototypes,
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.600]   the ones that they're announcing.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.840]   >> Well, I mean, at that price,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.840]   and they're not letting the journalists even
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.640]   fold them or take them home or anything.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.440]   So to me, it's kind of like,
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.560]   we'll price them so high that almost nobody buys them,
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.800]   or once they buy them,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.320]   we'll make a very small number of these,
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.920]   and we'll get our beta testers
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.400]   to pay for the devices.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.480]   >> So you wouldn't rush out, April 26th,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.320]   isn't that far off?
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.440]   You wouldn't rush out April 26th by a Galaxy Fold.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.280]   >> Well, it's kinda crazy.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   I mean, Vlad Savov from The Verge was discussing,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.040]   if this is coming out April,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.440]   and they're not giving you,
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.400]   they're not letting journalists touch it yet,
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.840]   what is happening between now and April
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.280]   that's gonna make these things ready for--
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.120]   >> For developers.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.120]   >> I mean, some sheets.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.800]   >> They're for developers, I think.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.000]   >> Yeah, it's definitely got a prototype-y
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.440]   developer feel to it.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.680]   >> That's what it sounds like.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.600]   Like when Project Tango came out, right,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.400]   and it was just, it was like $600.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.600]   >> It was really clunky phone.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.160]   >> It was, but the idea was to be a reference device,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.840]   and this is just Samsung saying,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.600]   "Hey, come to us for the reference device.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.720]   "You don't need to go to Google, we'll do it."
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.080]   >> And look, Google's gives us.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.400]   >> You know, the form factor, like it's cool,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.360]   like I definitely would love to show people this,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.000]   but like in day-to-day use, like, you know,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.600]   when I'm a mobile, I'm on,
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.440]   I'm probably using one hand, I'm walking,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   I don't wanna unfold it and, you know,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.200]   fold it back up and, you know, and then,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   I don't know, it just doesn't,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.680]   this doesn't appeal to me in a way that-
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.760]   >> This is for joy for you.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.840]   >> You know, yeah, you're doing Marie Conner.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.560]   >> I know, yeah, I've really killed that joke too,
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.120]   'cause I've said it too much out of the money.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.840]   >> So, I have to say, I know the audible gasp,
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.480]   but the reason Samsung said several times,
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.240]   $1,980 is, here's a phone that's very distinctive.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.000]   If you go to a meeting and you pull it out of your pocket
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.200]   and you open it up, everybody's gonna go,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.840]   he has the $2,000 phone.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.080]   That is the point of it, at least in some markets.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   >> I totally agree.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.240]   I feel like it's gonna be one of those phones
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.720]   that is sort of like a gimmick in some ways,
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.600]   but it is also, it's made for a very small group of people.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.160]   It's the luxury of luxury devices, right?
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.560]   >> It's a fire and call.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.160]   >> Yeah, it's this crazy phone that,
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.640]   if you pull it out of your pocket,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.080]   people will, at least for a very short time,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.920]   are they impressed?
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.360]   >> Well, I mean, Apple sold, what was that,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.080]   an $18,000 Apple watch when they first came out?
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.920]   >> I never saw anyone with it though.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.880]   >> Solid gold, yeah.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.720]   But I mean, the people--
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.560]   >> That was a better friend.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.400]   >> But it's as bad as similar.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.880]   If you are wearing a solid gold, Apple watch,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.920]   people know, oh, he spent 20 grand on that.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.200]   >> It's like having a big diamond or something.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.040]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.880]   >> It does look cool though.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.160]   I mean, I feel like, I don't know what the sci-fi reference is,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.480]   right, but the idea--
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.760]   >> That's part of the problem is there isn't one.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.120]   >> Yeah, 'cause if you watch the expanse,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.160]   the phones are like these clear, expandable sort of things
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.400]   versus these like physical, clunky--
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.840]   >> And even 2001, they had an iPad.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.240]   >> But they didn't fold them.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.680]   I don't think anybody in science fiction
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.240]   anticipated the idea that the screens would be so flexible.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.240]   >> That's very true, I think.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.480]   >> That seems a little odd that they can do that.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.320]   >> It does.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.040]   >> Isn't there circuitry on the back of it?
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.080]   Isn't it gonna get metal fatigue or something?
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.680]   Is it gonna wrinkle?
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.280]   >> The lamps and phones have two batteries.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.880]   >> Even the Huawei looked like it had a wrinkle
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.640]   where the hinge is.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.040]   >> Yeah, it's a little like wobbly.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.680]   >> It's wobbly.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.520]   >> Yeah, and where the hinge is,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.120]   they had the phones on Max Brightness,
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.200]   so if there was any darkness, it would kind of blur it out.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.040]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.240]   >> That's right, I heard about that.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.600]   >> Look at this, look at this right here.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.640]   Look at that hinge.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.120]   First of all, this is the Huawei hinge,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.160]   which is kind of funky.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.080]   It looks like they're glued in,
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.160]   and look at that perceptible bulge over the hinge.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.840]   Do you want that in your screen?
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.240]   I don't think so.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.080]   >> So--
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.200]   >> Then you have that big chunk on the right too.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.560]   >> Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.920]   >> It looks like the charging port.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.520]   >> Yeah, there's your type C connector.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   It is very thin.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.880]   >> Are they just trying to figure out
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.000]   how to make people buy tablets again?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.200]   >> That is a great question.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.320]   >> I think they're desperate.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.160]   They're desperate.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   There's nothing to distinguish
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.880]   any of the current flagship phones.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.960]   They're all slabs of black glass, all of them.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.640]   >> But it is innovative still.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.480]   >> So that's what I'm saying.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.800]   They need something that looks different,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.000]   and I don't think market research.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.080]   I don't think this is driven by research,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.560]   and this is what people are demanding.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.320]   This is more throw spaghetti at the wall
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.560]   and see what sticks, right?
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.640]   Or no?
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.800]   >> Yes, yes.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.760]   >> Eventually it will lead to other things.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.000]   I like to think of the,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.520]   I like to think of this being used
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.400]   for kind of all in one devices.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.080]   I think for a different kind of market,
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.880]   maybe not necessarily like the high-end market,
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.840]   but a market of people who just
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.160]   would like to have a two-in-one sort of device,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.440]   because maybe that is the only thing that's accessible
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.240]   to them, and they would like to have
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.920]   that sort of portability and that malleability.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.080]   >> Do you think it's possible this is for the Asian market?
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.720]   Because I remember in Japan,
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   twenty to fifteen years ago,
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.280]   long before the iPhone came out,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.840]   there were all these interesting, oddball,
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.520]   folding phones, lots more capabilities than anything.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.560]   We had in the States, and I was told at the time,
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.400]   well the reason is people don't have,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.760]   they don't have the room for personal computers,
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.400]   so their phone is their computer,
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.360]   and so they have odd form factors
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.600]   because they're more functional.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.800]   >> That's what I think about beyond A2,
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.040]   I think also Latin America, and other markets,
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   where this could really be hand-tamed.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.960]   >> Maybe we don't fully appreciate the way it is.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.200]   >> So this is going to become,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.760]   the more this becomes commoditized,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.320]   we think the more we'll see a market for it.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.160]   I think right now it very much is,
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.600]   well how can developers,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.240]   and I think this is very much an offering
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.240]   for people who want to explore that market.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.680]   >> I'm more interested in it.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.000]   >> Were there, is there,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.960]   you've been, I'm sure, watching Barcelona today,
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.800]   were there any other announcements?
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:47.960]   >> On Twitter, yes.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.640]   (laughs)
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.040]   >> Anything else that LG announced a new GA,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.160]   LG, I feel bad for LG.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.640]   They're not even the also ran.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.360]   I mean they have nice phones, this is the--
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.400]   >> I wouldn't feel bad for them.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.720]   They are the other half of the South Korean tech market.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.560]   They have it--
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.400]   >> They have other market other stuff.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.800]   >> They have a lot of stuff there.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.160]   They own a lot, I mean they own beauty brands,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.400]   they have appliances.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.600]   >> There's LG beauty?
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.440]   >> Yeah, the brands have different other names,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.320]   but if you look at the umbrella company,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.480]   they're the ones, there's like an LG home division.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.320]   >> How much are they out of that?
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.760]   >> They own products like Belief is a brand that they own.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.440]   >> Nokia, which the only claim to fame Nokia had
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.120]   was it made the only decent Windows phones.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.880]   And one of the reasons they were so decent is they had
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.160]   a lot of 41 megapixel camera.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.960]   They called it Pureview, well they're back.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.920]   The new Nokia flagship has--
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.760]   >> Spider eyes.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.680]   >> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven cameras.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.240]   >> It looks like when you have a spider's face.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.080]   >> It's--
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.520]   >> Why indeed?
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.920]   >> There's a 12 megapixel--
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.040]   all 12, all whatever have a 12 megapixel sensor
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.720]   and an F1.8 lens.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.560]   >> That just looks like a joke.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.720]   >> Only two shh. >> I get to it,
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.680]   like an onion article.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.960]   >> It is, it's crazy.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.800]   I guess they're not all, I don't know,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.500]   there's five lenses and I see on here seven things.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.240]   >> One of them is a flash.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.520]   >> There are two of the five camera shooting color,
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.600]   the other three are monochrome.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.760]   When you press the shutter, all five cameras
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.240]   shoot different exposures at the same time.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.360]   And then they merge them together.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.560]   This is kind of what the pixel does with one lens
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   very quickly into a single ultra detailed shot.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.320]   And Nokia says that individual cameras
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.160]   can even shoot multiple exposures on their own
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.400]   and add even more data to the final image result.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.600]   A camera that offers new levels of detail
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.800]   and color, you have flash, and then there's some other sensors.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.840]   So there's really only five cameras.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.800]   I see that when I--
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.840]   >> People are liking the Nokia Android phones.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.040]   They're doing well.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.800]   I mean, they're doing, they have some relative traction,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.640]   I should say.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.600]   >> We should also point out they're not really made by Nokia,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.200]   they're made by across the street.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.280]   >> HMD Global.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.480]   >> Just run across the street in S-Boo from Nokia
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.080]   and but they have the Nokia brand,
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.480]   they're licensing the brand.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.680]   >> Can I ask you a question about the foldable phones
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.840]   that I couldn't figure out?
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   >> Are these phones gonna have more battery power
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.480]   and last longer?
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.880]   Or is it because of the size of the screen,
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.240]   it requires the two batteries?
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.080]   >> So I was a little surprised.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.000]   >> 'Cause I couldn't figure that out.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.320]   >> Samsung Fold only had a 4,000 or 4,100 milliamp
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.520]   power battery, which is not--
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.360]   >> And I heard that I was like,
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.000]   is that enough?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.160]   >> Not a battery, right?
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.200]   >> The Huawei has two cells, one in each flap.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.000]   And I think it's higher, but still not as high.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.080]   I don't know.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.920]   >> For a thing that's really--
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.000]   >> 'Cause that's what I'm waiting for,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.280]   is a better battery.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.040]   >> Yeah, it's funny, they're throwing--
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   >> They're throwing me by two, okay.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.560]   >> Yeah, they're trying all these crazy things,
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.200]   but really just, you know, one thing they could do,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.240]   bring back the removable battery.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.000]   I always would buy with Samsung early galaxies,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.720]   I'd buy two batteries.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.680]   And then I'd go as long as I could with one,
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.880]   and usually that was most of the day.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.880]   And then if I needed to, I got off the airplane and it was dead,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   I'd open up the back, put in another battery,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.200]   and I'm good to go.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.240]   >> Yeah, that's true.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   That's an easy thing to do, I don't understand, I don't.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.080]   Anyway, they're all, if you want,
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.200]   we can look at these pictures,
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.160]   these are from the Nokia, and they look great,
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.920]   but you can never trust, you know, the pictures.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.440]   >> It takes a while to figure out
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.400]   the real capabilities of a smartphone camera.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.360]   >> Actually, these are these shot by the Verge,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.840]   maybe these are shot by the Verge, I guess they are.
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.360]   But why there's a shower outside mobile world,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.120]   Congress is beyond, maybe they're not shot
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.560]   by the Verge, I don't know what's going on.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.880]   >> Oh, they might be in a pool area.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.400]   >> Okay, there is depth.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.520]   >> Just, I don't know.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.640]   >> Bring context to it.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.960]   >> Things are strange in Finland.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.400]   There's a sandwich.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.760]   >> Delicious, I mean, it actually kind of,
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.920]   it doesn't look very, I mean,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.440]   it looks kind of lifeless to me.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.840]   It looks like very accurate, which, you know,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.480]   if you're used to Samsung, which pops colors,
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.640]   accurate actually does feel like a little bit less.
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.200]   >> Have you seen the comparisons from the folks
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.040]   who have the GS10 on the ground at MWC right now?
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.880]   >> No, what does it look like?
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.720]   >> The Pixel 3s.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.640]   >> Oh, this is the question.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.440]   >> I apologize, I'm coming out of this,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.360]   out of the blue and we don't have anything to show,
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.280]   but, you know, people have been posting on Twitter
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.080]   'cause they have the GS10s in their hand
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.400]   and you can still see that they're doing that thing
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   where they overprocessed, oversaturated photo,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.480]   versus the Pixel 3, which also processes the photo,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.480]   but it processes it to make it look more realistic.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.280]   So it's a, just to show their side-by-side processing
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.400]   and how it seems like it really tries to make it pop.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.360]   >> Google's Nightshot compared to the low-life photography
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.080]   on the Samsung, which doesn't even come close,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.440]   but you could argue that the Google Pixel is over-brightening
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.320]   'cause in dark images, it looks like the lights are on,
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.080]   is over-brighting it.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.240]   The Samsung seems to do a fairly decent job
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.720]   but nowhere near as much detail.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.360]   >> Right, that's the kicker, the detail is not as good.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.360]   >> And then Samsung over-sharpens as well,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.760]   which always bothers me.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.800]   If you Pixel people, you zoom in,
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.400]   you really see that over-sharpening.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.640]   >> Yeah, I agree.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.160]   >> On the other hand, Samsung's got the best screens by far.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.800]   There's no question.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.600]   When I go from my Apple, which, I mean,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.360]   this is an OLED screen, the 10S Max,
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.720]   or the Pixel 3 XL to my Note 9,
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.400]   it's like my eyes go, whoa!
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.560]   Because the Note 9 looks so much better and crisper and brighter.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.960]   >> Samsung gives itself the best screen, right?
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.800]   >> Exactly, they don't sell on the Apple.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.640]   >> Right.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.480]   >> That's the worst one.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.000]   (laughing)
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.560]   >> All right, well, there is a lot more new stuff
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.440]   to talk about, and I got up early this morning,
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.040]   early for me as 9 a.m.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.120]   to cover the Microsoft-
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.960]   >> Right.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.560]   >> Solar lens of a two announcement,
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.800]   we'll talk about that.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.840]   In a little bit, there's lots to talk about.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.680]   We have a busy news day, but fortunately,
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.840]   we have the 18 with us Florence Ion from all about Android.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.600]   Great to have you owe that flow.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.800]   I love the earrings.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.280]   >> Thank you.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.880]   >> She's wearing red pom-pom pairings.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.720]   >> Yes.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.000]   >> Danglyce, they're really cute.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.240]   We also have, they look like my poodle.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.320]   No, I'm a poodle.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.160]   We also--
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   >> What's the sayer? Is your poodle tail?
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.000]   >> Poodle tail.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.920]   (laughing)
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.360]   >> I have a red poodle.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   That's why I'm driving is also here from 9 to 5,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.360]   and Electric.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.720]   Great to have you, Seth.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.600]   I'm gonna ask you about electric vehicles
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.600]   in a little bit, 'cause I'm in the market.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.440]   >> All right.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.880]   And Ben Brock Johnson.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.240]   I'm gonna ask you about Tiny Podcast Studios in a little bit,
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.080]   'cause I'm in the market.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.040]   He's seen your producer, W.B.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.800]   You are radio edit.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   Quick program note, we are doing our survey.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.040]   If you haven't done it yet, there's still time,
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.640]   but only a little time left.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.480]   Once a year, we ask the audience to fill out
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.960]   a few questions so we can get to understand
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.080]   and know you better.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.200]   And if you haven't done it, no obligation,
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   but I'd appreciate it if you do at twit.to/survey19.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.040]   Quip is the first subscription electric toothbrush
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   accepted by the American Dental Association.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.320]   It is a really neat idea.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.720]   You know you can get a quip for $25.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.120]   They have more expensive ones, but they started $25,
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.760]   which means you can afford an electric toothbrush.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.960]   It's great because it's battery powered,
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.040]   which means it's great for travel.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.720]   It goes months on one battery, AAA battery,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.160]   and it also means it's more compact.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.320]   So quip, I love this, comes with a holder
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.240]   which you can mount to your mirror.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.480]   The multi-use cover can be a stand.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.240]   You could mount it to your mirror,
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.560]   which is what I do, so you never forget to brush,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.640]   but it also could turn around and cover the head.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.120]   And then it's like the smallest, most compact travel toothbrush.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.600]   And because you don't need a charger,
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.320]   you just put another AAA battery,
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.440]   and it's great for traveling.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.120]   It's as lightweight as you can get.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120]   I love quip.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.160]   And quip does something else that's very cool.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.520]   It's a great electric toothbrush.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   I should mention this.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.760]   You know, it's got great sonic vibrations
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.480]   that clean your teeth effectively without pressing too hard.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.240]   I think a lot of people with electric toothbrushes
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.320]   really push hard.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.720]   It's gentle, insensitive gums.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.040]   Some electric toothbrushes really are quite abrasive.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.320]   I've had my dentist tell me, don't push so hard.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.960]   They actually had to show me,
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.600]   you never have that problem with the quip.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   It's a nice gentle.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.800]   And just like, you know, it's got two minute timer,
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.600]   pulses every 30 seconds.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.080]   So you make sure you get your whole mouth,
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.760]   switch sides and all that.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.080]   So that's really good.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.440]   The other thing they do that's really great
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.040]   is you also get brush heads automatically delivered
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.200]   on a dentist recommended schedule every three months,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.840]   just $5.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.840]   I also get new tooth based delivered
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.960]   'cause I like the little travel tubes.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.520]   And that way you're not using old brushes.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.360]   And three out of four of us use bristles
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.440]   that are old, worn out and ineffective.
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.640]   That's why quip is one of the first electric toothbrushes
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.360]   accepted by the ADA.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.040]   If thousands of verified five star reviews,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   over 20,000 professionals backing it,
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.360]   I am a quip, quipper for life, I love quip.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.440]   And starting at just $25 you could do it to.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.920]   If you go to getquip.com/twit,
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.440]   we'll even throw in your first refill pack free
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.600]   when you purchase any quip electric toothbrush.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   We have his and her quips.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.280]   Get your first refill pack free,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   getquip.com/twit, it's g-t-q-u-i-p.com/twit.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.280]   And we think quip for their support.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.200]   So I'm probably the only one who actually watched
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.480]   the HoloLens announcement I'm guessing.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.320]   Flow.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.160]   - I was asleep.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.480]   - Seth.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.160]   - I read about it out to the internet.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.520]   - Did you watch it?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.600]   - Not the actual video, but I watched the reaction.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.760]   - So remember four years ago when HoloLens 1
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.080]   was announced, Microsoft showed games.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.440]   You know, they did Minecraft, they had spiders from Mars,
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.920]   they had all sorts of stuff.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.080]   No games this time.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.840]   Microsoft doubled down on industrial applications.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.080]   They showed fixing engines, designing theater sets,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.400]   practicing a surgery before you actually did it.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.440]   They showed new user interface gestures,
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.600]   which I was very impressed with.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.520]   We did a live stream of it with Mary Jo Foley.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.720]   And while she had, I think, been pre-briefed a lot of it,
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.640]   it was very impressive.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.880]   And the only gaming, concession, gaming,
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.320]   or even any consumer application at all
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.480]   was about a three minute visit from Tin Sweeney of Epic,
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.640]   who said, "This is gonna be great for games.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.680]   "Didn't demo anything?"
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.520]   And left.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.280]   - Well, I heard the Unreal Engine will work with it
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.120]   this morning, so cool.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.040]   (laughs)
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.360]   Great.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.040]   - It's really, they really pushed Azure,
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.120]   they pushed the cloud, they pushed enterprise uses.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.560]   That's the money ticket.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.920]   - I think this is the new Microsoft.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.200]   It's really interesting to--
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.360]   - They're leaning in to it.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.320]   Satya's leaning them into it.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.160]   And a lot of the opinion pieces I read this morning
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.920]   that came out about it were,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.720]   this is gonna be really helpful in industrial spaces
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.960]   where tech still needs,
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.200]   well, tech really hasn't penetrated yet.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   This is gonna help.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.040]   - Yeah.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.520]   It is a little pricey.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.760]   So the original HoloLens developer kit,
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.400]   which has been around for four years, was $5,000.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.560]   This is $3,500.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.400]   - It's a lot of money.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.320]   - But they, I think they did offer something
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.680]   that will be compelling to many businesses.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   It's $125 a month per seat if you commit to three years,
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.240]   which ends up being the same amount,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.320]   but I think a lot of businesses would prefer that.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.680]   They can appreciate it. - I'm sure they would
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.560]   just subsidize it, maybe.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.800]   - A program to subsidize it.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.400]   - Well, if you multiply 12 times 125 times three,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.680]   I think it comes out more than more than $3,500.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.760]   But knowing how business works,
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.640]   I know it'd be a lot easier for us to say $125 a month
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.480]   than $3,500 out the door.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.400]   And I think they also showed a conferencing of weird looking,
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   we can show some video of it if we have it lying around,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.280]   but it was very creepy video conferencing.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.840]   You'd be wearing this thing and they say much more comfortable,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.200]   it feels like a hat.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.840]   It was true that everybody put it on and just kinda,
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.520]   it wasn't a lot of tweaking and adjusting
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.400]   as there used to be with the old HoloLens.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.000]   It just worked, it looked like sunglasses up to the brow
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.520]   and then it was just a massive thing
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.920]   with a forehead suction cup.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.760]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.080]   - And it goes around your head's battery powered.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.160]   I was told about three hours of battery life,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.000]   which is decent.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.280]   There's no tether, you don't carry around a computer with you,
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.240]   except that's what the HoloLens is.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.600]   In fact, it runs Windows.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:51.920]   And they demonstrated this conferencing.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.240]   So the conferees would both be wearing HoloLens.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.440]   They can see through the sunglasses part,
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.040]   but they also can see projected onto their meeting room,
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.400]   the other conferee.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.120]   The reason it looked creepy is the conferee,
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.160]   the other people would use a 2D picture.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.680]   The HoloLens has time of flight sensors for 3D,
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.920]   it has the connect sensor on top.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.760]   So I guess, they didn't show it working,
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.680]   but I guess you'd show the 2D picture to the HoloLens
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.800]   and that would turn it into a 3D avatar view
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.520]   that was creepy as hell.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.080]   And then you'd be in the room with other people,
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.520]   but what's neat is you could both be looking
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.600]   at a 3D generated model,
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.880]   you could send each other images and pictures,
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.400]   they could have a virtual whiteboard
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.360]   that you'd all be working on.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.840]   So I think it was kind of fun.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.080]   - I'm just gonna say that reminds me of those 3D pillows
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.320]   that you get printed out of a picture.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.560]   - Yeah, it's exactly like that.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.360]   Or if you've ever done Bitmoji.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.200]   - It makes a invasion.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.760]   - Or the galaxy, you remember the galaxy?
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.640]   It's creepy like that.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.400]   - Oh, they have new ones with the,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.760]   sorry, that's a Samsung thing, I was gonna say.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.600]   - Yeah.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.440]   - They have new ones.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.440]   - Isn't the holographic field of view
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.840]   or whatever it is bigger?
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.600]   - They said twice as big, but they didn't say twice.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.760]   And I don't think it's twice as wide,
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.240]   I think it's twice as tall.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.440]   So that's a-- - Twice as tall.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.840]   - That was a big problem with HoloLens 1
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.880]   'cause it was like a mail slot.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.480]   - Yeah, that's what I remember trying.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.800]   It was like really amazing in the field of view.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.360]   But it was hard for it to be truly immersive, really.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.040]   I mean, I know it's mixed reality,
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.160]   but it was hard for you to really kind of dig into it
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.960]   in a way and I think that was partially the field of view.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.760]   So it was good, I thought it was good to hear
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.640]   that they had extended that.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.640]   And I think, I don't know, I mean,
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.840]   the business move makes a lot of sense to me, right?
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.960]   That these are the companies,
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.040]   companies are gonna be able to afford this
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.920]   and can actually find, I mean,
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.520]   I've talked to companies in Massachusetts
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.080]   that are already using HoloLens,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   the first version for things like turbine maintenance.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.880]   - Yeah. - Yes.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.600]   - And I think that it really does have those applications
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.120]   where you can have somebody who is,
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.720]   who's an engineer and who's trained,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.960]   but at the same time may not know everything
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   about this particular engine and run a software program
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.360]   that helps him or her understand
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.720]   how to repair something or how to tweak it,
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.520]   how to change it.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.520]   I can see that application being really smart.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.200]   - It does have an AI engine in the headset
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.800]   and it actually did seem to do a very good job of things
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.960]   like recognizing your hands.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.320]   So if your hands get in the field of view of the headset,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.720]   they are now, you're now seeing a three-dimensional version
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.240]   of your hands, they've got new gestures
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.520]   that I think make a lot of sense.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.080]   They had an excellent demo by a millennial
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.840]   showing she played the piano, she pinched and zoomed.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.640]   It really was impressive.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.600]   Here's a, in their trailer video,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.640]   an example of a motorcycle mechanic looking at,
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.240]   you know, the map of what he's gonna fix
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.680]   and then seeing what he should do.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.480]   And I think this all makes a lot of sense.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.880]   That's how we're seeing Google Glass use.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.560]   Here's a surgeon practicing open heart surgery
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.800]   before she actually does it.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   - Yes, please.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.440]   - Yeah, please, please practice.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.800]   And you can see if you look at it,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.040]   that looks like a fairly comfortable headset.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.360]   I love it that there's no tether.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.320]   Clearly, this is a set designer now,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.560]   designing her set in the theater,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.960]   but there's no real set.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.280]   It's just being superimposed.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.240]   - This is the new, this is the new--
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.240]   - It's a new workstation kind of thing.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.080]   - Exactly.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.920]   - Yeah, I mean, I played with Magic Leap.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.000]   I don't think Magic Leap has its coherent vision
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.920]   and certainly doesn't have the ecosystem Microsoft offers.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.200]   I think this is, they're right now,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.760]   clearly the leader in AR.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.960]   I mean, there's nobody even close.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.080]   - And they know who to go after,
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.920]   which is their existing customers, which is enterprise.
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.800]   - And the military.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.640]   - Exactly.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.240]   - Well, they didn't mention that.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.840]   (laughs)
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.680]   There was.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.520]   - That's what he said.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.560]   - Yesterday, we got news that about 50 Microsoft employees
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.400]   had signed a open letter to Satya Nadella,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.360]   the CEO of Microsoft, saying,
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.640]   "Please don't, they apparently signed a half billion dollar
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.120]   contract with the Department of Defense
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.120]   to use HoloLens in military applications."
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.280]   No mention of that.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.480]   In fact, no mention of military use at all.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.240]   - There was a discussion or rather what I saw on Twitter
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.520]   was that people were quoting Satya talking about AI
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.560]   and how it's going to exist in the future
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.640]   and a lot of the sub-tweets of that were well.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.800]   - Yeah, military.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.760]   Well, you could, you know, right now,
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.880]   I know there's drone pilots wearing headsets,
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.480]   some kind of, probably not augmented reality,
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.960]   probably virtual reality headsets to pilot those drones.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.000]   Military uses that.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.800]   This is not as big as the Jedi, the billion dollar,
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.760]   or 10 billion dollar Jedi contract.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.400]   - It's interesting that Microsoft's, you know,
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.280]   Microsoft's response to this,
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.600]   at least such as I saw it, was essentially,
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.680]   we're the best of the best
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.040]   and why not have the best of the best
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.800]   informing the military as the military does work
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.000]   that is important for, you know,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   keeping America safe for lack of a better term.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.920]   But I do, it does make me wonder, right?
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.560]   Because in theory, this is why people criticize
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.640]   like the military industrial complex, right?
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.200]   Is this situation where the government
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.840]   is contracting out work to the private industry
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.320]   and all of these people now have to work on something
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.200]   that maybe helps kill someone somewhere.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.600]   And those people don't get to work on helping the pianists
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.920]   to play the piano or helping that set designer
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.400]   do the set designer stuff.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.000]   And so, I mean, it's a small number of people
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.120]   who sign this letter obviously,
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.560]   but I thought that was an interesting story this week.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.160]   - It is only 50.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.240]   I mean, Microsoft has tens of thousands of employees,
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:52.560]   but this is something that's been happening
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.640]   all over Silicon Valley.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   Google decided not to pursue the Jedi contract
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.960]   because of employee revolt and Amazon ended up doing it.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.480]   And Jeff Bezos stepped forward and said,
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.120]   look, this is Patreon.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:05.960]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.560]   When did it become unpatriotic
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.760]   to help with the nation's defense?
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.600]   - Yeah.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.280]   - And I don't disagree with that.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.560]   I mean-- - It's easier to say
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.040]   if you don't pay any taxes like Jeff Bezos and--
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.640]   - Zero taxes, I gotta do something.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.480]   - Oh yeah.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.200]   (laughs)
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.440]   - This is some of the video from this,
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.880]   here's the young woman.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.200]   - As your connect, that's--
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.640]   - So they're also selling a three,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.800]   what is it, three or $400 version of the Connect
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.720]   designed for business?
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.080]   It's essentially the sensors that are part of the HoloLens.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.520]   - In a professional box.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.360]   - In a box.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.880]   It's not a webcam though.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.680]   It's a designed to do something.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.600]   I don't know what, I don't understand it.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   But you can pre-order it now at azure.com/connect, I note.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.280]   Here's the, this is the creator,
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.280]   kind of mad scientist, creator of both Connect
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.800]   and HoloLens.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.480]   And he spent a lot of time on stage.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.040]   I don't know.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   I actually have kind of admired the new Microsoft.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.960]   I feel like they have turned this company around.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.200]   They're smart to focus on cloud and enterprise.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.720]   There's a lot of the money to be made there.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.560]   There's the original HoloLens being used
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.200]   in the International Space Station on the right there.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.480]   - I agree.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   I mean, I think, you know, they've been,
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   for the past five, seven years,
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.680]   I've been really impressed with the direction of the company.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.120]   And I think also it's really, you know,
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.240]   it's interesting to see this story this week
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.400]   about Apple systematizing its software cross platforms
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:43.080]   or starting on that because Microsoft already did that, right?
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.440]   I mean, the Windows phone is long gone by now,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.200]   but I think they've been leading
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.360]   in some really interesting areas.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.080]   And HoloLens is a great example of that.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:53.920]   - Yeah.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.640]   Well, Apple's made a lot of noise
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.840]   about doing augmented reality.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.280]   We haven't seen a product.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.880]   Google had glass.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.560]   I don't think there's anything to write home about.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.520]   There's Magic Leap.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.240]   And as I said, I've played with the Magic Leap,
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.200]   but mostly it's games.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   I get it some, there are some industrial uses.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.880]   Google Glass, by the way, still is used in industrial ways.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.720]   - Yep.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.920]   - But nothing like this.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.040]   And this is Seth, that 2X view.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.960]   And I think it is taller.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.120]   I don't think it's wider,
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.440]   'cause it was wide enough.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.120]   And what you see, and I should point this out,
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.600]   when you use one of these devices,
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   when we talk about Field of View,
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.560]   it's not like the rest of it's black.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.640]   It's just that the images that you're seeing
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.080]   with their special camera,
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.920]   that they look like their full screen images
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.120]   fit within that view.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.000]   And if you move your head,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.440]   and they go outside the edge of that,
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.400]   they just disappear.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.720]   You still see the world around you,
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.560]   but they just,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.080]   the objects you're looking at only appear within that
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.120]   somewhat narrow field of view.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:52.960]   - Right.
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:53.800]   - So, Center of Gravity in the middle,
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   that's a big deal because
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   the imbalanced HoloLens got very tiring very quickly.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.880]   Here's Julia Schwartz.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:03.800]   She did a great job demoing this.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.040]   She's the millennial I was referring to.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.960]   And apparently it takes a millennial
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.880]   to really understand how to do this.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.240]   You can see, the thing can see her hands,
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.400]   she can move her hands.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.760]   And that means a whole world of gestures are available.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.640]   It was a little clunky in HoloLens 1.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.560]   It took some getting used to.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.560]   This is much easier.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.920]   See, she can see the edges of where that image is.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.280]   She can touch it with her hands,
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.960]   she can zoom it, she can pinch it,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.080]   she can spin it.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.480]   - It's a full artifact.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.360]   - Yeah, it's like a thing.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.120]   The thing that's weird is you're not touching anything.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.400]   So, while it's reacting to your touch,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   it's not like your hand stops.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.240]   - Right.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.600]   - So, she showed a little later on,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.560]   she showed how they're working on new gestures,
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.760]   like pinch gestures,
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.440]   where your fingers tap each other.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.640]   And the pinch gesture does give you something
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.960]   to stop your finger.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.120]   But as she's talking about how you push buttons are different,
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.400]   the size of the button determines how you interact with it.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.120]   If it's a bigger button, you might punch it.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.600]   - Can we just appreciate that even in this interactive environment,
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.000]   the slider is so a slider.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.080]   And the file system is still like the static file system.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.240]   It's just look, it looks like it's in 3D
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.360]   'cause it's fluffy.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.760]   - Well, there is a holographic version of Windows
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.040]   that is that dopey, you know, explores floating in space.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.120]   (laughs)
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.640]   - I know, I mean, you've got to obviously invent a new vocabulary,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.040]   but you can't get so far from the old vocabulary.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.160]   - That's true because then it becomes unfamiliar
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.920]   to those of us who've been living in this world.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:38.160]   - We're still in the skewomorphic stage of holographic interfaces.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   - It just feels somewhat antiquated.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.760]   - So, do you think you're gonna see people on airplanes
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.360]   and subways with these on,
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.480]   and they're looking to be doing their things?
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.960]   - Well, remember how crazy we thought people
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.920]   with Bluetooth headsets looked for a while,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.520]   just animatedly talking as they walked down the street?
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.960]   Now we're used to it.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.320]   I think you-- - And now we just accept
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   air pods like they don't look stupid.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.200]   - Yeah, they still look stupid.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.960]   But everybody's wearing them.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.960]   - Yeah, they still look like huge tips in your ear.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.120]   - But no, but that's right.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.040]   - People like them 'cause they're very convenient.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.040]   - Yeah, yeah, true.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.760]   - These two, the whole ones do flip up,
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.440]   kind of like clip-ons, so you could kind of look normal,
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.320]   except that you're wearing a helmet.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.880]   - Well, but it's becoming normalized the more we wear
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.640]   these things. - Yeah.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.680]   - You know? - I mean, if the guy's sitting next to you
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.160]   on the airplane, we have like an oculus on,
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.160]   and he was just going at nuts with his arms
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.120]   and flailing everywhere. - I would be annoyed.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.680]   - Oh, God. - Would that be, like,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.760]   could you call this the flight attendant?
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.720]   - Stewart is, he's annoying me.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.280]   - As long as I don't hear it,
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.240]   and as long as you don't touch me, we're fine.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.880]   - Get off my armrest.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.040]   - Like, there's a new thing now where people apparently,
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.040]   if they don't have headphones,
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.920]   they'll still listen to their content on the plane,
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.520]   which is not open. - That, I really hate it.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.200]   - You see that with people talking on their phone
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.240]   on the plane. - Not okay.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.200]   - Not okay. - But it's better that you can imagine
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.880]   the HoloLens is a lot better, right,
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.760]   in that kind of public scenario than actual virtual reality.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.720]   And I do remember people making the argument
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.120]   that people were actually gonna be wearing these things
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:10.680]   and effectively blinding themselves in public
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   to the actual real world around them.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.400]   And that made no sense to me.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.000]   Like, I've ridden the New York subway long enough
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.280]   to know that you want as many of your senses around you
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.640]   as possible. - Yeah.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.200]   - Here's the creepy-- - When you're in public.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.480]   - Let me go back a little bit in this,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.560]   this is in Gadgets edited video.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.000]   This is the demonstration from the folks at Spatial
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.240]   of the kind of creepy teleconference.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.920]   But as somebody in the chatroom pointed out,
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.320]   this isn't about seeing each other as much as it is
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.520]   about seeing a shared knowledge space with objects in it.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.320]   So even though this looks kind of weird and jerky and so forth,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.200]   it's really the data that you're sharing
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.000]   and the things you're working on together.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.560]   This is, Mattel was showing how they might work on toys.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.400]   Their employees are all over the place,
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.800]   but they can work in a shared space together
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.320]   as if they're meeting in the same room.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.840]   - Yeah. - I was thinking this sort of thing
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.640]   would be really cool, you know, as it advances
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.080]   to maybe help people who have anxiety
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.120]   about being out in the world,
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.160]   something that they could wear.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.480]   - Just so we need another reason for people
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.280]   to stay in their mom's basement.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.760]   - Or get them out of it.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.880]   - Or maybe get them out of it slowly but surely.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.800]   - You know, with something that would help them
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.080]   see the world's-- - So, but this isn't
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.240]   the form factor forever. - True.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.600]   - This is today's form factor.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.560]   This is the Commodore 64 form factor, right?
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.920]   We're in the early-- - Yeah.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.520]   - I think-- - Mr. No Pants is--
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.600]   - Mr. No Pants is weird.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.480]   - Mr. No Pants is creepy, right?
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.320]   They were talking about the-- - He's creepy.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.040]   - He stops at the waist.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.080]   Not only No Pants, no legs, apparently.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.600]   I know nothing.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.840]   - Speaking of No Pants, are we all--
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.120]   - I'm not a pants. - I don't wanna be
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.960]   the one to say this, but this seems obvious.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.120]   You're for porn.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.920]   - Oh, you think?
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.760]   - I mean, it doesn't that drive all technology anyway.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.760]   - All right, so we're gonna go there, let's go there.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.920]   - Humans are lonely.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.440]   - Wait, we've had VR porn for a while.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.320]   Is it huge?
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.160]   I don't know.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.320]   Is it big?
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.960]   It's been around for a couple of years.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.800]   I remember trying it.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.960]   - It's massive, Leo.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.360]   It's massive.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.760]   It's not as big as it appears in the mirror.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   It's, I think it's a gimmick, but I'm not sure.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.360]   I don't know 'cause I haven't kept up on the numbers.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.720]   I try, you know, when it first came out,
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.360]   I said, "Well, I have to see this."
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.680]   And it was actually a little disturbing
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.960]   because it's like you're really there.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.240]   It is very real, maybe too real.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.080]   Maybe that's just me, I don't know.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.760]   - I wonder if porn hub has ever put out the numbers on that
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.880]   'cause they're super, you know,
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.680]   they're always like putting out data on--
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.760]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, don't they always put out data?
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.320]   They're like, "Who does it so a data company?"
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.920]   - Yeah, well, let me look it up.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.960]   I know I shouldn't be, but--
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.800]   - Be careful.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.240]   - It's for science.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.640]   But you do, but then you do, remember you do have to go
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.880]   to the--
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.720]   - Yeah.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.680]   - But they have a site that's safe for work--
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   - Yeah. - With all the data.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   - Yeah, no, I'm sorry I made that search right now.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.240]   I'm really apologizing.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.600]   - Should've done it incognito
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   'cause then I wouldn't have affected you as much.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.680]   - I think I am now ruined my reputation on the internet.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   Let's go back to--
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   - I don't think, I don't think--
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.680]   - I don't think this is a porn device.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.040]   - I don't think porn is that big in that fear of use
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:28.880]   as we think.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.400]   - Unless you think fixing big injuries is sexy.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   - I think people appreciate something a little more hands-on.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.080]   - What they're showing here, which is kind of interesting,
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.880]   is it's, and this is the new Microsoft also,
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.360]   it's an open platform which can be used
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.240]   with Android and iOS.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.440]   So maybe one of your engineers has
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.400]   can afford the expensive Oculus, or no Oculus HoloLens,
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.000]   but the other one can be using an iPad.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.200]   So see, she's seeing the same imagery on the iPad
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:44:59.680]   in augmented reality.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.920]   So I think that's very interesting.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.000]   - I think they're not going after classrooms with this.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.200]   - Well, it's expensive.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.720]   They did mention education, but the--
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.560]   - I wonder if--
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.400]   - I wonder if--
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.480]   - I wonder if you could, I mean,
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.720]   if you can use this with Android,
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.240]   I wonder if you could do cardboard.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.880]   - Sure, why not?
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.720]   Yeah, I'm sure you can.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.240]   - In a few bucks, you can have, you know,
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.160]   one person has the HoloLens,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:22.720]   and then everybody else gets--
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.560]   - I think that's a good cardboard.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.400]   - That's exactly right.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.480]   There's an inexpensive way to do it.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.120]   That's VR, but you'd be able to see the image
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.360]   and that they're all talking about working on.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.200]   - I was gonna say, I wonder if Google's
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.240]   top that market and the other companies are like,
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.080]   (laughs)
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.760]   - Well, see, this is why Microsoft doesn't care
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.080]   if Google and Apple are involved,
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.080]   because what they're selling really is Azure services.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.080]   - That's true, that's true.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.800]   - This hardware is secondary to the whole thing.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.120]   It's really all about Azure,
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.640]   and that was very clear from the beginning of the event on,
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.680]   is it's all about the cloud
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.600]   and selling services through the cloud,
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.960]   and weirdly, they're based,
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.640]   all of the products that they're talking about here,
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.920]   and here's where he's talking about Open
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.800]   and they have an App Store,
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.320]   but anybody else can have App Store?
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.200]   All the products here are under the Microsoft
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.240]   SoberK Dynamics 365,
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.960]   which until now was their CRM ERP platform.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.800]   But suddenly it's their augmented reality platform too.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.200]   So they're clearly, they see this as a cloud service
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.680]   that happens to have some hardware,
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.360]   but doesn't matter if it's not their hardware.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.320]   Here's Tim Sweeney, who reminded me so much of the guy,
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.240]   I should turn the audio on for this,
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.440]   in...
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.280]   - Wait a minute.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.280]   - For starting with the Unreal Engine,
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   Holen support is up and running now,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.120]   and he's coming...
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.000]   - He's the geek in that Ready Player One,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.880]   what was the name of the Ogden Morrow?
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.120]   He's Ogden Morrow.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.000]   - To all developers in May,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.680]   and on HoloLens.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.040]   - I think that Ogden Morrow was based...
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.560]   - And for the long term.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.240]   - Tim Sweeney!
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.840]   I shouldn't knock him, the guy made $7 billion
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.360]   last year on Fortnite.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.040]   And Fortnite in HoloLens might be interesting.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.480]   Is it Ogden Morrow, is that right?
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.320]   - James Halliday.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.840]   - James Halliday!
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.680]   I don't know who Ogden was.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.640]   - Ogden Morrow was the business partner
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.480]   who was kind of...
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.880]   - Oh, it was Halliday, was the nerdy guy.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.440]   - Slightly more freshly adept.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.680]   - Yeah.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.960]   Anyway, there you go.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.440]   Everything you ever wanted to know
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.760]   and probably considerably more
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.160]   about HoloLens 2.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.480]   - Good for Microsoft.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.880]   - I'm rooting for them, isn't that weird?
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.520]   - They're smart, they know what they're doing.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.160]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.760]   - I would never have said that,
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.080]   and what's really interesting is
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.760]   I think a lot of open source developers are rooting.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.600]   - Oh, heck yeah!
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.240]   - For Microsoft, now they own GitHub.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.440]   And they use Linux in Windows.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.280]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.680]   And they've got a great percentage
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.360]   of the gamer market as well.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.600]   I mean, they're in a good spot.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.680]   - Simon Pegg played Ogden Morrow.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.080]   Who played James Halliday?
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.080]   He was so good, a great actor.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.320]   Can't remember his name, but he was wonderful.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   Hey, let's take a little break.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.440]   You know, tonight the Oscars,
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.640]   we're gonna get out of here soon
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.200]   'cause we all wanna go watch the red carpet.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.600]   It's just gonna be an important Oscar night to watch
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.800]   because the front runner on Best Picture
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.640]   is a movie that was not made for theaters.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.920]   It was made by Netflix, for Netflix,
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.600]   in order to get into consideration for an Oscar,
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.520]   Roma had to be shown in a few theaters briefly.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.960]   But it's weird, you can see this for free
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.600]   if you have a Netflix subscription.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.560]   And it is an amazing film.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.600]   It is, I would say, a modern classic.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.400]   - Yeah, you gotta set a time aside to watch it.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.680]   - And but what's gonna happen if they give it
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.040]   an Academy Award?
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.440]   - Netflix has an Oscar.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.480]   - It pisses off the entire Hollywood movie.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.920]   - What happens when Netflix gets an E-God?
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.240]   - Oh yeah.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.400]   - Like, have we got-- - Is Netflix not an Emmy,
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.400]   a Grammy, and a Tony?
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.320]   - Is this what's happening now?
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.000]   Like, streaming services are a part of the pie.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.720]   - I don't think they'll ever get a Tony.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:52.800]   You can't put Netflix on Broadway.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.160]   So there might be an E-Go.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.160]   - Netflix theater.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.000]   - I'm just saying, they have a lot of money
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.560]   and they wanna expand to the East Coast.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.200]   Get out of Los Gatos, you know.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   - I think it's really-- - Really?
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.840]   - Hasting story.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.400]   - Say again? - Read Hastings story.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.560]   - The read Hastings story.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.880]   - What's the-- - Oh, the musical.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.720]   - That's the musical.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.320]   - I got an idea. - I got an idea.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.000]   What has more bandwidth than DVDs by mail?
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.720]   (laughing)
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.440]   - I mean-- - I mean--
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.640]   - You'd be good.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.080]   - I want it, I want it, I want that job.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:20.920]   - I don't know, Leo.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.120]   - Leo aboard Eats. - The Elleport Eats.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.120]   - Read Hastings without the wallet.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.840]   I think it's gonna be very interesting
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.400]   if Netflix wins an Academy Award.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.040]   This is gonna set the movie industry in it.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.080]   So you're, I'll be watching that with it.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.560]   - You know what, good for them.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.160]   - Good for them? - 'Cause Hollywood movie.
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.840]   - Fire under its butt. - And by the way,
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.000]   it's Alfonso Cuaron, who is one of our greatest directors.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.880]   - And like children of men, oh my God,
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.200]   how many times have I seen that movie?
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.040]   I just think-- - He did.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.120]   - The best Harry Potter movie.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:45.960]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.400]   - Prisoner Vaz Gabban. - Yes.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:50.960]   - He did Ituamama-Tambien, which was an amazing indie film.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:51.800]   - Yes, beautiful film.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:55.080]   - He did Gravity with Sandra Bullock.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.920]   - He did, that was also a great film.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.200]   - You do big Hollywood movies.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.400]   This is a small movie autobiographical
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:05.400]   about his life in the 1970s, middle-class Mexico,
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.080]   Mexico City in the Colonia Roma,
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.680]   which is why the name Roma.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   And it's about his housekeeper who raised him
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.680]   in its shot in black and white,
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.720]   black and white digital though,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.560]   which I thought was interesting.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.800]   - She's also the first indigenous person.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.960]   - She's nominated for Best Actress.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.960]   - She's nominated for Best Actress.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.800]   - I don't think she'll win Best Actress.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.560]   - And she's never had an actor acting over this.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.880]   - First acting job.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.720]   - First acting job.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.560]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.440]   - I do, I think this is, what's really,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.640]   of course there's a lot of diversity
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.880]   in the nominees, Black Clansman and Black Panther,
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.560]   both of which are great movies and Deservet,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.640]   Green Book, which is a little more controversial,
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.320]   but also a great movie, Vigo is awesome in it.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.120]   It's an interesting night tonight,
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.600]   but the tech angle and the thing to watch for
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.760]   is what happens to you.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.800]   - Our show today brought to you by Atlassian,
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.360]   and I mean brought to you by Atlassian,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.840]   we use Atlassian, we're at Atlassian house.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.320]   So Atlassian, everybody's familiar,
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.080]   I think probably with Jira, which is their agile tool,
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.240]   which helps you plan projects,
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:04.600]   figure out who's responsible,
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.440]   see what stage the project's in.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.440]   It's a very satisfying tool to use
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.640]   when you complete a project,
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.520]   you move it over to the completed column.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:14.240]   We love Jira, and Jira integrates very nicely
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.640]   with Atlassian's Confluence,
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.960]   which is what we use to document everything.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:20.000]   That's so important, you can do things,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.960]   but you need to tell the world,
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:24.040]   the other people in the department,
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.640]   plus your stakeholders, what you've done,
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.880]   how you use it, Confluence is great for that,
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.440]   but look how many other applications there are.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.840]   There's Bitbucket if you've got code databases to maintain.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.240]   There's Jira service desk,
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.680]   there's Trello, they acquired Trello,
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.720]   it's a fantastic project manager.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.200]   They also have ops solutions,
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.000]   like ops Genie and Stanish page,
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.480]   which will help you better detect incidents,
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.360]   coordinate response efforts,
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.080]   to resolve issues faster.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.840]   And of course, as always,
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.880]   everything integrates with Jira and Confluence,
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.920]   so you can keep customers and stakeholders up to date.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.160]   It's not just for developers,
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.680]   I think a lot of people think of Jira
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.720]   and they say, oh, it's a developer,
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.080]   Atlassian's a developer tool, no, no, no.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.720]   Atlassian offers an affordable, reliable suite of tools
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.160]   for teams of all sizes,
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.200]   from DevOps to Agile, IT apps to ops,
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.840]   to ITSM and whatever is next.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.720]   Atlassian is a collaboration software company
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.200]   that powers IT teams around the world.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.720]   And we are in a world where the IT team
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.520]   has a lot to plan and execute,
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.840]   it's a very complex world,
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.440]   IT is at the center of it,
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.840]   Atlassian is at the center of any IT operation.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.440]   As always, with Atlassian,
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.560]   your team can choose the tools
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.440]   that are right for your current framework,
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.640]   while trusting that as you grow, they will grow with you.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.640]   I love Atlassian, we use it like crazy.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.680]   And of course, like all of Atlassian's products,
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.480]   the tools you need for your IT team are easy,
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.080]   and free to try.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:50.080]   Just head to Atlassian.com/IT to find out
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.840]   which Atlassian offering is right for your team.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:58.200]   Atlassian is the collaboration software company
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.280]   that powers IT teams around the world.
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.120]   Try Atlassian today and see what IT can be.

[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.720]   I think one of the biggest stories of the week,
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.160]   and maybe it's my imagination,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.800]   but I think one of the biggest stories of the week
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:19.040]   is that Apple is planning to team up with Goldman Sachs
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.800]   to release a credit card,
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.240]   a credit card that will work with your iPhone.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:30.160]   Seth, for a long time, we've been saying Apple
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:31.680]   should get into credit card business.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.440]   Is this a surprise to you?
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.400]   Is this a good movie?
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.040]   So it's not a surprise.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:42.720]   Goldman has a pretty good reputation
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.240]   among the banks,
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:49.360]   but I'm kind of wondering where they go with it,
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.040]   because at the end,
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.520]   this all ends up being in Apple's coffers, right?
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.040]   Like Apple can team up with any bank
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.240]   and have a credit card,
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.080]   but it's all coming through the iPhone.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.320]   So you're wondering why Goldman is doing it?
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.560]   Yeah, I'm kind of curious about that.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.200]   I wonder if it's gonna be tied to investment accounts
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:12.280]   or some other play.
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:17.040]   I don't really understand why Goldman is in it.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   Does Goldman do credit cards?
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.160]   I mean, I know they're an investment banker.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.320]   I don't think they do much retail stuff.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.120]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:30.360]   But they have the financial services, obviously,
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.920]   to do it and they have the name to do it.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.200]   It makes sense for Apple,
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.160]   which is trying to find new forms of revenue
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.280]   outside of selling hardware, right?
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.600]   This is one of those-- Absolutely.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.120]   That's how you build this service number,
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.280]   which is almost $10 billion a year already.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.840]   I think Apple knows it's got the gateway
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.640]   to just about everything with the phone.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:55.280]   So they're going up and down the value chain,
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.440]   you know, clipping new revenue models.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.280]   So I don't think that it's surprising at all,
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.400]   but it'll be interesting to see what angle they take here.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.120]   So this is a Wall Street Journal scoop
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:12.040]   from Tripp Meckel, Liz Hoffman, and Peter Rudeger.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.160]   They say the card will be rolled out to employees
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.680]   for testing in the next few weeks,
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:19.160]   officially launched later this year.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.120]   The companies hope to lure card holders
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.640]   by offering them extra features on Apple's Wallet app,
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.200]   which will let them set spending goals,
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.840]   track their rewards, manage their balances.
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.520]   Really, this could be the beginning,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:34.760]   and maybe this makes sense, Seth, of Apple as a bank.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.160]   Yep.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.000]   It's kind of what it sounds like,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.200]   because Apple would be the retail end of Goldman Sachs.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.680]   Yep.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.160]   And a lot of those services that were just mentioned
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.480]   are available not through Apple, but through, you know,
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.440]   app, Chase.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.880]   Yeah, and apps are on your phone.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.440]   Right, so this would be, I guess, built into your Apple account
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.000]   somehow or directly into the phone,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.760]   rather than having to have a separate app.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.480]   And for a member, people are already using their iPhones
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.120]   in their watches with Apple Pay,
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.360]   which has to be ultimately an important,
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:14.000]   you know, if you want to make, what was it?
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.560]   I can't remember where I heard this.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.000]   Maybe it was in the big short or something,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.560]   but the best way to make money is not to try to get all the money,
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:24.800]   but just to take a little piece of every transaction.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.480]   And that's exactly what this is, right?
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.800]   If Apple's involved in every financial transaction you make
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.040]   and gets a few percentage points on that, that's profit.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:36.920]   That's a lot of money, yeah.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.440]   That's a lot of money.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:42.320]   Yeah, I mean, maybe you get a bank account with your Apple ID,
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.160]   you know, like every single Apple customer has,
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.120]   you know, a Goldman account and, you know,
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.400]   your default credit card is the Apple credit card and, you know,
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.920]   all these things kind of come together.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:56.720]   I, this is Goldman's first credit card,
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.920]   but I didn't know this in 2016.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.080]   They launched an online bank, Marcus.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:05.480]   I'd never heard of this, Marcus, which is still around.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.400]   And so there's some thinking that maybe Apple,
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.440]   which has a loyal following among wealthy tech-savvy young adults,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.920]   could drive customers to the Marcus bank.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.840]   Who knows?
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.400]   I'm wondering if it's like when you buy a car
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:27.880]   and the loan goes through the bank of the car manufacturer
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.200]   that they want you to have the loan through.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:34.600]   Yeah, GMC, that actually turned out to be a bigger business for GM
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.160]   than selling cars.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.240]   Yeah, and they have a higher APR on those things too.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.080]   So you're paying more at a lease or buy a car through them.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.880]   And I wonder if this is just a way to appeal like,
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.400]   "Hey, you're buying all this Apple stuff anyway.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.640]   "So why don't you just have a credit card through us
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.200]   "and then we'll give you all these extra perks?"
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.720]   So Father Robert Ballis there who's in the chat room,
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.560]   lurking.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.640]   He's not with us anymore.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.880]   He's gone to a better place, Vatican.
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.600]   But he says he's had a Marcus account since its inception.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.640]   How do you like it, Father Robert?
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.680]   No fee personal loan.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.000]   I'm looking at their website.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.640]   No fee personal loan's high yield online savings.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.600]   Wow, APR in a savings account, 2.25%.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.560]   I think I've got a--
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:21.920]   So I think I might move.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.560]   Start saving for that next MacBook Pro.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.520]   I have an online only bank.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.440]   I don't--
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.560]   Goes into a bank anymore.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:32.840]   I use USAA, which is a great company.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:36.240]   Well, because they don't have branches,
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.520]   they, you can use any ATM and they refund the ATM fee.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.560]   Versus me where I pay like $4 every time.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.400]   So I can go to any ATM, get cash out.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:48.920]   I can deposit money, it checks through my phone.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.040]   What else do I need to go to a bank for?
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.000]   The cookies?
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.840]   I don't, you know--
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:55.960]   They don't give them out anymore.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.120]   So they don't really get out.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.040]   Toasters, nothing.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.600]   They don't give anything out anymore.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:00.760]   It's sad.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:04.440]   So no fee loans and 2.25% on savings.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.320]   Why is Goldman doing it?
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.840]   The Wall Street Journal says because Goldman's losing money
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.640]   in the investment market.
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.640]   Yep.
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:14.480]   That is--
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:15.840]   That they're not--
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.600]   You gotta diversify those bonds.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.000]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.640]   So they're both basically diversifying, right?
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.760]   Essentially, they're both just like trying to get some,
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.080]   I don't know, some money from somewhere else.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.280]   But let's help each other get into the future, you know?
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.840]   I'm sure Apple would like to do this on their own.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:32.840]   But--
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.680]   You don't have the cloud.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.560]   Financial services are not something you just kind of--
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:38.720]   You don't just go from Silicon Valley to financial services.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.120]   It's just two different worlds.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.600]   So I could see maybe if it's a success.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.840]   Apparently, Goldman's putting $200 million
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.080]   into adding customer support call centers,
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.520]   building an internal system to handle payments,
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.320]   beefing up Marcus.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:57.040]   And this is a major investment, said people familiar
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.200]   with the matter at a time when the bank is trying to cut costs.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.720]   So it's interesting.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.000]   I could see Apple maybe saying, well, let's partner.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.440]   If it goes well, we'll just buy out.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.160]   Just buy out.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:06.960]   You got the cash.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:07.960]   Oof.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.640]   Why not?
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.240]   I bet they're thinking of that.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.760]   Anyway, this is something we've talked about many times
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.560]   on Mac break weekly as if Apple's going to rely on services.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.080]   What it really means for Apple, since iPhone sales are down,
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.520]   you can't count on Mac or iPad sales to buoy you up.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.880]   You don't have the next big thing yet.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.360]   In fact, Apple's even saying this on their analyst calls.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.320]   It's all about services.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   Yep.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.560]   What do you do to replace that kind of revenue,
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.000]   which is significant banking?
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.200]   That's why Microsoft is doing so well, because they kind
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.000]   of floated on those services that we're working for them.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.120]   And Apple sees that and is thinking ahead.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:51.520]   All right.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.640]   Well, there's only so much more time
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.680]   we have left to make money off of all this hardware.
[01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:59.560]   Eventually, it's going to stall a little bit,
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.520]   because everybody will have their hardware.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.520]   And you can't keep upgrading.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.600]   No, but that's one more reason--
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.280]   That's why I'm going to slow down.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.880]   It's one more reason to buy an Apple Watch and an iPhone
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.280]   is because I do all my banking on it.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.160]   And I can't do that on my Android phone.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.280]   I bet they won't do it on an Android phone, right?
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:21.720]   No.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.080]   They're going to keep it open.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.040]   As long as we're talking Apple, you kind of brought this up.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.440]   Seth Apple is planning on combining--
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:33.080]   this is from Mark Gurman, who's very, very reliable, Bloomberg.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.560]   Well, I think you know Mark pretty well, Seth.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.560]   I know Mark.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.320]   I've heard of him.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.080]   Seth started Mark in his career when he was like 17, right, Seth?
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   It might have been even younger.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.960]   He was just a kid.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.200]   It was like, yeah, his-- a tipster turned star reporter.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.600]   I'm sure you're rooting for him.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.760]   But still--
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.280]   Absolutely.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.040]   He should be writing for 9 to 5 Mac.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:56.640]   Of course.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.200]   Not this Bloomberg.
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:01.680]   Anyway, he's kept his sources apparently.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.320]   He says Apple plans to come-- this is interesting.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.720]   The first thing I'd heard earlier
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.080]   was that Apple wants to encourage iPad developers
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.600]   to make their apps Mac compatible.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.160]   And there's an SDK.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.960]   It would acquire a week compiling.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.440]   Now, Mark's saying, that's this year.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.960]   But going forward by 2021, Apple plans
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.920]   to combine iPhone, iPad, and Macintosh apps.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.320]   So there's one platform.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.480]   Is that your understanding of the Seth?
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.720]   Well, I mean, so combine this with the news also this week
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:41.840]   that Macs are going to Apple chips, going way too into--
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.040]   Arm-based, yeah.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:45.240]   Arm-based chips.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.040]   I would assume that Apple, 8, 12, 13, 14, whatever.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.600]   So you're kind of merging, really, the platforms at this point.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:59.560]   So looking two years out, you kind of
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.760]   see that the Mac is going to be kind of like an iOS device
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.400]   at that point.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.400]   OK, project official.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.280]   You know, if Google's response to this--
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:07.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.040]   --that we got to make our own offer an assistant.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:10.560]   That's not going to--
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560]   You mean interrupt Seth.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.440]   Oh, that's ugly.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.560]   That's ugly at this point.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.920]   Thinking.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.640]   This is a mature system.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.240]   Ecosystem.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:18.640]   Right.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.280]   It's along the same lines.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.520]   So the idea is by 2020 when you're writing that app,
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.840]   it will work on any of those three platforms.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.120]   And your right, Seth, key to that is putting Mac on arm.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.360]   Right.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.280]   And Apple's version.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.640]   And they're kind of like with Mars and Pan,
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.680]   they're kind of like, here's our roadmap.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:41.560]   Here's our three year plan to get developers to write one app
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.320]   for both--
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.920]   most developers are writing for iOS
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.480]   because there's too so many more people on iOS than Mac.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.160]   So iOS apps will work on Mac.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.640]   And then theoretically, everybody comes over,
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.600]   except maybe like, parallels isn't
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.680]   going to work on not Intel chips.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.920]   And obviously Adobe's got a lot of work to do
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.320]   to get their desktop apps.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.600]   The bigger, more complicated stuff
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.760]   that's got a lot of legacy Intel code, it's going to be hard.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.920]   But this is one of those things.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.360]   This is like Apple going from a power PC to Intel.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.080]   It's just a transition over a period of time.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.880]   And we kind of know it's not official yet.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.840]   We kind of know what that looks like with Marx reporting
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.600]   and others.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.440]   It looks like we're about three years away from when
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.960]   it's fully engaged.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.640]   And maybe this year, Tim Cook or somebody else kind of shows
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.200]   that roadmap a little bit better so that developers are
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.760]   really on board.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.240]   This is going to benefit the rest of us as well.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.280]   Because I am hearing like Adobe is going to have to go and do
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.040]   some work.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.520]   We have all these other suites on thinking.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:57.480]   But Adobe's working on it.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.120]   They already have Photoshop's getting more and more capable.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.520]   Lightroom's getting more and more capable, both on iOS.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.840]   Adobe announced at their last conference
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:12.000]   that they were going to make a full Photoshop for iOS.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.080]   Truthfully, a lot of the pro apps are Apple's own apps.
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.720]   Final cut logic.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.200]   They're pages.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.160]   So I think Apple must have been working on this for some time.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.080]   How is it working out for Microsoft?
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.400]   Because this is what I was sort of clumsily referring to
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.960]   before.
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.240]   But I wonder how it's working out for Microsoft.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.320]   The history of this, you all know the history of this is
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:36.760]   terrible.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.880]   The idea of cross platform apps is littered with strewn
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.440]   bodies.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.760]   Remember Java swing, the idea that you'd write once.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:49.360]   Swing would give you a quote native UI on every platform.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.920]   It was a disaster.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.360]   I mean, everybody agrees.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.960]   Actually, there's an interesting tie in to this.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:01.120]   Because Linus Torvalds showed his prickly side this week when
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.680]   he said, you have to be an idiot to think that ARM is going
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.240]   to make it in the server room.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.680]   He says, because developers want their software as a service
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.080]   applications to run the same platform they developed it on.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.160]   They develop it on x86.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.280]   They want it to run on x86.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.440]   Nobody in his right mind really wants to do cross
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:24.080]   compiling or one size fits all.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.880]   You write an application for native.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.320]   But this could be where Linus missed the boat.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.760]   Because if all of a sudden one of the biggest players, Apple
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.480]   goes all ARM.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:39.360]   Maybe ARM servers are suddenly a very, very good idea for
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.120]   software as a service and progressive web apps and
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:42.480]   other stuff.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.560]   Maybe you are developing native.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.280]   But I have to say, the conventional wisdom has always
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.640]   been you develop-- the best app is not the app you develop
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.400]   for both Android and iOS.
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.840]   It's the app you develop for that platform.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.360]   An Apple app or an iPad app is not as good as--
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.000]   if it's just an iPhone app.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.760]   You need to develop specifically for that platform.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.520]   How do you get around that?
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.440]   Mm.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.960]   I mean, it's a good question.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.640]   I guess what they're hoping for in the long term is that
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.960]   you're going to be developing on an iOS Mac or an iOS
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.560]   desktop device.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.640]   So you're going to be developing iOS on iOS.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.520]   And that's got to be the idea.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.440]   I don't have any other--
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.240]   Like developing for Android on the Chromebook.
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.280]   I see the benefit-- I do see the benefit for Apple.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.320]   Apple does not want to be-- they've had to wait for Intel.
[01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:40.120]   And in fact, if you can criticize Apple for its slow
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:43.640]   development of a Mac Pro or new iMacs or new Mac minis,
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.440]   it's because Intel just can't deliver.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.080]   So they're sick of that.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:53.240]   Qualcomm and Apple are in huge fight, suing each other,
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.640]   owing each other billions.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:59.280]   And Steve Jobs always said, by the way,
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.080]   it's his 64th-- would be his 64th birthday today.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.040]   Steve Jobs always said, you want to make the software,
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.560]   you got to own the hardware, you got to do it both.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.920]   And he always wanted a single source of everything.
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.560]   He hated the idea of going to Intel and buying chips.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.800]   So of course, there's a benefit for Apple.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.040]   But the question is, is there a benefit for consumers?
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.520]   And are we going to be as happy?
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.280]   I know as a Mac user, I'm not looking forward
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:30.680]   to using my iPad for anything I use my Mac for.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.280]   I've tried.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.200]   It's a nightmare.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.640]   I'm smiling because it's my life with the Chromebook.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.840]   Yeah, you're almost-- you're kind of doing that.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.120]   I mean, theoretically, Apple has a couple years
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:45.080]   to bridge that gap, make the iPad OS more like a Mac OS.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.600]   Really?
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.100]   It was the great--
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:48.280]   In theory, eventually, it'll be awesome, right?
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.960]   I mean, for the consumer--
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.120]   In theory, eventually, everything is awesome.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:52.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.600]   In theory, everything is awesome.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.480]   But no, I think about the way that I use--
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.800]   I'm an Android, and the way that I use, essentially, Google,
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.440]   Drive, Gmail, all of that stuff.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.560]   And it is-- the experience is fundamentally the same
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.520]   on my PC as it is on my phone, right?
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.760]   And this is kind of--
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.040]   In theory, this is what it looks like for the consumer
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:19.880]   across the board, no matter what you're using, right?
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.560]   And to me, that sounds great.
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:27.440]   Being able to, I don't know, use Adobe products on my phone
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.240]   the same way that I do or a similar way
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.160]   that I do on my machine.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.080]   I mean, so many of us are doing that all the time anyway
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.120]   as people who are working increasingly all the time.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.560]   We're trying to open the thing on our phone
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.680]   instead of our computer, because our computer is not
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.880]   in front of us.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.960]   So in theory, it would be great to be able to have that experience.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.520]   Maybe Apple make a foldable iPad.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.040]   Samsung's making the displays for us.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.120]   We've got full circle.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.000]   So actually, when I bought the iPad Pro, the new iPad Pro,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.600]   12.9, that was exactly my experience,
[01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.800]   which is this is the best hardware.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.960]   This is hardware from the future.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.160]   This is amazing.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.440]   It's the processor is a desktop class, maybe even faster
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.400]   processor.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.040]   The screen is-- in every way, it was stellar hardware,
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.880]   and it was completely hobbled by iOS, which
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.320]   wasn't anywhere near as sophisticated.
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:23.640]   So they do have some work to do.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.560]   Yeah, my understanding is iOS 13 this year
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.280]   is going to be a big step in that direction.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.720]   I think they're going to have a--
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.760]   Lucky number 13, it's a good number.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.120]   The rumor says was that they wanted to do this in 12.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:35.640]   Right.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.520]   Stepped back.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:41.000]   Scott Forestall and others said, no, let's get 12.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.160]   Reliable.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.000]   I don't know if Forestall is still making those calls,
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.440]   but maybe not Scott.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.840]   In fact, it was Scott Forestall that they got rid of
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.480]   so that they could do this and step back.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.520]   So let's make it reliable.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:55.840]   And then in 13, we'll start taking those steps towards desktop
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.040]   computing.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:57.400]   Right.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.760]   That's kind of what I've been hearing.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.920]   So Microsoft very famously stumbled on this one,
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.800]   moving Windows 7 to Windows 8, trying
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.760]   to make a hybrid desktop tablet.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.160]   It was a horrific failure.
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:14.440]   Apple--
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.800]   But they didn't really try that hard.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.040]   They just said, here, and here.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:20.600]   And let's go.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.480]   Just push them together.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.880]   For my Windows 8.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.720]   I skipped it.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.240]   Oh, it was a nightmare.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:25.880]   I skipped it.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:29.160]   I just stayed on 7 until I couldn't.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.640]   And actually, 10 has solved that problem.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.800]   Much of the tablet interface that was in 8
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.160]   has been hidden is still in 10, but has been hidden.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.600]   And so it can look like a desktop operating system,
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.720]   even when you're in tablet features.
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.040]   Sometimes I touch the screen, but not always.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.200]   Oh, I like--
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:45.720]   I like television.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.960]   That's why I like the Chromebook, because here--
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.560]   I'm touching the screen.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.240]   I mean, you're actually-- yeah, I forgot
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.800]   you have this giant Windows.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.880]   I have a giant surface to it.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.480]   I mean--
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.040]   It's actually bugged the hell out of the--
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.440]   I would do this too.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.520]   I would do this too if I had this giant thing.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.400]   Pat the screen.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.240]   This is a bold step by Apple, but I
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:10.800]   think it's clear Apple has to make a bold step at this point.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:16.320]   That iPhone sales are tailing off, and that services
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.600]   aren't going to grow unless you start a bank,
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.440]   offer a credit card, and hardware is not going to grow
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.560]   unless you unify your best seller iPhone with everything
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:26.880]   else.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.680]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.880]   So it's a bold move, but I think Apple can do it.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.480]   Actually, I saw an article--
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.880]   I don't know if it's in our rundown today--
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.360]   saying that actually there's been a huge shakeup
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.160]   in Apple's executive over the last year.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.760]   And of course, the most recent is Angela Arrence,
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.920]   who was a very talented executive in charge of retail,
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.240]   leaving after only five years.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:00.560]   Yeah, and the Google guy that John, Gian Dara, is--
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.000]   Gendreya.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.720]   Gendreya has been elevated to like, you know,
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.880]   exact level.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.720]   He's obviously an important person
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.920]   because he's kind of the AI guy.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.200]   And that's-- you know, Apple's next 10 years
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.800]   is going to be very heavy AI.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.280]   So yeah, I agree with the Wall Street Journal's take
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.960]   on that.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:25.240]   These new people coming in are quite important.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.080]   They say it really shows that Apple is going all in
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.280]   on services.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:34.480]   But I think it really is-- this is the new game plan.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.320]   What do you think this comes from Tim Cook?
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.960]   He doesn't ever seem like a visionary.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.480]   I don't know.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.520]   Who's running this at this point?
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.920]   That's a good question.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.480]   You know, I don't see Tim Cook saying, you know,
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.160]   I want to make more-- I want to make video.
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.120]   Like, I want to make movies.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.960]   Like, that doesn't seem like something he would--
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.240]   That's eddy cue all the way, right?
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:57.600]   Right.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.640]   And like, you know, I have to say, like, I'm a big Apple fan.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:07.600]   Like, eddy cues stuff isn't always Apple's best stuff.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.800]   And like, I have to admit it as well.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.160]   Like, every announcement that we cover that Apple's getting
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.360]   into this or that or whatever, none of it
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.680]   is interesting to me.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.400]   Like, it's just, you know, like the app game show.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.440]   Like, that was like--
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   Oh, that was terrible.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.240]   --just painful.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:23.880]   It was painful.
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.760]   And so I don't know that Apple's
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.880]   going to be super successful in this area.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.000]   You know, I hope-- I hope they are.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.240]   I hope there's some interesting stuff that comes out of this.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.760]   But so far, I haven't seen anything.
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.360]   We're expecting at least according to John Pachkowski.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.560]   I think German confirmed it.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:44.640]   March 25th, Apple is hoping to roll out this new movie service
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.960]   and the new news service.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.040]   The journal is also reporting that there are some hitches
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.240]   in that get along, including publishers.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.280]   I'm sure the Wall Street Journal is one of them.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.160]   New York Times, I'm certainly another one.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.720]   Washington Post, maybe a third, that don't like Apple's plan,
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:03.160]   which includes a 50% of the take.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:03.680]   Ouch.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.360]   What the Journal's reporting, again, this is not Apple.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.040]   This is rumor, is that Apple has approached magazines
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.360]   and newspapers saying, look, here's the deal.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.600]   It's going to be $10 a month.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.000]   We're keeping five.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.560]   We'll take the other five.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.840]   We'll pull it.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:22.080]   And whoever gets the most views will get the biggest chunk of that.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.640]   We'll divide it up based on engagement.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:24.920]   And--
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.280]   --and bonus.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.360]   --where's the bonus coming from?
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.960]   I don't know.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.560]   We talked a lot about this on MacBreak Weekly.
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.360]   And I think the consensus was absolutely any national magazine.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.280]   Magazines have a hard time as it is.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.360]   Any national magazine will probably welcome the new eyeballs
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.640]   and whatever revenue that they can get out of this.
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.160]   They're struggling anyway.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.280]   It's the local newspapers that are going to say, well, wait a minute.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.160]   I'm the Boston Globe.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.600]   I have a big Boston audience.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.400]   I'm not giving them to you, Apple,
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.160]   because Apple's going to take half the revenue,
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.000]   and they're not going to give me the names of subscribers
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.160]   or any information about them.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.560]   Maybe the national papers, like the Times in the Post
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.840]   and the Journal, it maybe makes sense for it,
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.840]   but doesn't make sense for any regional--
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.200]   --and sub-cronicle.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.480]   Chronicle, no.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.200]   So I don't know if Apple will come back to them
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.560]   and offer them a better deal.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.680]   I guess we'll find out March 25th.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.080]   You know, Apple get in trouble with the book--
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   --the publishing thing--
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.640]   --book thing a while back.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.080]   And so this feels like a repeat of--
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:26.880]   --learn from your podcast.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.600]   But you know, you could say that.
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.200]   And remember, Apple got-- the music industry was pissed off
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.040]   at Steve Jobs for 99 cents.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.560]   They destroyed the album.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.560]   But you know what?
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.640]   In every case, Apple won, didn't they?
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.200]   In the long run, Apple won on all of that.
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.560]   And of course, the iTunes store is the number one way people
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.040]   buy music.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.480]   I can't say iBooks is the number one way people buy books.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.480]   Amazon owns that.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.800]   I think this is going to be interesting.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.640]   March 25th, Pachowski says there won't be no hardware
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.160]   announcements.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.560]   Well, he's hedged that a little bit since.
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:57.160]   Maybe there will.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:57.960]   Maybe there'll be a mini.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.000]   Maybe there'll be at least some news about Mac Pro.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.480]   And the king of the supply chain analyst
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:12.280]   says that there'll be a new 31-inch monitor.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.160]   Beautiful, if it's true.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.680]   If the rumors are true, monitor.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.920]   Ming Chi Kuo says it's-- what was the resolution?
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920]   It was weird.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.840]   6K.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.840]   6K.
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:22.360]   It was that.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360]   31 inch.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.840]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.040]   I know who's going to be buying those.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:27.520]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520]   Hollywood.
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.760]   Presumably paired with a new Mac Pro.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.760]   Right.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.600]   I would imagine that those are going to be announced at WWDC in June.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   In June, yeah.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.600]   That makes sense.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.240]   Maybe an iPad makes-- like an iPad mini's we know are coming pretty soon.
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.640]   Well, and you could tie that in.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.160]   Now you can read your magazines and your newspapers
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.280]   and the iPad mini.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.400]   You can watch the new Oprah show on the iPad mini.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.560]   Maybe they tie it in that way.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560]   It's a media consensus.
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.240]   They just got to figure out how to fold it.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.480]   That's the only thing I have to say.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.040]   Take it with you.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.440]   Does it bend?
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.560]   Does it bend?
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.520]   Will it blend?
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:05.840]   That is the motto of the day.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.000]   We're talking about all the tech news.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.680]   It's great to have Seth Winetrop here from 9 to 5,
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.520]   9 to 5, Google 9 to 5, Mac.
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.200]   Electric.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.360]   Are you a Tesla driver?
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.480]   I can't remember.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.080]   I am.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.480]   I have two now.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.000]   An X and an S.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:22.960]   An X and a--
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.240]   An X and a 3.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.240]   You like the 3?
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:26.720]   I love it.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   It's a great car.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.240]   Everybody who owns it loves it.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.760]   But I'm worried about the long-term health
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.640]   of Tesla a little bit.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.960]   I don't blame you.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:39.040]   The CEO is a little bit erratic.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:39.840]   A little.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.840]   So I mean--
[01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.720]   And yeah, Agenius, what's this rocket
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.160]   that he's about to launch?
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:46.640]   The guy's a bit--
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.560]   Clearly Agenius.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.840]   He gets stuff done.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.240]   Just a little nutty.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.840]   No, it's-- I just-- I worry that he's
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.920]   going to go on some Twitter rant, get himself fired
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.360]   from his company.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.000]   And it'll be in turmoil.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.120]   And the stock will go down.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.360]   And all the employees will leave because stock price is so low.
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.920]   And their options are worth nothing.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.080]   It just feels like they're kind of on the edge at all times.
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.560]   It almost feels like he keeps them on the edge at all times.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.240]   Maybe that's part of his thing.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:28.920]   But I mean, it's frustrating as a Tesla fan, Tesla owner,
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.160]   that I have to go around saying, yes, I know he's insane.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.880]   Why do we have to go through all of this?
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.120]   The cars are quite nice.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.520]   They built themselves a really good network of chargers
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:45.480]   and a gigafactory that's building tons of batteries
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.240]   that are helping--
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.520]   Well, helping Puerto Rico and Australia.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.560]   Look at this Raptor engine, which I think just
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.120]   got NASA approval, right, John?
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.960]   Are they going to be launching this test when?
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.760]   Pretty soon, right?
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:04.200]   Yeah, I can't play the video because I have my browsers too
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:04.640]   smart.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.040]   I hate it with browsers.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.680]   You see that smart.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.680]   But yeah, pretty cool.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:16.720]   Yeah, see every time I click on it.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.000]   I'm using the Brave browser, which I really like.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   I was going to ask what you want.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.880]   You know why I use it because it stops auto play video.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.400]   Well--
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.760]   There are times when I want to play video,
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.120]   and there's a button I'm supposed to click,
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.040]   but I could never find it.
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.600]   Anyway, yeah, so Elon is clearly--
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.000]   SpaceX is doing great.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.920]   I do hear bad rumors.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:42.120]   You tell me if this is BS, Seth, about Tesla's repairs,
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.920]   their repair facilities, the wait time for repairs,
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.440]   things like that.
[01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.160]   No, that's true.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.880]   I've had two different problems with my Model 3,
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:55.080]   and they've both taken a little bit of time.
[01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.920]   And if you get in a wreck and you need body work, forget it.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.080]   It's like months.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.560]   Right.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.000]   But I mean--
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.760]   I am the neighbor who has a Tesla,
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.040]   and she's been driving it.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.520]   She's got a Model 3, and she's been super psyched about it.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.600]   And last month, I saw the repair guy there at her parking
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.200]   spot.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.720]   That's the cool thing that would come to you.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.600]   And then last week, it was a Ford.
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.760]   The Tesla was gone.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.280]   That's not good.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:22.680]   That's not good.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.160]   And an Astor about it yet.
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   But I was like, hmm, that's interesting.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.800]   Like they sent the guy, and then now the car has gone.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:34.880]   It's kind of like an abusive relationship where--
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:37.640]   I promise, I'll never hurt you again.
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.200]   And then they just keep doing it.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.280]   It breaks your heart.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.280]   I don't know.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.400]   I'm looking-- there's so many now electric vehicles coming out.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.760]   I'm looking at other electric vehicles,
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.160]   because my lease runs out in July.
[01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.720]   I'm looking at other electric vehicles.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.920]   Are you looking at the Kona or the Nero?
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.680]   We're probably going to get a Nero, for sure.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.640]   At least it wants to get a Nero.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.840]   If you can find him.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.560]   Yeah, it's quite hard to get.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.400]   Yeah, I'm trying to pull some strings.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.560]   But what I really want to get--
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.760]   in September, Porsche comes out with its first electric
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.360]   vehicle, the Taycan.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.000]   Yeah, that'll be a--
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:08.600]   Taycan?
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.040]   That'll be a--
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:11.800]   Taken.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.160]   Taycan.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.200]   T-A-Y-C-A-M.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:13.920]   But Sam--
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:14.640]   C-A-Y-C-A.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.080]   Sam Mvelsomid says you pronounce it--
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.440]   Porsche wants you to pronounce it Taycan.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:18.520]   How do they always do that?
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.760]   I don't like having a car where I have to have instructions
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   on how even to say the manufacturer's name is.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.280]   Porsche, Porsche, what--
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.360]   I say Porsche, because that's how I--
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:26.840]   But it's Porsche.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.920]   It's tireless, it's taut.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.320]   I don't know.
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.200]   And it's Taycan.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:35.400]   And it's 0 to 60 in maybe even under 3 and 1/2 seconds.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.920]   That's insane.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.000]   I think they're saying 2.8.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.600]   2.8 now.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:40.080]   So--
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.720]   Which competes with the Falcon rocket engine,
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.680]   the Raptor rocket engine, I believe.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.280]   So you're taking it to the track?
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.080]   Track is right here.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:47.960]   I'm going to take it to the track.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.480]   Why not?
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.160]   I don't go that fast.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:49.960]   I have insane--
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.800]   So finally, oh.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.600]   That's so much fun.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.400]   I stopped doing it because I black out.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.400]   This is weird though.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.960]   Like the 0 to 60 thing is such a weird thing to me.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.000]   No, somebody drives that way.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:00.600]   I get it.
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.960]   Nobody does it.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:04.600]   I mean, they do it when you get into the car.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:06.680]   They do it to show you how awesome it is.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.160]   And that is awesome.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.440]   But then nobody-- you don't do it in real life
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.000]   unless you're getting on the highway in a super tricky
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.680]   situation.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.680]   And that's the only time you're doing it.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.800]   I'm betting so--
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.400]   It's an important thing to know that your car can do.
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:21.160]   Like how quickly can it accelerate?
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:21.920]   I want quick acceleration.
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.760]   But you need 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   I need to be able to--
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.120]   I'm saying.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.920]   --do you need it that fast.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:27.920]   Right?
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.920]   I am a person in a rush.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.520]   So this is the point of the final difference between a car
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.120]   cars and gas cars.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.240]   So if you have a gas car and you go to 0 to 60 as fast as it
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:37.480]   can go, your passengers are going to think you're insane.
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.200]   Because it goes the first gear--
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.520]   Just why I don't usually--
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.040]   That's true.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:42.520]   It's true.
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520]   I don't say it.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.840]   I'm not saying it's a sport hood.
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.720]   But if you're on a Tesla, you just put the gas pedal on the floor.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:51.880]   And everybody's head goes back.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.200]   The coffee goes flying.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.200]   It's true.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.200]   It did feel like that in your Tesla.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.200]   It didn't grow up.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200]   No, it does--
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.200]   Did I do that to you?
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.280]   But I've also been in a Porsche doing that.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.360]   And I had the same.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.360]   Well, imagine--
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.560]   But it's a little more than the Porsche.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.560]   Combining the Porsche.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.560]   It's pronounced Porsche.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.080]   OK.
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080]   Thank you, Ben.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.080]   I'm just kidding.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.080]   I'm just kidding.
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.080]   I'm just kidding.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.080]   Yeah, I'm pronouncing it like my people.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.440]   Now, wait a minute.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440]   Let's get this straight.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.120]   You're Romanian, not Romani.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.120]   Not Romanian.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   Romani, OK.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   I want to make sure--
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.120]   I'm Balkan.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.960]   I'm 80% Balkan and 10% Italian and 10% other stuff.
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960]   Don't be Balkan.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.880]   Go out and get a job.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.120]   I don't know what.
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.320]   March 2nd, the Raptor engine will fly.
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.320]   Will it fly with a crew?
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   Jon?
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320]   No.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   There won't be people on it.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   There will.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.440]   But they're going to do that thing where they go up in the air
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.840]   and then they land the boosters and all that stuff.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.480]   Wow.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.560]   They generally don't test new engines with crews.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:52.560]   No.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.920]   Actually, yeah.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.920]   And the water's somewhere.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:55.680]   It seems dangerous.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.040]   No, but if you're a Russian, you test it with dogs.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:58.800]   That's true.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:24:59.960]   Likea.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.720]   RIP.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.200]   Doggy's.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.120]   Aw.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.240]   They're cute.
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.320]   The true story of likea is actually horrible.
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.280]   You know that.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.680]   It's just awful.
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.200]   What?
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.760]   I have a husky name likea.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:10.840]   Oh.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.720]   She was the first dog in space, wasn't she?
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.880]   Her and another dog.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.680]   I forgot their name.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:22.320]   And yeah, the Russians kind of lied about what happened to likea.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.920]   Those darn Ruskies.
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.840]   Let's take a little break.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.440]   Maybe they didn't like it.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:28.440]   Oh.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.040]   Oh.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.360]   I'm balking at that joke.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.720]   Oh, boy.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.560]   It's pronounced Raymond Luxury Yacht.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.520]   But it's pronounced Throat Robler-Mangrove.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:46.440]   I'm just going to say, I don't know what that sounds familiar, vaguely familiar.
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.880]   But I don't.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.840]   Our show today brought to you by CashFly.

[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   The server's down.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.520]   The CDN's down.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.960]   It is awesome.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:30.960]   And I don't have to log into my CashFly dashboard every five minutes to find out if I'm over

[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:46.760]   CashFly CDN delivers rich media content up to 10 times faster than traditional delivery
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:53.960]   methods, 30% faster than other major CDNs, a 100% SLA.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.520]   That's not 5, 9, 6, 9, 10.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520]   That's 100%.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.840]   And the reason is they've got servers all over the world.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:06.520]   That's a huge advantage because your users are getting their content from a nearby server.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:09.520]   And if one goes down, you're still online.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.480]   They never go down.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:15.080]   CashFly guarantees the best user experience for all your customers no matter where they
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.800]   are, no matter what device they're on.
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.800]   I'm not the only one.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.640]   There are thousands of trust CashFly's reliable network, LG, Microsoft, Adobe, R's, Technica,
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:27.280]   we host everything, audio and video on CashFly.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:30.440]   You've been doing that for nearly a decade.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.640]   In fact, every time I check, it blows me away.
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:39.840]   It's more than a petabyte a month of data delivered to our audiences via CashFly.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.520]   We wouldn't be here without it.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.960]   Thank you, CashFly.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.960]   Say goodbye to logging in multiple times a week or even daily trying to track your CDN
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:50.080]   usage because there are no billing spikes.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.200]   There may be data spikes, but there are no billing spikes.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:57.800]   On average, in fact, customers who switch to CashFly save more than 20%.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.200]   You think you could save 20%?
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.120]   Here's what we're going to do.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:05.680]   No high pressure sales, but we will arrange a detailed analysis of your current CDN bill
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.560]   and usage trends.
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.360]   No pressure, no salesmen will call, but it's free.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.520]   But you can at least find out what CashFly can do for you and if you could save up to
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.960]   20% on your CDN bill.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   So here's what you do.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.320]   Go to twit.cashfly.com.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.760]   Do we have a promo for this week?
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:40.480]   You know, many people enjoy the fabulous shows on the podcast network, but miss a few here
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:41.480]   and there.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.440]   So each week we like to prepare a synopsis of some of the fun things you might have missed
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.160]   this week on Twit.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:51.920]   We talk about all the things that we want our smartphones to do.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.840]   This is a awesome smartphone.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.720]   I could run a smartphone company.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:59.000]   Well, now you can with a game called Smartphone Tycoon.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.680]   So my first phone is the Twit Song Plus com Xenophone XS Plus Plus.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.120]   This is incredibly endearing.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.320]   It's a beautiful phone.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.680]   Twit Live specials.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.120]   The Galaxy Fold let off.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.400]   They got a lot of attention right up front when most people are watching for the Galaxy
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:15.400]   Fold.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.120]   That won't be available till April.
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.760]   And of course the headline is it's almost $2,000.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.760]   And Samsung called it a luxury device.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.760]   Hands on tech.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:29.880]   I got to go hands on with the new Samsung Galaxy S10, S10 Plus and S10e at the big launch
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:32.040]   event in Save From Sysdout.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040]   iOS today.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:39.080]   Today we're going to talk about how to control your computers with your iPads and your iPhones
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.240]   and vice versa.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.440]   This is actually a show about magic.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.200]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:47.320]   It's a company who's a producer of our new show.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.320]   When I said we were remoting and his first thought was to tell us how he actually plays
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:55.760]   video games at his desk all day on his iPhone instead of working.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:56.760]   What?
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.760]   Twit.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.760]   It's free when you watch from work.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:03.320]   Wow, I just checked the Oscar feed.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.680]   You should see the dress Kevin Hart is wearing.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:06.680]   No, just kidding.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:12.920]   I'm going to say he still has an invite after that whole thing because just kidding.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.920]   He's Ellen DeGeneres' date.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:18.520]   Yeah, that would be appropriate.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.520]   That'd be good.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.680]   YouTube's had a little trouble of late.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.680]   A little.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680]   A little.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680]   A little.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:29.120]   A little bit Disney's pulling their ads from YouTube.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.120]   Quite a few companies.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.520]   Yeah, it's not just Disney.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   It's not just Disney.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.080]   It all started with a wired UK report.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:40.160]   It was kind of creepy about now.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:46.160]   So the headline was on YouTube, a network of pedophiles is hiding in plain sight.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.360]   The issue is though, there are a lot of videos on YouTube of young children.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.040]   Young children swimming, dancing, doing yoga.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.040]   Sometimes.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.560]   Opening gifts, opening their toys, showing what they bought.
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:05.200]   Sometimes there might be some exposed body parts, underwear.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:09.880]   I think my sense is that these are uploaded by the kids themselves or by family members,
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.480]   completely innocently, right?
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:12.480]   Right.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   But what happens, I guess, and the internet, I'll tell you, humans messed up, is pedophiles
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.440]   find them and then they share them.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:27.200]   And in fact, in the comments, they'll put timestamps for the best juicy parts of the
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.200]   video.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:38.880]   Plus, you're seeing people, kids creating new videos, responding to comments from the
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.360]   pedophiles.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:42.880]   So there's this whole vicious cycle.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:48.120]   And what's worse is their recommendation engine then recommends more of this.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:56.680]   And it was quite a shock to Alfred Romeo, Fiat, Fortnite, Grammarly, L'Oreal, Maybelline,
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:05.120]   Peloton, singlemuslims.com and other major band or major advertisers, including Disney,
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:11.720]   that their ads were appearing on these videos in this environment.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:16.520]   The response to this Wired article, which was earlier this week, is a lot of these
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.560]   companies, a couple of companies said, like Grammarly said, "We need to know more."
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:24.880]   And a few, not a few companies said, "We're not advertising on YouTube.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:25.880]   We're pulling out."
[01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:29.560]   Now, I'm sure YouTube will fix it.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.560]   Sure.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.560]   And...
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   I mean, how can they fix it?
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.560]   It could question.
[01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.760]   In fact, this has been going on for some time.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:41.400]   YouTube apparently said, promised they would fix similar problems two years ago.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:45.480]   It's been YouTube's policy since 2017 to disable comments on videos where users are
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.880]   saying inappropriate things.
[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:48.880]   After it's done.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:51.280]   Well, but if they're disabled, then they're going away.
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:53.520]   But apparently it's hard to find these videos.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.480]   I mean, you've got so much content.
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:02.480]   People using the comments to exchange phone numbers saying, "I got more like this.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.640]   Tell me what's at me."
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.840]   This is the equivalent of the chat room back in my day when my generation was just getting
[01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:11.920]   on the internet and the things that we were told to be afraid of.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.880]   But we didn't have a video element to it because that wasn't available to us.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.080]   But it is...
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.480]   I find it to be on par because it's...
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:25.080]   Yeah, it's like going into a chat room and engaging with someone who you have no idea
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.160]   who they are.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:31.160]   Here's a from the Wired article, "An advert for Grammarly runs before a YouTube video of
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:36.360]   a young girl in a paddling pool with comments like, "Wish she'd show something."
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.800]   Oh my gosh.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.640]   It's gross.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.440]   But get this video.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.800]   I mean, it was probably a family video uploaded for other members of the family.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.840]   It has 2.2 million views.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:49.840]   There's like...
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:54.880]   I think there's three really interesting things about this piece to me.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.840]   One is that a lot of this stuff is programmatic advertising, right?
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.640]   Oh yeah, you know these guys aren't buying those.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:02.640]   No, no, no, no.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.640]   I don't blame the companies at all.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.760]   But you would think that YouTube...
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:10.520]   So there has to be a technology solution there, right?
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:16.720]   There has to be some way for YouTube to think about the way that it sells programmatic
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.520]   advertising, I guess, or maybe these companies to think about where they are buying programmatic
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.160]   advertising.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.240]   But also, I think there's this huge problem where...
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:29.960]   And this is a problem on Facebook too.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:38.360]   Like this problem of too much content for these tech platforms to accurately police
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:44.080]   or effectively police is a problem across platforms, right?
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.200]   And I think that these companies actually, they need to do way more than they're doing
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:49.200]   already.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:50.200]   They need to take a stance.
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:51.200]   None of them are taking a stance.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:54.120]   They're just like, "Oh, well, well, well, well, just do this for these people."
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.520]   "Well, we'll do this for these people."
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:59.600]   And it's frustrating as a consumer because it's like you're letting all of this bad stuff
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.600]   in.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.320]   This is why Twitter is suffering.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.240]   This is why Facebook is suffering.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.160]   Our social networks are suffering because of this because the tech companies are not
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.160]   taking a stance.
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.160]   How important are comments?
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.960]   The answer is, we'll tweak the algorithm.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.960]   That's like...
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:13.960]   Sure, because the algorithm...
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:14.960]   I'm sorry, guys.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.960]   We need to do better.
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:16.960]   Right.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:17.960]   But this is what Google and Facebook and others do.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.960]   They blame the algorithm.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.760]   But the algorithm is programmed by people.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.760]   It is fed in by people.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.480]   If you have people who are not thinking about these things in the giant scope, why are we
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:38.400]   not having sociologists work on these tech things to talk about what might become of
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   these technologies?
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.440]   We're not looking at these from a societal scope.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:46.040]   We're doing the Facebook move fast and break things thing, which...
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.040]   And things are breaking.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.560]   And when I was overseas over the holiday visiting my family in Romania, I had to keep
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:59.800]   reminding them like they haven't gotten the full news of how bad YouTube is just yet.
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:03.080]   The way that I have being in Silicon Valley, like knowing what's going on here.
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:09.480]   And so I had to say, don't leave the kid with YouTube all day on the phone because the
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.280]   algorithm is going to let you down.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:16.320]   And your kid is going to see something that is bad, whether it is commentary from other
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.880]   people, whether they are videos that...
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:24.520]   I mean, surely you've all heard of the weird videos that are being sliced together.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.520]   There's a lot of...
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.760]   It's just like it's some really creepy, dangerous stuff.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.960]   I can't blame YouTube that much though.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:36.720]   I mean, how many hours of video are uploaded every second?
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.960]   I don't know if there's any cool...
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.520]   We can't blame them, but they have to...
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.240]   I mean, you have to think about this when you're creating.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.240]   I mean, if it's an issue, you need to fix it.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:50.480]   Certainly, at this point, they have YouTube's attention.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.760]   Disney has also reportedly pulled out according to the version.
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.360]   That's a lot of money.
[01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.640]   Money talks in this society.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.960]   Do these brands come back?
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.080]   I mean, YouTube deleted 400 accounts.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.840]   They've deleted millions of comments.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:08.560]   Do these brands come back?
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.800]   I'm sure they come back.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.960]   You can't not be on YouTube.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:19.080]   But YouTube's got a fundamental problem where they have an algorithm and it's not catching
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.080]   this stuff.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.720]   So they make the algorithm smarter or they make it tighter and maybe they get more false.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.640]   They pull some normal stuff out of the comments accidentally.
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:34.160]   But the bad folks are going to figure it out and they're going to get worse and it's
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   going to be cat and mouse.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:38.880]   I think YouTube has to kind of change their policy.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:43.400]   And I think, and this kind of goes for Facebook and Twitter as well, that they have to kind
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.520]   of tie the identity of the commenter to a real person.
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:53.400]   If this is ever going to go away and have some sort of responsibility.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:59.160]   Like if this person is posting pedophilia stuff, you can go to his, you know, phone
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   and address.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.320]   You know, he is publicly shamed and all the stuff.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.400]   So I don't think it's going to change until that happens.
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:13.600]   You know, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube all know that they would lose a lot of engagement
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:14.600]   if they did that.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:20.720]   Which means anonymous commenters are a large part of these platforms, unfortunately.
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.280]   But I think this doesn't end until that happens.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:28.240]   But what that does is it emphasizes that engagement is phony.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.240]   Right?
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:34.480]   Because if you're going to lose engagement, if you require real names, then this isn't
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.480]   real engagement.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.480]   I understand.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:41.080]   I mean, there are people behind a lot of this.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:46.160]   Obviously, some of it's bots, but there are sick, demented people, but they still buy
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:50.600]   like yogurt and they still buy, you know, shaping cream or whatever.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:53.880]   So like, they're still there.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.080]   It's real engagement.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.120]   It's just you don't know who the person is.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:03.520]   And you would think like Google like, hey, we're building this huge dossier on this person.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:08.160]   You can sell them much better ads if they sign in to their YouTube account and comment
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.160]   that way.
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.320]   You would think that would be a motivation for them.
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:16.800]   But I think for them, it's just raw numbers and raw people.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.040]   Comments have always been bad on YouTube.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.040]   Why don't you just end commenting?
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.440]   Is commenting important to YouTube's revenue?
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440]   No.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:31.360]   I would imagine if they could and not see it, a revenue hit, they probably would have by
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360]   now.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.360]   Yeah, that's fair.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.240]   Yeah, engagement is and the commenting is engagement.
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:38.240]   Exactly.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.920]   It lowers that bounce rate.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920]   But what?
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.200]   I think YouTube should think about it because honestly, I think people who watch videos on
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:51.400]   YouTube, I watch my 22 year old son, he that's commenting is not important to him.
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.120]   He never reads the comments, doesn't leave comments.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:54.840]   He watches the videos.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.960]   The recommendation system is important.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:57.960]   That's another problem.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:00.200]   YouTube's got to solve.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.600]   You raised him right, Leo.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:02.600]   I raised him right.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.240]   Not a comment, gosh.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.240]   Done it.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.240]   I don't even think--
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.000]   No, I don't think Gen Z is very much the commenting.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.200]   Yeah, it's us millennials, we're still keeping that on.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.560]   But as soon as we're done, Gen Z is done with our stuff.
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   Thank God.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.920]   I have a lot of faith in Gen Z.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:17.920]   I blame you.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:21.360]   Actually, I blame the baby boomers of which I am one.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:23.040]   Then Gen X didn't care at all.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.680]   Gen X was just a nullity.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:26.480]   None of you guys screwed it all up.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:27.720]   We did.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.240]   Well, to be fair, we inherited a lot of-- you know.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.800]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.640]   We built a beautiful internet for you, and look what you did.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.840]   But Gen Z is fixing it with apps like TikTok.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.840]   They're fixing it with indifference
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.520]   is how they're fixing it.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.320]   All right.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:49.680]   I also like-- I thought the anti-vaxxer story
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:51.000]   that was kind of-- Same issue, right?
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.480]   Yes, same issue, but interesting to see how YouTube responded
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.080]   there.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.720]   They didn't monetize the anti-vax channels.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.160]   They said, well, we're not going to kick you off,
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.040]   but we won't let you make money.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:05.920]   But they also did that weird thing
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:12.840]   where they linked Wikipedia talking points from--
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.080]   essentially, I guess you would call it pro-vax or normal
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.760]   talking points below the--
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.680]   no offense to any anti-vaxxers--
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:21.640]   No, no, no, offend them.
[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.320]   Because what they're doing is hurting communities of people
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.840]   because people are traveling without being vaccinated.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.040]   And introducing it.
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.760]   What's the problem with measles?
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.720]   I had measles as a kid.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.080]   Measles before-- they didn't even have a vaccine
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.000]   when I was a kid.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000]   Everybody got--
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.320]   I think it's all the kids that die.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.600]   Oh, the kids that--
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.640]   What was that happening before?
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.440]   Were kids dying from measles?
[01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:46.640]   In my generation, I guess they were.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:47.480]   I didn't enjoy the measles.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:50.360]   They're still dying in low-income areas
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.240]   that don't have money from them.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:54.040]   But what's crazy, though, is YouTube is like, instead of--
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.880]   to me, it's still a little bit weird, right?
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:58.480]   That their response is, OK, demonetize the channel.
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.640]   OK, fine.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.280]   But also just link to a talking--
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:03.400]   like link to a wick if you are--
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.640]   That's kind of a face book, does too, right?
[01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:06.120]   --in the article below the video.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.280]   It's kind of like, can you do something--
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.080]   you could do something a little better than that, right?
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:11.600]   I mean--
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.280]   Do they not want to boot them off?
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.640]   Is that too really political?
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.160]   Yeah, revenue.
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.280]   Because you still get revenue from all those views
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.720]   and all those engagements.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.920]   But as long as we tell you how to engage--
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.840]   Kevin Ruse actually wrote a great piece in the "New York Times."
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.480]   Exactly along this.
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:31.400]   YouTube unleashed a conspiracy theory boom.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:32.280]   Yep.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.240]   Great headline.
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.120]   In fact, I saw a stat that said, almost all the current flat
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.280]   earthers-- believe it or not, there still are flat earthers.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.600]   People believe the earth is flat.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:43.120]   Almost all of them got it from YouTube.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.560]   Like, they watched videos on YouTube,
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:45.840]   and then I guess that was it.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.400]   They convinced them.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.120]   He says the problem with YouTube--
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.040]   it's revenue.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.840]   They are not incented.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.120]   He talks about a wild video from a YouTube star
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:00.200]   called Shane Dawson.
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.880]   He did a 104-minute documentary called "Conspiracy Theories"
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:05.120]   with Shane Dawson.
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.080]   Shane Dawson sounds familiar.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.840]   He talks among the conspiracy theories,
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.200]   iPhones secretly record everything you say.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.520]   Popular children's TV shows contain
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:21.040]   subliminal meshes that are urging children to commit suicide.
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.320]   That the deadly wire fires in California
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:27.120]   were set by the military using a high-powered laser
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.680]   calling to direct energy weapon.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.640]   Of course, these are all made up.
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.240]   I don't know if Dawson was joking around,
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.840]   but the video's drawn more than 30 million views.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.080]   Yeah, that's real.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:40.560]   That's real.
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.760]   Among other things, he created a meme that Chuck E. Cheese recycles
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:48.120]   uneaten pizza slices into new pizzas.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:51.480]   And Chuck E. Cheese was compelled to actually deny it.
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:54.120]   I mean, it's bad, but it's not that bad.
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:57.920]   I was going to say, in fairness, that sounds like a good idea.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.880]   I mean--
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:43:59.880]   Waste not water.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:00.520]   Exactly.
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.280]   Don't waste food.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.480]   He has 20 million subscribers.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.760]   Also keeps the benefits there is better.
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.320]   I agree.
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:08.680]   And by the way, in contrast to what you said,
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.080]   most of his subscribers are teenagers, are millennials.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.920]   No, that's Gen Z.
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:15.320]   Oh.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:16.600]   Gen Z, yeah.
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:19.320]   Gen Z is anybody born in 2000 on?
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.280]   Oh, it's the millennials that are OK.
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.120]   Not OK.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:22.520]   Anyway.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:24.160]   No, we're the ones who--
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.160]   I don't understand.
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.640]   Nobody's in good shape.
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:27.240]   I mean, yeah.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.000]   We're all--
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   I mean, the Earth has gone in 12 years.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.080]   So I guess he--
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:35.760]   I don't know if he's serious or not.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.880]   I guess it doesn't really matter.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.520]   People believe him.
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:39.920]   Well, it's all about the page views, really.
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.200]   That's all you need in this world to be validated
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.320]   is page views.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.880]   So I think I need more page views.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.920]   Roost writes, "Innocent or not, Mr. Dawson's videos
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.280]   contain precisely the type of viral misinformation
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.080]   that YouTube now says it wants to limit.
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.880]   And its effort raises an uncomfortable question.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:01.960]   What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.160]   means punishing some of the platform's biggest stars?"
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:10.760]   Then it becomes a big--
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:15.400]   The problem is it's ideologies and ideologies
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:19.880]   when you start going after that, it gets really dicey there.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.480]   That's where the big--
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.080]   But there's a big difference between--
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.320]   Pizza gate and Chuck E. Cheese assembling pieces from--
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:27.920]   True.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:30.720]   There's a big difference between Info Wars saying Sandy
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.320]   Dook didn't happen.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:36.040]   And she and Dawson saying the moon landing didn't happen.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:39.720]   But there's a continuum.
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:43.040]   And they're both on that continuum somewhere.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:43.800]   But it is dicey.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.720]   I think flow is right.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:50.400]   It does get really dicey when--
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.720]   And that's why these companies don't want to do it, right?
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:56.480]   Where they're coming from is like,
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.720]   oh, we don't want to make decisions about free speech.
[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:04.120]   We don't want to decide that one thing is dangerous
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:05.320]   and the other thing is not.
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.520]   And it will take sides and the side step in.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.440]   And that's how they sidestep it.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.680]   One of the threats, of course, is regulation, government
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:11.320]   regulation.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.280]   And that's something that nobody wants.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:17.200]   But maybe they want some limited government regulation.
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:18.240]   They don't want all the states.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.360]   But the truth is, I wouldn't worry about government regulation
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.480]   because that's the other semi side of this,
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.840]   is that the government is hand in hand with these companies
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:30.400]   because they provide them with valuable surveillance
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:34.000]   information, which the governments want.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.160]   So it seems to me that they're unlikely
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.600]   to enforce privacy and other restrictions
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:43.200]   on these companies because it's an unholy alliance.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.120]   Yeah.
[01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:48.320]   What happens when like, imagine a scenario where YouTube is
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:51.800]   actually owned by Microsoft, which has the military contract,
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:54.400]   not to make a conspiracy video.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:58.480]   But like, this stuff gets really dicey really fast.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:02.600]   Well, Google did have that thing they were working on.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.760]   Yeah, but Google after the employees revolted said,
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:09.360]   all right, we're not going to do Project Jedi.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.320]   Microsoft snapped it up because it's
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:14.480]   a $10 billion Defense Department contract.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:15.240]   Money talks.
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:19.760]   But as I said, when did it become unpatriotic
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:23.640]   to create products for the Defense Department?
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:26.280]   I mean, the whole internet came from the Defense Department.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:31.000]   Well, it's unpatriotic because what happened is that the--
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.720]   everything you're looking at, the whole internet,
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.840]   the way this comes to you--
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:36.800]   It's unpatriotic--
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.760]   --was funded by the Department of Defense.
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:42.560]   Yes, but it's unpatriotic to go out and ruin a bunch.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:43.760]   We want to kill people with your--
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.560]   Exactly.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:46.040]   That's not patriotic either.
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.600]   That's just--
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.560]   How about this one?
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.160]   Wall Street Journal is on a tear.
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:54.480]   Some people say that the reason the Wall Street Journal is
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:57.800]   so quick to cast a gate Google and Facebook
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:59.560]   is because they're the biddick's threats
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.360]   to the Wall Street Journal's business model.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.160]   On the other hand, I think this is very good reporting.
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:08.280]   This is Sam Schechner.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.960]   You give apps sensitive personal information.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:11.800]   They tell Facebook.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.080]   We all know that the Facebook app on your phone
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.200]   is spying on you.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:18.360]   But did you know that millions of smartphone users
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:23.440]   are confessing intimate secrets to apps, which then turn around
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:25.120]   and send it on to Facebook?
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:28.480]   Here's an app called Flow.
[01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:31.720]   Period and ovulation tracker.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.240]   This is actually a very popular app amongst my friends.
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:34.800]   Right.
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:36.760]   If you're trying to get pregnant, you would use this.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.360]   You would enter the dates of your ovulation.
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.240]   You're actually trying to get pregnant right now using this app.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:44.120]   So they enter in this personal data, which
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.200]   is immediately sent to Facebook.
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.680]   That's awful because that is even--
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.080]   It's just--
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:50.400]   --dreamly personal data.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.720]   Even if you don't have a Facebook account.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:56.120]   That's the data of your ovulation
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:00.360]   that's incredibly personal to your cycle.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:03.480]   That is not something that I want to have be monetized,
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.760]   especially if that person ends up not getting pregnant.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.640]   And they've been trying so hard.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.200]   And then that stuff is used to sell you.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.760]   So it's just such an awful thing.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:14.920]   It's just so--
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.040]   It's pretty bad.
[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:16.480]   It's bad.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.360]   It's pretty bad.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.520]   So here's the steps, according to the Wall Street Journal,
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.480]   a user opens flow logs when she had her last period.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:29.040]   Then Facebook software inside flow--
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:30.840]   I don't know what software they're using,
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.560]   but Facebook software inside flow
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:34.920]   records that action sends a custom app event to Facebook.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.920]   Is flow built on Facebook's React?
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:37.560]   Might be React.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.520]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.560]   My React, I don't know.
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:41.840]   It includes data about the user's device,
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:44.440]   as well as other data flow defined,
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.560]   such as the fact that the user may be ovulating.
[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:50.000]   Then Facebook can often match that data
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.600]   with actual Facebook users.
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:55.080]   Facebook's Let's Developers use their own custom events
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:58.000]   to target ads at their users.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.480]   That's so awful.
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:01.720]   Because if that person can't conceive,
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.600]   they're just being reminded, no, oh my gosh, that's terrible.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.160]   I'm also feeling very--
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:09.320]   because I do have friends who are, again,
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:10.840]   trying and using this app.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:14.400]   Flow has 25 million active users.
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.000]   So you log on to Facebook and it tells you,
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.400]   by diapers for the baby that you've been struggling with the disease.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:20.440]   I see you're ovulating.
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.080]   By these ovulation test kits, maybe.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.440]   That's the thing they would try and sell you.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.440]   It's just--
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.640]   So Facebook--
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:32.680]   Or congratulations, you're pregnant.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.720]   Well, remember that article?
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.760]   This was some years ago.
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:37.160]   And it seemed like science fiction at the time
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:40.200]   that Target knew somebody was pregnant before a family did.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.440]   Because of those shopping patterns.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.360]   Facebook said some of the data sharing uncovered
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.120]   by the journals testing appeared to violate its business
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.480]   terms, which instruct app developers not
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:52.000]   to send in health, financial information,
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.960]   or other categories of sensitive information.
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:00.360]   So this is so playbook, Facebook playbook.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:01.360]   Oh, it's doing that.
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.320]   Oh, that we never-- that's sorry.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:06.120]   We're going to fix that right now.
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.240]   That's how Facebook works.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:10.920]   Facebook says it's telling apps to stop sending information.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.800]   And it may take additional action if the apps--
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.640]   Well, I also want to talk to developers of Flow
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.680]   because I want to know why this is in the back end of the app.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:21.960]   So they can sell ads.
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:23.520]   So that's a monetization strategy.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:23.880]   Yeah.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.480]   It's a more complicated one than just putting ads in Flow.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.480]   Instead, they're going to put ads on your Facebook page
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:29.400]   based on stuff you talk to.
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:31.840]   I would rather have an ad in Flow that is just like, hey,
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.320]   go buy these test strips or something.
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.920]   Have it be localized or something.
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.760]   It probably also violates Apple's privacy policies
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.400]   if it's on an iPhone.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:46.360]   I would rather pay for an app so it doesn't do any of that.
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.640]   In fact, a lot of the apps now that I use on my Android phone
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:53.600]   I would rather pay for the data to just stay local,
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.680]   back up and restore on my Dropbox,
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:57.840]   and I'll give you $3 a month.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.320]   And just don't-- just give it to you.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:02.280]   Just give you the money to use your app.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.120]   Just stop sending my data places.
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:09.440]   Anyway, just to be aware.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:13.200]   I mean, I think if you want privacy, use an iPhone,
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:16.800]   and don't-- whatever you do, install anything on it.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:18.560]   Just don't exist.
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:19.640]   Because that's any--
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:22.160]   You know what privacy-- don't exist.
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:24.280]   Your car is tracking you, your house is tracking you.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.200]   You know what's not tracking you?
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.160]   My Casper mattress has no electronics whatsoever.
[01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.160]   It's a respite.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:30.000]   It's a respite.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.640]   A place to go where you are safe from prying eyes,
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:37.200]   and a great night's sleep is one of life's greatest luxuries,
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.120]   isn't it?
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.960]   I mean, honestly, how much would you pay for a great night's
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:41.840]   sleep?
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.840]   Well, if you go to the mattress store around the corner,
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.760]   you're paying way, way too much.
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.400]   Actually, this is how Casper got started.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:51.520]   Casper's founders, as with any smart startup,
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:55.480]   they were looking for inefficiencies in the marketplace.
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.640]   And the biggest inefficiency of all is the mattress business.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:02.520]   Mattress manufacturers sell their mattresses to mattress stores,
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:06.680]   which then mark them up 100% and more so that you can come in
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:07.480]   and buy it from them.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:11.520]   That's why mattresses are ridiculously expensive.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.000]   Casper said, wait a minute.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.240]   We can make our great mattresses in the United States.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:18.640]   We can engineer them to really be perfect and just sell them
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:19.720]   direct to customers.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:23.000]   And we would be able to cut the price significantly.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.280]   No reseller, no showroom, we'll just pass the savings on to you.
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:29.400]   But then there's a problem because we think--
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:32.200]   and this is the message I want to get out-- we think that you
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:35.680]   should go to a showroom and lie in a mattress before you buy it.
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.440]   But in fact, that is not the way to test a mattress.
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:39.560]   I've done it many times.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:40.960]   And always buy the wrong mattress.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.800]   It feels different in the showroom somehow.
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.760]   You are fully clothed.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:44.560]   It's broad daylight.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.560]   And there's some salesperson looking down her nose at you.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:49.920]   You can't really enjoy it.
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:52.800]   So what Casper does is they give you--
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.280]   I love this-- 100 days.
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.320]   In your house, in a real environment,
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.960]   if any time in the first 100 days you say,
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:01.320]   this isn't the mattress for me, you call them up.
[01:54:01.320 --> 01:54:02.000]   They will come.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:02.520]   They will get it.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.400]   They will find you every penny.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.760]   No trouble.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.360]   I have the original Casper mattress.
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.240]   It combines multiple supportive memory
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:12.240]   foams for sleep surface with just the right sink
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:13.160]   and just the right bounce.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:14.320]   It's kind of magical.
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.880]   It's firm but soft.
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:16.680]   It's hard to describe.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:17.880]   You've got to try it.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:18.600]   And it's breathable.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.400]   This is so important.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:24.680]   Sleeping cool is really important to a good night's sleep.
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:27.240]   The Casper mattress breathes so you can regulate
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:28.960]   your temperature throughout the night.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:32.040]   Long lasting comfort and support with an obsessively
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:35.240]   engineered mattress for an exceptionally comfortable
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.080]   sleep experience.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.760]   I think you'll love Casper.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.720]   They uphold the highest environmental production
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:41.120]   standards.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.040]   They're made in the United States.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.040]   They come in a surprisingly compact box.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:45.800]   You open it up.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:46.480]   There's the mattress.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.200]   It smells great.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:48.480]   You don't have to air it out.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:51.000]   I remember buying a mattress from a big company
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.480]   a few years ago.
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.320]   And you have to air it out for three days
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:55.360]   because it smells so bad.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.720]   Not the Casper.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:58.200]   We slept on it immediately that night.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.120]   In fact, here's the Casper.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:02.800]   This is a queen in a box that you could easily
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.880]   heft up the stairs yourself.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:06.000]   I sent my son in college.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.120]   We first started to sleep in the dorms.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.800]   He said, this is a disgusting mattress.
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:12.400]   We sent him a Casper mattress, a twin.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.520]   And he was able to bring it upstairs.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:15.400]   And it was so affordable that after four years,
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:16.000]   he said, what do I do?
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.440]   The mattress, I had to leave it there.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.760]   The next guy, I'll appreciate a nice mattress.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.240]   You're going to love your Casper.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:24.920]   Free shipping and yes, if you don't like it, free returns.
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.640]   In the US and Canada, you will like it.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.720]   I know.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:28.960]   Get a Casper mattress today.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.960]   You could save $50 towards select mattresses
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:33.720]   by going to Casper.com/twit.
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:37.480]   Use the promo code TWIT at checkout.
[01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:41.280]   That's Casper.com/twit, promo code TWIT.
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:44.840]   Save $50 on select mattresses, terms, and conditions apply.
[01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:48.600]   We thank Casper for their support.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:51.920]   Actually, the UK is looking into Facebook.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:58.560]   They issued a scathing report, a British Parliamentary
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.480]   Committee, which spent months last year investigating
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:05.840]   online political disinformation, singled out
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:09.920]   Facebook for disingenuous and bad faith responses
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.040]   to democratic concerns about the misuse of people's data.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:16.080]   The committee called for Facebook's use of user data
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.640]   to be investigated by the UK data watchdog.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:24.200]   In fact, the Information Commissioners Office
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.000]   suggested Facebook needs to change its business model.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:31.360]   Warning, the company risks burning user trust for good.
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.280]   That is a risk, isn't it?
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:36.800]   The ICO also called for an ethical pause of social media ads
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:39.800]   for election campaigning.
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.560]   So maybe in the UK, Facebook's going to get its come up.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:45.800]   And so remember, Mark Zuckerberg refused to go and testify
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:47.880]   to Parliament, although he is happy, apparently,
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:51.840]   to meet behind the scenes with various government officials.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.200]   It's less stressful for him.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:58.240]   He doesn't sweat as much or have to prepare as much with a press
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.240]   person.
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:04.120]   Facebook has killed the Onava app.
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.440]   So this was the app they got in trouble with Apple.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.280]   Apple banned it.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.760]   Then they took the code from the Onava app,
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:13.480]   put it in a different app, which they continue to use.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:16.520]   Facebook did, until recently, continue
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:18.040]   to make it available on Android because Android
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:20.640]   doesn't have the same controls on the app store.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:25.200]   And confidential emails, according to Computer Weekly,
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.200]   show that Facebook planned to use its Android app
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:29.960]   to track the location of its customers
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:35.480]   and to allow advertisers to send political advertising
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:39.880]   and invites to dating sites to people they thought were single.
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:41.760]   It says, "A confidential documents
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:45.280]   that were seen by Computer Weekly also reveal plans
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:48.800]   by Facebook to pass data on single Facebook users
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.320]   to companies selling data services."
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:55.080]   Oh my god.
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.120]   The documents marked confidential reveal the secret program
[01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:00.200]   by Facebook's growth team.
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.680]   There it is, that growth team again,
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:05.600]   to collect and exploit data from customers with Android mobile
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:06.120]   phones.
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:12.200]   This comes only a week after that UK parliamentary report.
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:15.280]   Love to be exploited.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:17.240]   The kids with my phone.
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:20.600]   Do you all still use Facebook in the light all this?
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:21.280]   No?
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:24.240]   I deactivated mine last year, and it's been great.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:28.280]   I've gotten back to texting my friends one-on-one.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.800]   Throughout the week, I tried to just put it into my schedule
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:33.480]   to say, "Oh, I have taken a five-minute break.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.480]   Let me check in with a friend, and I have to say,
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:37.200]   my relationships have increased."
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:39.800]   Since I've left Facebook, they've actually gotten a lot better
[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:43.400]   and a lot healthier because we are forced to communicate
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:46.200]   with each other to make that connection.
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.720]   And it's great for us.
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:50.240]   It makes me feel more whole as a person, honestly.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:52.400]   In our chatroom, Mandy, the clown says,
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:54.480]   "Why isn't there just a program on Twit called This Week
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:56.600]   and How Facebook Screws You?"
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:57.560]   And then--
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.680]   It's a new show idea, Leo.
[01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:00.400]   I mean, there's plenty of content there.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.800]   Cousin of Joss has now to be too long.
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:05.800]   (laughing)
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.880]   Yeah, you need a marathoner host for that one.
[01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:10.040]   Seth, do you still use Facebook?
[01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:12.880]   Yeah, so I do.
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:15.560]   I've never used it like I think most people use it,
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.240]   or used to use it.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:22.360]   I'd use it to send pictures of my kids privately
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:25.720]   to my parents and other people who think Facebook
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:27.080]   is the internet.
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:32.080]   And then all the sites, obviously, have to use Facebook
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:35.080]   to just kind of like a feed.
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:38.440]   So when 9-5 MacBook versus a new story,
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.040]   it goes to Facebook, I have--
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:42.560]   Does Facebook drive a lot of traffic
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.880]   for your 9-5 publications and electric?
[01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:45.720]   Is that an important--
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:47.320]   Not a ton.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:53.600]   But it's one of the Twitter and the others that it's there.
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.600]   It's always gonna probably be there.
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:56.920]   So we do.
[01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.840]   I mean, we're not sharing any of our user data
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:01.440]   if people choose to look at Facebook
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:02.600]   and they choose to follow us,
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:06.000]   then they get some of our stories in their feed.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.840]   Although Facebook more recently has been,
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:13.000]   this is, of course, Facebook being Facebook,
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000]   they want us to pay them so that people
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.360]   who follow us can see our stories.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:22.160]   So that's one of those things where I'm like, you know--
[02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:23.160]   What?
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.360]   Oh yeah, I get that all the time.
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.400]   You'd get a lot more viewers on this
[02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:28.240]   if you just give us some money.
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:29.720]   Right.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:33.320]   So your viewers would actually view this
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.640]   if you just give us some money?
[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:36.640]   Well, yes, isn't this is out more like that?
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.080]   No, yes.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:40.720]   It would be nice if somebody saw this post.
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:42.360]   It's like paying to get to the playlist.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:43.360]   Right, you go to the pay list.
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.000]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.920]   'Cause the algorithm deprecates publications, right?
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.280]   This is the new thing that Facebook's doing.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:52.480]   It's prioritizing local and personal
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:54.240]   over national publications.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.640]   Yeah, which hurt a lot of less.
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.520]   They come into your grocery store
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.680]   and they like break some milk bottles.
[02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:00.680]   Be a shame.
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:02.520]   You're like, I'm gonna do what I call your milk
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.760]   if your milk was all broken, wouldn't it?
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:05.600]   Do you?
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:06.440]   Then they walk out.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:09.720]   I mean, honestly, when is it flip on Facebook
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:13.200]   where everybody just goes, wow, these guys are horrible?
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.320]   I think it is happening right now.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:17.960]   I mean, you guys don't use Facebook anymore.
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:21.760]   You know, I feel kind of, I wanna say guilty
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:23.160]   putting stuff on Facebook.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.120]   Well, that's different.
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.360]   I mean, you know what, Twitch has a Facebook page
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:29.000]   and we put stuff there.
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.960]   As a publication, you gotta be where your viewers
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.920]   or listeners or readers are.
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:34.840]   Right.
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:38.680]   I'm not on Twitter either, but we have a Twitter feed
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:39.520]   on Twitter. Right.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.320]   You're not on Twitter?
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.960]   No, I gave up on Twitter as a dumpster fire.
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:46.520]   It is, it is.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:48.120]   And everybody, when I say that, everybody says,
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:48.960]   oh no.
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.640]   Oh no, Leo, you can, you can,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:54.080]   just, you're not following the right people.
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:57.200]   Just follow nice people and you'll get a nice feed.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:59.520]   But what they don't think about is
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:03.280]   when you're a public figure, your @ replies are full of crap.
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:05.280]   And so, I mean, I don't look at @ replies,
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:06.760]   but still I don't wanna be there.
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:09.000]   Twitter has done, as far as I could tell,
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.840]   zero to try to improve this environment.
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.120]   Jack, don't care.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.080]   Jack, Jack, Jack, by the way, have, have done gone.
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:16.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:17.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:19.320]   I've left this week, he's off the board.
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:21.520]   That was interesting. Yeah.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:22.880]   You should put me on the board.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.360]   Founder of Twitter, I have Williams,
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.240]   is now not, nothing he sold as much of his steak.
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:28.600]   And Ben, are you--
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.680]   You're gonna work on that, that medium.
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:33.080]   My medium's his thing now, right?
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:35.680]   Ben, do you use Twitter or Facebook?
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:37.800]   Are you a social media hound?
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:41.880]   I, well, you know, I make a podcast about Reddit, so.
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:42.960]   Oh, I love Reddit.
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:43.800]   That's different.
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:44.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:45.880]   Yeah, Reddit.
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:48.720]   But I do, I use Twitter, I don't use Facebook really.
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:50.000]   Is that funny? I'm still on Facebook,
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.320]   but it's like one of those things
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.480]   where I log in and I see a billion notifications
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.480]   and I'm like, ah.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:56.480]   Ah, more people.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.840]   It's a great, it's a great white pages.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:00.400]   I'm just saying. Yeah, it is.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.400]   It's a great white pages. That's true.
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:03.200]   I do miss the ability to stalk people
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.720]   and find out more about them and see family pictures of them.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:07.080]   It's true.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.040]   'Cause I meet somebody, I used to,
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:10.120]   I'd go to their Facebook page
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:11.920]   and I'd know more about them than their answers.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:14.360]   I'm gonna say now, Instagram, the new thing is--
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:16.240]   I also left Instagram, I don't trust them.
[02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:18.680]   I know, well, at Instagram now,
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:21.120]   because I'm trying to fall along with folks and their kids,
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:22.720]   you know, you don't see those folks as often,
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.400]   so they have private accounts now.
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:25.320]   That's a good way to do it.
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:26.160]   That's what it does, yeah.
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:29.840]   And I think that that is a good middle ground.
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:33.320]   And also WhatsApp, which is another Facebook property,
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.960]   but that is where I put my family network
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.560]   so that my family and I have a thread
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:38.640]   with each other constantly.
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:39.880]   Now in light of all these things,
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:41.360]   you know that Facebook's doing with apps,
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.880]   you know, but any Facebook app,
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.800]   including Instagram, WhatsApp that's on your phone,
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:45.680]   is spying on you.
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.360]   But the problem is that it's hard to get people
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:48.560]   to move away from it.
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:51.560]   Like that's the problem is--
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:54.840]   People don't know that Instagram is owned by Facebook.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:55.680]   Yeah, they don't.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:56.520]   My mom does.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:59.680]   Oh, my mom is very well informed about this stuff,
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.800]   and she's still--
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.640]   There's a certain irony in me saying I love Reddit.
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:06.560]   When Reddit is absolutely a cesspool too,
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:09.240]   it's just that I don't go anywhere that I see that.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:11.080]   Yeah, I have a nice little community on Reddit.
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:11.920]   I follow the stuff.
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.160]   They're animal crossing people.
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:15.720]   Yeah, I follow the fountain pen subreddit, you know?
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:16.720]   I mean--
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:17.720]   Yeah, when you go to those small communities--
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.440]   All the communities from the bad stuff.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:21.120]   Yeah, I just don't go near it.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.200]   I don't know how that's different from Twitter,
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:25.200]   except that I just--
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:28.560]   I can't escape stuff aimed at me on Twitter.
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:30.560]   Nobody aims anything at me on Reddit,
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:31.400]   'cause I lurk out.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:32.240]   It's hard for--
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:34.640]   A lot of my gal pals are leaving Twitter
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.640]   because it's just like--
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.160]   It's unsafe to be a woman journalist on Twitter.
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.360]   That's actually a lot of the reason.
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.800]   It's not for me, it's because all the women I know
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.960]   are absolutely, horrifically abused on Twitter,
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:46.280]   and Twitter is nothing about it.
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.160]   Yeah, it just-- It infuriates me.
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:49.600]   So it's really more of a--
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:52.280]   I'm taking a stand that I really can't use Twitter.
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:53.360]   Matt, people master it on.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:54.640]   Master on this.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.480]   I tried it.
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:56.640]   There's nothing going on.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:57.640]   I know.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:58.640]   I know.
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:01.360]   I feel like social media, because of all this stuff
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:02.760]   that we've talked about on this show,
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:05.520]   about advertising and the way things are being monetized,
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.440]   I feel like the new way to kind of think about social media
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:12.720]   is how can I curate it to keep it more personal
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.120]   and to keep it more in my network?
[02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:15.200]   There's more value in it.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:16.040]   Absolutely.
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:18.240]   And I feel like I'm still trying to do it as a journalist.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:20.640]   There's also a somewhat public-facing figure.
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:23.160]   I am still trying to interact with the public on some way,
[02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:25.560]   but I want to be in control of all that.
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:27.320]   I want to be able to say--
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.760]   When I say stop, I want to stop.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:30.960]   You know?
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.400]   The nerdiest post I've ever read, Stephen Wolfram,
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:42.600]   the brilliant mathematician, programmer in his blog,
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:46.520]   "The Productive Life, Some Details on My Personal Infrastructure."
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:47.120]   Nice.
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.000]   If you have not read this yet--
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:49.960]   And I had line though.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:51.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:53.320]   Apparently, he never leaves the house.
[02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:57.960]   Well, he does, because he does a lot of metrics,
[02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:00.720]   that his mood was better when he walked around.
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.320]   So he's created a special tray for him
[02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:08.120]   to use when he's walking outside, because apparently, the guy
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:11.000]   cannot not be on a screen.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.600]   So this is the funniest.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:14.920]   I love this blog post.
[02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.040]   And of course, this guy is an absolute genius.
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:19.920]   So I don't want to knock him.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:26.040]   But if you want to read something, just insane.
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:31.440]   For 28 years, he's run the Wolfram company from this room.
[02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.360]   He never leaves.
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.080]   This man is my hero.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:38.640]   No, this is what I aspire to be in all actuality,
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:40.040]   because he's a productive.
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:43.080]   And he is keeping his social relationships that
[02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:45.360]   are important to him to continue to be creative.
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.120]   Here's an example.
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:48.720]   He's had the same big wooden desk for 25 years.
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:50.520]   And one of the things he realized
[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:53.160]   was a bad problem in his life was flat surfaces.
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.800]   He put stuff on there, piles up.
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:58.080]   So but on the other hand, he needs flat surfaces to eat lunch.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:01.680]   So he has a pull out lunch tray that he eats,
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.840]   and then he puts it back.
[02:07:02.840 --> 02:07:03.960]   Oh, I love this.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.520]   I want to desk with this, because I eat at my desk.
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.760]   And I never have anywhere to eat my food.
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:10.280]   He says, I don't deal with paper much,
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:12.440]   but when something comes across my desk, I like to file it.
[02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:14.480]   So I have a slot.
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:16.960]   And there's a banker box underneath that.
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.320]   And he loads it up when the box gets full.
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.760]   He fills it up every couple of months.
[02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:22.920]   He's in the basement where it's going to stay.
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:25.160]   This man is a genie.
[02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:27.360]   This is how I have structured-- Leo, this guy
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.800]   and I live very similar lives, by the way.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:31.560]   You got to read this.
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:32.560]   I just mentioned this.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.560]   All these photos were taken with the Nokia Spider-eye
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:35.280]   iPhone, too.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:39.160]   Hi, I bet they were-- here's his dongles.
[02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:41.320]   What the hell is that phone?
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.600]   If Stephen Wolfram is using that phone,
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:45.440]   then I am seriously doing something wrong.
[02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.400]   Is that a sat phone?
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.440]   Oh, maybe it's a sat phone.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:49.800]   It works everywhere.
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:51.640]   It works anywhere in any bar phone.
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:52.880]   But you're right, it works everywhere.
[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:53.680]   That's the point.
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:55.600]   He has an iPhone and there is something.
[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:57.280]   You got to have it in the stage.
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:01.000]   Apparently, it puts everything in these plastic inflows.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.040]   I don't know.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.320]   I love it.
[02:08:03.320 --> 02:08:03.800]   I love it.
[02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:06.480]   He conned, married his work life, really,
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:07.520]   when you think about it.
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:09.760]   This is the weirdest thing.
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:10.880]   Apparently, he gets a car sick.
[02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.200]   So he really likes-- he doesn't like to be off his laptop.
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.600]   But he gets a car sick.
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:17.080]   When he's being driven, he wants to use his computer.
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:20.920]   So he found these weird looking glasses,
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:24.000]   which despite being a bit odd, he says-- and believe me,
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.880]   they are-- do seem to prevent car sickness, at least much
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:27.880]   of the time.
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:31.640]   So it's going to be so weird when this guy pulls off the mask
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:32.720]   and it's Marie Conda.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:36.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:38.280]   Blog.sealmedease.com.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.240]   It's just a great read.
[02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:44.360]   And he says, I felt I should finally document my personal--
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.400]   I love this.
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:48.480]   But this is how I think about-- I mean, our whole work life
[02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:49.720]   is moving to be at home.
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:51.760]   We want to be more comfortable when we're working.
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:54.560]   It really helps us become-- look, productivity
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:57.400]   is the whole reason this world is going right.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:59.960]   So we want to be more productive, how to be more productive,
[02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:02.600]   while also being happy, taking our lives into our own hands.
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:03.920]   I love this.
[02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:05.880]   This man has lived my dream.
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:07.880]   This is what I try to do to my office.
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:10.400]   Every week I try to improve it in these kind of ways.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:11.200]   You're going to love this.
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:13.120]   He talks about how a file system should be created.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.800]   I have a file system at home.
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:16.320]   This is huge.
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:17.440]   It's much more brightly colored.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.120]   But I have a file system.
[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:20.880]   All right.
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:24.960]   I am going to wrap things up with a wonderful Twitter post.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:26.680]   And I want you to see the whole animation.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:28.840]   If you're not watching, I'm sorry you'll have to visit it.
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.120]   It's in the slash r slash Europe blog.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:35.840]   The top 15 best global brands ranking.
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:36.840]   It's a video.
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:38.520]   Now, let me start it from the beginning,
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:41.880]   because I think you really want to see this from the beginning.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:45.600]   It starts in the year 2000.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.800]   Coca-Cola is, of course, the best known brand
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:49.440]   followed by Microsoft and IBM, GE.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:50.400]   Interesting.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:51.600]   Nokia.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.960]   But watch over time.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.920]   I found this fascinating.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:58.880]   As here we are in 2003, new brands-- so a couple of new brands
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.800]   are going to appear and suddenly rise to the top.
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:03.960]   All right.
[02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:05.600]   And I think you could probably guess what they are.
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:07.280]   Disney, McDonald, Toyota, is there.
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:09.480]   Mercedes Benz, American Express.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:10.440]   2000 seconds.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:12.200]   It's going to be the crash.
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:13.200]   The crash.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.200]   It's a crash.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.200]   Wait, wait, wait.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:15.960]   Google just-- oh, wow.
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:16.440]   Look at that.
[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:17.520]   Google just entered the fray.
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:19.000]   And it's going to-- whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.880]   Number four, number four, position number three position.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.440]   And then all of a sudden, here comes Apple.
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.560]   Apple's coming on strong.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:26.480]   It looks like it's Google.
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:27.120]   It's Microsoft.
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:27.800]   It's IBM.
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:28.520]   It's Apple.
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.600]   It's Apple in the lead.
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:30.440]   Apple number one.
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:31.640]   Wow.
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.240]   Isn't that a hysterical horse race?
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.080]   That's amazing.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:36.400]   And then all the other brands shrink.
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:37.640]   This is the world.
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:38.880]   This is the world now.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:44.520]   It's longer and longer and longer and longer.
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:46.680]   Isn't that a fantastic graph?
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:47.520]   I just love that.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.200]   This is how we have to start thinking about the world,
[02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:52.720]   the come-up just changed in just those 10 years.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:55.360]   The crash, I feel like the crash kind of helped
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:57.600]   make that happen.
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:59.520]   Because it slowed down the rest of the world
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.840]   so that tech and tech--
[02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:01.840]   So I had money at that point.
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:03.280]   But the crash hit tech harder than anything else, right?
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:04.640]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:05.120]   I don't know.
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:06.920]   I just got out of college at that time, so I was kind of--
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:07.480]   You remember it.
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:10.800]   I was busy looking for a job.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:12.160]   Not a good time to look for a job.
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.200]   I was very lucky.
[02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:15.600]   You went to work at pets.com?
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:16.880]   No, I went to work for Future.
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:17.800]   Oh, Future?
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.160]   Yeah.
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:19.000]   What happened to Future?
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.280]   Magazine, well, they're now uni-nice.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:22.200]   They're the past.
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:23.840]   The writers have now uni-nized, actually.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.400]   Oh, really?
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:24.760]   Yeah.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:25.440]   This is past week?
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:27.000]   Is it online?
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.320]   Like, not Bloomberg.
[02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:30.400]   Who just uni--
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:31.200]   Buzzfeed.
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:31.400]   Yeah.
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:32.480]   Just uni-nized.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:33.000]   Yeah.
[02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:33.520]   Right on.
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:34.000]   Yeah.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.280]   Like I said, I'm sag-after.
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:35.800]   Proud of it.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:36.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:37.080]   I wish I could be.
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:40.280]   Because then I would have Andrea Zuckerman as my president.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.120]   Gabrielle Cartieras.
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:43.440]   I don't know who you're talking about.
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:44.320]   Andrea Zuckerman--
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.680]   Andrea Zuckerman, a nun or two and no.
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:46.560]   I don't even know my own president.
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:49.040]   She was the smart one on the show.
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.400]   She was also pro-union on the show, by the way.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:53.000]   Oh, that's good.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.800]   Florence I on your catcher, Oh, that flow on the Twitter.
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:58.880]   And she's, of course, on all about Android.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.840]   And I'm sure there'll be a lot of Android talks.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.000]   By Tuesday, we should know all.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.200]   I did an episode of Hands on Tech this week
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:05.680]   with the Galaxy S10.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:06.320]   Nice.
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:07.840]   So go check that out.
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:10.440]   The first review, we got the first review on the air.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:10.800]   Nice.
[02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:11.600]   Hands on.
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.600]   Hands on with it.
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:13.520]   I touched it.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:15.400]   I ordered--
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.720]   I am a nut because you could pre-order it.
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:18.800]   I pre-ordered it.
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:19.920]   And you know, they're talking about,
[02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.200]   well, there's the S10E.
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:22.200]   That's the value one.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:22.880]   There's the S10.
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:23.240]   That's--
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:24.760]   Value is still $100.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:25.280]   But yes.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:26.280]   Yeah.
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:28.840]   $7.99 and $8.99.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.040]   You get a 10E.
[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:33.560]   And if you really want, you get a bigger screen, the 10 Plus.
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:34.920]   Or--
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:36.240]   that's $1,000.
[02:12:36.240 --> 02:12:37.480]   But you could start to add things.
[02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:39.800]   For instance, they have two models with ceramic backs.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:41.280]   I always wanted a ceramic phone.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:43.280]   I always thought that'll be the material.
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.160]   So I had to order that.
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:46.760]   And then it turns out you can't get the ceramic back
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:49.800]   in anything less than 512 gigs of storage.
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:54.880]   For a phone, then I thought, well, as long as I'm spending $1,250,
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.720]   I might as well spend $1,500 and get a terabyte of storage.
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:00.480]   Why not?
[02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:01.160]   And 12,000.
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:02.680]   And now you're at the fold.
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:05.600]   And I'm practically fold priced at this point.
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:06.760]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:09.600]   I thought, well, I'll get the top of the line.
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:11.440]   And then we can review the other ones.
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:13.760]   You guys can get the cheap phones.
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:15.960]   It's nice to be the boss, isn't it, Seth?
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:16.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:18.400]   Yeah.
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:19.800]   Hey, it's great to have you, Seth.
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:22.640]   "WineTrob Electric" is the electric car magazine,
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:25.040]   9 to 5 Mac, 9 to 5 Google.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:30.920]   He's a legend in the publishing business, L.L. Seth J.
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.920]   On the Twitter, I get it.
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:35.920]   L.L. Seth J. Thank you, Seth.
[02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:36.560]   Always a pleasure.
[02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:37.160]   Have a wonderful--
[02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.560]   Ladies love Seth J.
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.640]   Yeah, ladies love Seth J.
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:43.240]   It's an old--
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:44.280]   It's an old--
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:44.680]   It's an old--
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:46.640]   Is that where L.L. Cool J is ladies love Cool J?
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:48.720]   What's the judge stand for?
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:49.840]   I don't want to know.
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:51.040]   I think it's his name.
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.040]   Because it's first name.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:52.560]   Yeah.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:54.480]   Ladies love Cool J.
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:59.600]   Ladies love Seth J. Ben Brock Johnson.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:00.760]   No, I don't know what to say.
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:01.480]   You're wonderful.
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:04.600]   Thank you for joining us, Senior Producer WBUR.
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:06.080]   What's the podcast you're doing?
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:08.360]   I know you must be doing a podcast.
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:12.560]   Yeah, make a podcast about Reddit called Endless Thread.
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.080]   Love it.
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:13.600]   Love it.
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:14.120]   Love it.
[02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:16.400]   Lots, lots, lots of episodes.
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:19.480]   We're doing some investigative reporting right now,
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:21.000]   so we're on break.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.920]   But we're looking into anti-baxxers, actually.
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:26.520]   Oh, how many sessions?
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.240]   We'll have a series about that.
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:29.280]   Where can I find that, Ben?
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:31.440]   A couple months.
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:34.440]   Wherever you get your podcasts, as they say,
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.880]   WBUR.org/EndlessThread.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:37.840]   Nice.
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:38.240]   Yeah.
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:39.720]   It's always great to have you.
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:42.800]   Seth, you have any podcasts you want to plug?
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:45.200]   We got the Electric Podcast, 9 to 5 Macs.
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:46.280]   Got a couple of podcasts.
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:48.640]   9 to 5 Google's got a couple of podcasts.
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:50.720]   There's even a 9 to 5 Toys podcast.
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:51.720]   Toys?
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:51.920]   Ooh.
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:53.760]   Is that new?
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:57.080]   No, that's our new products and deals site.
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:14:57.600]   Oh, I get it.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:58.080]   I get it.
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:03.040]   And we also have a drone site called dronedj.com.
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:05.160]   Oh, I forgot about that.
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:05.760]   And Flow is--
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:06.720]   For expanding.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:09.120]   --on, besides all about Android, the material podcast
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:10.920]   with some guy named Andy and not Hope.
[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:13.680]   On the relay, if I'm not work, we post a week on Thursday.
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:15.080]   Nice.
[02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.520]   We thank you for being here.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:17.760]   We had a great studio audience.
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:18.440]   Thank you, guys.
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:20.720]   We kind of tricked you by starting the show early,
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:22.960]   but you've got more than enough, I'm sure.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:26.640]   If you want to be in the studio, survive the long march that
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:27.080]   is Twitch.
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.320]   You can just email tickets at twitter.tv.
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.760]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:32.200]   You can also watch the live stream.
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:35.640]   We have audio and video at twitter.tv/live.
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:38.320]   If you're doing that, join us in the chat room.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:40.080]   That's where everybody else watching live hangs out.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:42.040]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:43.280]   Morning, noon, and night.
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:47.200]   There's always somebody at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:50.240]   This show's available like all our shows on demand.
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.760]   So you can listen at your leisure at our website,
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:54.000]   twitter.tv.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.560]   I know a lot of people like to subscribe on our podcast apps.
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:59.400]   There are lots of great podcast apps out there.
[02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:04.080]   Stitcher, slacker, Spotify, Google, apples podcast, pocket
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:04.880]   cast.

[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:07.640]   Subscribe that way.
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:10.760]   Twitter will be ready for you for your Monday morning commute.
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:11.720]   Thanks for being here.
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:12.920]   Have a great week.
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:13.680]   We'll see you next time.
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:15.280]   Another Twitch is amazing.
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:16.100]   See you.
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:26.100]   [MUSIC]
