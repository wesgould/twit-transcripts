[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.840]   I don't know what happened there, but maybe it's I'm influenced by Ian Thompson who's here from
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.880]   Jolly old he's at the register Dakota UK and he's been living in the US for seven years now
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.040]   But refuses to abandon the British ism. So I'm glad oh absolutely not
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.480]   There's no way I'm actually going to abandon my my heritage and I will say wanker until the day I die
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.800]   I think this is the earliest we've ever had a show title actually
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:56.760]   Jason is also here from the amazing six colors.com first former editorial director at IDG
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.240]   Oh, mate
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.320]   Also does a wonderful podcast and all the incomparable which is a thing theatrical podcast and many other
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.160]   Many others. Thank you. It's nice to have you. I always I always love having you with us in studio
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.120]   And I feel bad because Larry maggot who is also a great friend from CBS radio and connects safely org
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.700]   Is not in studio and you're gonna be a slight disadvantage. Oh well
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.160]   You fit that yeah, but just you know jam your way in
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.200]   Because we got three loud mouths here, you know this is the year of the underdog though
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.600]   Why not is that what we're gonna call this it is you know
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.080]   I've been reading on Facebook everybody's so glum because so many people passed away this yeah, but I think it's normal of course the
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.520]   the latest
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.520]   Ron
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.520]   Run glass
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.320]   Shepherd book that's what I always think of him. Yeah, but of course on Barney Miller a wonderful. Yeah a young
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.000]   71
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.160]   Yeah, and he was so great as shepherd book on firefly. Oh, I know he miller and
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.320]   He will be missed but he joins. I mean the year began sadly with Prince
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.240]   David Bowie David Bowie. I mean which I know
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.720]   2006 enough of it 2016 enough of it already
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.280]   And our own colleagues David Benel and Bill McCrone from PC mag number of our colleagues from
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.240]   IDG and Ziff Davis it's funny because I remember Leo when you and I were among the very young Turks
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.880]   Remember that
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.920]   Doesn't seem so long ago
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.040]   Nope, and that's what's weird about life. It goes creeps up on you. Yeah, it goes by both very fast and very slow
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.800]   I was talking about this with a younger relative and said look basically you feel the site you still feel 21 inside
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.280]   It's just that you can't quite do what 21 used to do. Yeah, it's just
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.680]   I was just psychiatrist friend of mine if she had any tricks on how to slow down the aging process and you know
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.280]   Psychologically slow down that that time lapse between years and she said yeah
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.360]   It's very easy have a really boring life
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:15.900]   See I'm trying to figure that out is it good to be have less going on and that seems boring or have more going on and then you have a richer
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.760]   Details of I've been doing the opposite which is try to get more
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.960]   Stuff it like yeah, you know more experiences into my life, right?
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.800]   But that does make it go faster when you're having a good time time goes by quicker in your mind
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.160]   It's as Albert Einstein once said relativity
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   what did he say said
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.040]   something about a
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.760]   Minute with a with a girl seems like no time an hour with a girl seems like no time at all minute on a hot stove seems like forever
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.040]   All right, I don't know if he actually said that but it's
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.200]   As Abraham Lincoln once said don't believe everything you hear on the Internet
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:00.320]   Where should we start we should start since we have you here Ian
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.480]   with something that broke last week the Snoopers charter passed in houses of
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.600]   Parliament and
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.720]   Once the sovereign I've learned that term from the crown the sovereign approves it. Yep, which I presume is pro forma
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.480]   Right? Yeah, basically the Queen can refuse to sign legislation, but it's never been done
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:24.560]   And if it did it would precipitate a constitutional crisis and the one thing the Queen is very good is keeping the firm
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.240]   She calls it the royalty front on a smooth say a smooth course of sailing
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.520]   It's probably what idiot son is going to disrupt when he gets into power, but we shall see you mean Charlie. Yes
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.240]   The I don't know I think they're gonna skip right past Charlie and go straight to William
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.600]   I wish they would to be honest because William seems to have a decent head on his shoulders
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.840]   Charles still has this rule this this concept that he should in some way rule and they're like no
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.860]   You just want the U3 lottery for goodness sake sit there look
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.360]   Supermarket I know but the Queen's actually put some work into it. She's basically has just been
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.400]   Sitting there waiting for his mum to die and it's kind of I think it's done something to his head because he's got this idea that
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.520]   he should be allowed to rule and as a famous conversation during his marriage to Diana which
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.800]   Has never been officially confirmed or denied, but apparently he was complaining to his mentor
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:24.600]   Why he was expected to be faithful to Diana, so my ancestors had mistresses why can't I and it's oh Lord because
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.460]   It's not a different century exactly exactly didn't have television back
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.040]   So the investment yeah, right the investigatory powers act of 2016 Theresa May was the current
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.360]   Prime Minister had been proposed this some years ago now. Yes, she was home secretary. Yeah, she's been able to get it through
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.880]   Some of the obvious
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.920]   It's you know some have compared it to our Patriot Act, but it goes considerably farther. Oh, yes
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.160]   I mean it makes the Patriot Act look like a bill but we work at the work of beginners
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.920]   I can understand that they've this has been sold as a child safety and protect us from our cater bill
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:08.680]   What it does is give a huge number of people access to the internet histories of everyday users
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.240]   It also introduces
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   cutting off anonymity from some users
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.720]   But the list of people who can actually look up your internet history is now
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:24.200]   I mean the food standards agency why quite they need to see the inland revenue, which is our version of the IRS
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:30.760]   You know all of these organizations once you get to a senior enough level get access to pretty much your entire online life
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.480]   And as a journalist who worked in the UK for 20 years
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.800]   I know exactly how that works because the police have their police records database
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.520]   And we had numbers that you could call
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.200]   You know pass it pass a copper of 25 quid and he would look someone up for you on the database and and give you their results
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.480]   Exactly the same thing is going to happen here. It's going to lead to massive corruption massive legal problems
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.680]   And it won't necessarily make us any safer at all
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.960]   So it's interesting you bring up the issue of making using child protection as an excuse if you can see behind me
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.000]   One of the things I do in life with everyone connect safely.org which is an internet safety organization
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.240]   primarily to protect children and we started this organization
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.240]   For the express purpose of making the point that you can have democracy you can have the internet freedom
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.400]   You don't have to have censorship yet. You can teach kids to behave in ways that are going to keep them safer
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.480]   Then they might otherwise be and this this excuse that every time
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.960]   You want to deny civil liberties is to protect children against whether it's pornography or
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.400]   Peter
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   fighting paid a file or whatever it is
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.960]   It's bogus because the reality is that these are taking away people's rights
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:46.920]   They're not protecting anybody and in fact the biggest danger for children is that they would grow up in an undemocratic country
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:54.360]   This is uh, jeff javis talks about this he uses the phrase techno panic and it's always considered the women and children
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:01.320]   And it's frequently child pornography that's used because no one in their right mind would be pro child pornography
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.640]   So it's a very effective
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:11.080]   Rhetorical trick to say well, this is to protect us against child pornography because it really eliminates opposition
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.720]   But I think exactly right larry that there are completely legitimate
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.520]   Reasons to oppose this that have nothing to do with supporting child pornography
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.280]   What we call the four horsemen of the in in for apocalypse which get rolled out
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.320]   It's peter files organize crime terrorists and drug runners
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.560]   And these are the four main excuses and we saw this again with the
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.400]   That letter that the fbi puts out about the rule 41 rule change hit all four straight in the button
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.440]   You know, it's just like oh you want defending peter files if you actually stand up for internet rights
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.240]   It's really important for us to say to say this and say this very clearly
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.880]   That these two are not connected. No, I mean as larry points out
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.760]   It's perfectly possible to protect children without giving up basic basic rights
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.400]   It's just it's a lot easier if you frame the frame the discussion in in in those sort of ways
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.640]   So one of the things in the uk and the u.s
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.480]   Law enforcement have plenty of tools to use to obtain evidence
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.720]   If they need them they have to work a little harder than then you do in a totalitarian state
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.160]   But we've had many convictions of people who have broken the law
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.440]   Online including people who have tried to hide behind their their routers
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.600]   And so there's plenty of precedent for catching bad guys on the other hand, you know the fbi
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:29.800]   Somebody estimated is running more than half of all the child pornography sites in the united states as a honey pot
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:35.000]   From peter files and I have to question whether that is a good use of fbi manpower and resources
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.840]   Well, the play pen case was very interesting because yes, they I mean they are running
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.000]   child abuse image servers on the dark web and
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.520]   Pushing out malware to people who visit try and find out who they are and so far
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.160]   They've got about 200 convictions on a site which gets 100,000 visits every month
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.360]   So the malware is not particularly good at the best of times and they're enabling child abuse
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.160]   So I'm kind of I'm kind of torn on this one. I don't really see how that falls in their remit
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.840]   And it's also borderline entrapment. I mean technically it's not entrapment
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.760]   But for all practical purposes when the government is encouraging you to commit a crime
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.040]   That is very close to entrapment, which is
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.480]   It's well, it's like putting a wallet on the street with money sticking out of it and then arresting you for picking it up
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.480]   Right, you know, let's I think the government should not be in the business of running child porn sites
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.160]   I think it's safe to say that's a bad idea. I agree with you
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.160]   And for it to be all of the in favor of government running
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:41.080]   Yeah, really I mean and and for them to be running nearly half of all the child porn night sites out there is absurd
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.680]   But anyway, that's the us. Let's get back to the UK the investigatory powers act
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.720]   There are two kind of areas one is kind of broad
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.160]   Bulk surveillance, which is something in the United States
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:00.920]   We've been debating ever since the Snowden revelations and I think it's widely agreed even among lawmakers that the nsa and the cia
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.840]   And the fbi shouldn't have this kind of bulk collection capabilities
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.000]   So at least we kind of have that agreement then the other part of it
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.480]   which is still being debated in the u.s is
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.120]   this issue of whether
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.240]   We should have access to encryption whether we should be allowed
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.080]   and now
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.080]   Correct me if i'm wrong, but
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:29.960]   This it sounds like from what i've read and i'm looking at the and i don't see this feature in the list on wikipedia
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.440]   But that it also mandates breakable encryption. Is that the case?
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.720]   This is something the conservative government has been pushing for for quite some time
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.520]   It's the same as you've gotten the uk in the us with this argument about back during encryptions
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.720]   And it's I mean it's it's a very politically easy argument to make which means
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.840]   Which is you know some bad people will use this to communicate in ways that the police can't discover
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.760]   The corollary of that is what they're going to do is in fact weaken encryption by putting a backdoor in
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:05.400]   Telling everyone they're going to put a backdoor in and you can imagine that the chinese government the russian government various governments around the world
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.320]   Are just working all out to find this backdoor because once you put it in there
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   You can't guarantee only you will be able to use it right once it's there anybody can find it anybody can use it
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.640]   We saw this with a junior pene network's back door. We're going to see it again and this time
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.440]   All our internet traffic is up for grabs so that makes it tremendously attractive
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:29.160]   Target for any state sponsored or criminal sponsor group which wants to break
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   To to find this backdoor and then use it for their own purposes
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.840]   Edward Snowden said this this bill goes farther than most autocracies are willing to go
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   Anna and jellima who is head of the world wide web foundation asks does the uk really want the dubious honor of introducing powers deemed too intrusive by all
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.720]   Other major democracies joining the likes of china and russia and collecting everyone's browsing habits
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.760]   And yet i get the feeling because this conversation is having all happening all over the world and the uk
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.320]   Which is let's face it where the magna carter was signed
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   Has adopted it that this is probably
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:15.480]   Uh the beginning of the first domino of many to fall where i think is it fear of terrorism that's driving this or is it just government abuse of power
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.240]   Wanting this is something the government has wanted for a very long time
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.120]   It's kind of like the national identity cards debate that we had in the uk
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.680]   This is something which the civil service and parts of the government desperately want
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.800]   Nobody else particularly does but it is being sold as we will keep you safe from terrors blah blah blah
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.760]   Despite the fact that you know the number of people killed by terrors is tiny unit tiny in comparison
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.520]   This is basically a power grab and it is what by the way terrors
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:49.320]   The point of terrorism is to do this right? This is exactly why one becomes a terrorist to terrorize
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:54.200]   And to get the terrorized to act in this way undermining their
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.120]   Fundamental freedoms. This is exactly what the terrorist wants
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.960]   Yeah, that's exactly it is for us to change our way of life because because we're afraid of them
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:09.480]   Yeah, and it's also a green light for oppressive governments around the world. So well the Brits have done it
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.440]   Why here you know shut up and stop complaining about our internet laws?
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.800]   It just it's a disaster in i mean, it's
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.960]   The conservative government in the uk is just leading the country more and more into becoming a backwater unfortunately in this
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.440]   I think unfortunately, I think this could be a precursor to what we see in the united states
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.520]   I mean these conversations are already taking place in the united states the president elect is on record is being opposed to apples
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.360]   Refusal as was as if in all fairness the current president
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:42.040]   On record is you know being opposed to apples once a refusal to
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.400]   Decrypt their their iphone go out of their way. I think oh in fact increasing pressure on this
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:55.560]   Our current president president obama has been absolutely aggressive in increasing governmental surveillance and power and asserting it
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   And he even recently said that he doesn't believe snowden should be pardoned
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:07.240]   I mean, it's very clear that this is something that's begun been going on probably since 9/11 and has just been
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:13.720]   Accelerating but I so I think that the there's not much more to say about this except that
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.760]   If if you're watching this show and you care about
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.560]   Encryption you care about your own privacy and I know our audience cares a lot about privacy
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:28.600]   Yep, um that the the thing to do well, there's several things to do one is to adopt encryption technologies even though
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.960]   Uh, it's it's been said by many people. That's a red flag
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:37.640]   Uh that is that it's time to learn how to use gpg to learn how to
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:43.320]   Protect your data whether you're up to no good or not in fact, especially if you're not up to no good
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.280]   Yeah, and then to contact your member of congress and just show them that you're interested in
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.520]   Unfortunately, historically geeks are kind of apolitical and don't want to get involved
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:57.880]   And I think this is a time for us all to uh stand up and be counted if you want to preserve your privacy
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.720]   And your protections and use a vpn and use a text messaging service with end-to-end encryption
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.200]   Like signal signal. Yep. Yeah, everybody agrees not telegram
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.240]   Signal, uh only reason I say not telegram is because
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.800]   Uh telegrams encryption is roll your they apparently rolled their own in its suspect
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   Furthermore is created by a russian
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.080]   Uh, who's in all fairness had to leave russia because they robbed him of all his profits
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:31.400]   He was the mark zuckerburg of russia left because uh poutins government basically forced him to turn his company over to
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.960]   the russian government however
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:40.040]   Uh in their most recent, uh, they just posted a uh a blog post about the updates
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:45.480]   Uh to telegram and to a new service. They're offering called telegraph
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.240]   In which they are there are a number of dog whistles
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.040]   Which kind of surprised me?
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:58.120]   Including they're talking about the new sticker capabilities and the sticker they chose to show is uh, pepe
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.920]   Uh the alt-right mascot
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.000]   Oh, which the guy the guy who wrote pepe there was now trying to reclaim it from the alt-right
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.400]   It says remember all those times when you had a sad pepe among your recently set sent stickers
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.640]   If you'd like to reunite pepe with the rest of his family you now can do that
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.440]   There are a couple of dog whistles in here that make me wonder
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:24.920]   What's going on anyway? Don't use telegraph. It's uh, if even if if uh, it's strange politics don't affect you
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.160]   Get on signal keep up to date with what moxie malmoxie malmoxie malmoxie malmoxie
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:35.960]   I think we can trust moxie. Yeah, you can trust moxie. Absolutely. Um, he's a fighter for privacy and freedom
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.800]   Did you see the the soudis contacted him?
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.440]   This was a couple of years ago. It was hilarious
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.160]   Uh moxie is a dreadlocked anarchist sailor
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:50.120]   Compute complete computer. We're so when it comes to encryption. He was contacted by a representative of the main soudi national talco
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.800]   To build a system for monitoring dissidents and spying on them
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.440]   And so he just like he played them along and then just published the entire email message because it was just
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:04.680]   What were they thinking? I mean it's moxie for goodness sake. Yeah, look at him. Yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna go to work for you
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.640]   I'm sorry. Yeah, he's got some he's got some standards
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.880]   Lots to talk about I want to ask I'm getting the new tomorrow. I'm getting the new microsoft windows
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.000]   Surface studio the big one
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.960]   28 inch skid lies almost flat. I'm gonna try
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:28.040]   Using it on this show. I think it'd be kind of cool to have I'll look like shepherd smith on fox news like giant
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.120]   tablet in front of me
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.040]   Um, so uh, I think we should talk a little bit about with her apple
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   We've spent a lot of time talking about that and I'm looking forward to this week
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:43.160]   Giving you my first look monday will do an unboxing tomorrow around noon pacific 3 p.m
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.800]   Eastern I had a play with her at the launch and I have to say it
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:52.380]   It's the kind of thing that you wouldn't usually expect from microsoft and why the hell is an apple doing more for its
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:59.160]   Lost its course, but we're gonna get we're gonna get to that. Yes, it's uh, but I mean the dial is fantastic
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.480]   The actual build of it. I brought in actually john found it in our basement
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.320]   This is the uh, this was the power now that griffin sold for apple macintosh's years ago
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.480]   We bought a bunch of them for our teleprompter operators and uh
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:20.280]   And so the dial is not new. Hey, however, I can't put this on the screen of my surface and not do special things
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.920]   So that's new. We'll take a break. We'll come back with more. Let's talk about that in a lot more great panel here
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.040]   From six colors dot com jason snell
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:36.440]   From the register dot co dot uk e in tomsen and from cbs radio and connect safely dot org the great larry maggad
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.640]   Our show today brought to you by my like that one right here
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.320]   I put my automatic. I maybe I connected it. You go to gun
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.760]   My you my automatic my personal obd port
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:55.640]   I've this is this is the awesomest thing the way to turn your clunker into a smart connected car the automatic every car
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:02.280]   Built since 1996 has something called the on board diagnostic support or obd 2 port
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.680]   This you may have seen it under your steering wheel and thought well, that's probably for the shop, right?
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.840]   That's for the the dealer when they fix my car they'll plug their computer in that's true
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.560]   But you can plug your computer in this is a bluetooth device goes right in the obd 2 ports powered by the car
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.160]   Don't worry. It's not going to drain your battery it goes to sleep when you're not going
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:27.560]   But you pair this to your phone your iPhone or your android device and the things you can do with this are awesome
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.280]   Of course is the obvious when a check engine light comes on for instance your phone will tell you what's wrong
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.480]   And it even tells you where the nearest repair shop is they'd also
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:43.800]   Connects with if this than that so first is I can with my amazon echo. I can say how much gas is left in the tank
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.280]   It'll tell me I I can find out more
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.360]   You can link it to your nest thermostat so you can have the take turn on but on your on your way home
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.920]   This is the new automatic pro which is even cooler. It doesn't even need a smartphone
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.200]   It has unlimited 3g service built in no subscription fee
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:09.880]   And it works wherever you are so it will get help in a crash automatic pro will detect severe accidents
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.840]   Trained responders will call for help even if you cannot
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:20.280]   If you have teenagers, this is a must you can geofence you can get alerts when your kids go outside of the area for instance
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.560]   We're not gonna let michael drive on the highway till he's a little bit older
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.640]   This will help us right. I love the idea that even if you don't have your phone
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.480]   It knows where you are
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.120]   If it knows where you've I use it all the time because I always forget where I parked and I can and the other day
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.920]   Lisa said do you remember where we parked? I said no she said oh it's too bad
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.920]   We don't have anything that could tell you where you parked when I went oh as a matter of fact we do
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.520]   uh normally 129 95 we have an offer code this would be a great gift for the holidays
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.640]   Twit 20 will save you 20 bucks
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.360]   Twit 20 go to automatic.com/twit for more information
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:00.520]   Uh, it is awesome if you've got teenagers give all you this should be a stocking stuffer for all teenagers
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.520]   Did they show you your mouth for gallon as well?
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.840]   And it does really because uh, you know, I think a lot of times we go
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.000]   Well, it's worth driving to costco 12 miles away to save five bucks on that bag of chips
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:17.240]   But obviously if your gas cost is $4. It's not and this tells you every trip
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   I have it set up so it goes to uh, evernote. It doesn't ever know entry
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:27.880]   Uh every time I take a trip that tells it has a map of where I went exactly how many miles it also grades your driving
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.080]   On hard braking you can turn that off hard braking
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.480]   Acceleration Ian says I don't want to know
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.680]   And uh, but all of that goes into my evernote notebook or if the kids are driving same thing
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.960]   So I have information about it what the gas cost was for every single trip. That's fantastic
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.520]   automatic.com/twit
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.600]   It's a it's the quantified
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.400]   Car
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.280]   It's the new thing. That would be great for uber drivers to actually know what what they're really earning on a trip
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.760]   A lot of fleets do this. I mean ups does this
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.800]   Uh in your right it would be good. I don't know if uber does that kind of monitoring, but it should and that would be really great
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.280]   They probably don't want the drivers to know to read about the new uber. I guess this is in new york
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.560]   mostly, uh, is it called?
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:16.760]   Oh, right the local one. Yes, juneo is it what is the new? Yeah, something like that. Yeah, because I tried that tomorrow
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.960]   Yeah, are you yeah, you're going to new york. Yes. So there was a good new yorker article about them and berytunde told me about him
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.680]   He says I don't use uber anymore because it's exploitative
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.560]   I want to use juneo now juneo is started by the guys
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.080]   Who started? Oh
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   They they sold
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.040]   Viber they started viber remember that yeah for nine hundred million dollars
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:48.440]   So, uh the founder tom and marco said he thought well I could sit around and just you know
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.760]   Enjoy life or I could take some of that money and start another company
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.280]   He looked around and he said you know we could do we could do what uber's doing better
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.600]   Now they're kind of cannibalizing uber because they're going after uber drive the best uber drivers
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.000]   If your uber score
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.400]   Your your rating on uber is over
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:11.320]   Uh, this is something out of a black mirror episode if your uber score is uh over
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:18.520]   4.7 out of five stars you can apply to drive for juneo in other words if you're one of the best they'll steal you away
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:24.200]   Although many drivers do both. Yeah, and you get a higher percentage right? Yeah uber takes five to 25
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.600]   commission juneo takes 10 percent
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:33.240]   And what's happening with a lot of uber drivers are getting squeezed it started out great and then yeah, then uber takes more and more and more
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   I took an uber the other day
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.960]   We were in uh, florida
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.120]   And I tried to give the guy a tip he says no the company doesn't let me take tips and I said oh my friend
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.600]   Yeah, you are so wrong
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.720]   Uh, they don't let you tip within the app like lift does they pretend that you're getting tipped?
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.360]   I always assumed uber was tipping the driver
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:57.480]   And they told drivers you may not ask for a tip until the drivers sued in one yeah
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:03.480]   And now uber drivers can ask for tips. I told him not only are you allowed to take tips you can now ask for tips
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.400]   And don't believe what the uber guys telling you no I mean uber has a
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.760]   Long record of treating its drivers terribly bad. They're on the record of saying that basically
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.480]   They're just hanging around until the automated car comes out and they're just going to dump all these drive by drive
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.160]   So, you know, it's it's a very it's it's not a company
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:21.800]   I choose
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.880]   Lift allows you to tip within the app and what I like about that is i'll tip after I get out of the car
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.640]   When i'm at the end of a ride what I like about uber and lift you they can just get out of the car and leave
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.880]   I don't have to fiddle with my wallet. Yep, but I kind of feel back because I do like to tip if I get good service
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.320]   But lift lets you do that at any point after the ride though
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.280]   I felt guilty because I have never tipped uber drivers
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.800]   Assuming that I didn't have to I know and I don't carry cash one of the reasons that I really like uber is that I don't
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   I don't need to worry about having cash for a tip ever since I've ever since that court case I have now
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.360]   Automatically tip I carry cash and then maybe you should try it
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.880]   So larry when you're in the big apple try juneo try june
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:07.160]   Perfect tomorrow morning. I've got a six a.m. Flight and I don't trust uber or lift actually have a driver in my neighborhood available
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.200]   Pick me up at 430. So lift now lets you schedule. I actually have a lift reserved
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.600]   I think i'm paying a little extra for that
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.200]   But it's it's a relief to know that a driver will be there at 430 in the morning
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.040]   Oh, and I don't have to worry about what it is nerve-wracking isn't it that you could just assume
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.120]   Well, i'm gonna get up and i'm gonna press a button and a guy will come within five minutes at 40 in the morning
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.600]   Maybe maybe not and you don't want to miss that flight hello alto nobody in the right mind to be trying
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:37.720]   Yeah, that's the thing even with juneo and lift i worry about in a few years
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.120]   It's clear that all of these companies want to do a autonomous. Oh, yeah
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.920]   Yeah, I mean these jobs are not going to exist in five
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.800]   Then you'll pay extra for the the human touch right that'll be you'll there'll be like an extra
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:57.720]   Fancy, you know our driver knows the way to go, but it will it will push the bottom what 90 percent 80 percent of the drivers out of the market
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.640]   Exactly. Eventually. Yeah, considering the driving is one of the most
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.800]   I think about three and a half four million americans and now
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:13.080]   One point one professional the workforce is a professional driver. Wow. They're gonna be a good truck driver. Yeah, it's a huge number
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.400]   Uh, that's gonna have to uh
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:19.960]   Attract drivers are gonna be yeah usually impacted by it because that's one of the areas that might actually get
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:25.960]   Covered sooner because it's so much more efficient to not have people, you know human beings have to do things like sleep and eat
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.280]   Yeah, well, we saw just a
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.520]   A few weeks ago auto otto
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:37.800]   Which is an uber company delivering, uh, what was it 7500 cases of beer? Well bud was it's a cool
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.440]   B is a big strong
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.400]   Oh
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.040]   You want to have you want the beer in the in the robot truck to be something you could lose
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.040]   Yeah, it is exactly important
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:55.240]   So I don't I wasn't going to get into this today because this is kind of a deep and difficult
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:03.160]   Understand a parsed topic, but it is very clear that income inequality is a growing problem. That's clear, right?
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.960]   um
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.160]   And the following out of industry is right jobs are going away
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.640]   And I you know and even if you are able to get carrier air conditioner
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:19.960]   To stay in the united states it seems highly unlikely that industrial jobs that have been lost will come back at any point
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.360]   Right, um, you can talk about and some do retraining
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.440]   teaching, uh people to have skills that are more
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.360]   in need but
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:36.360]   It's very clear with the advance of machine learning artificial intelligence that we're rapidly getting to a situation where they're even
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.640]   Jobs like mine that one would assume require human skills won't be available in the years to come
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.280]   So that leaves a very interesting question. There was an article this week in the atlantic
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.880]   A world without work. This is darak tomsen writing and this is an issue that a lot of people are
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.920]   Starting to think about actually I apologize. This is a year old
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:03.480]   Uh, i've read that that's that's a really great piece though. This is this is one of those issues that you know, that you have this
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.720]   Our our economy in some ways has never been more efficient
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.880]   But it comes
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.320]   But it's employing fewer people and that's the challenge is if you if you lose another 1% of the workforce
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.640]   Are they going to where's it going?
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:23.960]   Robot trust probably not I think donald trump is going to get his his campaign eventually maybe not during his administration
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.120]   He will fulfill his campaign promise of bringing jobs back to the united states
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.880]   But the problem i'm sorry bringing industry back to the united states not jobs
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:38.840]   So yes, apple is going to start eventually they'll start making devices in the us to be with robots even robscon in china
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:46.280]   Has replaced 30 000 people with robots? So right and it would you know, especially if energy continues to be cheap
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.240]   Why not put a plant in the middle of the united states closer to the consumer if you don't have well
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.120]   There's actually interesting economic reasons for china for apple to manufacture in china
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:01.000]   It's closer to the sources and the suppliers of the pieces. Yeah, it's the supply chain
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.680]   It's much easier and cheaper to assemble in china. It's not about labor the labor edition the cost of labor
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:13.720]   That would change the five dollars between making it here and making in china. It's not about the labor cost
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.480]   It's about the access to suppliers and being able to adjust
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:23.240]   Where you get from the supply chain just in time and by moment so that you can minimize your inventory and all those things
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.400]   That tim cook for example, it made his that's his that's what he does
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   Yeah, so I I think that
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:36.120]   We will probably makes able to be able to reverse some of this
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:41.720]   But in the but the long-term trend is clear geez jobs are not going to even exist in china
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.600]   I mean, it's not that these jobs are fleeing to china
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.400]   They are going to disappear thanks to automation on machine learning artificial intelligence
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.360]   And that's what this article says but the thing that
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.600]   This article wants you to think about is do we even need?
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.760]   To work and this is why psychologically it's very difficult historically
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.440]   We associate who we are with what we do
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.800]   Without my work. I don't know who I am
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.360]   Yeah, and so
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.480]   Psychologically mark and dreason has addressed this the netscape billionaire
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.520]   He says don't have you don't have to worry about income inequality
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:22.680]   You don't have to worry about job loss because there will be such a surplus thanks to automation and machine learning
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.240]   That there will be enough to go around and you actually won't need to work
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   That we can have a basic
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.320]   Essentially, yeah, that's a bad word. Well for idea
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:40.600]   Yeah, the idea and mark is now there are problems with basic income huge problems. Yes, chief of which it replaces
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.320]   in other entitlements like
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:51.000]   medical insurance that won't be covered in the long run by basic income, but but let's assume we could fix that discontinuity
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.920]   if there is a
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.840]   surplus
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.040]   Maybe in the future we won't need to have jobs
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.840]   But we'll have to psychologically adjust who we as are right and the idea of basic income
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.440]   By the way, if you've seen the sci-fi series the expanse they mentioned that from time to time
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.280]   It's part of the universe there is that earth is a is on a basic income at that point
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.480]   The idea is you don't have to work just to survive
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.800]   But if you want anything more if you want to buy
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.720]   Survival is guaranteed close that don't come out of a machine and food that doesn't come in cubes
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.080]   Then you then you choose to work and the idea there is that we could all end up being more productive
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:31.800]   If we can choose what we want to work on and it could lead humanity to interesting places instead of sort of fighting to
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:39.240]   Uh, fighting to to do just enough to survive. It is also a bit of a utopian vision and this question about whether it's also
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:43.160]   They've also the service economy and by service. I don't mean just working at mcdonald's
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.480]   So we had a flood in our house in july and we've had workers here constantly
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:54.920]   For the last several months, you know putting walls in and painting and doing things that cannot be done currently by machines
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.560]   And admittedly but spending a lot of money
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.600]   Some of the part of the problem is that these jobs may in fact exist but pay so little
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.000]   Yeah, and be so grinding and grueling
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.640]   That they in fact don't raise you above the poverty line in fact the minimum wage in the united states does not raise you above the poverty
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.440]   Right, but but doing carpentry work in paulo alto
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.280]   At least at the guys that we hire is 75 dollars an hour, right?
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.920]   Which if you didn't live in paulo alto with a pretty good wage
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:26.600]   I mean the problem is to live in this area so high but I mean what i'm saying is that there are still
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:30.760]   Jobs out there in fact, I think this whole whole mottimation
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.640]   Thing that we're in right now the iot thing
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.520]   Requires skilled people to to know what to buy to know how to install it to know how to configure it
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.800]   And I do think that there are service jobs that are going to be emerging
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.520]   Over the next few years they may not last forever
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:50.920]   But but there will be uh some opportunities for people and many of these jobs don't require a college education
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:57.480]   Here's from this atlantic article of last year the most common occupations in the us are retail salesperson
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.400]   cashier
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.640]   Food and beverage server and office clerk
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   These four jobs are about 10 percent of the labor force 15 and a half million people
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:16.600]   Each according to an oxford study is highly susceptible to automation. Yep. So yes admittedly there will be people working
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.640]   I'm hoping that podcast show host will not be
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.160]   However
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.360]   Even if you have 10 percent of the labor force not working you have to address this issue
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:33.560]   And uh, I I would I would submit that this is a clear future at this point
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.240]   So we really need to think about what does that mean?
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.200]   Let me recommend a video for people to watch that's really great on this by cg gray. It's on youtube
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.800]   It's called humans need not apply. Yeah, it is it is it might be his biggest traffic video
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.320]   It's got almost 8 million views. I watched it. It's kind of scary. It's scary, but the logic is there
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:59.160]   We are entering a time when um, we think that you know the 21st century right now is different than when we grew up
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.480]   But the reality is we're entering a time where
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:06.120]   Lots of rules that we don't even know are rules because they just seem like they're fundamental
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:11.480]   We'll just not apply anymore. Right. Yeah, it's going to require basically a fundamental restructuring of capitalism
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.560]   And that makes me very nervous because that doesn't usually happen without blood on the streets
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:21.800]   Um, I was speaking to a guy at the on the open AI project, you know musk's um artificial intelligence program
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.720]   He's doing an open one because he's afraid that google and facebook and others will own this
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.040]   He doesn't want proprietary
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:33.960]   But their developers are actually saying this is actually this is coming along much much faster than people are forecasting because
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.920]   AI has been this year's thing, you know, everyone wants to build themselves as an AI company
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.800]   But the point at which, you know lawyers jobs accountants jobs, right?
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:49.880]   You know any kind of job you can think of almost can be automated using code which is under development at the moment
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.080]   So this is coming up on us very fast and I don't see anybody
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.040]   Having a way to do this and manage this change
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.560]   Without you know without serious societal upheaval
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.400]   And there's seems to be no plan in action and that is
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.120]   Already it's in fact even without AI if you think of things like turbo tax
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.120]   How many accounting jobs have been taken away as a result of turbo tax?
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.840]   I mean there must be
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.560]   Not accounting jobs, but there used to be a category called tax preparer right in our block
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:23.880]   And even h in our block makes its own software now that makes an h in our block human unnecessary
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.960]   Yeah, so we don't need a tax preparer
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.400]   That's the use quick books that are at our at our at our seat at our nonprofit
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:35.320]   And not only is it much cheaper than a bookkeeper. It's much easier than a bookkeeper. We actually save time
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.240]   Using quick books over the time we used to have to interact with our bookkeeper
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:42.680]   And so it's not like we it wasn't even a financial decision
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.280]   It was an efficiency decision
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.520]   And and those things are happening more and more and more to the point where a lot of jobs have just gone away
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.480]   Let me bring this back around to uber because of something that Larry said there
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:59.240]   There is a possibility that governments will artificially block efficiency and tax preparation is a great example
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.960]   Where one of the reasons in many other countries
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:08.920]   Because because the us the us government knows exactly, you know, you get that bill and they like they already know from your pay stubs
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:13.960]   Exactly how much tax you owe well in other countries. They just say okay. This is what we think you owe
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.800]   Let us know if it's something different, but in the us you have to file a return
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:24.920]   Why is that because the tax preparers lobby the government very hard to keep tax preparation necessary? Yeah
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.360]   It's better the tax software people
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:36.680]   It's not turbo taxes the other one, but one of the automated tax preparers has lobbied congress to make the tax laws more opaque and more
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.120]   complicated
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   And to reduce and increase the complexity
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.200]   There are but but this shows you you can have you can have
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.680]   Attempts by governments to artificially retain jobs
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.480]   Even though they don't think in the long term those will succeed do you?
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.080]   It's who knows?
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.120]   I mean this this you could argue that this goes back to Eisenhower warning against the military industrial complex
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.600]   What if if the United States tomorrow decided it wanted to cut its defense budget in half
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.120]   Could we given how many people work in that?
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.920]   employment would be outrageous right?
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:16.520]   Could argue that this most recent presidential election was him was really a referendum over jobs
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:22.120]   And job loss and that the promise that president-elect trump made was I will save your jobs
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.280]   It was a very direct response to this issue and the problem is the law that job
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.800]   He said he was going to save on there's just no way that they can come back
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   So one of the reasons one of the reasons cold jobs mining jobs are disappearing is
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:37.960]   Not because we're buying chinese coal or even because we're closing down
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.000]   coal-fired power plants but because the coal companies themselves are closing down and
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.200]   Turning to fracking and other more profitable businesses
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.160]   Hill's home mining rather than doing that mining. Yeah, and so it's also a very powerful industry relative
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.640]   It's hard to force those jobs to puller. Yeah, we can call hard to make those jobs come back
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.520]   in 2013 according to this oxford
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.280]   article on the Atlantic oxford university researchers
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:10.600]   Forecasted here's the most scary statistic that machines might be able to do half of all us jobs in the next two decades
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:17.160]   Again, you're carpenter your 75 dollar an hour copter might still have a living especially if he's good at wood carving right
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.040]   But that's still half of all jobs
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:26.920]   Gone that has to be a massive disruption. Oh, it's gonna be and the real question is what do we tell our kids?
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.760]   Uh that what is the future for them?
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:37.320]   What should my 22 and 24 year old be thinking about right now get into computer security?
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:44.440]   That is gonna be no, I think that that's one of the things that could easily be replaced by an artificial intelligence
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:50.600]   This is this is the thing. I don't know I I think one of the core problems and gets back to the back to the election too is
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.520]   We have
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.920]   A lot of highly educated professions that just some of them might get hurt
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.560]   But a lot of them are going to be fine. The problem is that traditionally people who for whatever reason economic reasons, you know, it doesn't really matter didn't
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:13.960]   Seek an education didn't want an education couldn't get an education still could find an honest living and be middle class in america
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:20.920]   And when you look at the direction this is going that's just to be a real question about a percentage of the population that
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:26.600]   Isn't going to ever get a phd in biology. They don't want it. They're not inclined to do that and yet
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.480]   They look at their job prospects and there's nothing. There's maybe even nothing full time
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.200]   It's all little gigs with no benefits and that's terrifying. I mean it used to be the care
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.280]   I mean there's a there's a certain sort of historical
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.720]   Aspect to this in that you know in the 1950s and 60s American manufacturing was dominant
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.760]   In the large part because it was the only country that hadn't been ravaged by world war two and actually had some
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:54.920]   You know, so you could get a high-pair, you know middle class job with a just a high school degree
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.080]   You could go and you could join the factory and that would work out. That's no longer the case
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:04.520]   That's never coming back. So, you know, we need to work out some kind of way to get people
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:10.120]   You know give them a way to earn a living that doesn't leave them scrabbling around on the bread line
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:16.840]   And yeah, we may well produce a surplus through automation, but I would argue that based on past human history
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.720]   It's almost never been given away freely to the large populace. Well, you could say that right now
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.760]   I mean Travis Kalanick is not giving the billions of dollars
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.120]   He has to you and me or even to uber drivers
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.520]   In fact, he's giving less and less to uber drivers and and putting more and more in his pockets. So
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:38.520]   Uh, you're absolutely right. I mean that's that's very clear that there the trickle down is is is a pipe dream
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.800]   You see but I mean that only works up to a point sooner or later
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:47.880]   The numbers have dispossessed rise high enough so they take over the thing and that's why you see movies like a lesion
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.280]   Where the people who had the money move to the satellite and the rest of us have to scrabble around on earth trying to yeah survive
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:59.480]   But anarchist mobs don't build chip fabs, you know, we need to get the sorted out because otherwise and again
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.120]   I'm just like the last segment
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:08.440]   This is something we as technologists and everybody listening and watching need to think about because we understand better than many
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:15.560]   What's going on and what the potential consequences are and it's our industry that is often going to be the driver of this change
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:20.920]   Yeah, and this is a challenge and it's a challenge you said about how geeks don't like to be involved in politics and things like that
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.240]   It is terrifying to be able to say
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:29.960]   Um, the thing i'm about to create which i think is great and has a great upside could be completely destructive to our way of life
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.440]   And that doesn't mean you don't necessarily do it
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.480]   You have to still do it
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.360]   But you have to you know have apply some morality
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.840]   And think about the bigger issues and i do think that that has been a blind spot in silicon valley
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.760]   Yeah, and to understand the unintended consequence i feel actually a little bit guilty because
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   i've been a champion of social media since
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.800]   Before social media with a with a word right
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:56.360]   Going back to the 80s in some ways and i have to tell you there are aspects of social media today that scare the hell out of me
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:58.600]   I mean the fake news and the propaganda
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.640]   I think and even although i think it's exaggerated there is no question that there's a certain amount
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   Of radicalization that goes on that contributes to terrorism and there's a lot
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.640]   That has happened to the result of social media that i actually feel a little guilty about
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.360]   Because if i along with a lot of other people were propagandizing and promoting this
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.520]   Over the last 30 years
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:24.920]   I think we put some thought into the unintended consequences, but not nearly enough thought and i really think it's very
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:30.040]   Great you think that's true i've been i i feel a little guilty about pushing all these shiny little
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.680]   What do you call them fondle slabs? Yes
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:36.040]   And we talk a lot about gear and you know
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.640]   techno lust and consumerism but i have to say i don't think
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.720]   Thinking about the consequences or being the engineer is going to say well
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:51.080]   i'm not going to invent this because of what it might do is going to make a hill of beans difference because i think technology
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.040]   Has a march it marches on i don't know
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:46:00.440]   It will think you can't uninvents something and you can't keep something from being invented even though it may have dire
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:06.840]   Sociological consequences this is going to happen and even though google what if google said
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.400]   What if larry pates it you know we're going to stop this in
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:14.920]   Researching artificial intelligence clearly this is going to be a problem. That's not going to happen
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:19.800]   But what you want is something like open ai or you want somebody like google to be engaged with our government
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.920]   In a way where they can say look these are issues that we think we need to resolve here instead of being like oh, you know
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.320]   I just build the bomb. I don't drop it. Yeah, but actually in google day to its credit google does do that
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.560]   I mean they have people who think about those things
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:37.320]   Whether or not those people are driving product or they're just often some corner and mountain viewer, washington
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.360]   i'm not sure
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.360]   But they have people i'm headed next week to
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:47.880]   Guadalajara for the internet governance forum and google is going to be there along with facebook and all the other companies and we're going to be talking about
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:54.200]   The implications and and the unintended consequences and you know the policies around all of this technology
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.760]   So they do think about that
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.680]   But i'm not sure how much that drives innovation and or how much that's just sort of after the fact
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.800]   Conversations about the technology that's already out there
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.520]   It is a little worrying that the chief technologist who's advising donald trump at the moment is peter thiel
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:14.040]   Who let's face it doesn't have a great reputation when it comes to you know dealing well with others put it that way
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   i'm kind of i'm kind of the opinion that um these are
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.680]   Ultimately forces of nature
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:25.560]   And human beings will be tossed around like leaves in a wind
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:31.160]   No matter what we think or say or do and so i don't really think it matters whether peter teal
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:37.720]   Is it is advising donald trump or not i mean in the short term it will matter perhaps
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.320]   uh, but in the long term i think the trend is very clear
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.200]   and uh
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:50.360]   I i kind of maybe i'm pessimistic but i feel like we're going to have a very big dislocation at some point where where
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.680]   These these will these i think they're starting to come to a head now
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.040]   I think we're starting to see this come to a head and it's really at this point of race
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:03.640]   Between whether the ice caps melt and flood all of silicon valley or silicon valley destroys all work
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.680]   And and we have mobs at the gates
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.520]   uh, i think
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:16.280]   I i feel i feel bad for my kids because i don't think the next four four four decades or five decades are going to be anywhere
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.600]   I think we have lived an amazing
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.520]   last few decades
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.520]   Truly amazing
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:28.040]   Are you said last few decades like well i know what you meant, but it also is awfully final
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   Well, there's a new book that's a wonderful book called millennium that talks about this we have lived in an amazing hundred years
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.320]   uh
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.000]   Admittedly the most bloody hundred years in human history because we've gotten very good at technological warfare
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.520]   Yeah, but at the same time we've also seen amazing advances in life expectancy and medicine
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:52.360]   Technology's been an amazing boon. We live that's going to continually your kids are going to live a lot longer than you will
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.680]   I mean certainly your grandchildren are going to live to 140. Yeah, but they may be living on alpo
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.440]   I don't know. I am maybe
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:05.320]   I mean, I really this is what I this is what I uh, I worry about and I think we should really appreciate where we are today living as
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.720]   as we do all of us
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:11.800]   As kings really in many ways. We have running water and toilets
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.840]   If you take if you take a little broader perspective, um, the I believe
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.280]   Um
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:22.360]   Fewer people are starving in the world. Yeah today than at any point in human history
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:28.600]   Um, is that true standards of living in large portions of the world are dramatically better than they were even 50 years ago
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.720]   And I fear for this progress and so well, I don't know
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:37.560]   I I think part of it may be that we it's very easy in the united states to get a lack of perspective
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:43.720]   And say things are not improving in the united states and therefore the world is going to hell when the reality may be that
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.840]   Things are improving everywhere else in the world and the united states already had it so good that yeah
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.640]   We're not so great away the the forebearers aren't we of what we also have cheap goods or there's a
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:59.000]   Happening happen. Well, and then she would and I think you're that's what mark and dreason is saying goods will be effectively free
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.640]   So work will be much less important
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.760]   You remember buying a parrot by if you wanted to buy a nice pair of slacks in 1960
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:12.040]   I can't remember what the price was but it was it was a significant amount of money probably about 120
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.560]   $150 in today's dollars to buy a parrot slacks
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.520]   You can go to walmart and maybe that's not the highest quality clothing that you would want to buy
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:25.960]   But you can buy something for 15 20 dollars and they're gonna look okay. You can get away with that
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.120]   I'll give you another example long distance telephone calls. You know the days
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:38.520]   Calling long distances has to be quick. Yeah. Yep effectively communication anywhere on the globe is free now
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.080]   Right what the hell that is a massive change. Oh, yeah
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.400]   I mean just the shoot on the minute to our communications the very idea now of
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.080]   I mean christmas is coming up
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:56.200]   So my mom's doing a christmas card list for me the very idea of getting a piece of dead tree and writing on it and putting a stamp on it
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.000]   Trusting it to the global postal service do it electronically. It's there. It's instant
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.160]   It might not be sold of a paper of a paper christmas card
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.720]   But they're gonna get thrown away two days after christmas anyway, so you know why not do it electronically
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.880]   Of course, that's not a very popular opinion it seems but it's
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.680]   It's certainly doable. It's funny. I just um printed a brochure
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:23.080]   I'm headed to a conference and I printed this brochure for my nonprofit and it brought me back to
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:29.000]   I used to be a printer back in the you know decades ago and it brought me back to this wonderful time of loving
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.800]   to be laying out a piece of paper and
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.280]   Printing it and making sure everything was properly registered. Of course. I did it on a color laser printer
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.840]   And you know it didn't take any skill
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:44.280]   But but I and then I realized I started printing these things and you know, I ran out about a couple hundred
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.000]   I was you know, wait a minute. Nobody's gonna actually take this piece of paper
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.640]   I do it on a waste
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.960]   Yeah, we have a there's a guy at the gym
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.160]   Who does a christmas cd every year?
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.440]   And he gave me the cd and I said wow, that's retro
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:03.880]   Uh pretty soon you're not going to be able to give people CDs. I don't even think I have a cd player anymore
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.120]   I let me see if I can find one
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:10.040]   He says I burned 500 of these every year. I have a five
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.720]   cd burner that I was given one year for christmas. I said
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.600]   Yeah, john, that's good
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:21.160]   You know, you're gonna have to rethink this strategy soon. Maybe just share a spotify playlist
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:26.840]   There's actually a dvd cd player in my car that I discovered about five years after I bought it
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   I even know I had one in the yeah, who needs it punch around like I didn't know that was there
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.600]   It's kind of hidden behind the screen. All right. Let's take a break
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.480]   But you know, I'm not sure it's all bad. I don't know if it's good or bad
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.680]   But I think it's really important to kind of think these are these are men
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:47.960]   We see every day and we report every day about the disruptions that technology and the information revolution is bringing to our world and businesses
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:54.760]   Rise and fall on the basis of this and it might be worth spending a little time thinking about as we have just done a little bit of preparation
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.440]   Can save it enormous kind of hurt. Yeah, the impact will be yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:05.160]   I think this is the climate change of of the information generation. This is this is a really massive
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:11.640]   Change and by the way, I don't think henry forward with putting a lot of thought about the environmental in car impact of automobiles and
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:16.360]   How it would affect people's health and their safety back when he was building car
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.360]   You know what paying his staff well enough that they could afford to buy the car in the first place
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   I'm gonna give forward a little credit because
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:27.720]   Admittedly, he didn't have the sophisticated thinking that we do nowadays of the holistic effect of the automobile
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:34.840]   But he was very well aware of how the automobile would change america for the better by bringing the bad world
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:37.880]   By making communications in rural society
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.080]   Change the ability to bring to market farm produce
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:45.960]   He knew that this would make a massive change. It was his opinion opinion would be better
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:51.080]   I think can you think about the negative conflict? I don't think he could be blamed for not understanding the pollution element
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.200]   As fast as it's all at all. I mean it was just you know
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.080]   Who knew that taking all that carbon out of the ground and pumping it into the air would have a deleterious effect
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.960]   I don't think anybody in 1929 would have that no
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.320]   I mean there's lots to dislike about ford and his support for the Nazis in particular
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:09.480]   But I mean at the same time you can't blame the infant you can't say he should have known about about come
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.060]   You know about calm outside and global climate
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:17.800]   That's poisoning. Yeah, who knew I mean who knew I get my point at my point of bringing it up is on one hand
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.880]   I give the tech industry some credit because we are having these conversations
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:27.640]   On the other hand, I also blame the tech industry for not having enough of these conversations early on
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:33.800]   Early enough, but I think that that we probably are a little bit ahead of where the industrial revolutionaries were
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.480]   In terms of thinking about this. I would like to think so anyway. Yeah, let's hope so
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.520]   Well, that was a good conversation. I did not expect to have thank you
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.440]   Uh, let's take a break and come back. Maybe we'll talk about the Mac next maybe not. I don't know
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.520]   Who knows anything could happen. That's the wild card. I'm gonna spin the wheel. We'll see what comes up
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:53.320]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at go to me. Here's a perfect example
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:58.360]   Perfect example of how technology changes how you do business. It used to be
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.280]   Everybody hated this. I remember even as recently as you know 20 years ago
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:05.880]   Having a meeting was such a disruption. It was the last thing you wanted to do
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.200]   It took you away from your work, but you do have to have meetings, right?
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.400]   You have to sit down in the same room and talk over things
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:18.680]   We have a rule after three emails make a phone call because it's not going to get any better with more emails
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:23.880]   You sometimes you need to cut the Gordian not and if you're a team that's distributed
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:29.320]   And this is another thing that's changed where teams are globally all over the world at you know different hours and different times
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:35.160]   Those meetings really are important go to meeting is the high tech solution of this and makes meetings fast
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:41.480]   Efficient they don't get in the way they do do what meetings do best, which is solve problems
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:46.760]   And if you're gonna have a meeting don't don't make a phone call don't do a phone conference with that is so
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.520]   1990s go with the tech leader use go to
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.480]   Meeting of course it starts with a conference bridge
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:58.520]   You can have a phone call a conference call very affordable, but let's say you say well, you know
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.880]   I'd love to show you the drawings of this planner. Maybe you'd like to see the the
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:05.960]   Elevations or maybe you want to see my PowerPoint presentation and what we can do for you
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.600]   Then you fire up the screen sharing suddenly you're both on the same page. You're looking at the screen
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.760]   Maybe then you say i'd like to see your expression while you look at these drawings
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:24.200]   Fire up the crystal clear hd video. It's like meeting in person no matter where everybody is without all the travel costs without the consuming time consuming
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.840]   Getting together in the same room whether it's a sales demo a presentation
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.120]   Collaborative or ad hoc meeting go to meeting makes every meeting count efficient fast affordable
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:40.840]   And in fact nine out of ten go to meeting and users agree they close deals more than 20 percent faster
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:47.720]   That's what this is all about don't phone it and use go to meeting you could try it free right now go to meeting.com
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.960]   Go to go to meeting.com click the orange button says try it free
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.880]   You got to try this you got to use this it is a lifesaver
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:00.600]   It's a perfect example of how we've gone from we used to be very expensive to have a conference call
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.960]   I would sit there in a conference call think about the the clock ticking
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:10.600]   Now it's effectively flat rate fee free go to meeting dot com you to try
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:18.120]   Today and tomsen from the register dot co dot uk's you've been so great coming here and and being a part of our shows so much in the last
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:22.760]   Few months we really almost see it's really it's it's good fun. You get to chat about technology with people that know about it
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.400]   What's wrong with that? You give us kind of a posh feeling
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.080]   which
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.000]   Also, Jason's also from six colors dot com and the incomparable
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.560]   Hello and Larry maggot from cbs radio actually I was thinking about
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.280]   London the other day clarages
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:44.040]   Hotel we stayed there when we were in London very posh place right if the queen wants to stay in a hotel
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.400]   I don't know why she would that's where she would she's got it. She's got her own place in London
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:51.240]   700 rooms or so
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:56.040]   But if she did she'd stay at clarages. Well apparently this is what johnny i was up to these days
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:59.960]   Yeah, I really think johnny does not make much time in kupertino anymore
[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:06.840]   I really feel like he's kind of I don't know we you know john grouper said this week that some little birdie said that johnny's still pretty engaged with product stuff
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.360]   Well, that's and that's an answer to this question of what the hell is he doing because again
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.280]   He and I talked about it on his podcast and and people wrote articles saying oh my god
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:19.000]   Pundit speculate that johnny i was not doing anything which is not really much of a story but
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:24.280]   Here's what he's doing. He's putting trees in a room. Here's this is clarages lobby
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.320]   Which I remember very well and it's beautiful beautiful hotel
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:32.680]   He is created with mark nousam his partner another one a brilliant designer very famous designer. Yeah a
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:39.640]   Installation for christmas. It's the clarages christmas tree for this year. Uh, no no lights on these birches
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.200]   Um, let me see if I can find some more pictures of it. Is he doing a pretentious video about it?
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:48.520]   This is the most christmasy christmas tree i've ever done
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:52.120]   I am sorry. I don't know what little birds
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:55.400]   I don't know what little birds john no
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.840]   But
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.840]   I've my here's my take on this
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   Said to be connected to product design as ever. Here's my take on this johnny
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.640]   Was all in on the watch
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:14.440]   johnny said this is my thing the watch did not take off it is not apple's next big product
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:18.360]   It's okay. It's sold a few million. It's not like it's a flop
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.640]   But it's not changing the world no and johnny said well, uh, that's fine
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:27.640]   I'm gonna go. I've got some cars to design or something and uh
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.480]   And they've they've backed away from that now. Yeah, i'm not even doing that
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:36.840]   McLaren did say that they've been in early stage conversations, but then but i would apple buy
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:42.200]   The most expensive they make a hundred of anything right the f1 there was a hundred
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.840]   Why would they buy an eclairin?
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.080]   That's kooky like people maybe that's johnny. No, that's johnny. I'm telling you johnny call them up
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:52.680]   Said if we were to buy you how much would it that's all
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:55.320]   I and then apple
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:00.760]   According to rumor, this apple's never admitted this but uh, I think good sources say apple has
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.840]   Moved most of the airport staff over to apple tv
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:10.040]   Yeah, I hadn't heard the yeah, I don't know about the details exactly seems unlikely. You're gonna see a new airport
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:15.320]   Yeah, they've got a strategy for some of that stuff. It's not gonna be making their own wifi routers
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.160]   No, why should they why I agree? Why should they why should they other people are doing it?
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.640]   Uh, this is a when they start in
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:28.280]   Yeah, right. Yeah, and his sources are an act. I think bark is pretty accurate. Yeah, uh apple has basically implied
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:34.040]   They're not gonna make any more displays go by the lg. They told niele patel. We're out of the yeah, we're not gonna be displaced
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.640]   um
[01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.640]   It's pretty clear apple
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.040]   Doesn't have a lot of heart in the mac pro
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.240]   I don't know if that's entirely clear
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.240]   I mean
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:49.400]   Mentioned so I yeah, there's some theories here. I've been mentioning earlier about communities in the apple community
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:54.040]   There is still a very strong apple community because I've heard all of their frustrations about the mac pro
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:01.240]   Couple of theories about that just really quickly one of them is that maybe apple's bet on packing the mac pro three years ago
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.360]   The trashcan model full of gpu's they got they realized was not actually what they needed to do
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:11.560]   There are some rumors that perhaps they're rethinking like they basically decided that's not gonna work
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.560]   We need a new design also
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.040]   There is a prevailing theory among apple
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:22.600]   Criminologists that apple decided to skip an intel chip generation because they thought they could get away with it and use their time elsewhere
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.520]   And then intel delayed their chip generations and they got out of sync and now they're kind of stuck
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:31.480]   And that is I want to say i'm not blaming intel intel does what it does apple's the one that decided
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.880]   theoretically to get away with skipping a generation and now it has bitten them
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.920]   But I think that I think that those are the stories there. I think apple
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.920]   I mean the mac you know what it has shows that they are investing energy in the mac
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.920]   I'm gonna argue with you in that
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:51.160]   But let me say that actually skipping the intel generations has not hurt them a wit. I think the intel chip
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.120]   Uh the zon inside the mac pro is fine
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.520]   Especially if you got an eight core or 12 core you've got plenty of horsepower in there
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.960]   But by by soldering in stuff
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   The only upgradeable part of the mac pro is the memory you can't change that gpu a three-year-old gpu
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:15.240]   You might as well just throw it out it feels to me like that product missed the idea of why people buy high-end products like that
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.080]   And this is this is my overriding concern
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.920]   So I I we can get into it
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.160]   I think a lot of the concerns about what apple is doing now are a little bit hysterical
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.320]   But I will say this if steve jobs likened computers in the future to trucks
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.840]   And smartphones and tablets to cars which he did a while ago. Yes that they're specialized
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.640]   They're going to become over time more specialized devices for work
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.640]   I'm not sure sometimes when I look at apples mac strategy that i'm seeing any trucks
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.080]   Right and if there was ever to be a truck the mac pro you would think would be a truck
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.360]   And yet it got sort of like they took out the bed
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.840]   You know they took out and they replaced it with some more seating. It's like I get
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:59.240]   That's when I wonder about what's up with apple is do they I know I believe they're committed to the mac
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.840]   But are they thinking of the mac using the same terms that they use for ios because I don't think that's what the mac is for
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.080]   Well, I think what apple said is the writing is on the wall ios is the future
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.000]   We will continue to make the mac for a few more years because there's demand for it
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.040]   But we're not going to put a lot of resources. I think they're going to make the mac for a long time
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.280]   But the i don't think so the mac is not it's a legacy product for them unlike microsoft
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.600]   Has a touch based
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.920]   Exactly so the mac's entire existence is about creating something familiar
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:33.640]   Format users to keep using not about like transforming it into something new and incidentally you could make the same argument for microsoft
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:40.200]   They recognize we're in a post-pc era. They're moving most of their business to cloud services. They make a pc
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.840]   You know because there's still a market for it. They ain't much of a market. Go ahead larry. I'm sorry
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.880]   Well, no the innovation. I mean this is this is one of many
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:53.320]   Really good windows machines that came out this year. Is that a yoga pack the spectrum? It's like the yoga
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   It's but the same idea you can make it although I never do this except for on television
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.840]   I've never used it to the tablet
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.400]   But but the point is that you know apple puts a little a little strip right here and calls it
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.440]   What do they call their touch bar? You know microsoft gives you an entire screen. I mean yeah
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.720]   I don't know. I just don't see I I went to the apple announcement for the macbook pro announcement
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.120]   And I actually went there. I you know
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.640]   Show and tell
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:23.320]   Here's my my macbook air which has been my workhorse computer for years that hasn't been redesigned in what seven years or something
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.760]   I was actually hoping they would show me a machine that I wanted to go out and spend my own money on
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:33.080]   And they show and I don't I like the back pro. It's not a bad computer
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.480]   But I'm not going to spend 1,800 on one
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.200]   I don't think you get that much value for your money when you consider that there are a ton
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.400]   Of great windows laptops out there for under a thousand dollars that compete very nicely
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.120]   Against their 1,800 mac pro in terms of where I care about as a user
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.880]   And and I just I would I felt almost betrayed. I felt oh my god
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.960]   I'm I'm gonna have to leave the fold my next computer is not going to be a mac
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:04.360]   And I had fully intended to buy a new mac just like I have almost every year for the past four or five years
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:11.240]   Yeah, I'd say we watched the launch announcement because the register is barred from apple events, but really oh, yeah, we're on that
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:16.760]   But you know we um we watched the presentation and it was just like
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.080]   Seriously, under spec overpriced for what it is
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:26.440]   Other is the marketing strategy just by this like salivating dogs that you are or
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.480]   It's almost feels like apples laughing in a snap. Yeah, I hate to say this
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:37.240]   I'm a huge mac fan and I would bar far rather run mac OS than windows 10 given the choice
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.240]   I really would but at the point at the price point there and by the way
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.960]   Now having used this for 10 days
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.120]   The touch bar is the worst kind of Jim krakery ever
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:55.160]   Not useful this thing is annoying. I keep hitting it by accident. I finally had to take serie off of it
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:02.040]   Eventually, I'm gonna disable the whole thing because it it doesn't it's it's un it's an unpredictable
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:07.000]   Device where the function keys used to be if you're a touch-typer you're never looking down there
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.800]   Yeah, I disagree
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:14.520]   I I'm a touch-typer and I don't memorize where each F number is I always looked down when I when I press the F key row
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:20.040]   So I think I think swapping it out for the touch bar is perfectly reasonable actually you don't hit it by accident all the time
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:24.200]   I hit the because the backspace is right below series. I hit the edges
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.680]   Yeah, well, I took serie off immediately for many reasons
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.400]   But the edges it took me about a day to realize I needed not to overreach
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.120]   But otherwise actually I found it a lot of I think I think defending which
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:41.800]   Which there are certain apps for which the touch bar makes a lot of sense and there are apps where it doesn't and the question is
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.800]   Where do we go from here if there's more innovation?
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:49.400]   I really enjoyed like even something as basic as the calculator puts all their functions on that strip
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.360]   And you know what this is apples philosophy is there's two perpendicular surfaces. You've got your keyboard
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:07:00.200]   Touchpad touch bar and trackpad on one surface. That's where you put your hands and then the screen is up there
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.240]   And if you want to touch the screen, they aren't gonna sell you
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:08.520]   I can live without a shell unit. I even use windows 10 with that a touch screen often
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.560]   I use Linux. There's no touch screen on this. That's fine
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.960]   but the touch bar to me
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:19.560]   Is like chrome it's like fins on a Cadillac. It is a completely useless
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:25.560]   Feature that looks great seems on the surface great and now having used it for 10 days
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.840]   I
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:32.200]   Absolutely. In fact, my recommendation is buy if you're gonna need a mac pro and macbook pro many of you do
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.600]   Buy the macbook pro without the touch bar saviors
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:41.400]   The one we call the macbook escape seems to be its nickname now in the apple because it hasn't escaped because it hasn't escaped yet
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.080]   I didn't I mean I use the escape key and there is still an escape key on the touch bar
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:50.440]   But I just I feel like the touch bar. It was an interesting idea now having used it
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:57.720]   I can't say I think that there's any value to it. I've got to I'm just amazed that apple is still not getting involved with touch screens
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.120]   Because oh I was very involved with
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:05.320]   I mean not on the on the actual macbook now. I will I will say touch ID is great
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:09.400]   It's a shame that you have to get a touch bar to get touch ID
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.440]   PCs have had fingerprint readers for maybe a decade. Yep
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.120]   So it's not like I can't buy a computer in fact my microsoft
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.280]   Surface book
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.280]   Recognizes my face and unlocks
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:29.160]   My my hp does too, but it this is it about half the time surface book is is wonderful
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:35.240]   You and the key is you need to have the the special camera that they call it a hello camera
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.760]   Hello camera
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:41.000]   And if you have that and it works quite well on the surface book it's almost 100%
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.480]   And it's very quick
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:50.680]   So I don't I do think the touch ID is nice because when you make a purchase or a lot of times where you would have to enter your password
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.440]   You can use the touch ID that is a nice feature. That's taken from the iPhone
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.120]   And in fact is it I think a little bit like an iPhone. It's a separate CPU
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.000]   And I used to have a thinkpad with a fingerprint reader. It's you say it's an old not decade. It's just
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.560]   I just so adam angst look this guy's been writing about apple longer than even you and I have
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.600]   Ted bits is one of the oldest apple newsletter ever
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.520]   He says the problem is it's an apple's dna to focus on
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   One product even though it employs 115,000 people it's the most valuable company in the world
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:29.400]   Apple still thinks like a one platform company and now it's all about ios and everything apple does
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.840]   Is designed to serve the single goal of selling more iPhones
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.240]   He says and iPads I wouldn't even include iPad in that list dying market
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.160]   That's a dying market too
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.680]   And uh, so as many have pointed out we've said on this show
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:48.280]   I think the mac lives on it's too small a market for apple to care about at this point
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.440]   And it lives on almost with because of a momentum if nothing else
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.320]   Let's 13% of its business. Yeah, the minute you can get xcode on a ipad pro
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.560]   I think apple say goodbye to the mac and I think that'll be a very sad day. You see
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.360]   Well the ipad pro is a good example. I mean frack the ipad pro at a laptop
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.760]   Running ios that that's really what it is
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.400]   And so when you say to that we'll have a touch screen
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.760]   Mine is a file system you can access minus the ability to multi-task very well
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.760]   That's already changing pretty fast and I would imagine we'll see them
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.000]   Think i'll put a file system in ios
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.440]   There basically already is because i cla although i cla really janky
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.160]   You can really janky multi window display
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.200]   It's not
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.760]   It was the first take on it. I imagine that we'll see that all the rumors are that that next year
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.640]   That's gonna be a new well as soon as that is then you know new updates for the ipad features
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.600]   But I don't think the mac's gonna go away because I think it's got value to them
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:46.840]   I I actually am surprised that people are reacting to the new macbook pro and saying it's it's an example of how apple
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.320]   Doesn't care about the mac because if apple didn't care about the mac
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.600]   They would not have made the touch bar the touch to build in this new thing that it's weird
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.160]   It's like an apple watch stretched out over there. It's got a separate processor of its own
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:06.120]   It is a lot of engineering work went into that that I think now we can argue about whether their view of the mac is misguided
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:11.320]   Whether they're leaving their customers out out in the cold because their prices are are creeping up
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.040]   Essentially for the same products as the as the previous generation
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.480]   I think there are a lot of good arguments there
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.040]   But i'm not seeing the apple doesn't care about the mac
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.480]   Since the macbook pro is clear evidence that they are inventing weird things and sticking them into a new
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.120]   In you know one of their most important models
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.720]   What was that for evidence?
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.560]   Yeah, my evidence why would they have engineered the touch bar if they didn't care about the mac
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.880]   Because it's a very profitable way to sell a whole new generation of macbook pros without actually
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.120]   In a
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.200]   Let me tell you and I think my evidence my counter evidence is the mac pro
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.680]   Do you think the touch bar is the thing that was going to sell new macbook
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.000]   I think it did a three year revision. I think it did
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.560]   Because it's old eddy it's cool
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.560]   Leo do you remember the apple two forever
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.280]   Conferences I have brought this up as well
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.600]   Here before apple killed the apple two and had an apple two forever conference exactly forever
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.560]   Well
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.280]   A year apple told me on the in uh 20
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.560]   2014 that the mac goes on forever when it was the 30th anniversary of the mac
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:09.800]   So there you go. You can put that in the ground and so it's do
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.840]   Well, yeah, I mean there's a question
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.920]   Is there a reason not to buy the touch bar list macbook pro?
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.440]   I mean you're gonna save
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:25.400]   Three or four hundred bucks. I'd say the only reason is that the touch bar 13 inch macbook pro has a faster processor and the touch bar
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.600]   And it also has gpu that you can't get on touch id sensor
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:35.320]   And that's for three hundred dollars and quite honestly to build to order a mac with a faster processors already going to run you two 250
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:35.640]   Good point
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.520]   So at that point, you know, if if you've got the money to spend I think the touch bar model unless you hate the touch bar
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:45.160]   And would like really could disable it. I mean you can literally there's a switch that makes you function keys
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:50.760]   Yeah, exactly right. Um, I think that you know if you're in the market for that that it's actually a better deal
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.560]   But just because apple's gonna upsell you on that processor anyway one thing apple did right
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.280]   Which is the type seaports and I know they're getting a lot of
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.320]   Heat for dongle dongle mania, but that is an open standard
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:10.200]   Do you realize that you couldn't make a charger for mac laptops until now you can and I use I use an hp charger on it
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.720]   I use a a chrome book pixel charger on it
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.760]   I I have type c everywhere. So that's a good thing. I'm happy about that. Go ahead
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.120]   I'm sure well, I wish they had concluded one type a port the way
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.320]   Dongle handy
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:31.960]   This is this is a crux point because my wife is a mac user and you know, we we come we have a mixed marriage
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:38.120]   Um, and she wants to update her mac book when the macbook pro came out. She was like great. Okay, and she looks dead
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.480]   She's like so basically I'm gonna have to replace all my usb
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:48.200]   Devices to work with this. I'm not getting enough ports in the first place the speck on this is very very poor
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.840]   Then why should she's now looking at a piece?
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.200]   She starts in those four four ports isn't enough for her. She's looking at the escape model. No, she's looking at the escape
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:01.480]   No, she wants to escape key, but she's not getting a window. She's not going. She's not leaving apple yet
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.480]   Uh, well what she's actually gonna do is buy a refurbished macbook
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.280]   2012 macbook and go that
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:14.120]   I think that's it by the way a worthy thing about now that that my 2012 my 2012 macbook pro is fine
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:21.880]   And even the mac pro is fine. I've got a 2012. I think macbook air. Yeah, like the one that Larry showed
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:28.120]   Is I built it up with an i7. It's great. It's still great. Yeah. Yeah. No, I still I still
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:35.000]   You've it a lot but for people who want a power tool who want the latest gpu's who want the fastest processors
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.720]   Who want more than 16 gigs of ram there is an alternative. It's just not in kupertina
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:43.400]   Yeah, if you want to use mac OS, this is what this is what you got for for right now anyway
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:48.120]   Um, it'll be interesting to see how apple really deals with this reaction. They're playing it cool right now
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:51.480]   Although they did give everybody like a dongle coupon, which is weird
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:15:00.120]   I I do wonder if next year we'll see a revision perhaps more timely than the last just to address some of these points
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.120]   Right. I'll give apple credit for one thing
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.560]   I think they're more honest on their battery specs and then they're competition
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:11.720]   I can't believe how this this hp claims to get a lot of battery life. Hey nowhere near
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:15.320]   You know, I'm lucky to get six my favorite computer home at home is an hp
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:18.840]   It's the hp specter 13 t the copper one with really thin
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:24.280]   But I don't run windows on it because i'm not a real fan of windows 10 especially with what microsoft has done lately
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:29.160]   With they've got ads in it. They they coerced everybody into upgrading
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:35.240]   They have a real problem in some technologies particularly the update technology just being broken
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.720]   Um, however, it runs linnox beautifully. It's a really nice linnox
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:43.080]   You can run with it in an old you can you use an old laptop and run linnox?
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.480]   No, but why not have look that people always say that to me
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.600]   Why would you use?
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.000]   I would you have such a powerful machine to run linnox? Why not? I it's an operating system
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:57.320]   Why wouldn't I want an i7 and as much ram as possible? Why not? I'm not I don't consider linnox my trash computer
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.480]   If that's my main computer, this is a i7 with a
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.440]   Nvidia 980 m
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.200]   GPU a 17 inch screen and then m dot two and vme
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:16.200]   Uh, s s super fast ssd. Why not right? Yeah, having a buy you buy windows great on anything
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:20.040]   See in order the buy a machine it pretty much has to have windows on it, right?
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.080]   So you just well not this one I got from a linnox integrator
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.360]   So no, okay, but the hp. Yeah, I have it's I have a license for windows 10 to run on it
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.440]   You know what I here's the real debate tomorrow as I mentioned. I'm getting the new
[01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:36.520]   The new all-in-one from microsoft the yes the yes
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.400]   I can never remember the surface studio. I don't know why i was doing it. You won't be able to run linnox?
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.560]   How long am I oh, yeah, of course. I will I won't be able to well, but you won't have but you won't have access to every will
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.120]   The knob
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.440]   Maybe a well, I don't even know this knob works on linnox. I don't know why I maybe it will so
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:17:01.640]   That's the question. How long do I can I survive windows 10? I'm not I'm not dead set against windows 10. It's not a bad
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:05.560]   It's it's increasingly grabby and it's increasingly
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.440]   I find it increasingly intrusive as well
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:14.920]   I'm I'm reversing back to windows 7 because I just I've tried windows 10. I hate getting adverts pushed at me
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.000]   Hate like getting little message messages say edgewood work much better
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.920]   As a house to help I know Apple does that too by the way, it says you should really be trying safari when I try to switch
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:28.280]   He's telling me I should make it a chrome chrome
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:34.280]   Google does it too don't they have our business Google and safari it says would you like to download chrome so it happens
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.280]   I just something we noted earlier is the devices on this
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:45.240]   Table not one of them is running Mac OS or windows and it's funny how we ended up here, but and two out of three are touch
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.400]   Yeah, and I had I had the realization
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   not too long ago that
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.000]   I'm not sure I work every day at a retina at a 5k iMac and I love it
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.080]   but um
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:02.040]   I'm not sure after this macbook air. I'm not sure I'm ever going to buy another mac laptop because if apples
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:09.320]   Multitasking and other features on iOS keep improving. I would honestly much rather travel with just the ipad pro
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.360]   You just made my case for me. That's what's happening
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.480]   Yeah, yeah, this is how the world is changing right? Yeah, I don't play apple for that
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.360]   I don't I don't think apple's not going to make the mac anymore
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.840]   But this is why apple is prioritizing like you go to the ipad pro
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:30.760]   iOS is the growth operating system for apple right and the mac is not and microsoft has to split the difference
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.800]   Because microsoft doesn't have to it's got windows and so it needs to sort of stuff everything in windows
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.600]   And that's exactly right. That's just how it has to be and apples
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.080]   You know so the mac is in this weird position where it's like that
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.160]   But I think it's I think it's natural and you know
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:49.160]   I think it would be okay if the mac sort of stays what it is because the people who love it love it for what it is
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:54.440]   Not for what it, you know might be if apple reinvented it. They don't want to be your pro user
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.000]   This is I mean the the macbook pro
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.720]   To my mind was always this was what the creatives used, you know, this is what the people
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:03.800]   I think it was amazing the stuff you to me
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.360]   It was just for anybody who is willing to spend a little extra to have the fastest
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.200]   Nicest machine now a lot of that was creative pros
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.040]   But it could have been a I don't think a writer is particularly demanding on a computer
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:20.680]   But uh, and I wasn't demanding I could I mean yeah, maybe I do a little video editing
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:22.440]   But I'm not designing rocket ship
[01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:25.960]   But I was willing to spend a little bit more to have a beautiful industrial design
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.600]   To have an a beautiful operating system and to have that power and you know what most of the time
[01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:33.400]   I'm on the mac. I'm in the command line. So I don't need any of that
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:36.600]   So that's who I think the market for the mac is
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.800]   is
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:40.680]   The same as the market for our Mercedes or a BMW
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.080]   I was always john groover's argument is the mac is for people who want things to be a little bit nicer and are
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.440]   willing to pay for it to be nicer
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.880]   You can't say that everybody buys a BMW is a pro driver
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.400]   I know guys. So I have to I'm up here on the freeway. No
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:59.080]   I have I have two max and my current fleet of machines that I use every day
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:05.320]   And I've got this new hp windows machine and I find myself gravitating towards the windows machine
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:08.440]   Because I like it better and I didn't expect that to happen
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:12.280]   But but I'm about to go on a trip tomorrow and I'll go and bring one laptop with me
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.160]   That's the test. What are you doing?
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.360]   And it's probably going to be the hp
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:20.360]   I mean, I'm not 100 percent happy with it. I for example, the the uh the track pad moves too quickly
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.720]   I can't slow it down enough
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:27.160]   There there are a few things like all of a sudden for no apparent reasons my my my screen goes away
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:27.960]   I mean just
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.240]   Yeah, one could have windows larry you'll get uh, you'll see
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.920]   I don't know whether it's user error or
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.960]   Bad operating original error when you get using that windows 10 update that crashes your machine
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:46.600]   Well, actually it's funny. They I'm avoiding that. I'm not doing that next update. Oh, you can't avoid it for too long
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:51.720]   They force it don't force the time you throw it. I know that no there are and the other thing is that my machine still knew
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.320]   I've only had in a few weeks
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.240]   I know what happens after a year or two of the windows machine they grind to a halt
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.320]   You get that windows crud
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:02.120]   And that doesn't seem to happen on max at least not as much
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:09.080]   And I don't know if they fix that with windows 10, but I've never had a windows machine that I didn't have to reformat at least every six to nine months
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:14.040]   You know ultimately I think this is really a big part of the success of the iPad
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.840]   Is that every desktop operating system linux mac or windows
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:21.480]   ultimately
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.480]   frustrates and annoys
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.760]   That they're too complex they're too general purpose
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:31.880]   And they're too open to security flaws to crashes because of updates and installs
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.840]   And that you don't have those problems on a chrome book. You don't have those problems on iOS
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.120]   Yeah, once we're used to having a smartphone in our pocket
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.520]   First off it makes the need for
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.560]   mobile computing this is quite a lot different use more than any other exactly right
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:51.400]   And it changes your expectations of your relationship with those devices
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.640]   No, I used to run home to check my email, right?
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.400]   Or you get to your hotel room set up your laptop chicken
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.560]   Practically cyber Monday. I'm gonna wait till work to do all my shopping
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.960]   Exactly because the back then
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:09.880]   For the internet. Yeah, I mean still true here because we have 20 gigabit
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:15.160]   You see I'm gonna get on with some stuff. Yeah, I mean I use a Chromebook as my sort of non work
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.000]   My work PC is a is a thinkpad because the keypad that's what you write us
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.200]   Yeah, because the keyboard on the thinkpad is just super great
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.040]   But for the day for carrying stuff around
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.480]   I wasn't expecting to like the Chromebook as much as I was because when it first came out without an internet connection
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.080]   It was just a very expensive doorstop, but they've improved on it
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.520]   And now it's a perfectly good carry around and write operation and adding in great apps is an interesting shift
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.680]   Yeah, that's gonna make that's gonna be interesting
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.200]   But I do worry about the security side
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.600]   I have to say that in some ways is the knife and the
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:51.000]   The stake through the heart for me with the macbook is their decision to go with a pretty bad keyboard
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:56.440]   I can live with it that you but I don't want to have to just live with my keyboard
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:00.280]   That's that's exactly my take on if people say Jason. I know you care about keyboards
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:07.000]   What do you think about this? And the answer is can I type 100% my typing speed on it? Sure. Do I enjoy it? No? Yeah
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.440]   That's a rub that's surprising from a company that spends so much attention to human factors
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:19.720]   And they built a a beautiful I've actually got it here beautiful external keyboard after they released the macbook called the magic keyboard
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.720]   It feels great and this is not what's in the macbook pro instead
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.040]   It's a version of what was in the macbook. I'll be improved a little bit along this new
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:34.280]   Keyboard is gonna last yeah until they replace it with one that is a matter fly keys and a touch bar
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.480]   That's inevitable. I think so
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:41.000]   Yeah, and I'm with you. I mean I I don't use my think pet every day
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.920]   But once in a while I'll go back to it and I always say oh wow I love this keyboard
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:48.520]   Yeah, it's it's IBM's design right IBM designed a your gentleman
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.040]   Yeah, and they are were incredibly good keyboard builders
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:56.440]   It's put me in a very awkward position because my laptop is now six years old the battery is
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:01.160]   Is on it is new enough. Yeah, but they changed the keyboard. Oh have they yeah, they're not good
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.640]   The old star this was the think bad
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.360]   Yeah, this was the very last of the old style keyboards
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.320]   So what i'm gonna have to do is rip and replace the battery and the hard drive just to keep the form factor
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.480]   Do you like the rubber eraser the little thing that
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:22.040]   Right the magic nipple. Oh no, it's fantastic. No, but it's just um I cannot use it accurately. It's too
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.200]   I used to love it. Some people love it. Yeah
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:30.040]   Remember it wasn't until about two years ago when windows track pads were an absolutely horrible
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.640]   Yes, right every trackpad on a windows machine was aptly dreadful
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.800]   Until about two years ago and now they've gotten it to the point where they're not they're not horrible anymore
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.760]   That's you know what the windows has never done well with mice
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:46.600]   Historically and and apples always known how to do a mouse known how to do a trackpad
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:53.720]   This is yeah, they ultimately what makes me sad about this transition is there was a company that made really great
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:00.440]   Hardware and just like the thinkpad keyboard times change. I'm an old man. I don't want companies to change
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:06.200]   Uh, but I think it's inevitable and you think you have IBM. I mean, they made great hardware back in the day
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.840]   Yeah, yeah, I actually went out and bought a clickety
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:15.240]   Keyboard with cherry switches from a das keyboard. I've got a couple. It's nice. Yeah, the product
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.520]   No, I was gonna say one of the problems everyone of the office wants to strangle you
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.760]   I can only use it at home is like Dan with the door close because it's the noisiest damn thing
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:27.800]   But this is one of the funny things about uh living in this mobile life is if you've got if you buy a laptop
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:30.920]   You have to take the keyboard that the vendor gives you right?
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.520]   Yes, pretty great and that's the challenge with apple making a decision like that is
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.680]   It's great that they've got this opinionated take and they want it to be thinner and lighter, but you know
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.480]   It means that if you don't like their keyboard then you're just gonna be unhappy because you can't get another keyboard for it
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:48.040]   Yeah, you can't start it or something but like really be serious
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.880]   You'll be using their key what laptop has the best keyboard think about the the old thing about modern new
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.280]   Oh
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.840]   That's tricky start gaming. They're fairly game a laptop with mechanical keys. That's good. Yeah
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:04.040]   Keyboards actually a good point
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.480]   But they're very similar this chicklet. Oh, they're not quite chicklet style
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.200]   But this like like the Mac book like the Mac era. There's very short flat not much travel
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:15.880]   You know and they the other ones may be a different color
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.600]   But that seems to be the prevailing keyboard these day that i've had i've had to get used to it
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.480]   But i'm not happy about it. So I recommend uh, you know if you use an iPad you get to buy an external keyboard true
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.040]   Razor makes one with mechanical switches
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.040]   There's actually a nice little setup you've got here. It reminds me a lot of the surface
[01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:36.360]   Got my little little stand. This is a fold-out stand, but they also make ones with hinges and yeah
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.680]   Who makes the case? Uh, well, okay. So i've been using this for like six months now
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.960]   Um, the guys at studio neat made this and i i'm not supposed to pre-announce it
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.080]   I think it will be a product very soon is what i'm saying. So check out studio neat.com six months
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.920]   They've been working on this they yeah, i've been i've been beta testing it for them. It's pretty great
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.800]   It works with the magic keyboard that's gonna say the surface keyboard
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:03.560]   I was quite they they they've got when they slunched the surface originally they had the two key boards keyboard, huh?
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.880]   Yeah, the one of them was the one way you've actually got a so you don't have traveling keys
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:12.520]   That was a dog, but the actual traveling keys for the surface that wouldn't sound pretty well
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:18.760]   I might buy this look at this a wooden dock. Oh, they make great stuff. It holds your iphone and apple watch with little fuzzies
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.960]   Little fuzzies. Wow
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:26.760]   They they built a lot of fun. Yeah, they make the glyph right. Yeah, though. I have the glyph
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:33.320]   Stylus and they make a bunch of great stuff. Okay, so maybe we'll take a break and come back and talk about buying crap
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:36.520]   Because it is the holiday season. Yeah
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:44.760]   And uh, let's uh, let's oh tom careheart and dan provost. I know those guys those guys those are the guys those are the guys

[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:53.160]   And i'm thinking this used to be a podcast. It looks like a freaking tv station

[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.680]   Yeah, I could I would not know what to do with that. I used to do the whole thing. I'd edit it
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.880]   I put it out be careful. Jason it can get out of control
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.520]   Yeah, it's already out of control leo people ask me how many podcasts I do know and I have no answer for them
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:11.320]   Because I can't count that. Oh, I got to that point years ago

[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:40.360]   I like going to i-hop. We had some visitors last
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:46.680]   Yesterday visiting from australia. I said, what are you doing next? We're going to i-hop. We don't have them in australia
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:52.520]   We have an international house of pancakes next door the problem least that I have is we worked hard all day
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.240]   It's the end of the day. The last thing you want to do
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:00.120]   Is plan a meal shop for a meal then go home and cook the meal and you're eating at 9 p.m
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.360]   That's why you end up at i-hop
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:08.040]   And when you get sick of i-hop right across the street, there's an applebee's and there's a burger king around the corner
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:12.360]   You don't want to eat like that once in a while get yourself a blue apron box
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.880]   Then you don't have to think about it. You don't have to plan it. You just go home in half an hour to 45 minutes later
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:25.560]   You're eating a meal the house is filled with amazing aromas your loved ones are coming around you saying what can what is what's for dinner?

[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:34.120]   Some over we'll have blue apron tonight. I actually bought that at Costco. They were selling it at Costco a couple weeks ago
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.880]   I haven't or I haven't ordered it yet. Oh, I see like a little yeah
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:41.960]   I think I forgot my wallet open. It's blue. Yeah, you know
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:47.240]   Now I got the wine because as you're going out they have things like that and then at our Costco
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:51.240]   I don't know if this is your Costco. They also sell coffins here. It is right. What you see
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:56.440]   Yeah, they sell coffins right am I making this up? Yeah, there you go. So they say I bought that
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.000]   Yeah, so then you know, I have to sign on did you get a coffin too while you ran it?
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.360]   Well, if I eat enough crap, but this is not junk food
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.600]   Well, that's funny because the coffins are right across
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:10.600]   from the Costco hot dogs and
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:18.360]   Two dollars how just get a hot dog and roll around and hot dog how much what could be in that or a and then there's the coffin right there
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.760]   They're looking at
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.560]   It's the strangest it's actually not at Costco. It's a price club. No, what is it?
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:32.040]   It's a cost because it's okay price club is back in the 90s too. They don't have price clubs anymore. What other Costco?
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.280]   Costco bought them out. What
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.760]   I love price club. It was great
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:47.160]   Uh, what were we gonna talk? Oh black Friday. Yes, uh, you know the stats are in I don't know why but apparently a dobe keeps track of all of this
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:52.040]   And this was a Thursday and Friday were an amazing
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.920]   uh record-breaking
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.760]   Weekend this is the final numbers from black friday
[01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:06.120]   Online sales grew 21 percent year over year three and a third billion dollars
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:10.840]   3 billion 340 million dollars, but here's the thing I find most interesting
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:13.720]   not ipad but phone
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:20.120]   Accounted for a third of that 1.2 billion dollars and that was an increase of 33 percent over last year
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:24.840]   People are doing their holiday shopping on their phones. Yeah, makes sense
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.080]   So I mean you've seen the videos of what it's like on black Friday. You know people getting trampled
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.680]   We had somebody getting why would you even bother doing that you can do it all online?
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.880]   And then you you sort of you run in there you elbow you way past the crowds and you find they haven't got the thing that you want
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.840]   So why not just do it online? It's it makes perfectly lot. I even buy my clothes online
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:48.120]   In fact, what I do when I travel a lot of times it actually is cheaper for me to buy a pair of slacks on
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.520]   Amazon have a delivered to my hotel
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:53.240]   Then it is to have my clothes cleaned at the hotel
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:59.880]   So sometimes I'll order clothing. Oh wait, I'm traveling. Wow and this is why folks you will always have a job
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:05.160]   Larry doesn't even have his clothes cleaned. He just buys a new pair
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.640]   Unless your job is a hotel launderer
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:12.440]   At home I hope I do but if I'm gonna pay $30 to have a pair of dry cleaning done
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.480]   I'm actually on New York. I never thought of the economics of that, but you're absolutely
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.120]   Although in China I once had my clothes laundered in a beautiful Beijing hotel
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:27.800]   And the clothes came back wrapped as if they were brand new with bows and sisal, you know wrapping in the beautiful basket
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.200]   Like I'm not even close
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:34.040]   Yeah, that's what happens when labor is effectively free, right? Yeah, yeah
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.880]   That was an interesting stat also in karsen flash that up on the screen
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:41.880]   Almost all of the mobile sales 47 percent
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.600]   uh worse from uh
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:48.600]   Was I mean of the online sales was from smartphones 9 percent tablets
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:56.600]   So tablets were not a driving force in here. It was a lot of demographics on that like how many with those were young young people
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:02.920]   Shopping with their phones versus folks our age my theory is that once the phone got to five and a half inches
[01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.320]   You didn't need a tablet. Oh wait a second. So so phone the phone
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:10.840]   Orders were twice as much as a tablet. No, yes
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:12.840]   They're way way
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:17.560]   More than double the number of phones than tablets, right? Okay. I guess that's it
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:20.600]   I think that's pretty good showing for those old tablets there, huh?
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:23.320]   on friday
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:28.280]   Mobile visitors were 56 percent of the visits to retail sites not as purchases, but visits
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:32.840]   Sure 47 percent were from smartphones 9 percent were from tablets
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:36.840]   That's even that's almost five times more. Yeah, I mean half
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:41.640]   Absolutely, I bought stuff using the amazon app on my phone standing in the kitchen
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:46.520]   I do that all the time. Yeah, I literally my pizza cutter broke and I wore the echo right my pizza cutter broke
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:50.760]   And I was like uh time for a new pizza cutter and like two minutes later. It was on its way echo
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:57.160]   Pizza cutter. She said well you ordered a pizza cutter last year was this would you like that again? I say yes, that's it
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:02.200]   Hello, have you ever uh, euthy ameth on apple you're in a retail store
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.240]   That is not allowed
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:11.640]   Violation of the of the of the Torah I have you have violated you know the shopkeepers
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:14.200]   What is it the shopkeepers law the shop?
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:21.240]   You're it's considered an ethical violation. This goes back back pre-internet this goes back a thousand years
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.440]   That you shouldn't go in to a shop
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.520]   Find out all about a product and leave and go buy in somewhere cheaper
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:35.640]   So here's what I have done. I have actually shown the the sales clerk the online price and said can you come anywhere near it?
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.720]   You don't have to beat it. You're in that sphere
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:43.160]   Can you come close to it and and more often than not they've come closer? They've actually met it
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.880]   So, you know, that's one way to do it. I wouldn't do that if you know to save a few a couple of bucks
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.120]   But if it's a big purchase and it's like a hundred dollars cheaper online or something like that
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:57.000]   Uh, or whatever. I actually an ethical way to do it. So yeah, I mean that's
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.560]   Amazon selling this for a lot less would you kind of come close to that? Yeah, yeah, I could get I mean
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:07.160]   We had a photography shop just down the floor from our office and I like to patronize those guys
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.160]   I want to keep me
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:13.560]   You know and you could talk over different products and the specs for them and you'd buy from there
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:19.000]   But it got to the point where they were charging nearly double what you could get on low. Yeah, yes at that point
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.520]   You're kind of like you know, I like you guys but sure enough it's gonna have business, but you know your fault
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:29.320]   I do feel a little bit guilty a silicon valley there was one called hebal and shoot people and shook it
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:34.440]   Just close the bellow out. So just close. It's a tragedy. I hate but on the other hand
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.400]   I have to admit my last camera I bought online because it was easier and cheaper and faster
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:43.720]   And I got what I wanted so I I guess I'm part of the reason that they went out of business
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:47.160]   Uh anybody got some good black Friday deals
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:52.440]   I'll we we're talking about before the show that the amazon dot if you keep here. Yes talk about 39 bucks
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:57.560]   They they knew dot was already a lot cheaper is 50 bucks and now they produced another 10
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:01.800]   That's tomorrow. That's a cyber monday deal. I think but no way that was 38
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.000]   $9 today
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.240]   When I'm out of that Sunday. Yeah, or yesterday. Yeah, there's a going down. It can't be getting cheaper
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:10.040]   No, no, I mean that's got to be close to their cost. That's incredible
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.480]   That's an amazing deal
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.000]   They should give them away because I buy more stuff on amazon because of that
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.200]   Yeah, right before now have you compared it to the google home yet? I do if we in fact we have both in the kitchen
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:26.600]   Yeah, and what what's your sense? Google home is good if you want knowledge. So for instance, we did this the other day
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:27.400]   I said
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:30.040]   Uh, you saw that google ad for google home
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:32.040]   father reading
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.720]   Child story
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.280]   And the child says well mom always makes the whale noise
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:43.320]   So the dad says hey google make a whale noise and it does if you ask echo, which says I don't know what you're talking about
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:45.000]   Alexa
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]   make a whale noise
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.440]   I can't find the answer to the
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.040]   Yeah, she's just baffled. Yeah, it's right general information
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:59.640]   Google has its knowledge graph and that it's just like the google assistant here. I fact I can right I can duplicate the home
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:01.640]   I don't have a home right here, but I can ask
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.400]   Uh google assistant to do this make a whale noise
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:12.040]   According to N O A is national. That's not a good one. Let me just let me do it this way
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.080]   Oh, yeah, no, I don't stop
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.880]   What does a blue whale sound like?
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.320]   According to wick a no no no no no no no no what does a blue whale sound like?
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.760]   Here's a whale sound here we go
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.040]   Only took three tries good job. No because
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.200]   This is a bad environment because I cut it off each time because I was in a big hurry
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:38.760]   So if you get the words out, it'll do it right that's it. Is that a pixel you had there?
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:43.960]   This is the pixel so it's a sense the assistant's the same as the google home make a whale noise
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:51.400]   Are you doing it with Siri? No, I'm using I've got the check on no
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:56.840]   I think I have a turn down. I'm using pixel. It's it's not doing it. It doesn't like me make a whale noise
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.800]   We're trying no no it doesn't sounds like this
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:07.240]   You got the same one I did right? This is very this is compelling. This is not well get rollsy. I mean
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:10.680]   Right now somewhere in the pacification. There's a whale going what?
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.480]   Like what do you call my love? Anything with google home. You can't you can't even
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:24.040]   Oddly enough. I can't even get my google calendar to work with google home. Whereas echo does fine echo does a great job on that
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:30.360]   Yeah, echo can do all sorts of interesting things now thanks to it's it's been around for two years
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.600]   Yeah, and thanks to its many integrations. There are over 3 000
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.880]   Echo skills out now that is amazing. Yeah, I turn my bedroom lights on and off
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.040]   Every morning every night I turn my bedroom lights off with my voice through the echo
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:50.280]   We did on the radio show. I asked echo to beatbox and it goes boots and cats and boots and cats
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.680]   Which is not what I would call a good beatbox, but then watch I'll say
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:43:00.040]   Can you beatbox?
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.840]   My friend here can throw down some beats
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.520]   That's pretty good
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.200]   One i've heard one i've heard one electha
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.400]   Poodly a la port. Oh, I love that one
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:19.080]   Lea la port's an old has been used to be on radio. We don't know what happened to him at the 1998
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.840]   Oh my god. She's thinking leo leo is 100 years old
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:28.840]   error error. It's all coming from wikipedia. That's the problem. Yeah, it is coming if you modify and i'm not
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:35.000]   1956 in new york city new york the american technology. I know I know
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.840]   This is sorry. It's because i'm in wikipedia, right? Yeah, no, that's true, but it's something. It's yeah
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:43.240]   By the way, i'm gonna tell you uh
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.920]   Larry
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:50.280]   That anybody who uses the echo on the air has to not use the a word
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:57.080]   But you i've renamed all my all my echoes to echo that way I can test them without triggering people at home
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:00.040]   That's right because that's that's what we call the a hoy telephone problem
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.680]   Right where you don't want to say you need to say attention lady in the canister, please
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.400]   Just don't say the mention one of the things that I avoid when I do my radio segments occasionally
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.440]   It would actually work to have a like a siren in the background
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:18.200]   My radio segment but I think about people driving down the street and hearing my siren if that actually gets the law
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:24.680]   Um, no probably not a siren. However, I might be I know that since I work for clear channel
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:33.320]   Uh, I have to take a test. Yeah every few months that porn test. Yes, not the porn test the one the one on the eas
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.200]   emergency alert signals
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:40.920]   Because some dj in new orleans played the emergency tones
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:46.920]   On the air and got a fine from the fcc of more than a million dollars
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:50.440]   And clear channel doesn't ever want that to happen again
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:56.520]   So I periodically get tested now is it leo is it ever okay to play the eas signal
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:02.360]   Unless there's an actual emergency no ma'am. You would never do that. Would you no ma'am
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.960]   What would the fcc do if you did that they would find me ma'am?
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:12.600]   Okay, you could stay on the air see I I took the one where I had to learn the seven dirty words and not not say them on the air
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.960]   You don't learn them?
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.800]   Nah, I didn't have to learn them. Come on. Let's hear it larry
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:20.600]   On your show I could use it. Let's hear it. No, actually we we bleep those because we
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:24.520]   Want kids to be able to listen safely at home and me too and you too
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.080]   We don't want to burn your little your little ears and amazon is doing its best to improve
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:34.120]   reviews on amazon fake reviews are the bane of the internet just like fake news
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:37.880]   Which is worse fake news or fake reviews fate and well, they're both pretty
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:42.040]   Society fake news is worse, but if you're trying to buy something it's just
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.280]   Having to go through the reviews and so well
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.000]   They've done a certain number of reviews and they're paid to have the product yow cow trust that one
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.760]   But this one is obviously completely bollocks. Yeah, and you've got to work out, you know, it adds a whole new page
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:56.760]   It's bam. It's young. It really is
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:01.320]   So amazon has put a limit on customer reviews you can only do five a week
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:08.360]   Unless you're a verified purchase and that's clearly to block people who would say oh, this is a terrible product
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:11.080]   You should go over and buy this product instead on every page
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.240]   Things like that
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:18.200]   18 subscribers if you're an att subscriber you can actually send text messages through the echo
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:21.320]   I want I want this on google phy. That's my
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:27.640]   Yeah, I mean the only problem with that with voice text messages is the potential for cock up is huge
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.200]   You know, it's true like
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.200]   It's auto correct
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:37.080]   I have that with android auto sometimes it comes out very strange. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:40.840]   Particularly when I also want my mother's involved because she makes up her own text speech
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:46.440]   So it's just like you have to call your sister and say I have to call my sister and decide what was she saying that?
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:47.160]   I don't know
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.840]   Right, you know, so it's time for a call
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.920]   I have been told that the thing to do among young comedians these days is never fix auto correct
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:59.160]   So that apparently you get when you get garbled messages
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:03.720]   From these guys that's what they want. They just you'll figure it out
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:07.560]   Yeah, I I sent a text message to my friend james tomsen spelled the same way
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.120]   In scotland who develops p calc
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:15.720]   About his app from my car and I it was a long message about a gentleman named pete kalkman
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:18.280]   We don't know who he is
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:22.280]   But uh james thinks he should be sure he should hire him
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:28.760]   Right you're hired people. Yeah, wherever you are amazon also says they may start doing ticket sales
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:36.120]   In the us now, of course right now second master has the monopoly on that right and everybody hates ticket master
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.400]   He's gotta be the most hated company out there
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.680]   So I don't know if you've ever used it they do it in the uk now apparently
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:44.440]   I haven't tried it in the uk
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:51.000]   But anything to get out that convenience fee that ticket master so cheerfully slap onto the cost of a ticket
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:57.160]   Yeah, which is sometimes like half the price and it's huge. You should be crazy. I know it's an enormous ripoff
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.320]   I mean I have heard one argument which
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.400]   Is that it allows artists to charge more for their tickets and blame on ticket master?
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.200]   But you know, I'm kind of like
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:13.800]   I'm I'm inclined to give that company a break because I'd rather give the money to the artist and ticket master. Yeah
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.640]   Yeah, totally
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:21.560]   Yeah, so one of the things amazon does in the uk is up front pricing you don't there's no surprise handling fees
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.480]   They tell you the entire price
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:27.240]   That doesn't say they don't have a handling fee, but they tell you no, but they build it in there
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:30.360]   Yeah, by the way, this is in the uk is built into the price
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.360]   Why you go to a shop in the uk and it says?
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:39.880]   2020 pounds. That's what it is. You don't have to they don't add the tax later. Oh, it's infuriating when I first got over here
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:45.240]   And you're like, oh 1990 you take it to the till it's like 23 bucks, but you know, but but but but but but it's
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:50.680]   No, I genuinely you know, it's like you've got to do mental arithmetic in your head just to work out if you can afford to
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.080]   You can't because our what is our sales tax 8.735. Yeah, it's not exactly
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:57.720]   It's not something you could calculate readily
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:02.200]   This by the way credits adjacent l ray because amazon hasn't made any announcements that recode
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.000]   But he was able to find in patent filings
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.800]   and and job offerings
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:13.080]   Hiring effort to quote position amazon tickets as the world's premier destination
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:19.480]   For purchasing it's an ideal market to disrupt because you've got a very limited competent amount of competition
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.680]   They should go in there with both hands. Yeah, I would love to be able to say, you know
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:30.600]   Hey echo wins uh, peter gabriel playing next and saying could you get me a couple of seats in the front row for that?
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:33.400]   Oh, yeah, that'd be awesome or or get me, you know
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:38.280]   Get me a couple of seats for the giants game. Yeah, and on tuesday and have them
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:44.280]   Gonna be able to work it out. That would be great. The question is really live nation which owns ticket master
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:48.840]   Yeah owns because they're the concert promoters. Yeah, they own all the tickets
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:54.360]   Nice. So can amazon get tickets is actually gonna be that is gonna be the I mean stuff up my niches
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:56.520]   But you know, but those are resale. Yeah, exactly
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:00.600]   So the the resellers and you pay a real premium for it
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:05.640]   If they actually do lower the bow on amazon that surely could be a good way to get anti-trust stuff goes
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:11.640]   Well, what if they were to what if they were to do the smaller venues like my son's a musician and you know his he his shows sell out
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:15.800]   And his tickets are not as expensive as a big name
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:19.400]   But you know it'd be great if if he could sell his tickets that are nominal
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:26.200]   Online fee instead of having ticket master grab. I don't know how much they charge what $10 12 $1 some
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.240]   Crazy amount of money. I'd love to see that
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:32.200]   So amazon as you remember
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.600]   Bought some or released some jets that were going to do their own delivery service
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:38.920]   Not so fast
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:46.200]   The to air transport services that amazon uses air transport services group and atlas air worldwide holdings
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:52.760]   40 dedicated jets, etc, etc. The pilots who have been contracted delivers these
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.640]   Packages went on strike on tuesday, but didn't the government order them back to work?
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.720]   Yeah, they've been ordered back to work
[01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:03.640]   Is christmas package delivery considered part of the vital national
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.840]   Do you did the government have the information on that?
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:10.840]   He said what do you couldn't imagine christmas without or thanksgiving without amazon?
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:15.160]   Whoa, you're like what you're a judge supposed to be impartial on this
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:18.200]   I think they reserve that for like vital national defense
[01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:22.280]   You know keeping keeping bridges open and things like that, but christmas packages are now
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:25.240]   Essential services that the government's protecting
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:29.960]   Only for so long after january 20th, it might go the other way because as you remember
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:33.880]   Donald trump has said he is going to go after jeff bazos for anti-trust
[01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:41.080]   With for trust violations. So yeah, this may go the other way, but yeah, I mean so good news christmas was saved this year
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:46.760]   Well, we'll see this next week when the when this is this that will be more moves on this first
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:50.840]   That's a great ad for for amazon to have a judge to declare it an essential part of christmas
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:53.080]   It's like the judge declared fannacloths. That's right
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:59.640]   Forstry. Yeah, that's that's you that's a huge. Yeah, this shit. We can do a movie about this
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:04.520]   See, i'm inclined to listen to the pilots on this because I used to write an aviation for an aviation
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.480]   IT mag and piloting is you know
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:13.800]   If you're a pilot you are more likely to be killed on the job than if you're a policeman. Yeah, really by what but not by
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.920]   But if you get killed as a pilot it's your own damn fault
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:19.960]   Well, that's a bit that's a star way in star way
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.080]   Are you saying that commercial planes or that or that?
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:28.120]   No, that's not that's this was a bloom. But don't go. Yeah, but that's small. That's got include small aircraft
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:33.080]   Although actually not that many I mean statistically cops are not the most dangerous occupation either. I think it's like
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:33.480]   A fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish fish
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:39.720]   A fisherman yet there are other other job that are more dangerous. The most dangerous catch. I know I saw that. Yeah, the
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:42.520]   No fishermen are by far and then it's
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:47.240]   miners and then truck drivers. I think is the third but it's been a
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:53.640]   Podcast host a pretty low down in the low. I don't know many have any podcast hosts ever been killed in the line of duty
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:59.480]   Probably but since we generally don't broadcast live no one would know no one knows
[01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:06.920]   Those have been edited out. I'm sure there's some listeners that are tempted though many people don't know but I'm on the 43rd clone of leo l'aport
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:14.200]   This is a show we banked in 2013 recorded this many years ago. Yeah, I for one welcome my rebel table. I wonder you know
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:17.160]   relative to our conversation earlier
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:24.920]   There I've done how many hours patrick della handi does this every one so well i've done well more than 50,000 hours of
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:29.800]   Castings you should get out of it by now in 2005 well one of these days i'll get good at it
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:33.240]   But but the but there's it more than enough voice samples of me
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.880]   easily
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:40.680]   For some ai to create a leo that could do this show without me at all
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:45.080]   And now adobe's got the software to allow them to put whatever you want into your into your mouth as well
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:48.120]   You heard about this I can put whatever I want in my mouth
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:53.880]   Wait a minute that software. What are you talking about? It takes a while to do it because roger Ebert tried to do that
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:59.960]   To make my voice yeah, yeah, but I would imagine the technologies advanced at the point and you have so much of a track record
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:03.560]   I have said every word i'm ever gonna say every certainly every right every
[01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:10.360]   Fennening they just need to so this is the photoshop for audio. Yeah, but but the point is they have all the samples
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.640]   It's just a question of editing them together fixing the pitch eliminating pauses and making it sound intelligent
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:17.640]   That's how your job will be eliminated
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:23.160]   No, no, no, think about the good so you'll be ready to retire and people say no no don't go leo
[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:28.360]   And you will have a 3d model of yourself that will speak with your own voice and you are on the beach somewhere
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:34.520]   Well, certainly certainly I mean a newscaster can be can be replaced, but yeah, i'm not sure an analyst
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:40.760]   How would you how would you replace somebody who's kind of expressing opinions and changing them on the fly or not changing your opinions?
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:43.320]   But on the fly i think that's how I change my opinion
[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:47.320]   This is this is my hope for journalism because i tried automating some journalistic stories
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:51.480]   And it does work quite well as you will know a great many
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:55:00.360]   Journalists stories today are written by ais including most many sports stories, right? Yeah, but it does show
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:05.640]   You know, it's so I think yeah when you need to get opinion when you just get analysis in there
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:09.800]   Then I think we've still got a job for a little while yet, but um, but yeah
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.880]   Business analyst as well as another area, which is going to be difficult to replace
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:18.520]   But um, yeah, well you could certainly you could certainly have a machine for example
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.920]   Say that you know the stock markets reached a record high and that this stock is 20
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:29.160]   Percent over anything it's been anything that's factual could be done through AI, but anything that's purely analytical
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:32.840]   Would be i'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's more difficult
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:38.760]   Clicking clack are still doing a show so if click see clack can I you can do it google research blog
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:42.200]   This is the evidentiary point that would be counter to what you think
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:47.640]   Apparently google translate which as you know over the last 10 years has gotten better and better now
[01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:49.800]   It's a hundred third 103 languages
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:55.960]   140 billion words a day every time we travel we take it along with us because you know
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:59.640]   I can say something in English and have it translate into the french audio in seconds
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:04.760]   They have changed in september they added neural machine translation
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:09.720]   To it so it would understand context better understand sentences better improve the translation
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:15.880]   Well, it turns out in this process an amazing ability was discovered
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:24.840]   Google's translate can now translate languages. It's never seen before wow. Oh, all right get ready for this kids
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.720]   So apparently for instance
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:31.960]   Uh, let's here's how it works. This is the google research blog. Let's say we train a multilingual system
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:35.800]   With japanese english and korean english examples
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:43.560]   Well, it turns out that it will then know how to do japanese to korean and back rif
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:48.360]   Uh, it's called they're calling it zero shot translation
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.480]   And they're not sure how it works
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.440]   I'm a little concerned that it's going to look like something translated from japanese into english and then into korean
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:02.040]   We all we've all bought hardware with those that was instruction books just that way. Yeah, what do they call it?
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:09.480]   english. Yeah, um, I don't know. I think we're also seen google use ais to create encryption
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:12.360]   An interesting challenge we talked about this a couple of weeks ago work
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.680]   It created an encryption technique so that it could talk to us
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:23.160]   They had three three bots and they were able to talk to each other with an encryption technique that the humans did not know
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:29.240]   How how neither how it worked or how to decrypt it? I know that was that was one of the deeply disturbing
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:32.280]   Very disturbing because now they could talk amongst themselves
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:37.640]   Everybody we don't need to be involved in conversations anymore the bots will do it for us. Yeah, it's great
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:42.360]   But this is I forget which science fiction all that came up with this, but he was just pointing out
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:46.280]   We're all worried about you know machines developing self-awareness
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.600]   If they did the very first thing they would do would be hiding the fact that they do
[01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:55.400]   I certainly that they'd create because they know that they'd be turned off if they actually exposed it so
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:58.200]   Yeah, it's gonna be interesting times ahead
[01:57:58.840 --> 01:58:01.320]   Boy, this is happy holidays
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:06.920]   Happy stuff come up with some cheap stuff we can buy soon
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:12.200]   If you go if you go to my website larrythroll.com I put my mercury news article up there
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:16.520]   Low cost gifts for special people all right. Hang on my picks
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:21.480]   We'll do a few of those. I mentioned one the dot which is I think a really good holiday gift
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:23.480]   You should just put a dot in everybody's stocking
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:29.400]   Actually, you can't because they have to be amazon prime members, right? Do you can you buy a dot for somebody else?
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:35.080]   I would I would have thought so you could buy it, but you it would be not that valuable your account, right?
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:42.280]   But I guess you could yeah, you untie it and tie it some I think you could probably you can have a spotify account and just a regular
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.080]   Amazon account
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:46.440]   I think you could probably still use it and get your music. I'm not sure
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.920]   Ah, let's find out. Anyway, let's take a break
[01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:53.720]   And we'll come up. We'll wrap this up. It's been a great two hours with you guys Jason Snell from
[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:57.640]   Six colors calm the incomparable calm
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:03.880]   And you were just on with Gruber. Yeah relay dot FM. I got some podcasts there and
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:07.000]   Get around Cas galore. Yeah, you should talk
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.600]   No, I'm doing fewer all the time. I only do 10
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.800]   Nothing
[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:20.760]   Nothing 10 shows a week till two shows now. How many of those shows are the robot and how many are you you'll never know?
[01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:26.120]   Never know. I bet you could guess though. Ian Thompson from the register dot co
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:30.600]   UK where he writes each and every word on the page by hand
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:37.320]   Using a six-year-old Lenovo laptop. Yeah. Yeah, but you know my hands are now used to it
[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:42.280]   Yes, you know, it's just it is and I try on something else. It takes ages to get used to a new keyboard
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:47.960]   And larry maggad who does his work talking on cbs radio
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:55.240]   But he also has a couple of great websites. We'll talk about a little bit including a podcast it can it say connect safely dot org slash
[01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:02.440]   Podcast and safe kids dot com and larry we used your contract for teenagers with our teenage son
[02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.680]   um
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:06.680]   to for internet use
[02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:14.200]   Good because yeah, right and he signed it and and lisa signed it and that was a wow I think it's not so much
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.480]   uh
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:20.440]   Like here's a contract you signed that you better stick to it as to be explicit about what's okay and what's not okay
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:23.800]   And you know part of the contract that parents have to agree not to freak out
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:29.080]   The first time something happens that this might possibly disturb me. It's a two-way street
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:33.160]   Yes parents have to be reasonable as well. Yeah, but I think getting all this stuff explicit is is
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:39.560]   It's self hugely valuable having the conversation is the most important part of the old absolutely. Yeah

[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:31.800]   You know, I realize why you put me in the show leo
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:37.080]   This is not the first time that I've been on your show that they've actually patronized one of your advertisers
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:39.720]   While I'm in the show. I'm actually signing up as we speak
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:42.440]   That's the reason i'm wearing something
[02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:46.120]   You know what i mean to Harry Harry's shaving

[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:58.520]   Our advertising this is actually not this sounds like bs
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:02.440]   But it's true. I say no to a lot of advertisers every day. I say no to somebody
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:07.400]   We hand pick our advertisers because we know what geeks want are interested in and since you're a geek
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:13.240]   This just proves my point, right? This is something you go. Oh, I could use that we try to find stuff you could use
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:18.760]   Instead of I don't want to you know waste people's time with ads for stuff. They they can't use hey
[02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.360]   Congratulations going out to the late grace hopper
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:26.200]   Yep, and to Margaret hamilton not the wicked witch of the west
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:32.280]   The poor woman has been named that but she was the programmer who wrote the code for the apollo lunar
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:44.260]   Land
[02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:49.800]   Ceremony yeah springsteen is there. I mean the peed dates was that bill gait is amazing anyway
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:58.040]   Well done. Uh admiral hopper was the first lady of software she passed away in 92. So it was a posthumous award
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:01.000]   Um, she's the one who very famously
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:09.160]   Found a moth in one of the computers. It was causing a problem and pasted it in saying the first actual example of a computer bug
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:12.360]   Uh, so obviously she had a sense of humor first compiler
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.040]   Um was withdraw was pulled back international service twice
[02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:23.800]   Um because they couldn't afford to live without her. She's amazing grace was a fantastic woman and she has a my personal motto which she publicized
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:30.440]   Which was it is better to ask forgiveness than to ask for ask for permission. She was a woman with that. Oh, nice. You got all the time
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.960]   Yeah, so
[02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:37.320]   Amazing woman and credit to Margaret hamilton. You know so offer we talk about diversity and technology
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.080]   Here's a woman in
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:40.440]   1969
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:45.480]   Who wrote the code that landed humans on the moon for the first time?
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:48.840]   Now thank goodness she's still with us and was there to accept there
[02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:53.480]   She is standing in front of bill gates who's applauding and her code is on github so you can check
[02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:59.800]   Yeah, we looked at the Apollo yeah people have made pull requests. It's great. It's brilliant fantastic
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:07.080]   Build your own lunar land commander. Well the russians have announced they want they want to land on the moon in
[02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:13.960]   2032 my apple watch is far more powerful than the Apollo but uh, you know, it's fine
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:18.520]   uh bill and molynda gates honored for their work with the foundation
[02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:21.480]   Which is can you believe this?
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:23.880]   For a long time bill gates
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:28.040]   Uh got flack for not giving back. He had so much money richest man in the world
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:33.320]   Yeah, and he always said i'm not going to give away money until I have the time to make sure it's being given away
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:39.240]   Sensibly he got married to molynda gate. So I think convinced him to do it a little earlier. They created the foundation
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:43.080]   In the time since the foundation was created they have given away
[02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:47.400]   36 billion dollars
[02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:51.400]   And it's highly and it's highly likely that within our lifetime
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:54.840]   We're going to see the eradication of polio thanks to the work that they've been funding
[02:06:54.840 --> 02:07:00.680]   Which they're there now any a few countries left which still have polio available polio in the wild
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:06.280]   And this has been a huge push for them and it could be the very first time smallpox
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:12.360]   We've actually seen something like that actually eradicated and no longer a problem. So amazing. Yeah, and it's huge huge
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:16.200]   Work to reduce malaria around the world too. Just amazing
[02:07:16.200 --> 02:07:21.080]   You know the thing about too that that in addition to putting a huge amount of money into it
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:25.080]   I don't know molynda very well, but bill is an extremely smart guy
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:30.200]   And he puts a lot of work into this foundation and puts a lot of his a lot of his intellect goes into it
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:32.680]   So it's not just it's not just writing checks
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:34.680]   It's actually thinking through
[02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:40.600]   How you can use your money because that you can use your money in ways that are actually negative and there have been the gates foundation has been accused of that
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.080]   But you know as foundations go
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:48.280]   I'm pleased that that bill gates is is is putting a lot of resources into it
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:51.240]   It has been a remarkable reputational turnaround because
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:58.040]   Gates has gone from being one of the ultimate software robber bands and has just remade his entire image by
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:02.280]   Becoming a world flaunt in the great tradition of robber barons like dandrew karnigee
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:09.960]   Right who made all his money in steel and and and heard a lot of people but then built libraries on the crust
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:15.400]   Alfred no bill with it made made by them. I mean, yeah dynamite. I mean, you know now you have the peace price
[02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:18.840]   Yeah, it makes you wonder what Steve jobs would have done if he'd lasted long enough, but well
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:23.800]   And I think mark Zuckerberg. It'll be very interesting to see he's already pledged to give away almost all of his for well
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:29.240]   I was actually at the zuckerberg health announcement where you they've announced that they're going to
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:36.360]   Their plan is to make all known diseases either eradicate or make them manageable by the end of the century
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:41.640]   And they're pushing huge amounts of money into it. I have to say when I was at the presentation
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:49.240]   It sounded very much like hubris, but bill gates was actually there and was he's sometimes it's working with a dream big dream
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:55.160]   Exactly. Exactly. And if you can throw 36 billion dollars, you can get a lot of progress done as well
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:59.400]   So zuckerberg and chanif his wife have pledged three billion dollars
[02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:04.200]   To that effort and I they say they're gonna they're gonna give it almost all away
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.840]   And I think that's the right way. Yeah, I think it is the way to do it
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:11.480]   You can't take it with you when you die. So, you know, and how many billions do your kids need really?
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:15.640]   I think well each kid has a billion dollars. They're probably gonna be okay. Yeah, I mean bill
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:18.040]   Bill Gates said that he was more than that
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:23.400]   Yeah, I mean bill Gates said that he was gonna leave his children with enough money to do what they wanted but not to do nothing
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.040]   So I think that's a nice that's like $20
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:31.320]   Seriously, you can't I mean not assuming that they have to work
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:36.200]   He's gonna have he can't leave them the million dollars. No. No, I think he's leaving them like a hundred million a piece
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:38.520]   No, they don't they don't have to work
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:44.200]   Give him a hundred thousand dollars. They'll blow it on their trip around europe and then they'll have to come home
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:46.040]   You realize your son is watching this sweating not
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.400]   No, no, I'm planning on spending his inheritance long before he comes into it
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.800]   Absolutely
