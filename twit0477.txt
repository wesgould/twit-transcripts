[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   It's time for TWIT this week at Tech.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, the show where we talk about the weeks.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.160]   Tech news at what a week has been.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.640]   Let's introduce our panel.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.600]   I got their books right here.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.160]   The author of How to Be Black, Mr. Baratunde Thurston, who we adore.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.200]   You know, I just realized on the back cover of your book, you're wearing an infinity scarf.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.040]   Oh, it just looks like that.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.000]   It's actually a normal scarf that I just wrapped up.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.400]   I didn't even know infinity scarves existed until the most recent, was it the Apple event
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.160]   or the Samsung event where there?
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.480]   A guy came out, I think it was the Apple event to demonstrate a game.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.800]   He was European.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   Ah, man.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.320]   And he had a ring, a scarf that was, well, never ended.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   It was just a ring.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.480]   He must have pushed it over his head.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.600]   Apparently, that's the thing today.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   And you invented it.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760]   Thank you.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   Yes.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   We love Baratunde.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.240]   His company Cultivated Wip brings comedy to some of the most tragic corporations in
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.240]   America.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.640]   Is that not right?
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.160]   That is you.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.280]   I wouldn't ever put it that way.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   I love this.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   It is.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   I think that's amazing.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.760]   I mean, we essentially have a marketing firm operation using humor and design to help people
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   tell stories.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.400]   We've done that for a teacher recruitment effort to get more science, tech, engineering,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.040]   and math in America.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.360]   That's over at blowmines.org, the animated music video.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.200]   So I wouldn't call that a tragic client.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200]   No, I was teasing.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   No, no, no.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200]   I want to take it very seriously.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Well, it's I miss you.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.560]   I love having you on the show.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   And anytime you're around.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.080]   Baratunde is right now in San Francisco offices.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.880]   You've got a comedy of a hackathon coming up.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   That's right.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   Tonight.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   Tonight.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   Where's that going to be?
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.880]   Bravo.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   The theater at seven o'clock.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   There's still a few seats available.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.440]   Best comedy show that you haven't seen yet.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.200]   Well, it's you hack software and jokes.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.640]   The idea is to explore new ways to be funny, new ways to be creative at the high end,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.280]   like humanized tech at the basic end.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.600]   Be funny in a new way.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.760]   And so people have made comedic, often satirical apps.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.280]   They actually have to work.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.480]   And we've got some real zingers coming on stage tonight.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   I'm very excited.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   How far?
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.280]   Got some hardware going on, which is rare for us.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   That's good.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   Have fun.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.160]   Where could people go to find out more about that?
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   Comedyhackday.org.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.160]   Comedyhackday.org.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.080]   We'll be in Los Angeles the weekend of December 5th with the same event.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.080]   Okay.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.080]   And it's 2015.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   Who knows?
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   You know why that's good?
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.320]   Because Nick built and moved away from San Francisco.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   He's in Los Angeles.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.320]   Right.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.320]   He's loving it.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   What's up, Nick?
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320]   Oh, Nick.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.320]   You could only make it.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.720]   He said you made it three years in San Francisco, and that was it.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   That was all.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.640]   It was exactly three years to the day I made it.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.960]   And then I was just like, I'm out of here.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.120]   Too many nerds.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.920]   You said in the New York Times that it was too geeky even for you.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.240]   Well, you know what?
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.240]   Okay.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.520]   Let me clarify a little bit here.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.680]   Is my microphone farting a little bit?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.680]   Or is that okay?
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.680]   Is it better?
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.680]   Well, it's better not to fart.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   Yes.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.760]   But you are amongst friends.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.880]   So an occasional pop is fine.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.360]   We tend to find out what those mics, if you don't bend it towards your mouth.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.360]   Just make it.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360]   Bend it away from you.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.360]   Not away.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360]   They are straight.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360]   Perfect.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   Perfect.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   Should I put it in the other room?
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360]   Give it a time out.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.480]   No, I found, I write about technology and culture for the New York Times, which is a mainstream
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.960]   audience that crosses the globe.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.200]   And I found that I was, you know, you live in San Francisco.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.000]   And what's amazing about it is, you know, there are cars that drive by that don't have
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.280]   people in them and there are drones that fly off your head.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.820]   And there's an app to like pick up your dog poop and all these really cool things.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.000]   But that's not the way the rest of the world lives.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.200]   And I found that trying to cover technology for the mainstream in San Francisco was very
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   difficult.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   So I moved to LA.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   Where...
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.480]   There's a bubble in San Francisco, absolutely.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.280]   There's a huge one.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.080]   One of the reasons that we're in Petaluma in our north is we're close enough to cover
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.120]   it, but we're far enough that we're not kind of in the reality distortion field of San
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.120]   Francisco.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.880]   But LA has its own.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   Absolutely.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.520]   No, but it has its own without a doubt, especially when it comes to film and things like that.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.240]   But when it comes to the way people use technology, not so much.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.600]   It's, you know, I think it's comparative to lots of other places across the US.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.560]   It's been, I don't know, it's been really interesting.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.600]   There's also some amazing technology stories down here.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.360]   If you look at the biggest tech stories of last year, you've got Beats, LA, you've got
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.200]   Snapchat, LA, Whisper, LA, Oculus, the OC, which is an hour south.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.480]   Like all of the biggest stories that were happening last year, not all of them, but
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.640]   some of the biggest stories in tech were down here.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.440]   And part of the reason I think is because it's no longer just about the technology.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.360]   It's around it's about the content.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.600]   And who does content better than Hollywood?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.320]   Virgin's is finally happening.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.080]   Nick is the author of a great book now in paperback, Hatching, Twitter, built in a really great
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.080]   story.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.080]   We talked about it last time you were on.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080]   It's such a super much.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   Thank you very much.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.840]   Did you say I came in a little late?
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.120]   Were you guys pitching about Twitter and people on it?
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   Because I agree.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.120]   It sucks.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   You know what we're going to get to that?
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.600]   I want to talk also about this new social network that all the cool kids are on called
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Elow.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   Elow.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   Elow.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   I've already left Elow.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   I'm hanging on an Oi.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   Oi.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   I like Oi.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   I would join Oi.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   People were hanging on an Oi.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   Oi's the new Elow.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.160]   But I want to introduce Steve Gibson, who is our, as you know, our security guru, the
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.680]   host of security now, and a great guy when it comes to explaining security.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.320]   Because this was the week of arguably one of the worst vulnerabilities ever.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.400]   There's some we're saying then heart bleed, shell shock.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   Hi, Steve.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   Hey, Leah.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.080]   Great to be with you for this Sunday's Twit.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.200]   I know we'll talk about shell shock Wednesday on our Tuesday.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.600]   No, I guess it is Wednesday because we're flip-flopping with Windows weekly because the new Windows
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.880]   comes out on Tuesday.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.360]   Who would have thought that?
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.320]   But for the Twit audience, I think it's fairly important to talk about it.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:26.960]   First of all, this is a vulnerability in a program that something like 75 or 80% of all
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.560]   Linux and Mac computers use, the born again, shell bash.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.360]   And now that wouldn't be necessarily a big deal unless your computer's out on the network.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.000]   But it turns out, bash is also widely used on computers that are running web servers.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.120]   Well, and actually even it turns out, for example, whenever you connect your computer
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:54.680]   to a network and it does that obtaining an IP address thing, that's called DHCP, dynamic
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.760]   host configuration protocol.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.040]   It turns out that that uses bash in many instances.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:08.960]   So if you are on an evil network, the fact that your computer may be using bash sort
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.920]   of way behind the scenes without you even being aware of it could create a vulnerability.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.680]   So this is different than heart bleed.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.280]   People may remember that.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:26.560]   The way you could think about comparing them is that with heart bleed, there was a sort
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:34.600]   of a very small probability that a hacker who was trying really, really hard might be
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:44.800]   able in some circumstances possibly to capture the encryption keys for a server.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:50.600]   So it was unlikely to happen and in first people didn't believe it at all.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.520]   And then some people demonstrated they actually had been able to get it to happen.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:01.760]   So very sort of a slim chance that something really bad could happen to one particular
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:09.720]   server with this vulnerability, the shell shock vulnerability, the moment the experts were
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:16.160]   informed of it, there was like this collective gasp across the internet because this was
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.160]   easy to do.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.520]   Well, in fact, there's a rating system for vulnerabilities for like how hard it is to
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.960]   do, how likely it is to happen, how much expertise you have to have, blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:34.240]   This was a 10 out of 10 in horror for every single one of those parameters.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.720]   I know that's the case because our own sys admin bear as soon minutes after this vulnerability
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.280]   became known was emailing us saying I'm patching the server now because we run on Apache with
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.360]   nginx in front of it, but we are using Apache.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.080]   And of course that means bash is accessible.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.200]   What is the scenario that shell shock gets activated in on a web server that's sitting
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.880]   publicly on the internet?
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:06.040]   So sort of the history of this is that bash is this command interpreter that the Unix systems
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.320]   and then Linux have had for more than 20 years was written for at the request of Richard
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.760]   Stalman for the free software foundation.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   Stalman wanted a non proprietary shell that could execute SH scripts and he got the Brian
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Fox to write it.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.320]   Brian was working at the free software foundation at the time.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.820]   That was 1989.
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.480]   Has this bug been present since then?
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.880]   Since a few years later, it was turned over to another programmer who's been maintaining
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   it ever since for the last 20 years just sort of as a hobby unpaid in the background.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.480]   And the problem is that sort of the Unix way of doing things is to look around at the
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:55.360]   various components you have the various tools and sort of glue a solution together by calling
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.480]   this and then calling that and using this to go do that.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.920]   And it's sort of a ad hoc sort of a toolkit approach.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.520]   But by the way, and we should point out this is well accepted.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.520]   It often thought to be the best way to do it, to have small programs that do one thing
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.840]   well that can then pipe into another program and you can put together a series of programs
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.920]   to get something done.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.200]   This is in fact this kind of factoring should be more secure.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:31.280]   Well, so bash was one of those tools and through time it became more and more powerful.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:40.800]   So it's got some amazing features now and it ended up being incorporated sort of throughout
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:49.040]   computers, Unix systems and internet connected systems as part of this toolkit.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:55.480]   And so what was discovered a few weeks ago and it was kept quiet while it filtered through
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:01.760]   like the patching community who were immediately working to get this fixed was that there was
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.600]   a way that any sufficiently knowledgeable person, the no hacker, but you don't have to
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.720]   be a power hacker, you could be like as there's something that's referred to as script kitty
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   who just sort of basically knows how to make things go.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:26.120]   It turns out that there was a way that an internet server was inadvertently exposing
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:35.320]   access to this, what is ultimately a powerful command system back sort of behind the scenes
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:41.360]   in Unix so that it was easy for them that that is anyone on the internet to get that
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.960]   internet computer, that server to execute arbitrary commands.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.000]   And that's like the worst possible thing.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.560]   So are you saying that any web server running that has bash, it's typically used to run CGI
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.320]   scripts, but it has bash accessible could be compromised?
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:06.800]   Yeah, the I mean, we're still trying to root out all the different possible ways that we
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.240]   might inadvertently get like have like have contact with bash.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:19.600]   PHP is still we're not still not completely sure there isn't a way for some PHP interpreters
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.280]   that might use bash for some functions.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.760]   Well, PHP can easily exec out to a bash script.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.320]   I've done it all the time.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   And I'd tell you.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.720]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.760]   Steve, what is what does this mean for like me and people like this is affecting your
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.920]   Android phone, your iPhone, your your web connected home device, what did the practical
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:47.680]   impact of what Bartenday is really asking is it going to affect his porn consumption
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.680]   online.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.120]   It's already affected that.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.160]   There are many people who have that question.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.160]   So thanks for representing.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:03.080]   So so the initial concern was that the so called Internet of Things, you know, or light
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.760]   bulbs and refrigerators and microwave ovens and things might be affected.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.600]   However, well, and our home routers that are now so ubiquitous.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:20.920]   It turns out I've already been stuck.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.280]   Net Net it died.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.520]   So sorry.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.520]   Well, one of the things that the people recognized was this was very wormable.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:38.240]   And within 24 hours, there were were internet worms created that meaning that it would find
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.200]   a computer that would then start finding other computers that would start finding other
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.200]   computers.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.600]   A denial of service.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.680]   A botnet was created using this.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.280]   I mean, it was it took nothing for the hackers to jump on board.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:01.880]   So it does look like the concern for appliances is a little less extreme than we were first
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.360]   worried because bash is a one of the larger command shells.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.880]   And many of the the systems that are more lean have used alternative shells that are
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.120]   much smaller and don't suffer well, essentially don't have the power that bash has.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.240]   And it was from that power that bash acquired over time that this problem arose.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:31.920]   So so the real the real takeaway is sort of be aware for the next few weeks of available
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.820]   updates to your anything you have Mac and Tasha's for instance, which which have command
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.080]   lines have the bash shell.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.920]   That's the default command line shell on Mac and Tasha's.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.920]   But unless your Macintosh is set up in such a way that somebody can log in to your computer
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:54.480]   which is not the normal default, you're probably not vulnerable, right?
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:02.160]   Except this DHCP concern that that's one place where it looks like if there was something
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.960]   you'd have to be on an evil network.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.920]   But that's the case for example in open Wi-Fi.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.360]   If you want to start by example, you would you would have you your your your machine would
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:21.120]   be receiving an IP address and that process often executes bash in the background as part
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.120]   of it.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.960]   So Steve, should we not be using I mean, should we not be using Wi-Fi and coffee shops for
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   the next few weeks?
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.160]   Is that kind of the only thing that we really have the ability to avoid doing or?
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:41.120]   I think probably now that's the only I mean, it's it's been demonstrated the DHCP is a
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.120]   vector.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:48.440]   So if you were if you if you exposed yourself to a network where this had been set up, you'd
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.840]   be in trouble.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.840]   But like it's hard to be here's the question I had.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.520]   So so every week we every day we write about some sort of hacking some sort of bugs some
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.600]   sort of whatever it is.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.200]   I mean, I joked with my colleague, Nicole Pearlroft, who's the security reporter for
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.640]   the New York Times that she could literally just write a document and fill in the words
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.640]   and it says on Monday is the date you fill in and you name the company that was hacked
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.320]   and you name how many people's accounts and how many credit cards.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.760]   It seems like every day there is some sort of thing that is going on and some sort of
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.240]   vulnerability and whether it's iCloud or bash or this that or the other.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.660]   Like isn't there just a point where we just have to be like, all right, we're on the
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.660]   Internet.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.660]   Bad things are going to happen.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.600]   Kind of hate to get to that point.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   That's all despair.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.720]   But we but that's kind of where we are.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.760]   We still use even though credit cards are stolen every single day from all these different
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.760]   websites.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.760]   We still.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.760]   Well, we have that in the United States anyway, the luxury because of the banking laws that
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   we don't have to worry the bank, the credit card companies, the responsible party there.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.520]   And that's I think one reason that most most people in the US anyway don't really pay any
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.720]   attention because so what if Home Depot got hacked?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.600]   It's only going to cost Bank of America or whoever hold my credit card.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.840]   That's who's going to cost.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.080]   Of course we end up paying for it, but we don't have to see it directly.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.920]   I think that this issue is a large issue for a couple of reasons.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.880]   First of all, we do keep seeing flaws in open source software.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.360]   This flaw has been around for 20 years.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.800]   That's a significant amount of time.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.440]   We don't know when it was first discovered.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.880]   This is when a white hat hacker discovered it.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.280]   Somebody at Kaspersky discovered it.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.200]   But Steve, is it conceivable that this has been used by others for some time, including
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.760]   maybe the NSA?
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.160]   That question, of course, is inevitable.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.400]   And it is absolutely possible.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.320]   And it would generally not leave a trail.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:48.200]   The access is so rich that you could use it to install something that would remove traces
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.200]   of itself.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   It's kind of a classic exploit that lets you get in and then eliminate any footprints.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   Yep.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200]   So does it have an effect?
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.360]   I mean, other than next question about how we individually behave in coffee shops, for
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:06.080]   going back to this internet of things, potential vulnerability, is there more onus on a manufacturer
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.640]   to make their devices secureable when things like this are discovered?
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.120]   Is there an upgrade path?
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.320]   Is there a firmware patch?
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   Is there a software patch that we consumers are going to have to add to the cost of owning
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   connected devices?
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   You don't just buy it.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.640]   You actually have to maintain it.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.960]   That's a great question specifically about the non-mainstream devices.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   For example, light bulbs don't currently have like an automatic upgrading, updating,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.320]   patching facility.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.920]   We now have that maturely on all of our computers and our smartphones and so forth where as
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:49.480]   things are discovered and patched, our desktop computers go out and get themselves updated
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.520]   and on our smartphones do and our iOS apps and so forth.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:01.960]   But there isn't that maturity right now in the infrastructure for the internet of things
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:11.160]   devices and it's looking like we really are going to need that kind of connected self-healing
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:18.960]   technology as we move forward because with this tremendous capability comes responsibility.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.880]   Here's the other issue.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.400]   There may be the larger issue.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.280]   I think that this is not, and correct me, Steve, if I'm wrong, this is not something
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.720]   that home users are going to have to say, "Oh my God, my bash shell is vulnerable."
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.480]   However, if websites are hacked and if they're easily hacked and we've already seen this
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.760]   exploit in the wild, I mean, this is being used right now, the first thing that happens
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.960]   is malware is put on the website which may very well then affect an unpached Windows
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.040]   PC or an unpached computer.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:56.360]   What I think we're probably really going to see is the sort of the 99.1 rule where essentially
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:03.520]   99% of the systems, the big ones, are going to get updated and patched very quickly.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.040]   But there will be those in the closets, those in the back room.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.120]   This is the same as heart bleed, right?
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.120]   Yes.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   It's been, now let me ask you about the patch scenario because there have been several patches.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.440]   Has it been patched? Is it effectively patched? What was wrong with the first patch, etc.?
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:27.440]   The nut, when we talk about open source versus closed, one of the neatest things about open
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.640]   source is what we've just seen in the last week, whereas this came to the industry's
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:39.600]   attention and because it was open source, the industry's best people were able to pile
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:46.880]   on and we were able to use all of the tools we have for interacting in order to compare
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.600]   notes and find things and share discoveries as a result, rather than waiting months for
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.800]   this to be fixed.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:03.160]   As often happens over in the closed sector, this thing just got fixed in minutes.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.640]   But I have to point out, and ours Technica is reporting this, that while the patch fixed
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.920]   one test case, many are concerned that other vulnerabilities remain.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:22.200]   Yeah, and that's actually more the fault of how much breadth this has.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   That is, what they're trying to do is remove some functionality which has been there and
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.680]   is in use.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.160]   So it will break backwards compatibility.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   Correct.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:40.120]   I mean, they could have fixed it instantly if they just took out the ability to parse a
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:46.200]   command in an environment variable, but it turns out many things use that.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:54.240]   So the problem has been how do we sort of neuter the malicious use without killing off
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.560]   the good use because, and this is the problem, it's so pervasive.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:06.040]   As you were saying, Leo, it's just like in PHP, they'll like, you know, P open shells
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   out to bash in order to perform that function.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.840]   And we can't kill that.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:19.120]   So it's really required some delicate surgery and there's been no time for it.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.040]   Well, this is good.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.400]   Well, that's nice.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.880]   It's an inclusion.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.960]   I have a possible solution when I was taken intro to computer science and college.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.760]   I actually did as a final project, wrote a shell with my lab partners.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.160]   So maybe we can dust off that code and put something out into the world.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.400]   Barretunde shell.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.400]   I like it.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   Yes.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   The B shell.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400]   Yes.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.360]   That's to the internet.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.080]   That actually is the irony of it is shells are not complicated.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.080]   They're easy.
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:53.680]   And one of the reasons this has been maintained by one guy, what written by one guy and maintained
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.480]   for 20 some years by one guy is it's fairly straightforward and every I've used bash
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   for years.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.480]   I have hundreds of bash scripts.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.720]   So should we rename the show this week in code?
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.560]   No, we're going to move on.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.000]   I take that as a vote from the peanut gallery to get rid of this bash guy.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.280]   Anyway, we so it's out there.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.840]   I guess it's Barretunde's point is well taken.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.040]   Is there anything normal people should worry about at this point?
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.600]   Is there anything weak we should do?
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:30.640]   No, I would just keep I would be on the lookout for updates and take them seriously because
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:36.160]   if these if there are vulnerabilities that are found in the devices that we have, it's
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:43.000]   probably worth getting rid of them sooner rather than later because the hackers are really
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   having a ball with this.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.560]   So there have been quite a few exploits in the wild already.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.560]   Yes.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.400]   I have a little advice to put a little piece of sellotape over your webcam.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.640]   That's from the New York Times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   Always.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   Guys, we wrote.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.480]   Webcams can spy on you and the New York Times is on it.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.480]   Yes.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   All right, we got that.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.480]   Thank you, Nick.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.400]   And especially thanks to as Steve gives and I'm sure we'll go in much more nitty gritty
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.640]   detail on security in the hour this week.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.480]   It's going to be on Wednesday instead of Tuesday because we're flip-flopping with Windows
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:20.360]   Weekly so we could get instant same day coverage of Microsoft on Tuesday.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.120]   Microsoft's having a one hour briefing for select journalists, including Mary Jo Foley
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.160]   and Paul Thorett in San Francisco, revealing details about the next version of Windows
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.440]   Windows 9 threshold.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.040]   And Paul and Mary Jo will come up here right afterward.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.120]   So they'll be on one o'clock Tuesday Pacific.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.080]   That's 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2000 UTC.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.900]   Steve will then flip-flop to the Wednesday slot that he used to be in 11 a.m.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.900]   Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.900]   Yep.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.900]   Thank you, Steve.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:45.900]   Thanks, buddy.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.900]   Really appreciate it.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.400]   As always, it's kind of nice to have the, you know, somebody really knows what they're
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.240]   talking about, reassure us.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.000]   Although not much to say reassuring in this.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.320]   Yeah, we should call that segment, Bash Bashing.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   Bash Bashing.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   The Baratunde again, Shell.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.040]   This is my technical contribution.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.040]   I like it.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   I like it.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   I like it.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   We're going to take a break.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   Come back with more Baratunde Thursday.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.440]   Nick, built, and I will continue on with this week in tech right after a word from our,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   what are you laughing at?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.240]   I sound like you almost forgot the name of the show.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   What is the show?
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   I did forget the name because I have way too many shows and I'm way too old.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.960]   When you, every, for every year past 50, you should subtract a show, I think.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.280]   I don't want to take away your segue to the advertiser.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.480]   Segue to the advertiser.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.440]   Our show today brought to you as often it is almost always by legal zoom.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.160]   Actually technically the whole networks brought to you by legal zoom back in 2005.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:45.400]   When I was starting Twit, I asked my buddy, Kevin Rose, what do you do to start a business?
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.760]   He said the first thing you should do is make an LLC and he said, but you don't have to
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.920]   have a law firm to do this.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.640]   You just go to legal zoom.com.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   Legal zoom.com.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.320]   For 13 years, they've been helping people like me start their own businesses with LLCs,
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:06.200]   S-corps, and more to protect you against personal liability and very affordable and easy to do.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.800]   Legal zoom is not a law firm.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.560]   What they do is they provide self help services at your specific direction.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.720]   You go in, you say, I want to do an LLC, you fill out some forms, they walk you right
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   through it.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.120]   It's super simple.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.280]   This is something new which I love, the Legal Zoom Legal Plan.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:30.320]   Pre-negotiated attorneys in your state at a pre-negotiated price, so it's flat rate.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.760]   If you have a question, I had a question.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.600]   What state should I incorporate it in California or Delaware?
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   I made up the answer.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.680]   It would have been nice to call up somebody.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.080]   We're incorporated in Delaware and say, maybe I would have done this.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.120]   It probably would have done the same thing since then I have had asked attorneys and
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.560]   they said, "Yeah, that's fine."
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   So it's so great.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.280]   If you have a simple question like that, it's very easy.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:57.080]   Legal zoom also does personalized wills for your family powers of attorney, living, trusts.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.000]   We just, Lisa and I just do the will stuff.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It's so great.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.760]   They send you a beautiful kit, actually.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.960]   All the forms you need, you could do online, most of the work online, they print it up
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   for you.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.520]   It really is gorgeous.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.120]   Legal zoom was started by some of the best legal minds in the country.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.400]   They make it painless for you to get the legal protection you need.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.280]   Protect your family, protect your future, start your business at LegalZoom.com.

[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:31.200]   That's just to encourage you to mention where you heard it at LegalZoom.com.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.760]   Please use the offer code TWIT.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.160]   You get 10 bucks and we get a hearty handshake from LegalZoom.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.360]   You can get legal help through independent attorneys and self-help services at your
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.760]   direction, but they're not a law firm, they're better.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.520]   LegalZoom.com, use the offer code TWIT and we thank them so much for their support of
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.520]   this week in tech.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   All right.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:56.800]   Before we continue on to a newsy thing, I read to Isaac Asimov stories this morning,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.840]   yesterday morning, that I thought were fantastic.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.560]   Have you guys ever read them the last question in the last word?
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.240]   The last question is one of the great, it's free first of all, you can download it.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.040]   I'm going to share the links on the thing.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.080]   We'll just Google the last question, Asimov.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.080]   It's amazing.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.640]   Yeah, fantastic.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.560]   The premise of the last question is what there's a computer.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.640]   You know what, just read it.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   It's really good.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:27.360]   Yeah, it's the premise essentially that we created God and we are recreations of ourselves.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.880]   Don't spoil it.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.400]   And that's it.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.280]   It's got the best final word in all short stories.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.360]   I haven't read the last answer.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.360]   Is that a follow-up?
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:42.080]   The last answer was in the 1980s and it was yes, a follow-up to the last question and it's
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.400]   equally as good and it's essentially, I mean, it's not giving it away, but the last answer
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   is-
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   Stop scrolling, stop scrolling.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.440]   A gentleman who gets to fight with God.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.120]   You have to read it from beginning to end.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.160]   This is not one to go to the end of it.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.160]   No, yeah, read it.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   It's awesome.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   Great stuff.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   Who was it was telling me?
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.600]   It was a Michio Kakus somebody, somebody that we've interviewed on triangulation told
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   me about the last question and said it's one of the great.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.200]   Maybe it was Jerry Pournell, I don't remember.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   Anyway, yeah, it's nice and it's free.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   It's online.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.240]   The foundation books were one of my early literary sessions.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.240]   Yeah, which ones?
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.240]   The foundation series.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   Oh, yes.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.240]   Yeah, yeah, the foundation.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.240]   The Psycho History.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.520]   I read that and Dune and the Gunslinger series all in the same kind of two-year window.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.040]   You didn't read the whole Gunslinger series, did you?
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.040]   I mean, at the time it was three books now.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   But I'm current on the series.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   And it was easy.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   What is it?
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   Eight books now, right?
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.840]   Yeah, I mean, you could binge read it, though.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.200]   I'm stuck on book four of the Gunslinger series.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:50.760]   I'm sorry, Stephen King's kind of, it's the thread that runs through all of his novels
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.240]   as it turns out.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.320]   But it's this kind of infinite cycle about the sky and he's walking around, he's got
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.560]   boots and there's lobsters that go snake-snick and weird.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.520]   Hey, that's--
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.520]   Isn't that accurate?
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.480]   Have I not summarized it perfectly?
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.400]   It is true.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.160]   All the things you say.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.840]   I'm not sure if it's accurate.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.920]   I didn't get the heart of it.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.280]   This is guiding what's running.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   He's got boots.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.120]   He's like things.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.360]   So are you both on Elo?
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.880]   Elo is so stupid.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.640]   It is such a moronic, stupid, stupid, stupid thing.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.720]   Who's going to use it?
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.840]   Are you holding back, Nick?
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   I signed up.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.680]   It's literally, it looks like someone's art school, high school project.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   I think it is.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   They say they're artists.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.760]   Yeah, they're not at high school anymore.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.560]   Here's the thing.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.600]   It's not going to disrupt Facebook.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.720]   Facebook has 1.3 billion users.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.320]   I mean, Twitter can't disrupt Facebook and they have 260, 270 million users.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.440]   So let me tell you for folks who have not yet heard about Elo.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.320]   This is, I'm on Elo right now.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.080]   Invite only, by the way.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.800]   But that hasn't stopped 40,000 people an hour from signing up in the last couple of days.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.040]   That's what the founders say.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.800]   40,000 new users an hour.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.600]   Wow, that's so many.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   That's sarcasm.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   Okay.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   Thank you.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   Thank you for annotating.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.240]   Elo, okay, well, here's the pitch.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.560]   Elo is ad-free.
[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:27.040]   They wanted to make an anti-Facebook, a social network where they will never sell ads and
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.360]   they will never sell your information to advertisers.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.520]   And the idea is that they'll monetize.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.680]   And by the way, some people were upset when they found out and it's not really clear in
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.040]   the Elo manifesto that they do in fact have almost half a million dollars in venture
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.400]   funding, angel funding from a Vermont venture.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400]   Yeah, Vermont.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   So that's whole.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.400]   Well, it's Vermont.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   They're probably wearing earth shoes.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.400]   Just nice.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.000]   But somebody pointed out, hey, if you get venture funding, somebody's going to want
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   an exit.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   They're going to want you to monetize.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.040]   The plan is that they will charge you small amounts of money, a couple of bucks here,
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:03.360]   a couple of bucks there to add special features.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.240]   And that purchases basically.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:11.400]   I would prefer, I would love a Facebook that I paid $5 a month or whatever that didn't
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.640]   have ads.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.080]   One of the things that's great about Elo, they don't have edge rank.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.040]   They don't decide what you see of your friends posts.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.200]   You see all of your friends posts.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   I think this is a good idea.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.840]   It sounds like just like a site.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:23.840]   I can't remember the name.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   Oh, Twitter.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.520]   No, Twitter sucks.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.440]   Twitter sucks because of the at replies.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.240]   Twitter sucks because it's a broadcast medium that people try to have conversations in.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   That's the problem.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.240]   It's the conversations.
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   Twitter doesn't suck itself.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.560]   If you just look at the news feed or the or the discover tab, when you look at the
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:46.920]   at replies, it's literally like it's just the comment threads on a news article.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   That's what sucks about Twitter.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.400]   Well, there's other issues to 140 characters means people are tend to be kind of cryptic.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.200]   So you spend a lot of energy trying to understand what the hell is he talking about.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   And then you.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.840]   It's like reading license plates.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   What?
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.160]   You just do the P market technique of just spamming everybody with it.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.080]   Yeah, well, then that's the other problem.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   There's a lot of spam.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.960]   And then the main problem I have is Twitter has yet to come up with a comprehensive way
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:12.440]   to block trolls and evil doers.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.720]   And so it's just laced with.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.560]   Let's go back.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.040]   Let's go back.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.840]   Actually want to rewind back to the Elo thing.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.760]   But then I want to have this Twitter conversation because we have the author how to be Twitter
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.760]   here.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.360]   And no, wait a minute, that's the wrong book of hatching black.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.040]   No, that's the wrong.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.320]   But anyway, we have, I mean, Nick, if anybody would be able to defend Twitter, be Nick
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   built.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.840]   But I also know, but I'm not defending Twitter.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.280]   I actually think that Twitter does have its issues.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.120]   I think the at replies are literally the worst aspect of the platform.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:50.200]   You cannot have a conversation in a one to many situation with 10 people or tens of thousands
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   of people.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   I think that aspect of it is completely and utterly broken.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.360]   But I do still think that the 140 character sharing content, you know, the real time information
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.400]   and the reason real time works is because it's 140 characters.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.000]   I think that that is still completely brilliant.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.160]   As a Twitter turned bitter.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.320]   Now we're having the Twitter conversation.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   Let's go back to the fair.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.520]   They wanted to do L.O. then we'll do Twitter.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.520]   I'm going to do L.O. then Oi then what up?
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.800]   Boy, it's the new L.O. apparently.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.360]   My reaction to the L.O. thing, a friend of mine on Facebook was talking about it.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.000]   And I was just like, I hate new stuff.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   I'm just at that stage.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.920]   Well, that's just because he's old.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.560]   And my tech adoption was like, oh, it's new.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.560]   It's probably dumb.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560]   I don't need it.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.120]   I'm going to hate because it's not what I know.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.880]   But I think the reaction that it grew out of, the sort of spirit of L.O. is important.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.160]   And this idea of their manifesto that users own their data, that they're trying to position
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.960]   you as making you aware, reminding you that you are being productized by the platform
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   companies that you could give all this stuff to.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.520]   I think that's an important idea contribution to the space.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:59.280]   And they don't need to take down Facebook, 40,000 an hour, 40,000 over a year for those
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280]   people.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.280]   It might end up being very meaningful.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.920]   And the idea that we have all sort of opted into by default, not all, but so many, a billion
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.360]   into Facebook that defines what a social network is.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.840]   I like from a creative perspective that there's some other people out there saying, no, it
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.000]   can also be this.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.760]   So it doesn't need to be about taking down Facebook.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.040]   There's some value to creating something different from Facebook for people for whom
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   that matters.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040]   You know, on that.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.240]   On our Sunday, I am so unfriending you on Ella right now.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.680]   I'm going to put you at the end.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   I don't care.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   That's it.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.680]   We're done.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:37.720]   No, I do think that when new social networks start, they have one advantage, which is
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:43.080]   that only us, only the insiders use it and we like each other and then the real world
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.200]   comes and then I have to go somewhere else.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.800]   You're just constantly running from real people.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   I'm just running from people.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.120]   No, here's the thing.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.760]   I think I totally get it.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:58.400]   But the reality is we make a choice every single day to log into our Gmail and to all
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.480]   of these things and to our iPhone and to Instagram.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.680]   And because we enjoy them and we have fun, even though we know we're being tracked, we're
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.240]   not, you know, ads are being put against the things that we're writing.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   But yet we still do it.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.440]   And I think that like, do I truly believe that there's a privacy problem on the internet
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.440]   without a doubt?
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.440]   I have no question.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.240]   I've written a thousand articles on it.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.600]   But I also think that the kind of ship is already...
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   What's that?
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.360]   A thousand articles, really?
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   Really?
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   I'm privacy probably.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   Go ahead.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   Keep going.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:30.800]   But I actually do believe that the ship has sailed.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.560]   And I think that, you know, there...
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.600]   So part of the reason that L.O. grew out of Facebook was because there were people that
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.000]   were transgender that weren't able to use their...
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.760]   That's why I got a lot of attention lately is that Facebook has been with its real names
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:49.960]   policy, making it very hard for LGBT people to have a place on Facebook because they have
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   many cases, real reasons not to use their real names.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   Correct.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   But what happened was...
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.040]   You want to be sister Mary Duncan Donuts on Facebook?
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   You can't.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.520]   Unless that's on your driver's license.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.640]   And you got much bigger problems.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   So I completely agree.
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   That's what happened.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.480]   And then what happened after that was a bunch of people went over there and people from
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:17.400]   the LGBT society, like the groups that went over there, there's no way to block people.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.360]   So what started happening is you had all these haters that came on and started saying really
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.040]   negative and mean things.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.880]   And they couldn't use L.O. because there's no system to block people on there.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.280]   So it kind of all backfired.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.920]   At that point in particular, that's another thing I'd love to get to.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.400]   When you start, I think there's something that as much as L.O. your gripes and even mind
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:41.040]   about Facebook, they are mature enough to be experimenting at a whole nother level.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.040]   Yeah, of course.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.960]   And so even the idea of a managed news feed, if they actually showed you everything, if
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.720]   you have a thousand friends, you have a friend of people a lot over the years, it would
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.440]   be a horrible experience, probably.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.440]   So I give them credit.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.600]   Use your blocking to the...
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600]   Or try.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.400]   They're going to put this on their coming soon list.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   It's number one.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.920]   And the next thing they want to do is use your blocking.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.280]   So for a company like L.O. to enter this late into the game, what social networking
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.120]   mean, but we've all been trained.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.640]   It comes with these features.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.120]   There's a reporting mechanism that there's a way to filter and to not have that from
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.960]   ground zero, like the starting line, I feel like has been moved forward.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.640]   Is it late in the game?
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.160]   Are we really at the beginning of the Internet?
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   Isn't this really the beginning?
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   You guys are just jaded.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   It's not late in the game.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:28.320]   We're at the beginning of the Internet, but we're not in the beginning of social network.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   Hell yeah.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:35.080]   I mean, what wakes you think that in 20 years, Facebook or Twitter will even be around?
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.320]   You think that they're here to stay?
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   It's done?
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.320]   Absolutely.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.960]   If it is, then I'm depressed.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:41.960]   Yes.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:47.680]   I think that there will be other Facebooks and Twitter's, but I guarantee you in 20 years
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.440]   Facebook is still around.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.960]   If Twitter is still around, maybe it's part of Google or something like that, if it gets
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.880]   acquired eventually or something.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.360]   I don't think that any incumbent can come along.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.360]   I'd agree with you.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.680]   Nobody can be Google anymore, but that's more about a technical issue.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:05.360]   It's hard to do an index of something that's growing as fast.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   Here's, okay.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.800]   I think social networking, look how fast MySpace got to center mediate and look how much people
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.880]   hate Facebook.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:16.240]   People use Facebook, but often they're not happy about it.
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.280]   We live in a world where we're dependent on them both.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:25.160]   In the media, do I hate going on to social networks, first thing in the morning and checking
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.400]   to see what nasty things people have said about me and my calm and this, that and the
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.000]   other, but I do it because that's how I share my content.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   I have no choice.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.320]   It is the paper of today.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:40.760]   If Elo suddenly gets a sufficient subscriber, you'll start visiting them.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.960]   It's just a matter of critical mass.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.120]   I don't know why they can't get critical mass or any other new network.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.160]   I think we'll waste too early.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.440]   I think we're way too early for a statement like Facebook will definitely be around in
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.200]   20 years to be taken as fact.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.040]   To me, I will bet against you on the show right now.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   I think it'll be a safe bet.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.040]   Go ahead.
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   How much you want to bet?
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.600]   In the year 2034, 28th of September.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.080]   I will be dead.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.080]   We can hit on that.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   What else?
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.080]   Facebook.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   And Nixon.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.000]   By the way, I'll be glad to be dead if Facebook's still around.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.640]   I'll be looking at you from the grave going, "God damn you guys.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.280]   Couldn't you do better than this?"
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.400]   I would like to bet with you, Bartenday, but there are rules at the New York Times and
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   apparently you get it in the rough.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   Oh, but you know what?
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   It doesn't matter.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   We know.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   You heard what you said.
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.320]   He pulled the New York Times card.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.240]   I'm not working at the New York Times in 20 years.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:37.840]   Retroactively bet you a large amount of money in Bitcoin.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:43.240]   I just think to Leo's point, like the speed at which we're moving, something will...
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.400]   We can not...
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:49.560]   Technically, I don't even think have the ability to imagine of what our world will look like.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:56.160]   So the idea that a company called Facebook could be so adaptable to do holographic burrito
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.920]   delivery or whatever becomes the thing.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.400]   If you look at the history of tech companies, they try.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   They try.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.400]   They really do.
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   Microsoft tried.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.400]   IBM tried.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   And they lasted.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   Like my friends.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.120]   And they last, but it's very hard to stay on the forefront.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.760]   And I think Google won't be on the forefront.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.880]   I don't think Apple's already started to lose its edge.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.800]   And I very, very surprised.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.120]   I'm not saying they'll be gone, but it'd be very surprised if Facebook is the dominant
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.640]   incumbent that it is today.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:24.360]   So I think this is a perfect segue to this full thing.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.360]   Is it Ben?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   It looks Ben.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   It's not Ben, but I do...
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.960]   But those not watching Nick is holding up an iPhone.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.560]   For those not watching, I'm holding up an iPhone 6, not a 6 Plus.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.880]   And it feels like an Android device.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.280]   And I think, I don't know, I'm like, I'm not that impressed.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.080]   It feels like an Android device, only not as good.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.080]   And here's the thing.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.080]   I don't think...
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.080]   I've been thinking about this all weekend.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   So I don't think that Apple is...
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.920]   If you switch to Apple now, we're not going to get Twitter in.
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.920]   We're going to get to Twitter.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:52.920]   I just have to get this thought out.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.560]   So I think that Apple...
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.480]   I don't think that we have moved from a non-linear brain functioning yet.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.160]   I think you're moving into the future.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   Okay, go ahead.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   Talk about Apple.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   No, no, we can go to Twitter.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   No, be non...
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   I'll tell you what.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   Let me take a break.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.800]   When we come back, God only knows what we'll be talking about.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.600]   Nick Biltness here, he's the author of Hatching Twitter.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.800]   Barretunde Thurston is here.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.840]   He's biting his cord.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.760]   Author of How to Be Black, Cultivated with New York Times, Leo Leport.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.360]   I can't wait to get on the plane.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   We're going to take a break.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.360]   We'll be right...
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.360]   I love you too, Leo.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.520]   No, I love you guys.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   You know what?
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.680]   This is the most spirited conversation we've had in years.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.080]   It's always fun to have you guys on.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.680]   It's always fun to be on.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:36.440]   You know, it comes from time to time, it becomes up that we need to hire people.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   Quite often.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.600]   It comes up that we need to hire people.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.680]   And the challenge is where do you post it?
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   We've tried Craigslist.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.480]   We've tried some of the job boards.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.280]   You know, each job board has this kind of specialty.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.200]   If you're looking for a certain type of person.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.360]   The problem is it's hard to know where to post.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.000]   And it's a lot of work to post.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.480]   There's a lot of job boards.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.080]   So we discovered ZipRecruiter and we couldn't be happier.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.400]   ZipRecruiter.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   You post once on ZipRecruiter, they post it to 50+ job sites, plus social media sites
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.920]   like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Craigslist.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.880]   It lets you find the perfect person fast.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.600]   You can find candidates in any city, any industry nationwide.

[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.080]   Remember the last time, I wish we were both in Petaluma because Leo had to jet the last
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   time.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.080]   Did I do the cheer last time?
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.880]   No, you took over the show.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.520]   You did hockey time, and we took over your chair when you left.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.480]   That was awesome.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.600]   I invite you to do that when I leave today.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.920]   You can continue the show if you want.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.600]   Great moments in the Twit history.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   And I am not annoyed.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.080]   The chair is all Leo's annoyed.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.840]   This is another problem I have with Twitter and the internet in general, the literal net.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.320]   Hold on, I got to close my door if someone's making noise outside.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.080]   I thought he was an Asana.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.320]   Doesn't he look like he's an Asana?
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.200]   He looked very much look like he's an Asana.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.440]   See what happens when people move to LA.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.680]   They get finished wood, sauna walls.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.320]   He backdrops, not that I'm.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   I don't have a fancy back.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.640]   The mix always been pretty stylish though, hasn't he?
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.080]   He was like, remember he had those bowler hat lights?
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.160]   He's got the salt and pepper hair, is this a natural hair.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.040]   When we were people leave, you talk about.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.560]   Oh, look, he's brought a marsupial on with him.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.560]   Pixel.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.320]   It's going to be this isn't pixel.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   Oh, what?
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.320]   That's not pixel?
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.320]   No, it's not.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.600]   Did you leave your dog in San Francisco?
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   So.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.000]   And now we've got dogs on to it.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.280]   We had dog dogs before, I feel like that's a trend.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.080]   I love Steve Martin's Twit from last week.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.560]   He said, I sold all my bitcoins for pixels.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.120]   They're going to be big.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   All right.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.240]   So Apple iPhone, we should talk about this.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.120]   It came out.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   How long has it been?
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   It's been a week.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   It's been a week.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.120]   Just over a week.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:54.760]   Nick, you can't have it all these different directions.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.960]   No, you can.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   It's good.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   We have a smart audience.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.240]   They can piece it together.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.600]   Let's talk about Twapple.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   Twapple.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.240]   The new app that launched five seconds ago.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.720]   Are we done with LO?
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.240]   You and I, Beritunde, want to give them a shot.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.720]   Nick thinks it's just dopey.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.880]   Why is it dopey to create a new social network?
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.400]   I don't want another social network.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.800]   I don't need another social network.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.800]   Well, don't join it.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   Exactly.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   It's not.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.360]   Who wants another social network?
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   Can I?
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   Apparently the people joining LO.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   Like that's a social network.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.360]   What other than you two?
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.160]   You guys should text each other.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.160]   That's your social network.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:39.400]   We recorded, so a couple of episodes ago we had scobilizer on and he said, in a year,
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.080]   we basically met a virtual bet that he said in a year, I will say that Facebook is completely
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.560]   dominated the entire space.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.560]   They won.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.240]   And I said, are you crazy?
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.680]   I will not say that in a year.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:55.440]   He said, well, you don't know because you haven't appropriately cultivated your Facebook
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.440]   page.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.800]   And he spent an hour with us.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.120]   We're going to air it, by the way, tomorrow.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:05.920]   It's a triangulation 11 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC for triangulation.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.240]   It'll be me and Scoble and he's going to show us all how to make Facebook work great.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.840]   But I can just tell you, here I am three weeks later and I actually read deleted Facebook
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.240]   from my phone.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:23.080]   So Robert's got a really, I had some complaining that I did about Facebook, obviously on Facebook.
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.080]   He believes in it.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.160]   Because I'm a hypocrite.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.120]   And he is, he is like an advocate.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.920]   He's like the John the Baptist of Facebook.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.120]   It's really got some belief in it.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   He doesn't work for the company, but I think he just genuinely loves him.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.520]   So he responded to my post and he likes suck.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.880]   He's a big duck fan.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.160]   Is that the way there is a phony zuck on Ella?
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   It was quite funny.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   Oh, really?
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   Maybe I'll go follow that.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.160]   Yes.
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.960]   I'll play everybody's name while we still can.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.280]   I think, you know, I was bullish on Google plus two and I think it's really for the same
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.280]   reason.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   I'm only half a seashore.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:50:00.720]   So when I say I like these networks when they begin because as with most online communities,
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.240]   when they begin their civil people make an effort to put content into it instead of just
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   garbage.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   Here's the thing.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   This is my belief.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   Okay.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.240]   I love Instagram.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   I joined in.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.160]   There was one of the very, very first people on Instagram.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.080]   I like it's great.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:22.320]   I am sick of looking at people's food and at people's vacation and the sunrise and the
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.200]   sunset and their cappuccino.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.200]   Like I'm bored.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   I don't.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.440]   It's like, what am I getting from it anymore?
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.440]   Nothing.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.600]   My friend, if you are bored with Instagram, you are bored with life.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.760]   Exactly.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.400]   So what I do is I read these things called books.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   You guys.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.480]   Oh, no, no, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   Leo sounded like a father.

[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   Harry's. All right back to work we go. You're watching this week in tech.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   Baratunde Thurston is here of Cultivated with. He uses comedy to make companies work better also the author of How to Be Black.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.440]   And things are going well Baratunde.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:07.440]   They are. I mean to be honest like it's very hard. It's very hard for running a company.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.440]   I left the onion a few years ago started this firm with two other people from that organization
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:19.440]   trying to carry forward some of the spirit at a few new things take away a lot of things like a news production operation.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:26.440]   And you know I'll lightly plug the last thing we did as an example of where I feel most proud like this blow minds.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.440]   That org American needs a lot more teachers of all kinds.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:30.440]   Love that.
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:34.440]   And the president said we need a hundred thousand STEM science tech engineering and math teachers.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:41.440]   So we're working with an organization to make that message a little more relatable to the people they want to attract which are
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.440]   people to major in science recently or currently.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   Here's a video from a blow minds.org. This is really great.
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.440]   There's an animated music video. We've done a lot of animation and music video was a first for us.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:01.440]   A lot of gifts. We have a whole page on Giffy and some tumblr action tumblr action.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:07.440]   So yeah I would say in that sense it's going well. I love the people I work with.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.440]   It's also I don't want to like sugarcoat. It's just hard.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.440]   It is. I know. You know more than I know.
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:20.440]   It means to respect it on your own. So I'm enjoying the learning process almost all the time.
[01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.440]   And I'm having a lot of fun which happens to be our model. We make fun.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440]   So that's I'm consistent with our own brand.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.440]   Well everybody loves Barretun Day. It's really nice to see you here.
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.440]   That's not true but it's nice for you to say.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.440]   Oh come on nobody doesn't love Barretun Day.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.440]   [Laughter]
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.440]   Nick Bilton is also here.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.440]   Apparently he doesn't. He's the author of Hatching Twitter Rights for the New York Times.
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.440]   The Bitz Blog. You've been that.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440]   No no no I don't do the Bitz Blog anymore.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   When you leave the Bitz Blog.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440]   Like three months ago.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.440]   What are you doing now?
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.440]   My calmness in the style section but I'm coming to acknowledging culture.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.440]   No you lie. You're writing for the style section?
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.440]   No it's just switching over to the style section.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.440]   Oh Nick you want to tell us something?
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:09.440]   You coming out of the closet here? What's going on?
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.440]   I'm in a hot tub.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.440]   It's a sauna. It looks just like a sauna.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.440]   So wait a minute. You write about technology but in the style section?
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.440]   So what happened was a lot of my columns were increasingly becoming more about mainstream uses of technology.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:29.440]   So I used to sit down on planes and people would be like which iPhone do I get or which tablet do I get.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.440]   And now I sit down on planes and they're like my son is on Minecraft 24 hours a day.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.440]   What does that mean? My daughter takes selfies all the time.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.440]   Why do that too? This is talking to real people about what's going on in technology.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.440]   It's very important.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.440]   The technology itself.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.440]   My coverage of the technology started to change and it was much more about the way we use it.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.440]   And our broadest audience is actually and the broadest readership is in the style section.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:55.440]   And so we took my column there and I'm writing about how interesting.
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.440]   How interesting.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:05.440]   So this latest article big iPhone 6 bulges and all the wrong places easy in the fashion and style.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.440]   But it's the same kind of article you would have written for bits.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   It's the same kind of article for the business section.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:17.440]   It's just in the business section there would have been some sort of business statistic and I would have talked to an analyst from Forrester.
[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.440]   And here it's a different kind.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440]   It's a different audience.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:28.440]   So like the piece I did last week about Steve Jobs not letting his kids use technology.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:32.440]   That was a perfect example of a story that is a very mainstream story.
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.440]   A lot of parents wondering, you know, should I limit screen time with my kids?
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:45.440]   And it was kind of a revelation that Steve Jobs, Mr. Apple, wouldn't actually let his kids use the iPad.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.440]   Yeah, it was pretty fascinating to me when did you guys talk about this on a previous show or?
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.440]   I wouldn't mind bringing it up.
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   It's a very interesting point of view.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:15:05.440]   So the gist of the column essentially was, you know, everyone who was in media knew that there was this kind of little secret that Steve Jobs, if he didn't like an article you had written, would call you and yell at you.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.440]   And sometimes he would say nice things, but mostly it was yelling at you.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.440]   And I was on the receiving end a few of those calls and one of them was about the iPad.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:19.440]   And it was late 2010 and I tried to change the subject with him.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.440]   What I didn't actually write in the article was I was actually drunk when he called me.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.440]   I had been out to dinner and I was like, Steve, I'm going to finish.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.440]   I want the swift version of all your columns.
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.440]   OK, so your little tipsy?
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.440]   I'm a little tipsy and he calls and the oh, this is really funny actually.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:46.440]   The first thing he says on this call was, Hey, Nick, I'm on my iPhone on 18 T so if the call drops, I'll call you back.
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   Oh, I was like, no, he didn't just say that.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.440]   Oh, yeah, it was pretty amazing.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.440]   You didn't say Steve, you're holding it wrong.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.440]   He hadn't said that yet.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.440]   That was a couple years later.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:03.440]   So anyway, he was yelling at me about something I'd written about flash and Adobe and and I.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:04.440]   You're probably defending it.
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.440]   Of course he was a strong anti flash.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.440]   He hated flash and which I think was the was in hindsight was a good decision.
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:11.440]   He was right.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.440]   And I said, so what do you kids think of the iPad?
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.440]   And he was like, they haven't used it.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.440]   We don't we limit the amount of tech our kids can use in the house.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.440]   And I was like completely shocked.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:28.440]   And over the years, I've met more and more people that run tech companies or editors of technology magazines,
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.440]   whatever that have said the same thing that they limit their kids technology use.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   And it turns out that they know a little bit more about the way kids and technology can can interact badly than the most mainstream parents.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.440]   We should point out that this is a 2010, right?
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440]   So his kids were not little kids.
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   They were teenagers.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:50.440]   And it's been interesting because I called Walter Isaacson who wrote the Steve Jobs book.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.440]   And I said to Walter, I was like, you know, was Steve being honest with me when he said that.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.440]   And he said, absolutely.
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:00.440]   He said that when he was at dinner at Steve's house, you know, there was a strict no.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.440]   No gadgets rule in the kitchen.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.440]   And they talked about things like books and history and art and literature and.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.440]   Wow.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440]   That's very old fashioned.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.440]   I kind of admire that.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:17.440]   I think it's a luxury that somebody with his wealth can do because those kids won't actually have to hold jobs.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.440]   They won't have to know how technology works.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.440]   But it's a luxury.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   A lot of parents whose kids will have to enter the workplace by the time they're 21 will don't have that luxury.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.440]   But there's a balance.
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:35.440]   I think that, you know, it does is whether it's technology or or painting or something, anything in excess.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.440]   I think, you know, you have to you have to limit your kids use of it.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.440]   And, and, you know, I mean, I don't have kids.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.440]   So I can't tell parents what to do.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.440]   I'm telling you right now, I know a lot of affluent parents.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:49.440]   It's an it's affluenza that it's like sending your kid to a Waldorf school.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.440]   The Waldorf school is only watch TV.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:53.440]   I admire it.
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.440]   But I think it's a luxury that normal working parents cannot afford.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:04.440]   And I also believe that kids get a lot of value out of using technology at 10 and 11.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:08.440]   And to say to a 16 year old, you can't have an iPad is nuts.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.440]   And you can only do that because he's Steve Jobs.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.440]   I don't think that that's a reasonable point of view.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:21.440]   Well, yeah, to your to your class point, I think there's the other, the other end of the spectrum, which is when your only computer is the phone.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:29.440]   I mean, I live in New York City and there's been a recent attempt to adjust the policy of no cell phones in public schools, the new mayor.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.440]   What campaigned on the idea that this wasn't a great idea, partly for safety, which I don't quite buy.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:41.440]   But no, let me tell you, if you had kids and the only, I mean, I don't know how we survived as kids.
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:45.440]   Our parents didn't know where we were at the end of school till the time we got home had no idea where we were.
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:46.440]   But we did, right?
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.440]   So the idea is like we didn't have a missing generation because nobody didn't die.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.440]   Some did, I guess.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.440]   But I mean, no, yeah.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.440]   I think it's more to the point.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.440]   Now you see this all the time.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:03.440]   I even took a picture illustrating at the airport that nowadays when you're anywhere in public, nobody's looking at each other, talking to each other.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.440]   They're buried in their phone constantly.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.440]   That's a little, that's sad.
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.440]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.440]   I mean, we all do that.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.440]   And I tried an experiment recently where I deleted all the social apps from my phone.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:27.440]   And in their place, I put audible, kindle, and pocket so that if I'm going to sit there and stare at my device and do absolutely nothing, at least I'm trying to do something.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.440]   And it's actually been a bit of a game changer.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.440]   I took Facebook off my phone and I have to say I'm happy about that.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   But I do still have pass and I have Instagram.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:39.440]   Did you go for a Sunday?
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:47.440]   When I did my unplugged story for Fast Company a year ago, I moved all those apps into a folder called apps I never use.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   And most of them haven't emerged.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:20:02.440]   I just want to finish that earlier point that if you're in a household and if you're in an economic situation where your only computer is your phone, there's a different assumption about what it means to have a phone.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.440]   It's not discretionary.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.440]   Like you're doing your homework on that.
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.440]   You're trying to get a gas station.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.440]   It's just like, oh, connection is bad.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.440]   It's like, well, it depends on.
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:21.440]   So I'm not sure I buy the premise of the article, Nick, that well, these technology people are immersed in technology and they understand better than us normals how awful it is.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.440]   And so they make sure their kids don't use it.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.440]   I think it's more a class thing.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.440]   I really do.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.440]   I think you're right too.
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:36.440]   But the one thing that was interesting was certain people said to me that some CEOs that I spoke to said, for them, it's not about the technology or no technology.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.440]   It's about consumption versus creation.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:48.440]   So if their kid wants to go and build an app on their computer after school or they want to paint something on an iPad or something like that, they're okay with that.
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:55.440]   But if their kid goes and sits and wants to watch YouTube videos for five hours, then they have a problem with that.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.440]   And I think that that's from what I gathered from it is that that was probably like the best solution.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.440]   So there's a middle ground between letting them do whatever they want and saying no screens for you.
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:11.440]   And that's similar to the idea of 15 to 30 years ago.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.440]   Don't just sit in front of the TV, go outside and play.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:20.440]   When I was a kid, about 80 years ago, my parents said you can watch one hour of TV a night.
[01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.440]   And that was it.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:23.440]   And I hated it.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.440]   I had TVs then, so that's really great.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.440]   They were black and white, but it was still enjoyable.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.440]   What did you used to watch, Leo?
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.440]   Batman.
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:30.440]   Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440]   Batman.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440]   Batman.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.440]   I remember in fourth grade, Batman came out.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.440]   Adam West, Batman.
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.440]   Not Chevy Rooence, but was it really black and white?
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.440]   Yeah, with those.
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   Well, that show was in color, but I don't think we had a color TV because my father said the skin colors are all, they're all pink.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.440]   I don't want one.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.440]   Wait, so how old were you, Leo?
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.440]   I feel like I'm in like an old folks interview.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:57.440]   Let me tell you.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:00.440]   How old were you when your first computer came along?
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   Oh, well, computers were around in college.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.440]   They had big computers in the basement.
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:12.440]   And I remember this was 1976, '75, that a good friend of mine, Eric Schwartz, was building a computer in his dorm room.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.440]   We thought, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.440]   He was building probably an M-Sire, one of the Mitzel-Tyrk Kick computers.
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.440]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.440]   I thought that was Kuku.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.440]   But I do remember very well when personal computers came out, Apple's 2s, and eventually I had an Atari computer.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.440]   And the shift was you could have a computer on your desktop that was yours.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:38.440]   You'd not have to bring a deck of cards to the basement of the computer lab in the middle of the night because everybody else was using it.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:42.440]   That personal experience was not something attracted me.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440]   The personal experience grabbed me right away.
[01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   By the way, here's a picture I took at the airport, SFO.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.440]   This lady's not happy at me, but I just thought it would tell the story.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.440]   It was graphics on the wall of Max's deli.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440]   And now everybody was sitting there and they're not talking to each other.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440]   They're just looking at their computer, their phone.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440]   It was kind of a sad thing.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:05.440]   So I'm on Kevin Rose's new app.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:11.440]   It's only for the iPhone to I-N-Y, T-W-I-N-Y, to I-N-E.
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.440]   And the app is kind of an interesting social network.
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:21.440]   You can only post postage stamp-sized photos or videos and they only last 24 hours.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:25.440]   And then whoever you follow, you're just going to see this kind of page full of these.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.440]   I can't show it because I don't have an iPhone here.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.440]   But it's kind of, I like it.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.440]   It's kind of weird, but it's like you're communicating in pictures only.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.440]   Oh, it's Snapchat-ish.
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:37.440]   It's kind of, but you're doing it with a bunch of people.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:41.440]   So there's what it looks like and it's actually kind of like it.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:42.440]   And there's, it's a class.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.440]   The class is a background.
[01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.440]   Yeah, but it's fast.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.440]   They die after 24 hours.
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.440]   And there's a guy, one of the developers of the app, Mark, I think is his name.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.440]   He's on there.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.440]   I just, I think of him because he has a lovely beard.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.440]   And I'm just thinking, you know, and then I saw a picture without a beard.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.440]   And he's not as good looking as he is with his handsome beard.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.440]   I think he knows it too because there's a lot of pictures of his face.
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.440]   But anyway, I'm just saying a beard can work.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440]   Yeah, so it's a back to Apple.
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.440]   You know what would really help the iPhone have a beard?
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.440]   You get an apple of jibbles in your beard.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:21.440]   It looks like a modern Greek god.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440]   And so do you guys.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:25.440]   And I'm thinking, maybe I should grow one.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.440]   But then I'd lose Harry's as an advertiser.
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.440]   So, so are we here to talk in general about these new phones?
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.440]   First of all, Bendgate is bull's gate.
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.440]   It's a bit gazzy.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:37.440]   You don't believe in Bendgate.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:38.440]   It's it's bullgate.
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:44.440]   Isn't it this one guy who made a video 41 million views of this YouTube video?
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.440]   And yeah, he was able to bend a phone.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.440]   Any idiot could bend a phone?
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.440]   No?
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.440]   I think that what do you think?
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.440]   I think that that Ben Gade is dumb.
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.440]   Right.
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.440]   Yes.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:04.440]   I do think that Apple's design stuff is not it's kind of it's missing the thing that you the
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:05.440]   wow thing.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   And and I do like the iPhone 6, but if you can Android devices, someone threw iOS on top.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   And and the I watch.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.440]   Yeah, sure.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.440]   It looks okay.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.440]   It looks cool, but it doesn't look like wow.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.440]   Do you like my watch?
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.440]   Forget the I watch.
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.440]   What about my watch?
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.440]   This is the Moto 360.
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.440]   It's pretty.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.440]   It's black.
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.440]   It's big.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.440]   How to be black, how to be round and black and endorsement deal.
[01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.440]   And and it's not that big.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:32.440]   It's nice.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.440]   It's a normal size.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:34.440]   It's a good looking watch.
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.440]   And then I get notifications on it.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.440]   It's huge.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.440]   What do you mean huge?
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.440]   It's like as big as a baby.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.440]   It's a wrist baby.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440]   Show what that is.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.440]   That watches.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:50.440]   That watch is the one that flavor Flavius to hang on his back.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.440]   It's not that big.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440]   Come on.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:57.440]   It's a wrist.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440]   No, I like it.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.440]   But I agree with you.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.440]   I think that there's some question about wearables in general
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.440]   watches and glasses particularly.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.440]   Are these useful?
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.440]   Are they worth the money?
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.440]   Because they're expensive.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.440]   In fact, Apple somebody.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:11.440]   Gruber said I think that the Apple watch could because it's 18
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.440]   carat gold could be as much as $6,000.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:15.440]   The edition version.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.440]   The edition version.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.440]   Crazy.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.440]   I take on this on this bend.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.440]   Benditron.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.440]   Yes.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.440]   Back to Benditron.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:24.440]   I think I trust the Consumer Reports reviews which came out
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.440]   and said this phone is pretty strong.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.440]   It's slightly below the median of the five or six phones they
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.440]   tested between six, six plus and some Motorola phones.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.440]   But part of the problem.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.440]   Here's the video, Wenchit.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:40.440]   This blows up because Apple is really good at making hyperbolic
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.440]   claims about its awesomeness.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.440]   And because more people bought this phone than all those other
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.440]   phones combined.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.440]   People want to hate Apple is what you're saying.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.440]   But I think there's just more people.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.440]   Keep showing it.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.440]   Because this guy's going to bend this.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.440]   This is an iPhone 6 plus.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.440]   Consumer Reports has a testing lab.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.440]   They applied 90 pounds of pressure to it.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.440]   They actually said the iPhone 6 bends more easily than the
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.440]   plus and the M8, the HTC One bends more easily than that.
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.440]   But anybody, first of all, I don't recommend doing what this
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:08.440]   guy's doing.
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:11.440]   Anybody can take a phone, especially a full metal phone.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.440]   Metal bends easier than plastic.
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440]   Well, I take that back.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:17.440]   Metal bends and doesn't return whereas plastic bends and
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.440]   returns.
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:20.440]   And so anybody could do this.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.440]   This guy got 41 million views.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.440]   But how much of this is a problem?
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.440]   Is this going to be a piece?
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.440]   First of all, Apple could make a case that this is what true
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.440]   user-centric design is.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.440]   The phone bends to your thigh.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.440]   Oh, come on.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.440]   But there's the other idea or you could put a titanium case
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.440]   around it.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.440]   Or you could just, you know, it's a case around.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   Apple says we reinforce the incisors titanium struts.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.440]   Some say that the Consumer Reports report is very important.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.440]   The Reports report is wrong because they don't apply pressure
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:51.440]   at the right spot.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.440]   This guy's pointing out that right at the bottom of the volume
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.440]   rocker, there's a gap between inside, between the battery and
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.440]   the rest of the electronics.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.440]   So this metal point, right at the bottom of the rocker there,
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:03.440]   is vulnerable.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.440]   I fix it, says there's two very screws, very close.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.440]   But look how hard he's pushing.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:11.440]   Yeah, no one would do that to a phone.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.440]   Yeah, it's stupid.
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:15.440]   It's like I could bend, I could probably bend lots of things
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.440]   if I pushed that hard.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.440]   I mean, who cares?
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.440]   Like nine people have complained, apparently, to Apple.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.440]   Nine.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.440]   And this is sold 10 million.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.440]   In contrast to, you know, the antenna situation, like that was
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.440]   a justifiable outrage.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:31.440]   Like they just missed something in the design.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:34.440]   And then the jobs response of like you're doing it wrong was
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.440]   adding insult to injury to people's legitimate complaints.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.440]   This, you know, even I was like, I held off a little bit, but
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.440]   having watched all the reviews and the more scientific ones,
[01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:46.440]   I think this phone is probably fine.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:50.440]   I'm amazed that somebody, we live in a world where somebody
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.440]   could make a video showing him with great effort bending a phone
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:57.440]   and it get 41 million hits and people go, that is appalling.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.440]   It is what is wrong with Apple.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.440]   They made a phone that I can bend if I really put my mind to it.
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.440]   Yeah, and that's an old someone in Ken from Chicago in the chat
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.440]   where it says, and I wasn't clear about this.
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.440]   Nick, as the journalist on the panel, Leo, the other journalist
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.440]   on the panel, when folks were saying, I put this phone in my pocket,
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.440]   what pocket were they referring to?
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:20.440]   Right.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:22.440]   Was it their butt pocket or was it?
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.440]   Well, there was one guy who was at a wedding and it was in his
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:29.440]   like suit pocket in the front pocket, but because it was a very
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.440]   tight suit or something like that, that was, it was pushed like
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:33.440]   a suit.
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.440]   That's got to be a tight, that's a tight ass suit.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.440]   Yeah, it was like a skin tight.
[01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.440]   I don't know something like that.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.440]   I think this is really an indictment of skinny jeans more than
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.440]   it is an indictment of the iPhone.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.440]   I'll say it here first.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.440]   I agree, I'll put it in your back pocket.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.440]   You're asking for trouble.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.440]   MC Hammerpants are going to make a comeback.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440]   All people points, you know, that could be.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.440]   I have an iPhone 6 and 6 plus.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.440]   You know, you're going to treat it with care.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.440]   It's a beautiful machine.
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:00.440]   It's your product acquisition strategy.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.440]   I think I got in line for this at three in the morning.
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.440]   I think it's gorgeous.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.440]   There is?
[01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.440]   I like 6 plus actually.
[01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.440]   I went to an Apple store in New York just to play with it,
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.440]   knowing I wasn't going to buy it, preventing myself from buying it,
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.440]   but just being curious about is this too big?
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.440]   And that camera looked really interesting to me.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:19.440]   The optical stabilization built in seemed like a potentially worthy thing
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.440]   because I'm shooting a lot more things.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.440]   Great battery life because it's got a massive battery in it.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.440]   And it seemed like it would challenge the reading that I use,
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.440]   you know, my iPad mini for and the video viewing.
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:32.440]   That screen is just like maybe big enough to read a book on.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:37.440]   I, I, I, the camera on here is amazing, but I do have a problem.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:41.440]   I mean, I know it's like, can you see the, the camera jutting out?
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.440]   It sticks out a couple of millimeters.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:44.440]   That's not, is that really a problem?
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.440]   No, but it freaks me out.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.440]   I, I'm worried it's going to scratch or something.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:49.440]   It's cool.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.440]   You need to just do some more deep breathing.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:54.440]   I probably don't need to put this in it.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.440]   But here's a good thing about the good thing.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.440]   The good thing, the camera quality on this thing is amazing.
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:01.440]   It's, it's, it's stunning.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.440]   Yeah, stunning.
[01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:04.440]   And that for me is, that's the reason to buy it.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:07.440]   It's not because of the, of the design or anything like that.
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.440]   I really am not that impressed with the design of the actual phone,
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:11.440]   but the camera quality is phenomenal.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.440]   Do you not have a case for your phone, Nick?
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.440]   I put them on and then take them off and then put them on.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.440]   I think the six is so beautiful.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.440]   You shouldn't put a case on it.
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.440]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.440]   Yes.
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:23.440]   That's like almost an oxymoron.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.440]   It's so beautiful.
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:25.440]   You shouldn't protect it.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.440]   Well, no, it's not an oxymoron.
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.440]   It's gorgeous.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.440]   You want to just look at it.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.440]   Um, you buy a car and then go buy a case to put it around your car.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:34.440]   He has a bra.
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.440]   He has a car bra.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.440]   I know it.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.440]   I looked at him and I said car bra.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.440]   You have a rental car, which is the only cause I drive because I own.
[01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:45.440]   My daughter got her iPhone six with an Otterbox glued onto it.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:48.440]   I wasn't going to let her take it out of the Otterbox.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440]   She can't resol that way.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.440]   She's broken so many phones.
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:53.440]   It's not, it's just not going to happen.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.440]   But I, I carried around and I like it.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.440]   In fact, I'm taking it to London.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.440]   I'm not taking the six plus.
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.440]   It feels like a clown shoe.
[01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.440]   It feels too big for me.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.440]   I'm not, it flaps her.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:04.440]   And I'll tell you the other thing.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:06.440]   You're wearing phones on the feet.
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:07.440]   You got to put it.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.440]   That's why they've been.
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.440]   No, and another thing.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:15.440]   iOS to up to this point that doesn't take advantage of that giant sized screen.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:16.440]   Everything's just blown up.
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:21.440]   So I don't, I mean, I'm old, but I don't need to be, I don't need to be that big.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:26.440]   I think that going just to wrap up Ben gate, I think that Leo, you should take a, you should
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:31.440]   get an iPhone six or an iPhone six plus and you should take a brick and smash it with
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:33.440]   the brick as hard as you can.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.440]   And then complain that the phone broke.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.440]   Brick gate.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.440]   Brick gate.
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:42.440]   Here, here, do you want to see my pictures from my, my weight in the line at the Apple
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.440]   Store?
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.440]   Actually, if you look at the, at, at, at, at, at, it's a trending topic.
[01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:46.440]   Brick gate's already blowing up.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.440]   I like Ben to gozi.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.440]   Yeah, Ben gozi is my favorite.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440]   That's, that's good.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.440]   That brings in a lot of different things.
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.440]   Don't we look kind of like homeless people?
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.440]   Actually, many of them were homeless people.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.440]   You sleep out there?
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.440]   Well, I didn't sleep, but I was there.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:03.440]   That's my chair in the middle there, the little blue chair.
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:06.440]   That's a cute little chair.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:08.440]   Which, which Apple store is this?
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.440]   This is the Santa Rosa Apple store.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.440]   I have a little video.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:16.440]   You want to see the video of the, of, of when they opened the door, the excitement was palpable.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.440]   Well, any people crushed.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   No people were crushed.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.440]   But unlike the New York line, which was full of Chinese scalpers, these people were actually
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   excited to be there.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:29.440]   I think if you saw the video of the fifth Avenue store, it was like, yeah, whatever.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.440]   I just let me get my phone and get out of here.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.440]   These people, well, okay, maybe not that excited.
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   They don't, they've all been there since like three in the morning.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:45.440]   One of my, my favorite sort of performance art experiments was to go to the Apple store.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.440]   I think when the iPad came out, this is a 14th street in New York.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.440]   And I just pretended to have bought an iPad so that I could be cheered by the masses waiting
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.440]   outside.
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.440]   We're cheering everybody.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.440]   That's fun.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.440]   There was a king coming home from war.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.440]   It's kind of good feeling, isn't it?
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.440]   Yes.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.440]   You just hold up a bag and say we did it.
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:05.440]   And people love you.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:09.440]   So you just had like an Apple bag you got the night before and there's nothing in it.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.440]   I just, I grabbed one from a friend who did buy a thing.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.440]   It's a great feeling.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:16.440]   Be one of the, one of the, the in crowd.
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.440]   I felt loved.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.440]   Well, you are.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.440]   Leo, don't you have a flight to get?
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.440]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.440]   And when we come back, we're going to have snacks.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:29.680]   And when we come back, some final thoughts between Bendgate and L.O. I got my Moto X.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.440]   Now this, bear a tunday for Whiskey Friday.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.120]   How about a phone that smells like a fine men's club?
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:38.120]   That's got leather on the back.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.360]   That is for Whiskey Friday.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.360]   You need this.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.680]   If Motorola wants to sponsor Whiskey Friday, we can do it.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.680]   This is our tunday.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.520]   Do you have any whiskey on you?
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.000]   We can, we can do a, a triumphant toast.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   I do.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000]   Of course, this office as well.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   All right.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000]   All right.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000]   So, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000]   to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going
