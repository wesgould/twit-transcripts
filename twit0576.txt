[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.560]   I thought it'd be fun to start this new episode in our life
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.520]   With our hosts the people who come in every day and work so hard
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.280]   Formerly at the brick house studios now here in our new studios and it's a little rough if you're just tuning in
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.480]   I got to tell you it's you know the engineers were up all night. They've been up for several days frankly money of them
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.000]   Wiring and moving stuff over because I I was mean I was cruel. I said I don't want to miss any shows
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.040]   I want to go as best we can as we did the last time from
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.680]   Broadcasting at the brick house to here at the east side studios and you know what to their credit?
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.000]   They made it made it happen. So a tip of the hat John Slanina or to Alex Gumpel
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.520]   Russell Tammany
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.760]   and
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.000]   To our engineering director Bruce Chasem to you Patrick Delahandy to all the people who work so hard
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   Behind the scenes to make this possible. Let's say let's toast the new brick house. Sorry East side studios
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.400]   All right
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.160]   So if you if you're watching and I know most of you listen so if you're listening you probably don't notice any difference, right?
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   It looks the same to you. Yeah
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.040]   I don't know what they're talking to dark red at the back of your eyelids are exactly the same for those of you watching on a
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.120]   Video there's a little bit of a difference. We brought the gear with us. We brought the wall with us
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.520]   We brought the little thing behind us. We have a new table this table. They promised me is impervious
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.040]   To any kind of abuse that we might give it
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm not good you have all of the audio controls for all of our microphones at my feet underneath where you're
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.560]   It's going power probably not they're permanent
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.480]   Hey, I also should thank if I want to go home tonight my wife Lisa Laporta CEO the person who really made this all happen
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.120]   Who was the project director and you should get some champagne?
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:21.320]   Without Lisa we couldn't pay the bills we wouldn't have this beautiful studio she found it for us
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.600]   She managed the the build out and thank you Lisa for doing such a great job
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.720]   And thank you to everybody here in studio
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.400]   They've got a huge studio audience today some familiar faces some new faces welcome to all of you to Petaluma
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.560]   What do you think you like it? Yeah?
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.320]   We survived
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.960]   No, I don't think we lost anybody in the process
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.240]   We are streaming this for the first time ever in 360 surround thanks to you Alex Lindsey
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.680]   Tell us about that. Oh, yes, so we're we're using one of the Nakia Ozos now
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.440]   We did this with Mac break a couple months ago, and it was like it took like a week to
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.900]   Render it you could record it and then you had to process it for a week before you get 15 minutes
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.960]   Yeah, it was like it was it was like an hour there
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.480]   But but so now we have some dedicated servers that are actually able to stitch everything live
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.720]   And it's capable of stereo 4k. We're doing mono right now
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.320]   And I tweeted out and I think also in the forums we've got
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.680]   We've got the links to both the YouTube which is YouTube.com/twit. I think yeah, I think it's in the channel there
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.480]   Network could channel so if that's the one to you
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's a little lower quality, but that's the one to use if you're using cardboard or guitar
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.600]   Exactly so that one's that one is at 1440p and then and then the one at the pixel core site
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.160]   And it is a pixel core
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.960]   And I am I site might just want to check it out pixel core calm pixel core PXC - live - - but if you go to pick score
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.360]   You'll just see three okay there, so just go to pick score calm, and I also tweeted those out and so you can find them there
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.000]   But anyway, so it's a it's 360 live
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.960]   It is
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.680]   It's kind of the next thing we think it's kind of fun. It is people seem to be enjoying the oh so right there
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.360]   It's whole behind the scenes view of it and this is really in our opinion
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.800]   I mean there's a lot of 360 cameras for live specifically. We think this is probably though how much it's gone down
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.360]   It's gone down
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   It's no
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.080]   This entire studio no no it's uh these cameras are now 45,000 a piece
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:36.240]   Yes exactly so now you know why a metric weekly we've invented a unit of
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.960]   currency called the Alex
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.760]   Which is $700. Yes, it makes everything sound a little bit more reason. It is it's only a thousand
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.120]   Alex's or like 70 Alex's
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.200]   Bad we interviewed Alex at NAB for this and yeah one of the features
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.800]   I love about this and no one else is doing this is the fact that it uses multiple microphones because it's when you're thinking a 360 immersive
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.640]   Experience it's not just what you see
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.680]   It's what you're right here and with the microphones pointing in different directions
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.800]   They can actually capture that and it's and this one's got eight eight mics on it
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.280]   And so if you're watching with a visor as you turn your head to look at something your left
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.000]   The sound will do well with that or on the Nokia platform right now
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.400]   It will other people have to adopt it into the players
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.720]   So it's not adopted into the YouTube player or into the stream shark player that we're using on this one
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.760]   But it is a but we're working with folks to as they start to adopt those
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:32.960]   But that's gonna be the neck one of the next things for VR is really the audio because when you hear it all around you
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.240]   It is it's impressive
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.400]   You know it really changes how how like the 360 gets you most of the way there and it turns out that sound is probably more
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:48.200]   Important than even stereo as far as pulling you into that into that scene. So it's um, it's a it's a it's you know
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.120]   It's it's working progress. That's not actually not a surprise at all to me. I mean, it's always been clear the audio
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.700]   It is really important as soon as you have surround audio you immediately just lock in
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.960]   I mean it just just pulls you right into the into where you're at so many of your cues just in
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:08.040]   Reality in general come from the right right. That makes right creates a whole new set of problems like we were at NAB
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.200]   We were cutting between three different cameras live and then how do you how do you change?
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.680]   Because you had three of those those yeah, we have three of those those actually we that's 45
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.160]   They had they had a trailer that did nothing, but how's the servers needed to process?
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.200]   Well, yeah, there's a lot of and that's processing real time. Yeah, the real time processing right now takes yeah
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.080]   It's two two GPUs that are full fully in a pretty beefy machine that
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.360]   That unwraps each for each compute for each camera
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.720]   And then once we get it it's just a 4k on its basic a Mercator projection or a rectilinear
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.520]   Equirich linear projection
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.640]   but the
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.840]   Anyway, so then we just edit it in a block magic switcher and add graphics nice. It's easy
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.760]   But but yeah jumping from one surround sound mix to another what turned out to be more complicated than we'll get a well
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:03.000]   I think there's a I think the Samsung 360 is about 350 dollars. That's what we're gonna get is he's got one again
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   We have one of those two
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.760]   This is more in our price range. That's what we're gonna get. This is what we could get. Our price range fits in a little toast
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.200]   Yeah, but it gets you like 80 percent of the way. It gets you it's good enough
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.880]   Actually, you could stream live with it reach under your seats. You get three no
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:26.440]   I mean I used the theta s and you showed me Alex how to do that live stream live with that
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:31.560]   Um and this streams live as well, but you have to have a I think a Samsung phone to stream to
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.080]   You don't need yeah, you need to stream through the Samsung phone. It'll record
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.640]   We have one of the I have a little record, but then if you want to do a lot
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.240]   I see live is really of the most interest to me right right right it's and the big thing for us, you know again
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.960]   The more industrial version, which is the ozo because it just uses an hdst
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.240]   I feed we are able to I can literally put it over fiber a fiber network
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.000]   So I can have the the camera sitting in New York and be stream loud of dc
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.080]   That's the hard part with the smaller the smaller the ozo's laughing at your camera
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   Totally mocking it right now. It's like
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.440]   But the reality is
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.720]   The reality is is this is where it's going. I mean these little yeah, this is a future
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.520]   I mean, this is you know, this is you know in the next five years
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.480]   We're gonna have little cameras that are doing these little there you know, it's so in a small form factor like this
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.560]   How do you work in stereo?
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:26.520]   You don't there's no stereo like that's the hard what's really hard about streaming is right right now is is stereo and sound getting good stereo and good sound
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.960]   stereo you mean
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.880]   stereo vision. Yeah, so you're actually getting the you know 3d depth
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.760]   Yeah, yeah, you're basically getting a 3d as opposed to 360 degree looking around you're also getting
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:43.640]   3d information depth information. Oh, and that and that does not do that with the ozo does do this is flat
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.200]   Yeah, and the ozo while we're only streaming right now in mono. I don't know if I could handle 3d
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.000]   It's actually extreme cheer. I think I'm gonna herp up. It's bad enough to do 360
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.000]   If you actually look at it it does like there's a there's a couple shots from
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.960]   One of the political conventions recently if you go up and take a look at the um, but if
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.240]   We had one on us there was one on a stage and when you look down over the stage
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.520]   You literally your whole stomach just pulls up because it's like you know, you're because the closest the pole had to be right
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.360]   Right off the stage right on the stage and so it was uh, it was um
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.240]   Uh, it definitely you start really feeling like you're you're part of that that environment
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.640]   So it's you know the the probably the best the three best cameras for stereo right now
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:35.080]   Are the jump, you know the the go pro slash google jump camera the facebook camera and this camera
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.640]   Are probably the three best stereo cameras except
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:43.640]   The only one that is live currently is this one really? Yeah, so this is no kia right no kia. M. Wow
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:52.280]   I don't even know why they bothered. I just the uh the nab demonstration had uh, it was like a cirque troop a semi-circ troop
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.520]   Maybe off-circ right um and it was it was beautiful. You could say everything with the trailer
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.000]   And at the same time i'm thinking
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   These people need more clothes
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.480]   This is a little too intimate. Oh, well. I mean it was outside. It was las vegas
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.800]   So it was ridiculously hot and you had these performers trying to do these intricate moves
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.760]   Sweating through every piece of oh they had it was sometimes you don't want to be 60
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.040]   Yeah, don't worry. There will not happen here
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:25.160]   And i'm thinking the 360 for us more as a spy can yeah not so much as a broadcast medium because it's not what we do
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.440]   As somebody said this in the chalom. I don't need our sir. I don't need 360 degrees
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.200]   You just want to hear your voices and what you're talking about. We're basically 1d
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.640]   Yeah, we should be 1d. Well, I think that you know and this is a good
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.640]   This is a good start as far as playing around with it
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.720]   What we're playing with is actually bringing a little bit closer
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.960]   So setting it for instance like right on the other side of the table
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.560]   So someone would be able to feel like they were literally sitting at the table with us
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.120]   Person at the table. Yeah. Yeah, so that's that's kind of where we think but but but like a person with a
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.240]   With a muffled with the you know, they can't talk the can't just see there
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.200]   But it's like Megan. They just sit there silently. That's what no i'm sorry. That's me. I can say that
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.240]   Speak Megan
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   Speak you have nothing to add to this
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.120]   I was thinking this is just one more thing that will keep us all inside our houses when we won't have to go anywhere
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   We have so much room for a studio audience. We want people to come here. Yeah, not just feel like they're here
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.080]   Like me. Yeah, but not everybody can get here. I mean, I think it's good to have both, right
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.720]   I mean, but we do like having people come in this nice
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.040]   We have more room than we had before I think that's probably a little bit more comfortable for people
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.360]   Uh, than it was in the old place. It was a little certainly provides a better view for everything. Yeah, yeah
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.160]   Not having a but we also designed this in the center of the room
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.480]   It's relating because we designed this not only to be better for an audience but better for 360 view, right?
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.160]   Because that means the the studio is around you completely with no obstructions
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.680]   That's good for the audience and it's good for a 360 camera. Absolutely. Yeah
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:52.360]   Uh, thanks to ryan marsh by the way for lighting this and getting all the rigging up and and helping design the uh, the the look and feel of the studio
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.160]   We've got a lot more to do the wall behind you. Robert is
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.880]   Just right now just plywood, but it will be brick. It's a beautiful plywood be a lot of brick
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.880]   I see we've saved the clock your set megan is right where kind of almost where you're sitting
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.960]   That's where tnt is going to be is right behind you there. We'll rotate this table around
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.480]   Um, so yeah, this is going to be and then when we do ios today
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.440]   We're going to be doing it over in our new living room set
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.760]   Just over there with all the champagne on the tape. What does that is? Is that going to be there every every day?
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.240]   Yeah, here we go
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.560]   Some days I need it and we put we put a little caught behind the wall so during ios today
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.800]   You might see birk wake up and that was actually the biggest challenges. Where are we going to let burt sleep?
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.960]   There isn't a basement. Well, it is a raised floor. I only have one word hammock
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.640]   All about you can't you can't quite fit behind that wall. It's pretty as skinny as birk is
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.440]   It's still pretty narrow. You're going to be busy at tomorrow
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.080]   I think on tnt and Jason on all about android because rumor mill says
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:54.200]   nougat nougat nougat nougat nougat comes out tomorrow. Is that right? Is you is that credible?
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.640]   I don't know. I mean, it's it's not outside of the realm of possibility
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.720]   Why wouldn't they wait till they have the new nexus phones because those are apparently not gonna be out for a couple
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.560]   I mean, that's that's a big question, right?
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.000]   Like that's very different from what we've been seeing up until now
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.240]   I think there's been one other, you know release of the os that wasn't completely tied to the nexus devices since they started nexus
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:19.000]   But we already know that the lgv 20 which is supposed to ship in september has already kind of teased that it's to be the first
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.440]   Shipping device with nougat so that seems unfair that lg should get that on a little strange a little strange
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.480]   They would be able to say that and I don't know what why the deal they made
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.000]   Yeah, what kind of deal how that happened?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.080]   HTC is making the new nexus phones, right?
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.280]   And we know a lot of hours right now. Yeah, the sailfish and the
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.000]   Marlin the Marlin
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.240]   Both gamefishes that you sail out to see and google loves to do that
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.960]   Yeah, they love all their their codenames to be creatures of the sea apparently
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:54.680]   They've got a thing for preceptors. They're desserts and desserts. Oh, okay or tasty treats as they've said meanwhile apple's not sitting still
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.680]   I just got another I got pushed another update to ios 10
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:05.480]   I think they're getting very close to the final version of ios 10 because I think we all know there's going to be a new iphone in the next
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.800]   Months for sure, right?
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.520]   Although so we're leaving the country
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.440]   I think we're leaving the country right before the iphone supposed to arrive
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.160]   Something i'll pick one up in the london or something if you order it i'll take care of it before you
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.520]   Yeah, it's only the first time i've ever missed an iphone launch
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.960]   But it's interesting because this might be the first time i don't actually buy the new i know that's what i was saying
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.120]   You said you weren't weren't even interested in maybe getting it well without an headphone jack
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.520]   I we really got to the point now where phones are not there's not a whole lot new i just got this is the new nexus
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.280]   I'm sorry the galaxy note seven and uh looking phone
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.880]   I think that in many ways this is going to be even the new apple hardware. It's an OLED screen apple won't be able to do that
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.160]   It's uh, I would say the best screen on the market today. It's very bright very crisp
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160]   um
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.720]   It's got a great camera apple could beat the camera their new camera is what's gonna apparently gonna have two
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.240]   Imagers, that's what we hear yeah, i'm better for taking pictures inside
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.280]   Who's doing that is moto z somebody's doing that with a black and white and a color lens they're doing two
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.600]   while we did that with the p9
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   um
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.600]   A couple of new ones hcc had a
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.240]   Mm-hmm. M8 i think had a but it was using it for short depth of field
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.240]   Yeah, and i have five megapixel sensor
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.880]   Kind of trick of like shift your perspective. Yeah, lonobo's that was kind of the wrong application project tango built into theirs
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.800]   Sano tango does not excite me. Why is tango such a good thing?
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.480]   Tango is an interesting thing because of what you can do where did you get that watch? Uh, you that was on the tables
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   Stuff comes up on the free table
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.720]   And that's how pardry's terrible
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.280]   How you store
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.440]   That's the moto 360 sport watch no but but with tango, okay, so imagine as a developer
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.520]   I could do something like I could make a green screen effect without a green screen
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.280]   I could just tell tango only take things that are within five feet of the gas
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.120]   Oh, that's it. So there's like a z axis and you could say if it's at a certain distance this is i want i could also use a sensor as
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:10.520]   Super accurate gps so it's not just satellite i could go into a building and because it's always collecting data points
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.200]   It will know what room in fact what chair of what room i am in the building
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.920]   That's the kind of things that you can start it. Isn't it kind of big and clunky to have all those sensors?
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.400]   It adds a bump. It's got a big bump. It's not it's not huge. I don't see people buying tango
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.680]   I see tango as something that ends up getting included
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.720]   And then developers start playing with it right now. It's just an oddity. We have to um
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:36.520]   The other reason people are talking about tangos because you can map a store. Yes, sure and uh
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.120]   So then you can go in the store and you can know where the pants are you know you just because you have a map of the store
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.600]   uh, we need to reshoot our
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.800]   Tour our 360 tour of the studio remember we had one for the old brick house
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.880]   Uh and the and the developer who uh did that one says he's coming back
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.200]   Can we put the ozo on a hat and just have you walk?
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:02.440]   It's actually kind of complicated and he did it with as I remember he did it with still pictures. I can't remember
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.440]   Um and then uh and then he you have to google makes you blur out faces. So you can't see people
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:14.680]   Uh they do that for you though, right? Yeah, yeah, it's all part of the part of the uh part of the deal
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:20.280]   So, um, all right, so new iphone you're gonna you got to buy one you have to buy yes
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.600]   I definitely want one. I I'm happy with my bluetooth headphones. I am okay with dongles
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.360]   I don't want to have to wear bluetooth headphones. Well because of the sound the sound isn't good enough
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.840]   I walked into work today. I had headphones plugged into the headphone port on my phone
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.120]   And listened to a book. I don't I don't why should I have an extra dongle or have to do wireless extra battery
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.440]   Why?
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.680]   I wish I could take a compilation of all the times you say i'm not gonna do that all the things i'll say
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:53.800]   And i know people say that they say oh they got rid of the cd you know you complained but you didn't you were happy
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.880]   They got rid of the floppy you complain, but you were happy
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.360]   I don't think the headphone jack it's like saying hey, we're gonna get rid of the keyboard
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.960]   You know that's 150 year old adventure. You don't need a keyboard. They did that on the phone
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.280]   Oh, yeah
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.760]   No, there's a keyboard a physical keyboard, but yeah, I mean i i'm okay
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.080]   Everybody has to type to vorac from now on you can't use kordi what about that?
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.040]   And the everybody would say you could reasonably say well, that's the future. It's a more efficient system
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.240]   We should just adopt that. I don't buy that with a headphone jack
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.280]   I think that that's a universal port that everybody has
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:32.520]   And you need it. I was with you. I was I would you've changed with you. Well, no, it's it's that
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:37.080]   The I so I have a little developer thing on this and I was able to look at the logs
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.280]   And it does record every time you plug a headphone to this and I realized I haven't plugged the headphone into this phone
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:48.920]   In 18 months use wireless. I have bluetooth in my car and I have a bluetooth headset. Yeah in my car. I don't listen to headphones obviously
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.480]   I don't even i've been playing with some some had had had like bluetooth
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:59.160]   Stereo headsets not just like phones and there's some I don't think that the audio quality is any different
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.880]   I think that the hard part is figuring out how I manage it
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.040]   You know, like how do I turn them on and off and you know and and the process of that and
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.200]   So I've been testing the what was the bottom? I mean, I didn't send them to me the brat the braggy braggy
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.600]   Those are interesting. Yeah, that was a kickstart. Yeah, really you like those because that was the biggest flop ever
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.120]   No, it was the braggy's. Yes, they were. I think they were
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.000]   Yeah, it was a kickstarter
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.360]   They're bluetooth they they didn't have any wires no wires
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.560]   And they cleverly decided that the way the second had phone one has all the juice in it
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   The way the second one is they just fire radio waves through your head. Oh really? Yes, that makes me feel so much better
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:48.440]   I you like the sound on those a lot of people complain the sound was poor that I think that this it depends on what headphones you're comparing them to
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.760]   I mean, I think that the the hard part is is the microphone if you're going to use it as a cell phone
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.720]   The microphones on them. They're too far away from your
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.400]   Your mouth. Yeah, I really don't that's but you don't so don't want to look like the time life
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.320]   operator with there
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:07.160]   Well, we like when we do when we're really using these for events then we have kind of we do definitely have a big head
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.960]   Uh, I don't know which ones we use we have these big ones that come, you know
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.600]   Have a boom mic down and everything else because all you care about is clarity, you know, you're not doing a fashion statement at that point
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.120]   but
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.080]   But we've been testing a lot of them again because we you know, the we
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.680]   We want to know, you know, the the nice thing about a bluetooth
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.880]   Why don't you set the phone down and then you walk around and you're not carrying the phone around with you?
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:33.320]   Um, yeah, I don't know why I'm resistant to to bluetooth headphones. I've never actually owned a pair for myself
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.200]   Um, primarily because anytime I ever use bluetooth for audio with other things
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:45.160]   I feel like it's rarely ever just stable enough. Well, there are there are random dropouts that I can't explain
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.320]   I don't want that in my ear. I think I still I'm so perfectly fine with the plugged in earphone
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   They're substituting this for innovation. Yeah. Well, yeah, it's in my opinion
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.160]   They're saying oh look how we're future forward thinking we're eliminating the headphones port
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:02.120]   I don't I don't want to be the sound the official reason is because they want to make it thinner because I mean
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.760]   No, I don't think there's an official reason because they we haven't heard it. I mean there's a there are a bunch of
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.440]   Competing reasons. I think there's one is that it closes the analog
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.080]   Connection so that but that I mean for the analog hole the Corey doctor is very worried
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.800]   Well, it closes the analog hole for from from a
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.640]   Audio but it also if you look at things like square and everything else anything anybody that's been using that jal has to use things
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.040]   iPhone mfi right so that they're gonna it gives them more control there. It also
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.600]   They also do happen to own a headphone
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.480]   company
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:38.520]   Which would be you know it'd be convenient if suddenly all those headphones came out you can buy the new gold plated beats for just
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.200]   $1,000 and the gold plated dongles this is
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:49.480]   A riskier beats beats won't be the apple doesn't have to wait for people to support this what we're gonna see is beats is gonna come out
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.880]   With a whole line of straight lightning
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   Connectors, you know and and if you look at the investment when you look at people investing this is another one of those things where
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.760]   So now everybody invest in light expensive lightning headsets not doggles but headsets
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.680]   How quickly are they gonna change phones now that they have that's another buy-in?
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.360]   You know and not to be cynical right you're not gonna switch to android if everything
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:17.080]   Yeah, I mean if I got $300 headsets that are lightning only I mean of course you know that's absolutely a concern or a component of that
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:23.160]   Yes, so I think that those are all components of that meanwhile android posting the highest ever market share and the latest mobile data
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.480]   I think that this is apples doing this at a risky risky time if you look at the graph
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.640]   Android is 86.2 percent of global I admit global mobile market share
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:40.120]   That is significantly higher on this graph the blue big line is android
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.560]   iOS is the purple line hovering at around 20 percent
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.320]   You know it has that saw like shape because of course sales go up
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.360]   When apple releases an iPhone and then they taper off after each it is an interesting move
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.480]   I mean basically we have to convince ourselves it's bold by a new phone and now they've done with the headphone jack
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.720]   They've convinced people not to buy a new phone. So they that's what I said of what they need to do that
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.400]   But I don't think I don't think that there is a huge
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.040]   Conversion from apple to android there won't be over one year
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.080]   I think that if apple if next year's is really you know and they don't people don't upgrade
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.480]   I think then you end up apple starts to see some erosion
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.240]   But again you have a lot of buy-in
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.600]   I mean not among tech folks like us that'll just go out and buy everything again
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.320]   But from the average person once they've got a bunch of apps once they
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.600]   Understand it once they have all those bits and pieces it you know
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.520]   They're not all buying a new phone every single time anyway and it's and I think that
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.440]   You know, I don't think that apple has I mean
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.720]   I would love to see them keep on progressing as fast as they had in the past
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.840]   But I don't
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.520]   I'm resigned to the fact that they don't need to go as fast as they have been going
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:48.760]   Meanwhile everybody else is going full speed ahead. That's the problem android is iterating much much faster apples a new phone every year
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.160]   Android because it's multiple manufacturers
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.680]   Iterating very very rapidly and it's a real rate some way
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   Manufacturers now admittedly the individual manufacturers aren't doing as well as apple
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.480]   Because they're splitting up the market, but it's a bigger market and it's growing all the time
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:10.200]   I think there's a huge risk isn't this apple just returning to form because this is how apple used to be in the 80s and 90s and even early into the
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.760]   2000s where they didn't care about market share
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.280]   All the apple the strong apple fan said look we don't care
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.440]   We just like it that it's a great product they designed for the higher end market
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.240]   They designed for there's a different margin and 80 percent of apples revenue comes from the iPhone
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.320]   This is what's different. They're a one at this point. They're as close to a one product companies yet
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:35.000]   And it's a risky thing to take your one product and say oh and by the way, we're going to get rid of something
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   They must have done market research, but we're going to get rid of something that's fundamental
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.320]   To the operation of everybody else's fault
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.800]   I'm sure that what the market the market research they have is they have a lot of data about how people are using their phones
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.480]   Right, you know, you know, so they must know like you do when it was plugged in or not
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.400]   Maybe they see people not using headphones anymore
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.560]   Right didn't apple make its name with white earbuds and that was a big marketing thing
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.120]   You saw those white earbuds everywhere and you knew they were listening to an iPod and then later an iPhone
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.200]   Well again, I don't think I don't think they're gonna knock on a
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.560]   Headphones, I think they're just gonna ship them with headphones that work with the lightning connector
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.640]   Right and by the way android is not
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   Not doing this also Motorola Motorola's yeah, how's that fun selling? We don't know yet because it's not out, but it's true
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.760]   But it's coming out now. I'm not saying it's a good idea. I'm just saying there are others that think that that's a good idea
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.280]   Crazy talk. I think yeah Google released duo this week
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.280]   This is their FaceTime competitor
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:32.760]   And I think that that's directly a competitive FaceTime and aloe is apparently just around the corner of their messaging
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.640]   Hello, I had a call today on the radio show from somebody said I have everybody in my family uses
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:43.240]   iPhones I'm moving to a PC. How am I supposed to message them? Is there messages for the PC? I said no
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.720]   I said you have to use push bullet or something like that. You can send them SMS
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:56.360]   Um apple is apple is increasingly moving into this silo and google meanwhile is making products that are cross platform duo is crowd platform
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.240]   Aloe will be cross platform
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.600]   Apples new messages is very powerful, right? This is the highlight of iOS 10 for many people
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.760]   And I have to admit I didn't think I thought that was the silliest part of
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.840]   The presentation they did they spent a long no no and I have completely changed only because I put my kids on beta
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:20.440]   So my kids have like a visible link all the giant emojis they go they're sending
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.880]   They figured out how to send each other disco smiley faces
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.160]   Like you click on it is like the whole the whole takes over the whole screen. Yeah, yeah the lights
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.000]   They're like sent I was like I don't even know how I don't know what they're doing
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.440]   They have feature
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.840]   They have gone they're like they're like they're just they've come by the way your kids are how old?
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.400]   708 so they're little kids
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.280]   But they they know better how to do it than their dad does
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.360]   Oh, yeah, the part that I had to unlearn from them is how to change their password because then they
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.080]   Not because they they change the password then they forget the password and then I have to reset the whole right thing
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.560]   So anyway, it's by the way, it's good to have a family have your kids iPads and the family
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.600]   Group so that you can reset their iPads every time they oh, that's correct. I don't have to worry about that anymore
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:07.080]   No, it just it's an hour of time to get it fixed again, but anyway, but so the messages okay. I was like, okay
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   Wasn't a bad idea. It's probably gonna be a really good one. Can you get him to use duo?
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.520]   Um, they're so tied into FaceTime. I've tried to get them to I like it
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:23.640]   That's you like it better than FaceTime. Yeah, because you can use it on Android. That's cross-platform. That's an advantage
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:29.320]   Yeah, I mean, it's I think that we have so many ways to use video messages in addition to FaceTime
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.440]   You know if you want we you have facebook messenger you can do video chats you have Skype, but I will say that
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.280]   Duo was simple. Yeah, that was that's the big that was the problem with hangouts or or messenger
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:47.080]   It was that for us it was nothing to just use that and jump on video, but I definitely there were definitely
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.800]   relatives and friends that just
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.160]   See what I replaced my phone icon with on the phone. That's the duo icon
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.080]   You know the actually I learned this last week on twit
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.240]   Who was it was Alex Wilhelm? I think it didn't have his phone icon in his phone anymore
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.280]   So wait, there's a phone went and then I realized oh yeah much like apparently analog headphones
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.960]   I don't use the phone anymore
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:16.760]   And if I'm going to use the phone I use I either say okay google and have a call or I'll use a shortcut to family member
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.000]   Um most of my phone calls are incoming and I want to start using duo
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.760]   Uh, well, and I mean right now my phone number, right? So the people you call show sure it's linked up to your phone number
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.000]   It's not linked to a gmail or google account, which is definitely a bonus
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.440]   What's the challenge right now is that it's not audio but apparently they're working on that mean audio lands
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.880]   Plans to have audio calls and duo as well at some point. Well, I think there's a trick just keep it in your pocket and talk
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.120]   Just not
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.920]   It'll be audio
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:54.040]   I don't love video calls. It's nobody. I don't like this period. I don't ever do calls on this like
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.960]   I don't like technology. No, I mean, it's all done. Thank you
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   No, it's text and email for me. I
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.800]   Have a limited plan so it's got unlimited data, but it only has a hundred minutes. I never
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.440]   I never over 10 minutes. Yeah
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:14.840]   Well, and I I find I do not like having like every meeting that's a video meeting the first 10 minutes is trying to figure out
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.680]   Why is someone's connection isn't working and then and then the rest of it is you know
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.360]   I'm I'm not a big fan of monotasking
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   So if if you put me in a box
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.920]   Where I have to monotask which is like you put me in a video thing where I have to sit there and look at you and talk
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.320]   Rather than fiddling around which is what I usually do when I'm taught, you know, I clean my office
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.040]   That's what I do. It keeps me calm. Alex is our visitor for the future. Most people just call it tasking
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.920]   I'm like monotasking. You call it monotasking
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:46.840]   Because the door is anything but one task at a time. Yeah, yeah, no, no like yeah, there's there's very few times
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.640]   No, I don't monotask
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.000]   I have too many things to do
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.520]   It's just you should learn to write everyone knows everyone knows when I have lots of meetings because because my office gets really clean
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.960]   Like like in when my office is clean. I literally disassemble my keyboard and I
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:07.800]   Clean every bit of it. It's totally something to do while I'm talking. Yeah, and yeah, and so with you anyway
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:12.840]   Oh, this is fun. This is our first tweet from the new studio the site studio and so far so good
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:19.080]   I think if you're listening at home or watching at home, you can see that uh, not much has changed
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.040]   Right. Uh, this is an all-in studio twit because our skypusaurus is still being
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.560]   Constructed or maybe it's working, but we just didn't want to rely on it
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.360]   By chance. So it's great to have our regular hosts and our staff
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.760]   Hosts putting mega moroni from tnt ios today

[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.560]   Did I say something wrong?
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:48.360]   What just I was hamming it up lio. I'm sorry. Did you make a face? No, I actually made absolutely no favor
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.000]   Now the other
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.240]   You made a face to do it again just because I missed it. I can't do that. I'll have to watch
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.880]   I'll watch the video
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   Oh, man behind my bag
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.600]   Jason's the only guy who fits this table
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.800]   I don't actually look like there is a little kid here too tall for me too
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.440]   Funny how you get used to the style of table on the tnt stair height and table height
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.920]   There must be a standard table height, right? Well, or we could just get power chairs
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:18.760]   Oh that there you go. I'm
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.960]   We could stand
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.040]   Yet you get a whole bunch of uh barber chairs
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.760]   Aren't you glad I didn't like this side just kind of all of a sudden?
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.200]   We should do twit standing and just not no chairs. Well, but look at how many points we'd get on our apple watches. It's true
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   It's true
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.320]   That a thing
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   Oh, yes, your apple watch people
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.360]   You now have the head of it just mostly when you're managing a sport
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.400]   If I have to put my my apple watch on charge in the middle of the day
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.600]   I really feel like I'm getting shorted
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.200]   I mean like I did some walking in the warehouse and did I get any points for that?
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:46.840]   No, okay
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:52.040]   So so far the only thing I use this for is to control this when it's doing youtube so I don't have to get up to push
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.800]   That's the exact opposite. That's like that's over there
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.880]   I mean
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.720]   That's exact opposite. That's the I don't want to take any steps watch

[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.640]   Today we thank them for their support of
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.720]   this week in
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.560]   Tech when is aloe coming jason, do you know if they send anything? Uh, well
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:19.240]   I mean we pretty much are certain that it's gonna come out or at least we thought it was going to come out with nougat
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.800]   So it's very possible. We hear maybe a monday. Um
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.680]   That i'm more excited about because I think of a universal messaging platform has some
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.840]   If it does all the things that messages does and it looks like it'll do a lot of them
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.120]   And it goes to all the different devices that you want to use exactly
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   I think that's the that's the problem right now with exactly the whole like tying into a phone number
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:43.080]   It's like why I don't use what's app is right? I have more than one device that I want to connect to right right?
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.520]   Uh watch two
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.760]   What do we know about that mega moron?
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:54.200]   Well, uh, we don't know anything for sure, but of course we have all the rumors mark german and bloomberg, uh, and
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:39:00.440]   One rumor was wrong one about it being connected to a cell phone. Yeah, that's that's what we heard
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.880]   We heard you were going to be able to untether it did have 3g built in
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.080]   Yeah, and uh apparently we won't be able to do that because of battery life issues, which makes sense
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.320]   Mark talk us through what we know so far
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:17.560]   No, this is my fault. This is my fault. Actually. I'm not going to even say it's my fault. It's bloomberg's fault
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.040]   They're stupid autoclave
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:27.000]   Mark let me talk to this amark. Let me talk you what through what we know you mark
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.440]   Uh, so but it will have gps built in that's what we think which I mean isn't a big deal for most people
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.960]   But I use it to run
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.640]   Um, and I also bring my cell phone with me so that it can accurately track if I don't bring my cell phone
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.440]   I still get an idea of how far I've run but not exactly and as we talked about before you need to know exactly how much you worked
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.400]   Out and be able to see it or else you didn't work up. It didn't happen
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.760]   But by the way, robert don't worry. You can't control your tv with it. Yeah, I'm good. Here's the good news
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.600]   Right there's a remote control built in. Yeah, supposedly so yeah, I mean, it's important to you know, know
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   I mean we know this about you know when a new phone comes out versus when a new o s comes out
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.640]   A watch o s 2 is also coming out. So that will be separate
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:11.880]   We can run that on our current watches and then there's apple watch 2 that also will come out if we want a new watch gps
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:17.880]   You're a runner gps is pretty important. It is pretty important. I mean, like I said, like I strapped this giant iPhone to my arm
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.720]   That's your gps. Yeah, so yeah, I can know how far I ran
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.760]   Um, and I can run without it, but then it's not as accurate right right so I will like that
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.320]   I mean also
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:31.400]   It's nice to have anyone be able to track me if something horrible should happen
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.480]   Silence
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:45.000]   Is here a like a emergency button that you could press well that you know that is coming with watch o s 2 the emergency button
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Remember that was the big thing so it's great for people. I'd give that to my daughter
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.160]   Yeah, um walking around campus right or an older parent. It's great. It will contact your emergency contacts
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.720]   Is apple gonna call it the if I've fallen and I can't get up
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.880]   I think it's the I find my body
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.080]   Oh
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.360]   Oh, that's to find my body
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:11.320]   Actually further the line was here. I got here. Yeah, that's all right. You take my role. Yeah
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.520]   Uh, yeah, so I think I think that'll be a game changer for some too that uh, yeah
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.920]   It's it'll make you feel safe give you a reason to buy it because we kind of need a reason
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:26.520]   You need one big reason to buy this watch a lot of people have said I have no reason a lot of people bought the first one
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.760]   And don't wear it anymore
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.600]   Well, and wearables just as a category
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.240]   It's been so up and down as far as like validating itself over the last couple of years
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.640]   And I think a lot of people are still kind of like grasping at like the reason why
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.680]   It exists and be they need to do that
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.400]   But if there's one category that really has shown
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.440]   Over the years to kind of have lasting power. It's the fitness aspect
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.480]   So if you have the gps tie that in with the fitness fake functionality slap an apple logo on it
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.360]   That never hurts and then yeah, that makes perfect sense
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.600]   So we learned actually a lot about uh apple this week from barber strice in
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.480]   Naturally, I mean, that's where I get all my news from
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.880]   People who love people barber strice and was on npr
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.280]   And she told the host
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.040]   Well, tim cook told me that ios 10s coming out september 30th
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.480]   Oh
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:22.360]   For new markerman barber strice and yeah, and uh, one of the three reasons that she cares is apparently syri mispronounces her name
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.280]   Could you uh, do anybody have an ios device? Could you ask?
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.520]   Uh, I don't know how would you find out how it pronounces her her name?
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.840]   Ask her barber strice
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   Maybe who is barber strice and
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:44.120]   She's theory doesn't know. Yeah, apparently she uh, emphasizes the second
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:49.080]   You got a guy in there. That's not syri. That's a man
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.320]   It's a man in your phone and he does whatever I ask him to
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.680]   Sometimes sort of a little bit nice nice. What's one of her movies barber
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.080]   Who started the way we were?
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   Who starred in the way we were?
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:12.840]   Our internet's really slow here. It's only 20 megabits per second 20 gigabits per second
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.240]   interesting question Megan
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.800]   Megan
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   Thanks interesting pause
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:20.840]   Siri
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:27.240]   Uh, the emphasis is on the second eseverse or surname with a z so it's uh, so it says
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.520]   It says strizand which actually is what I just said it should be strizand
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.040]   So she called tim cook
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.360]   And she says strizand with a soft ass like sand on the beach
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.640]   I've been saying this for my whole career and so what did I do?
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.280]   I called the head of apple tim cook. This is my barber strizand impression
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:56.600]   And he delightfully agreed to have siri change a pronunciation of my name finally with the next update on 30 september
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   We're gonna roll that one in there
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:05.240]   You know just she know you can get siri to pronounce anything in any way you want it to but she's barber
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.520]   She doesn't have to well
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.240]   She probably did she probably called him up because that in that big interview that he did where he said it was lonely to be seet
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.880]   You see yeah, she was like, oh, he's oh, I'm all the lonely
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.920]   People who need people for the happy
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.960]   They said i'm funny. Uh, I I think she's actually wrong because
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.920]   Uh, by all accounts the apple event
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.560]   We still haven't seen invitations will be early in september and they certainly will have a new iPhone out
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:36.680]   By say the 20th my guess is he told her by the 30th so the so that he says she would stop calling you
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:41.000]   You know, I think that was the no he probably said barber by the end of the month you'll be happy
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.720]   Yes
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.080]   Well, that was the other
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.080]   At that right right the carrier would carrier phones wouldn't come out till september 23rd
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:52.040]   That's what mark german also said right that they come up with a carrier one. We'll see these by then. Yeah, uh
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.640]   A new as long as we're doing the apple rumor mill. Let's let's go for it
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.400]   By the way
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:06.440]   Here's here's here's apple's response to the fact that android phones are 82 of the marketplace
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.240]   New report
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.960]   Confirms that iphone and android combined are 99 of all phones sold
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.320]   What is the one percent of smartphone blackberry?
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.720]   Like oh, that's that's
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:26.840]   Windows forget the window party. Yeah, very small party 99 market share
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:33.000]   That's for the apple announcement. We but together we have 99 market share
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.200]   Wow, that is uh, that is in the
[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.720]   Pretty much I think blackberry is pretty much just the government
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.400]   I mean we all the government agencies who work with you still see these android 82
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:49.640]   iOS 14 windows 2 blackberry 0.3. There you go. Holy kagan is the
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:55.160]   government agency holy cow wait a minute. That was a second quarter 2015 the current one
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:01.080]   2016 market share 0.1 for blackberry 0.6 percent. They got a good car business
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:06.760]   Holy cow. I mean that's the surrounding error at this moment. Holy cow the phones are I mean
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.240]   But the car business is the big business for them now, right?
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:15.720]   Uh for blackberry oh qnx. Yeah, they own qnx and they're in my tv. I've got webOS
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.800]   Do they own webOS? No
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   HP owns webOS
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.960]   Rewind that and edit that out would you thank you
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:28.200]   Uh, do we have that capability now in the studio in the new studios? No carse is laughing. I would highly
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:33.640]   Hey carse if you want to see wait a minute. Wait, but we have a camera on carston. Can we do we have that camera?
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.200]   Can we see? Oh, oh
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.000]   That's the shot
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Why do you have all those lights on you?
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.320]   All right, but we are going to have a carsten wishful thinking we are going to have a carsten care
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   I see he's got lights. Yeah, are you gonna have you have a microphone yet or no? Okay, that is something that you need leo is an evs
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.160]   What's that? That's the that is the replay
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.360]   You can you can take the whole show and just shift it by 10 minutes
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:03.320]   And then you can rewind move things around change them and then nobody would even hear my stupid comments let alone
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.680]   You could you could you can literally just re-edit the whole thing. Well for $45,000 that should do that. I know
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:14.120]   No, no, no, the evs is more expensive. Well, yeah, they don't have 360 degrees
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:25.720]   70 alexes a little bit all of the alexes. It's not all of the alexes, but it's um
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.040]   evs is expensive. Yeah, it's like
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.400]   150 because it's hard to record because you got to have a digital buffer for digit. I mean for 10 minutes
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.800]   That's a lot. No, no, no, it'll do digital buffer
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:41.000]   Basically you can take so with an evs you can take up to up to six inputs, but typically you do four you can
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.680]   Did you use that for president obama? I can't comment on
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:51.080]   On other one on other if I were president obama, I would have that no actually all that all stuff is all been live
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:58.120]   It's all but yeah, wow, but it's like the uh, wow, um, but the uh, yeah, that's everything more. I bet trumpet pick
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.800]   Um that'd be useful. Yeah, no, so all like every time you see a replay for
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:08.680]   Uh for sports that's all these evs and so what happens is yeah, but then there aren't they late aren't they delayed like isn't it like you're watching the game?
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.960]   No, no, no, no a live a live game might be
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:19.480]   Maybe 20 seconds behind but it's so basically the evs operator basically has four inputs coming in
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.240]   I mean they have six in and outs, but they usually use two to send back out to the switch
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:27.160]   So it's a it's a digital dump right like radio stations. Yeah, and it's just you but it's no
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.160]   No, but it can record up to 24 hours
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.320]   Just sitting there just recording everything coming in from all from the cameras that they have you know
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.880]   You might have three or four evs operators sitting there getting
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.760]   Four cameras each for like a football game and then the director will say hey give me that shot
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.160]   And they'll literally just go back and play it back
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.960]   But what we use it for a lot is to actually like if you had a conference and you've got like six rooms
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.520]   And you can just time shift all the rooms by a couple minutes and you know 10 minutes here half an hour there
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.760]   And play it back. It's
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.960]   It's awesome for this kind of thing. I don't think we'll be getting one of those
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:01.080]   I think I think we need one of those too. See this is my job is to come in
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.560]   Make me want to buy stuff
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   I just bought this I can't afford anything
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.920]   New tech does make a a smaller version called a three play three play talk talk to them about that
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.080]   Oh, all right. We could put a three play if new tech's what a three play on these guys need a three play
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.640]   Yeah, all right
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.560]   according to
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.640]   Mac rumors the name for the new iPhone is iPhone 7
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:28.760]   Justin rumor kids
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:34.280]   I'm creative and iPhone 7 plus I see what they're doing. They're following Samsung's naming convention
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:42.200]   Everything in 7 happens when you have share 99 market share everything syncs up. Yeah, yeah, they're all friends now
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.280]   They're all all on 7
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.400]   Uh, so there were rumors. They might drop numbers
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:53.320]   I we rumors we started that maybe the numbers were not it is so it has been so confusing when they dropped the iPad numbers
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.840]   It was like I don't know what even to call it anymore. It's just the current iPad right?
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:02.200]   But they were gonna call it the pro to the iPhone pro, but they're not doing that
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:08.200]   Well, it sounded like this. I have a third phone that right it sounded like they were a third phone that was gonna be a better pro
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.760]   Yeah, more expensive call it pro charge more
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.000]   It's actually just two phones in one case
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.240]   And and the thing is is for me if if it had like the two the two cameras and you could draw on it
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.800]   Like the big thing for me now in the phone is I just want I want my pen my pencil
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.600]   to work on my phone
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.000]   And still stick out of the lightning connector the long way
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.720]   I never charged it that way. I always just I have I used a little kind of way
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:37.560]   You're the little coupler there and you just see the little stylus you put it right out of the 7
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:42.120]   I know no, no, don't do it. Shall I try? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, do it
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:47.400]   No, hey, they learned the lesson. Okay. This is they call it the leo
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:53.640]   You can't put it in backwards anymore. So good way it should be. This is this is printer pressure sensitive
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.960]   It's not as good as an iPad pro. I'd be honest pencil, but but at least you have a stylus on a
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:03.960]   Unbind one are you gonna buy a note? Yeah, absolutely. I buy one every year. Oh, you do yeah, because I it works with the gear b.r
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.920]   So I right I get to so I buy new I have a new gear VR. Yeah, it bugs me
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:15.160]   You this this will bug you too. See that back. It looks like a mirror. It's mirrored. It's not a mirror though
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   They do something so it doesn't reflect you. Oh
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:23.720]   Why would you do that like a matte type thing? It's a fake mirror. Yeah, why would you go to all the trouble put a mirror
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.840]   Back on but not have it be a mirror because it would be useful. It looks pretty that way
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.320]   How you can tell me know
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.560]   A what fee a selfie have you heard of that? You can just look at yourself that way what?
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.200]   That's insane
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.160]   You know
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.560]   Like probably use the camera on the phone to look at yourself. Yep
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.320]   Oh, that's it's it's got a diffraction petted on the back
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.680]   That actually could be a safety feature. This is this week. It's probably it
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:56.600]   If you make a mirrored back if you have this in your car say on the driver's seat, oh, yeah, you turn in the sun
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:01.160]   It's dying in your eyes. Oh, that's probably a safety feature. Yeah, also probably cuts down on the
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:07.080]   Visibility of things like fingerprints. Yeah, like it's a real fingerprint magnet. Yeah
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:11.480]   I was surprised at the amount of upset about this
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:18.360]   Google has announced that they're going to kill chromium apps on windows and mac and touch. This is a
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.720]   Kind of a feature. I don't even know how many people use this but the idea was that I was like what what I didn't know
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.920]   There are there are apps in fact if I look at my chrome
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:33.480]   Which i'm running right now on my mac up in the left corner of the bookmarks bar show apps and that will pull up
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.760]   Both extensions and apps so that's up here
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.760]   And then I can scroll through my apps some of the apps are
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:47.160]   More standalone than others some of them are web, you know html 5 and some of them are extensions
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.920]   But the ones that are apps standalone apps are going away
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.720]   and google's
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.760]   Story is uh, well, no one was using them
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.080]   Yeah, probably nobody's a lot of echo here and we decided to get rid of the echo
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.960]   They said the reason they did these in the first place
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.200]   um
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.200]   is because we wanted to make
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.960]   kind of
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:16.680]   Certain experiences on the web that we couldn't do in a browser like working offline sending notifications connecting to hardware
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.280]   So they started this chrome app thing so that you could do more
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.880]   Within a browser and I think this is reasonable because nowadays really the browser is is the application you live in
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.120]   For the most part
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:34.600]   But uh, they say in the blog post since then we've worked with web standards community to enable increasing number of these use cases on the web
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.600]   So html 5 has gotten more powerful and it can do a lot of these things there's service worker web push
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:46.360]   Uh more capabilities will be continued to be available. So they say in order to simplify chrome. We're just going to take
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.480]   the uh packaged apps out
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:54.520]   Uh 1% of users on windows mac and linux actively use chrome packaged apps
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.680]   Apparently all of those 1% are in reddit though because there was a lot of upset
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:03.640]   People were very upset about it. Generally a lot of upset. Yeah, pretty much general. That's just where it is. Yeah
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.440]   So if the idea was to be offline does this just show how much we're
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:14.200]   Online constantly now as opposed to when that's an interesting question. I don't yeah, I don't know if
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.040]   New browser capabilities support more online offline
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:22.760]   Stuff or would they just notice people don't really care about or people don't think it is online all the time
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:27.480]   Yeah, it's a different environment because remember when the chrome books were first released that was everyone's like, oh, this is stupid
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:33.080]   Why would I ever have a computer that's crippled when it's offline now? It's well if i'm offline i'm probably not getting any work done anyway
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.240]   Well, I guess I
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.040]   If from a from a mac user perspective or windows user perspective, I don't really think of the chrome
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.440]   Of solutions as something I can use offline
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.280]   So, you know, I think the part of it is there was no even thought that like you think oh if i'm going to use
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.000]   You just accepted the fact that's a browser or not
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.080]   Or whatever, I mean, you know, and I run my I run my whole company on on google docs
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.960]   So it's it's like so it's it's something we use a lot but we don't but you can tell no google docs and use it offline
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.520]   You know that right there's so many people using it at the same time
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:04.760]   I just don't know the collision that that you know the reason we use them is because they're
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.280]   I mean ours are actively all the sheets are tied together
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.760]   So like when you change one thing it changes across many sheets and you'll be very complicated
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:19.080]   You could tell i've been using a lot of chrome apps because I still have the original angry birds the google i/o 2010
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.560]   And the gangnam style game
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:27.000]   I think that's just a picture of you and you just like it for that reason like you as sigh
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.680]   The up a gangnam style guy
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:35.640]   Um, all right. So anyway, I'll mention it. It won't be till 2018 that they'll be gone completely
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:40.120]   But they'll start facing those out over the next year hangouts get phased down a lot faster
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.920]   Yeah, I really sometimes I wonder what google's overall strategy is they just
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.080]   It's not very it's baffling because they've had some decent products and
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:55.160]   Either they they combine it with a crap product so no one wants to use it or as it starts to gain steam
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.160]   They say well, we're not gonna support it anymore hangouts is actually a pretty decent
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.280]   Hangouts aren't going away. So the hangouts themselves are staying there
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.720]   It's the hangouts on air
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.680]   The streaming, you know solution that's connected to that and if you look at what most people were using them for
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.160]   I think they were just streaming them talking to one other person
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.120]   I think that was the you know, they didn't need you didn't need 10 people to
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:18.600]   This is a challenge for google because of course they operate at such a massive scale
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:25.240]   Even if only 1% of users adopt something that's made so many people hundreds of thousands or millions of
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.560]   People and those people are all going to be upset
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.640]   And I think it does hurt google because you I have to say when aloe comes out
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:39.480]   I will have some resistance to going all in on it because well, maybe they'll lose interest in three years or whatever and then i'll be stuck again
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.640]   You know, I I don't want to nobody wants to keep going through that process
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:46.520]   It's kind of hurt them and google's really good at coming out of the gate
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:50.120]   With a strong face like being super positive on a new product
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:55.160]   They're launching then right out of the gate and so you get kind of swept up and you're like wow the promise of this is so
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.280]   Cool like yes, of course. I'm going to get in on aloe
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:04.120]   But then it's it's it's the one two three years down the line where they kind of they tear trail off
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:11.320]   It's like they get distracted they see a squirrel and they go right new that new thing and this old thing that was once so promising
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:16.200]   You know, it gets it's kind of left behind in the dust and as a user that's very confusing
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:22.360]   Especially when they've got like five million messaging it's really enormous and like what on earth do I use such a
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.080]   Iodo, right? I mean because we were sitting there and I was talking to the developers and
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.600]   It's different from the IO I attended six years ago
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:35.800]   Where everyone was wide-eyed and very excited about the things that google was rolling out this time now?
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.000]   It's sort of like oh, okay
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.360]   Well, I want to wait two years before I start developing for that because I don't want to start and then have them kill it
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.520]   That's not a good place to be on your google
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.680]   Trying to push out all of these initiatives to get people excited especially at a developer copy
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:53.160]   At some point that whole throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what stick model it fails
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:57.480]   You're too big for that anymore. Give me something that's cooked. Give me something that's ready
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.520]   Give me something that I know you're gonna keep around for more than
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.960]   Just the next executive that gets put in and wants to kill a project
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:09.000]   Well, and I and I when we developed a lot of hangout tools because we were doing a lot of hangouts for as a service and
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.880]   The we kept them all internal like because I didn't want to go through the trouble of externalizing them because I was like
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:16.920]   Oh, I'll go through that trouble and I just didn't know I never just never knew how
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.680]   Solid that ground was going to be to step on it. And so I just was like I'll just I'll use them for my you know
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:28.840]   And it was just easier to keep them internal. I noticed that with duo. I was really reluctant to invite other people to use it
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.080]   It's like oh
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:35.800]   I don't want to put my reputation on the line and get everybody and then everybody says oh, yeah, no
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   I'm not gonna eat and it's oh, it's
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:43.480]   That's another google nevermind forget it. Well, I'm excited it's cross-platform the problem is that I use a lot of other
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.720]   Like I want to get my mom to start using it. She likes using FaceTime
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:54.840]   Because it's easy for her and this would be just as easy. There's a picture of me. She presses it the knock knock thing. She'd probably like right
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.760]   um
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.800]   But I don't want to I'm nervous about getting her in on that and then
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.120]   A year later. Oh, yeah, mom. We got to stop using that. We're gonna use something else
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.840]   And that's the heart the hard part was when folks that aren't used to because for me, I just have a lot of message like I put it on
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.400]   along with you know
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:16.360]   My slack and messenger and hangouts and you know, like it's just kind of like yeah, it's like
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.720]   Hold your is the whole screen. Well, if I hope front
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.960]   You know like what what what?
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.760]   It's worse for android users because we get conflicting
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.920]   You know the manufacturer wants us, you know Samsung wants us to use their messenger
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:33.080]   You start using hangouts Google says oh, don't use hangouts. You should use our messenger
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:40.520]   Facebook you launch Facebook measure. It says why don't you use me? It's a mess. It's really bad and uh, that somebody has to figure this
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:46.280]   Oracle says we're uh, yeah, we we're we're behind this apparently the oracle
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.320]   lobbyists in washington dc
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:54.680]   Uh have there's something called the campaign for accountability. It's a non-profit
[00:59:54.680 --> 01:00:02.040]   It's a mystery group. They won't say who pays for their activities and within the campaign for accountability. There is
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.920]   the google transparency project which exposes
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.280]   Villaines carried out by the search giant
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.160]   Well, apparently that's oracle
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.080]   Oracle you may remember isn't a big suit was google at the moment
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:23.400]   Or and actually what's weird is senior vice president oracle kang look admitted it oracle is absolutely a contributor
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:27.960]   One of many to the transparency project. It's not clear if there are many by the way
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.520]   This is important information for the public to know
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.680]   Yes, it is. What are they what are they talking about with google?
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:42.040]   Specifically with the transparency project well, uh, you push well you want to should we should we find out?
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.640]   What they're what there's I have to admit there's a lot of things I disagree with with it
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.720]   But I don't think of them doing a while back
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.360]   There was an oracle pr
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.640]   Crater who was basically complaining that the reason why the lawsuits were going against oracle
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:01.480]   Was because google has too much mindshare in the public the judge was using google
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:06.680]   Precisely, oh people just like google so they think google can do no wrong and this sounds like an extension of that
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.040]   It's like well if you knew if you knew what google did behind closed doors
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.920]   You wouldn't like them so much if you look at this it looks like a non-profit that it's uh, you know, somebody
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.120]   Google and government explore the data white house kept close tabs on ftc google probe
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.400]   Google pulled white house strings to kill telecomm treaty
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:30.360]   Google's revolving door in the us google's revolving door in europe the revolving door is of course people going from government into google and back
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.560]   Because no other company would ever hire someone from the government
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:39.000]   Google funded speakers dominate policy conferences google pressed on white house visits
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.280]   This is like politics. This is like the kind of stuff you see in political attack ads eric schmitt obama's chief corporate ally
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.160]   Um, and so when you read stories
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.000]   And by the way, this is the new thing to do by the way as you create
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.720]   A kind of a shady group that looks very data heavy and responsible
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:05.720]   You create a lot of data, which you pass along to then mainstream media who picks it up as information and reports it
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.320]   It's a great way to hide your agenda and and slant the news a little bit against your opponents
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.080]   Pretty ironic that they're funding this google transparency project and they're secretly behind
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.240]   transparently
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.560]   Well now you know, okay
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.280]   AT&T apple and google are going to join with the ftc to try to kill
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.920]   Robocalls. Oh, yeah, don't you hate robo calls? It's not going to work
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:41.640]   Uh never does never does they try they keep trying. It's a task force. I'm sorry a strike force
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.320]   That's one from task force. It seems like they could almost do it
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.000]   They could almost do it automatically without anything because every time you get a robo call
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.160]   You know you get that weird silence at the beginning
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.640]   It feels like you can just have a setting on your phone that just said if I get that weird silence at the beginning just people do that
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.720]   Just there's software to do unfortunately
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.400]   The carriers of course don't want to support this because well make a lot of money
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.520]   They make a lot of money in it
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.800]   So it's you have to usually to use these kinds of tools port your phone number through another company
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.120]   They get the call first and then route it to you and they listen for exactly the silence and stuff and they kill robo calls
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.520]   There are a number of services that do this like I think it's robo no more or something like that
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.120]   But I don't know if I want to pass my phone through another company
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.560]   That seems like I think I think I'd deal. I would love the apple like apple have a little switch that I just want to well
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:32.120]   Turn that off. They are participating in this along with verizon and comcast
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:41.160]   Uh, they're going to report to the fcc by october 19th with concrete quote concrete plans to accelerate the development and adoption of new tools and solutions
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.160]   Says at and t chief officer randal stevenson. He's the chairman
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:51.960]   Uh, what they're hoping to do is implement caller id verification standards to help block calls from spoofed phone numbers
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.240]   That's a big part of it right there. You end up getting this call that's totally from your own area code
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.240]   I get so many of those what I do
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.400]   Like what I feel like somewhere along the line. I totally messed up. Well, that's and as a result
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.560]   I'm now getting those I don't like just I don't ever answer a call unless it has the name on it
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.240]   Like it must be someone I know if it's just a phone number. I don't assume it's a robot
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.120]   I and in some systems you can you know at least
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.040]   You know modify a setting that says if this number calls back again block it or or at least I don't see it
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.520]   Don't ring my phone when it calls and then it doesn't bother you
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.480]   But the problem with all of these task force strike forces that they're all they're going to suggest the same thing
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.400]   You find the company that does the robo calls and you can find up to ten thousand dollars per call
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:38.200]   The problem is you can literally create a robo call company overnight, right do ten thousand calls and then shut down here
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.840]   So if they you go out to that company it doesn't exist anymore
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:47.000]   And you can't stop that so unless you're going to change the rules about how you set up a limited liability corporation
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.720]   And accept payment from companies who want you to robo call on their behalf. You can't stop robo calls
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.760]   Tom wheeler chairman of the FCC says
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.640]   This scourge must stop
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.160]   The
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:05.000]   Oh, Tom the bad guys are beating the good guys with technology doing large part to industry in action
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.200]   Everybody agrees robo calls are horrible
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.800]   And there's nothing really nothing you can do. There's a do not call registry, but they don't adhere to that
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.320]   Um, you can there's nothing you can do you just get the calls
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:21.960]   Uh, there are technological solutions. I've used true messenger. That's a swedish company
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.720]   Have you ever tried that on your Android phone? They keep a database of it's kind of crowd sourced of spam calls
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.640]   Bam numbers, but the problem is the really worst people don't use the same number twice
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.760]   They use random numbers spoofing now if you could stop spoofing then things like true caller would work
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.760]   I mean, what about that make it make spoofing calls illegal. I think that's what they're trying to do
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.160]   That's now if you have time on your hands
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.960]   I I used to have a lot of fun with with robo calls like someone would call through and I go hey
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.600]   What do you what do you sell it? And I'm boxing for a little while ago. That is such a good such a great idea
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.320]   Well, someone's at the door. Okay. Can you wait a second?
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.680]   I just put the phone down
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.480]   And if you I found that if you came back every five or six minutes and did that you could hold someone
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:05.160]   Oh you can use them for like over 37 minutes with my record
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.160]   Oh, I love that. That is so great. Yes. That's perfect
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.960]   So you know, you're not really busy you get one of those calls you you got to tell them and the more excited you're like
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.520]   Oh, this is this is exactly what I wanted. Oh, I can't believe that you called right now
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.480]   This is the timing. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. I just got to get something out of it
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.560]   And then you promise I'll be back right back. I'll be back
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.520]   And then you know, there are some people you you do that and what you always felt like you were you blew it
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.760]   When you do that you set them down and then you come back like four minutes later and they were gone and you're like
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.720]   It's the opportunity. I obviously was not
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.720]   Zubern enough about how I was gonna
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.160]   We had I'm still waiting
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.680]   I want one of those tech support calls where they try to get you installed in 2020
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.040]   Oh wouldn't that be great? I have my right it's on this computer right now
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.800]   So that if they try to install malware on my computer it actually takes over their computer
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.600]   Oh, you can't so that's illegal. It's all
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.680]   And they started it. I'm talking theoretically now
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.120]   Wow
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:08.520]   Theoretically there are people doing that aren't them so we had the guy on the new screen savers right karsten the jolly roger phone company
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.920]   It's really it's kind of low tech, but it's hysterical
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.680]   What you do when you get a telemarketer is you conference them in with the jolly roger phone number
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.360]   And then he starts playing a recording
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.680]   Of exactly what you're talking about where
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.440]   You know he'll say wait wait, I'm sorry. I got distracted. What were you saying or?
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:38.520]   It's I should play should I play a little bit of it? Do you remember this? Yeah, I was I was co-hosting. Yeah, it was so funny
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.520]   February 20th. Yeah
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:46.600]   Let's see if I could find they have some they have some sample jolly rogers on here
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.560]   I'll put the link the problem is they go on for a long time
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:53.800]   But you know he he he said well do you ever just wake up and uh
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:58.920]   You can't you can't remember anything and you're like a little groggy. That just happened to me
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:07.560]   So could you start over and then it really is fun to hear people yelling and screaming at him after a while
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.400]   Uh, here we go agent. Not sure if this is a recording
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.680]   Trying to pitch me anyway
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.480]   Can you hear this?
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.440]   Hi mr. mrs.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.720]   Is this
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.240]   Yeah
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.280]   Hi mr.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:28.920]   This is kierson with cat. Oh, you're a real person. So the work though his voice is recorded. It's it's random actually
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.000]   Hey, hang on a second. Hey, honey
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.200]   Yeah, that's perfect. I'm on phone
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:39.560]   Well, we haven't really gotten that far. I'm not sure yet. Sorry. Who who never
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.680]   Can I talk to you later? Okay. Thanks. Fine. Sorry. Okay. I'm back. Oh, this is awesome
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.400]   Not a problem. Can you start over who this? Why are you calling?
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.600]   Yeah, this is kierson
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.560]   I feel sorry for kierson. She's 21. She couldn't get a job out of college. This is the best she could do
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.360]   He telemarker. So this is pretty promising a lot of it. I would do it
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.000]   Is it for you?
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.680]   Question is is it as effective as a recording?
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.960]   It just drives people crazy. I know it's awesome
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:13.000]   So she said everybody did this if we all decided bad for if we all decided to do this though
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.280]   It would like literally shut the whole industry down because they're their whole thing is based on you hanging up immediately like right
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.560]   Not if you're not the kind of person his his software waits for a pause
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.360]   Right
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:33.800]   It's satisfying
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.600]   Oh boy, yeah
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:43.160]   Anything it's a totally work
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.840]   Eventually he says oh a bee laid it on my
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:53.560]   I mean, it's it's it's it's mean, but it's satisfying because we all suffer from that
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.160]   Yes, I do feel bad for that person though. They're just trying to pay some bills
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.440]   Yeah, it's just a marketing when I was looking at shelter like it's just the worst job or a few months because apparently
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:07.240]   At least when I lived in montreal it was like 1996 and I was only there for like half a year
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:13.720]   But um apparently montreal was a hotbed of telemarketing positions and you know they always promise
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.440]   Good money. How horrible was it?
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.000]   Um, I ended up working in three different places before I was like, all right. This is not for me
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.560]   It was pretty bad. I mean one of them was really bad one of them was a lot of hangers or um
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.800]   Yeah, but that kind of came with the territory one of them was uh one of those
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:36.520]   Vacations like hey stand you know stand by we're gonna you have been selected for vacation blah blah and you were lucky if you got
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.040]   I don't know you were doing okay if you got like five sales a week
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:46.280]   So you're talking, you know, I think I think I was working 30 hours a week. Are you a commissioner hourly? Uh, it's commission
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.920]   But you know you're putting you're putting in your time and if you get a sale you get like $90
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.640]   So there was always that that potential that today could be a great day and I can get five sales and wow that just adds up quick
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.840]   Um, but there were there were other ones that were a lot shadier like selling
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.240]   uh white pages to
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:10.680]   Our business listings and in business white pages to companies and it was just a total sham and it was just like and they were everywhere
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.640]   You could get these jobs so easily and I mean it's just yeah as an operator though
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.280]   like like i'm trying to
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:24.200]   Listen to this and put myself on the other side from when I was doing that and I I guess I'd be a little upset
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.360]   But I wouldn't be offended personally because I'd know what it is that I do for a living
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   Yeah, we're wasting your time
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:36.680]   Oh, well then I would quit that place and I would go to a different telemark because I suppose if I was really dead set to be a telemarketer
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.920]   Wow, well, we're glad you didn't become a telemarketer. I am too. It was not very fun
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.840]   Yeah, I have friends, you know getting out of high school and that's what you do in this best job you can get and I feel bad for him
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.440]   But uh, so I'm usually very nice
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.600]   I say put me on your do not call us and thanks have a nice day because I know that they're
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:56.680]   I feel bad for them, but it does get to you after a while for sure. Yeah
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.760]   We're gonna take a break. Jason howl is here former telemarketer Jason

[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:58.600]   What are you so what are the different honoraria titles? I could call it father right father
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.560]   Honorable the reverend reverend can I call you reverend you can call me?
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.880]   I always thought that was a protestant thing a priest can be reverend
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.720]   Reverence are you the right reverend? Uh, that's a bishop the wrong reverend
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.400]   father robert balancer
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:17.640]   Uh padre sj on the twitter. He's also the digital jessuit and we thank the church for letting us have you
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:25.000]   For the time being taking me back from so I hear yeah, what is now you're uh, you told me you have to go to rom sometimes
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.280]   So we've got this thing that the jessuits do every generation or so and i'm part of the next one
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.640]   Wow, I tried to get like an ecumenical council kind of a thing. Yeah, a synod
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.920]   We call it a general congregation. We're going to elect a new leader
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.520]   Oh wow, and then we kind of set the agenda for the the jessuits for the next 10 15 years
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.840]   So the jessuits are
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.800]   A subgroup of catholics. There's fransiscans. There's dominicans
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:59.000]   I always think of them as uh abbots not abbots friars as monks, but they're not monks
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.200]   No, jessuits are very non-monk. That's that's part of our terrorism
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.160]   So we we are on the largest order of the catholic church
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:11.000]   Yeah, and we're known for schools. So george town boss and college. Those are all ours a lot of great schools
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.560]   Uh, and of course the pope is a jessuit
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:20.040]   And I should mention that one of my heroes was a jessuit priest and a teacher lassal. I think
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.720]   Uh john mclawcla mclawcla grew past this week
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.480]   He did 34 years of shows and it didn't miss a show till the last one where he fell ill
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:34.280]   34 shows years of shows without missing. I watched them every sunday when I did too
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.480]   As a kid I would always question and I have to mention this is why we do this what we do
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.280]   This is he was my inspiration for this round table style
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.080]   uh show although i'm not as uh
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.880]   What would you call it flinty as?
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.600]   As he had a style
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.200]   Wrong, he had no style wrong
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:56.040]   Imagine to it if you just went around the table and said no that's wrong megan
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.800]   No, Jason, but I loved that I loved that style and I tried to do that at first
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.480]   But it's just not me. I can't I can't be like that, but I really do love that style
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.800]   We have another jessuit you might have heard of who's that the governor of california?
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:14.920]   Jerry brown he was a jessuit. He went to the seminary. He never got a dame. He was never ordained. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That's right. I forgot about that
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:20.440]   Yeah, we have a couple there's a few there agents every see you don't say that because then now see people are going to conspiracy theory
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.840]   Wait, wait, hold on. They're gonna cut this this
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:25.720]   The jessuits
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:31.480]   Now that's gonna get to the pope and you're gonna be in trouble stop it not get off
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:34.120]   No, we love him father robert balissary really represents
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.040]   Uh the the order very well and that is a great host onto it

[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:34.120]   It'll be a little rough. It's not quite done. Although we do have the the bricks and the arch have been put in the windows are almost done
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.560]   Uh for our new set and we'll do that tomorrow and you could tune in for tnt tomorrow as well
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.000]   All we're gonna do all the shows it might be a little rocky at first a little rough
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.920]   Might not look as polished as it will be but uh, I think it's functional and most people just listen anyway
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.760]   Yeah, that's what I keep saying
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.160]   Yeah, just listen anyway
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:17:01.240]   Our show today brought to you. Well, if they were paying attention, they would notice that many of you except Alex have excellent clean shave and face
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:04.520]   Thank you
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:12.760]   Well done. That's thanks to harry's actually i don't know. Do you use harry's lisa loves her harry's she really likes it harry's
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:17.720]   Is the they they sell the men the great shave every man deserves
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.480]   But uh, there's no reason why a woman couldn't use it as well
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:27.160]   You know how razor companies are always changing the handle putting out new models. Oh, look. We've had a 17th blade
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:33.000]   Well, uh, and of course they raise the price each time harry's does not believe in doing that
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.320]   They completely improve their razors all the time the price has never changed about half the price
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:46.760]   Of what you'd pay for that expensive jalette blade of the at a drug store just two dollars a blade and now they've really improved these
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:52.680]   The handles are new the soft texture, but I think we should also talk about the new features in the blade itself
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:58.680]   They'd have a softer flex hinge for a more comfortable glide and this was something I I really wondered about
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:03.960]   You know the the very expensive drugster blades have that extra blade at the top of six blade there
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:10.440]   For getting it, you know under the under the nose or the hard to reach places. Anyway harry's has it now if that's something you care about
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.800]   That sixth blade they have a lubricating strip of course
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.160]   And they have the textured handle for more control when it's wet. This is the new harry's handle
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.520]   And if you are new to harry's you can get this for a reduced
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:28.760]   Price harry's was founded by two friends who wanted to offer great shaves at a fair price
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.320]   And they did the smartest thing I can imagine they actually bought the factory that makes the blades
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.000]   In germany one of two big blade factories they bought it
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.040]   And that way they're selling it's really factory direct to you. They're selling you the blades
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.000]   They make and design for performance and quality and they sell them for half the price
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.960]   Quality always 100 guaranteed and if you don't your love your shave harries will fully refund you
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:59.080]   The way you start though is with with a kit you need the weighted razor handle of your choice and these harry's kits are really a great deal
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.160]   You get uh
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.960]   The razor three blades you get the travel cover and you get a full size
[01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:13.160]   Uh, uh, bottle of the shaving foam. This is the the shave gel the foaming shave gel. They also have a cream
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.800]   I kind of like the cream. That's what I use but you get to pick
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:20.600]   And you pay no more than $15 for this. This is the Truman set
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:24.840]   If you want a metal handle they have the new grippy metal handles are beautiful the new winston set
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.000]   That's 10 bucks more but in both cases

[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.840]   From the new
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.560]   East side it's gonna take a while to get used to saying the east side studio
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.120]   I made that name up
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:17.800]   Mostly because I wanted to play moving on us to the east side
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:23.320]   And then I realized the next line was to what a deluxe apartment in the sky
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.520]   And I thought that's not really what I think of this as a deluxe apartment in the sky
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.480]   Could we just call it tests like the east side studio test test. Oh, I like that
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:40.040]   Tess that's better. I like that. It's personified. I don't like saying i'm gonna be in test for the next eight hours
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:46.200]   Jeez, that's gonna get me in. Oh, no, never mind. You could say east side studios. You could say
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:59.080]   My son is a student at cu boulder. He's gonna get to try this new wireless broadband network that google is launching wireless
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:03.560]   So google made a lot of noise with their gigabit
[01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:10.040]   Broadband that they're offering in very limited cities and never did quite make it to petal remember the competition
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.560]   We tried to we worked on it. We worked on it. We tried to get it but put it in here
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.120]   Thanks to sonic that i'm okay
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.520]   Because what do we have here 20 gigabits?
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.760]   10 20 gigabits
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.760]   We have fiber in here
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   10 is it 10 or 20?
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.520]   10 gigabits symmetric
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.480]   Frankly passed four or five gigabits. You don't really notice the difference
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.960]   But it's really nice to have that kind of speed
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:34.600]   Thank you sonic net for that
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.680]   But google is gonna start rolling out wireless and I think this is kind of key
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.480]   To getting the next level google's realized as verizon did it's very expensive to put fiber in there 500 dollars
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:52.760]   Afoot something like well, I think a lot of the problems with the rollout for a lot of locations is that they had to have cities that had the right
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.640]   uh ownership of right of ways right
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:22:00.280]   You know, it's very hard to do like so there's all the there was incredible amounts of red tape and
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:06.680]   A lot and obviously the wireless is still challenging because you what you had then now you're negotiating is where do you put the transmitters?
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:11.080]   Right, but a lot easier, but a lot easier than digging. Yeah, they started in Kansas city
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.320]   They then they went to provo. They're in Austin
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.080]   But according to a recent wall street journal, it was just a story
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:22.920]   It was just too expensive in the company now wants to find a better way either lease existing networks
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:29.080]   Or go wireless. So they're doing a trial in 24 us cities boulder will be the first
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:34.440]   Um, so that's I think that's that's exciting. That's really uh really good news
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.600]   They've been they've been playing with this tech for a while
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:42.120]   Is it now so I wanted to ask is this 5g is we talked about 5g last week and I got it very excited about it
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:45.880]   So, um, if it's like the technology that they tested in San Francisco
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:53.160]   Last year it actually uses three different sets of radios. So you have a higher a lower frequency radio to do the long haul
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   That's gonna transfer mass amounts of data connect the towers with each other
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:04.840]   Then there's a like a micro mesh at 433 megahertz that connects blocks and then you get down to
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:11.720]   More ism 2.4. So it's not wife five, but it's wife. I like it's wife
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:20.280]   Like the last link is Wi-Fi. Okay, but so they have a microwave link at the higher at the for to the head end or to whatever the
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:28.520]   The root places and then Wi-Fi from that which works and the technology was proven to be able to do a very nice mesh
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.280]   But the problem is you're just running into fundamentals of physics here
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.200]   There's only so much arith energy you can pump into the air before it becomes saturated
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:43.720]   And it's not like a cable where you can saturate that cable and it won't affect anything else if you start saturating our f bands
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:49.400]   It's going to affect everything in the air. Right. Well and also there's this this will have different challenges in different cities
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.360]   Because there's a lot of cities that have an RF component that is very complex like San Francisco being one of them where there's just
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.200]   I know when we work with
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.840]   A lot of electronics that we have very noisy. There's a lot already there's a lot of traffic already there
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.960]   Right, and so it will work in different levels
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:12.120]   There's also the legal issue because thanks to people like Comcast and Verizon many states have laws against municipal Wi-Fi
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.800]   I think this gets around a lot of that because Google's actually providing is the actually the service they're non-coa- that's a commercial operator
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:24.680]   The city is not paying google to put that in as that's important. That's important. It's like hey
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:30.760]   You didn't pay us. We're we're doing this on our own right? Although the city obviously would love this
[01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:37.080]   Right. It's a good thing for a city to have high speed internet and this is all that's left because the FCC just got shut down
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.880]   They just lost a higher right ruling on
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.920]   municipal fiber networks
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.440]   Which is ridiculous because we're talking about cities where Verizon
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.680]   ATT etc. They don't want to come in there's not enough there for them to make money
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:57.880]   But or outlining areas right side of where municipal Wi-Fi has already offered reminds me a little story of a dog in a manger
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.720]   I remember reading about some time ago. I don't know. I'm looking at you
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.640]   You remember that story, right? Remember that story
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:11.240]   Is that in the Bible or that's just a story we tell after the fact? I don't think the dogs actually in bible
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:14.840]   That's the one
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:20.520]   There's not going to be any internet internet access at this main drum. I know you want to tweet. I'm here
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:22.920]   You're not I'm just saying that
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920]   Oh, and gee the savior of the world is here
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:31.160]   At least you can tweet it. Well, maybe not Twitter is a honey pot for a holes according to BuzzFeed
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:40.440]   Um, and then Time magazine just published a cover story on trolls. I I love the story because it said
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.160]   Writing this story is like putting out a pan of baklava for bears
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.840]   It is it is it is not the right thing to do
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:52.920]   But sometimes we just have to talk about trolling this BuzzFeed article
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   We talked about last week
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:26:00.840]   Really kind of I think opened the lid on on the issues going on with twitter
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.880]   um
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:09.400]   I don't know why I brought it up because there's new filter. They have a new filter. Yeah, that's right
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.160]   So tell me about that. I don't know so it rolled out on
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.880]   iPhone on a friday or thursday or friday
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.160]   It makes it easier for you to control your settings
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:24.920]   You can also just not see people that you don't follow you have to use that
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.000]   in the twitter
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   official twitter app on ios
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.400]   So so you can control it so that you don't see any of this stuff. So what do you say?
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.560]   Well, I don't have it on android yet. What does the setting say?
[01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:39.000]   It's I don't think that I I updated. Yeah, I don't want to use it
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   Like I want to hear from everyone
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.880]   It was the quality filter which apparently verified users have had for i've had the quality filter
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.720]   And it's rolling out of the quality filter because when I turn it on I don't see anything
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:52.440]   Yeah, I get a friday tweets. It's nothing
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.200]   everybody
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.560]   I don't know if that's a statement about the quality of twitter or just but
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:04.520]   It does it it I don't see part of my problem is I want to know if there's abuse and harassment going on right?
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.880]   Right me too
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:11.400]   At the same time. I like others I get on twitter and I feel like my life is going downhill. I just get depressed
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.280]   What should I do about that?
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.840]   I like to mute people so that they can continue to yell and they don't know and they have no idea
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.880]   The problem is only it's only muted for you. Everybody else is seeing it
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:27.800]   But I mean most of the accounts the troll accounts they have no followers or they have like they have 14 followers all of which are their
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.600]   Vams, yeah, they're sock so they can yell to themselves as much as they want if they make some feel better. They're great
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.320]   I see that as outreach to the the poor
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.720]   I think this is such a personal thing
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.760]   I mean everyone has their own experience on twitter and you know my experience is different than other people's experience
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:51.560]   I wouldn't say like you know for anyone to not use these but for me like I just don't experience that much
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.840]   Hatred I don't experience violence or threats or anything like that
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:00.920]   And so I want to see when people disagree with me. I want to see that I want to see that's the problem is it's very hard to titrate that
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.880]   Well, is that abuse or just somebody who says you're wrong you're full of it. It doesn't always feel great
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:12.360]   But you know what I want to see that right? Yeah, that'd be correct. Well, I don't think that and I don't think that the problem with twitter and the problem with
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:20.040]   trolling is really us filtering what's coming to us it is how it's going through the entire ecosystem and affecting
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.440]   I mean, I guess if I google it you find it. I mean it's there. It's just it is a
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.360]   Oh the world in general. Yeah, the well
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.720]   There's just the echo chamber that it builds quickly, you know of
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.240]   You know and admittedly you look at twitter like if I'm
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.800]   If I'm upset, you know, it's a great place. I don't do it on facebook
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.800]   So it's fine. You know, there's different like on facebook
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.320]   I use facebook and I'm talking about cool things and I'm doing this stuff
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:49.240]   But and twitter I you know twitter I also talk about things that I think are cool or things that I want to announce or things that I
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:54.040]   You know, whatever, but definitely the place that that as my daughter would say I think I said is on another show
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:59.320]   It is my daughter would say, you know, you know fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to twitter
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:02.280]   You're seven year old for that?
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.280]   No, my old 21 year old
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.280]   Oh, that did it.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.520]   You know, yeah, that's so true though, right?
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.320]   But it's the point.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.360]   You know, like I'm you're mad
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:14.920]   You know, but if you have enough like if you build up enough followers, you know, you do get to a point where you're like
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:18.360]   Really, you're not gonna give me a seat on that plane. You know, like I had a seat on that plane
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.880]   You just took it away and then you're like you tweet dear united and then next thing you know
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.320]   I hate to do it. I don't I've done it like twice. I've been so tempted to do that
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.600]   I've done it twice and and it was like I had a $60,000 camera
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:33.960]   And that they were not gonna let me carry on. Yeah, I knew that you get some satisfaction by tweeting it
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.440]   Oh, yeah, was it this one because I wouldn't let you carry that
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.720]   Looks like it really does look like something else
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.720]   You should see it. You should see it in the x-ray
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:48.360]   Those are the lenses they all like like little springs going back into a center thing like dirty bomb
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.480]   Excuse me, sir. Is that an atomic bomb or a hydrogen bomb?
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:55.720]   Because we do carry those on and every time you go through TSA, they're like, excuse me
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.520]   I need to open that because they just want to see it. You know, they have this whole thing like it
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:03.000]   What could that be if they've ever seen anything like it's uh, but it doesn't you know, it doesn't
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.960]   It doesn't look bad other than it looks very complex with a whole many things point point at a center unit
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.960]   Which I feel like I need a lightsaber to train
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:13.080]   Like that or like goodness it is
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.920]   Put your helmet on. Let's see how you do it. Put your plastic helmet on lovely
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:23.720]   Okay, okay, wait, wait, that devil devil's advocate because there's gonna be people who listen to any discussion about trolls twitter
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.800]   Wherever might be and they're gonna say why not just ignore why not just block them?
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.320]   Why not grow thicker skin so right? How do you answer that?
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.080]   Well, here so here's the problem we see we do a lot of events that have a lot of
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:43.160]   Viewers on on things like youtube and so on so forth and what happens is is all those trolls basically make the entire comment system useless
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:48.760]   You know, like it's just it's just completely so that's true. It's just my company. Yeah, publications like NPR
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.280]   Just turn on our mom getting rid of all their comments. Yeah, you know toxic
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:59.240]   Yeah, and so and so that and and that's why for instance, my you know, we we spent a lot of time building tools that led us basically
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:03.000]   And we actually learned how you know the hazoo stuff that we did the questioning right just them
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.200]   Created a place where trolls could come just to learn how to yeah block them. Yeah
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:15.640]   And twit turned out to be a great like lab. I'm a pioneer in trolling. In fact, we turned off our comments 10 years ago
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.040]   Well, we learned there's better ways to do it
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:23.080]   I mean the the big thing is is that what you know and I think youtube started going down that that way and then everyone got upset
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:28.040]   It's as soon as you know who people are like when we started the pixel core, you know 10 or 15 years ago
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.440]   Uh one of the first things we did is everyone has their own photo everyone has their own name
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.040]   A lot to be said
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:40.760]   As soon as you do that suddenly it was like people are much nicer. There was very little it was always within a tempered level
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:44.840]   It's the it's the anonymous nature of it now. It doesn't mean the anonymous nature shouldn't exist
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.880]   You want to be able to have people say what needs to be said anonymously
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.720]   But on a general process and I think that we're going to see organizations
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.920]   Find ways to
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:32:00.760]   Tighten and a lot of it has to do with if you're gonna you're gonna come back to my channel over and over again
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.920]   I can start saying
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:06.120]   I'm beside you're a bad actor, you know, and and you know, we're not gonna listen to you
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:08.840]   You know, so you want you don't want to be like you ignore it
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.240]   You want as a channel at a channel level you want to say
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:15.240]   I want to flag these folks and that and no one can see them on my channel
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:20.680]   Because it was on this it was on this show that couple of weeks ago that Jason calicanis said that he had heard inside
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:26.040]   Story that twitter was going to roll out verification for everybody right now. It's only for
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:33.720]   Celebrities movers and shakers people like that. I just got it. Did you just congratulations? I'm verified
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.720]   I think if they roll
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.720]   I did not
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:42.200]   Defiable one of 187,000 there aren't many
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:46.360]   Yeah, and I think if they rolled that out and let everybody verify
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:52.840]   Not any criterion about who gets to verify but just make it ever then you then reasonably a filter would make sense
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:58.760]   Then you turn on the filter and you say I only want to see people who are willing to stand behind their comments with their own name
[01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:04.360]   Uh, then that's different. I think that's it. I just wonder how how twitter has okay
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:10.200]   So because we've been talking about this whole twitter troll, you know problem for forever years since twitter began
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:14.040]   Obviously, it's a long-term, you know thing that twitter is grappling with
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:19.960]   How did they how did this filter exist and it was really only kept for a very small percentage of people?
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:24.600]   I understand the the application of it for someone who has millions of followers and everything
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.080]   It might be a little bit better used in that scenario
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:32.040]   But when it comes to your users who are exposed to certain action from people like I feel like any
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.800]   Anyway to be able to control would be nice would be nice
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.360]   Just I'm surprised that it took them a year and a half since the point of creation of this tool to
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:44.680]   That article is about like they're just disorganized in this sense. They don't really know what they're doing
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:49.960]   They're not they're primarily male, which is maybe they're not experiencing the same kind of harassment
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:56.280]   So yeah, that was what the article said essentially, but I also just think it's it's personal like I'm not saying I don't block or mute people
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.360]   I sometimes do but you know, it's my choice and I like having that choice
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.920]   And I think that we I
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:08.120]   Think there's a lot of sensitivity to also having large numbers of people leave your service because they're upset that you
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.320]   You know, they're they don't care even if they even if it was a
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.120]   20 million
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.760]   Trolls that left the newspapers just gonna say 20 million people or 50 million people have left twitter
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:26.360]   You know and and and everyone is so concerned in these social networks of any kind of losing any ground of the number of active users
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.480]   That that you know, I can see why they would hide that for a long time and and only have those tools to you know
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.640]   For certain people because they don't want to they're afraid of getting the reaction that youtube got
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.400]   You know, you know youtube decided we're gonna make everybody use their g plus account
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.960]   It wasn't to push g plus as much as it was to make
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.160]   Why I think to make youtube more usable?
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:49.560]   um and uh and you know the youtube community and so the problem is you also have a culture
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:53.640]   Of what people expect you to do and this is why they joined and and there's this
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.080]   You know, whether you agreed to that or not because you let it go for that long
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:59.400]   There's also a pendulum here because
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.960]   Not all trollish behavior is what we would consider trolling
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:09.960]   You know, it's there's nothing wrong about being a pervacatour about throwing out a question every once in a while to get people talking
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.480]   That's how you get good conversations. Yeah, rather than an echo chamber, right?
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.240]   I think
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:21.000]   We we made a mistake as a digi-rati calling it trolling. You call it what it is. It's stocking
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.160]   You're getting stalked you're getting you're getting bullied. Well, there's different. There's bullying. There's stalking
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.960]   There's abusive. There's hate. There's a lot of yeah
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:33.800]   There's as many different kinds of trolling is there are trolls and that pendulum's just gonna keep going back and forth
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:38.280]   We're gonna get too tight and then they're gonna oh, we're gonna loosen it up because we've been too restrictive
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.440]   And it will get too loose and go back and forth and back and forth. That's that's not twitter
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:49.080]   That's not facebook. That's conversations throughout there is a kind there is a criticism though here of twitter and you kind of
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.720]   alluded to it in a way they've had this for a year and a half for celebrities and twitter is not any different than facebook or
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.280]   Frankly any other business where people?
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:06.600]   Celebrities get treated very differently. Yeah, and you see that not only not only with the verified profiles and the tools the special privileges of being verified
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:12.120]   You also see it with their video platform. They're like they're very right. They have stars twitter has stars in your eyes
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.760]   They want to be really special when it comes to celebrity
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:20.040]   Entertainment and sports and all this kind of stuff that's very validating to twitter as a company
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.880]   And i twitter and facebook have apps for celebrities to use that are better. They don't have ads
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.960]   They're better than the other apps
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:32.600]   Well, and i think that also i think twitter in many ways lost its soul when it decided it was going to suddenly promote like years ago
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:38.680]   You know when the the high adjusted user list when they started doing the suggested user and they started pushing all these stars
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:43.880]   I think that they really lost this this ground swell if you look at if you look at youtube for instance
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:51.640]   YouTube has a whole set of celebrities that the mainstream doesn't even know exists right if youtube had tried to pick winners it would have failed miserably
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:57.080]   miserably, you know because then then then they're just more of the same but what what youtube did really well was that they
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.840]   They basically just let these stars build up and they help build them up
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:05.720]   And and and it's it's hard when we we explain like uh, we talked to people about doing their events
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.800]   You know we're doing these live events and we always go
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:12.440]   Yeah, so bringing someone from hollywood is not particularly useful like just so you know like like if you're doing a live stream
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:19.160]   What you want are our twitter those are the and youtube stars and really the youtube stars like like that's what's gonna get you viewers
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:25.560]   You know, you know vidcon was loaded with people i've never heard of who had screaming fans
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:31.640]   I mean justine has to go around with her bodyguards, you know, I mean like, you know, but the mainstream is seen, you know
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:37.240]   Justine has her like pop up every once in a while, right, but most i would say most people have no idea who i justine is
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.120]   Right, uh, but obviously in her world. She's huge. Yeah, she's as big as Beyonce
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.320]   Yeah, yeah, and so and so it's but we always try to explain to people like that is
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:49.960]   That but it always bad gave up because if from somebody like me from an old school
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.880]   Media point of view what I see those people do I don't understand why there's celebrities
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.120]   What makes them so?
[01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:05.400]   I mean, it's not the traditional definition of celebrity that we have or of you know, I mean that we're not talking johnny karsen here
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.800]   We're not talking jerry lo is here
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.600]   There in that vertical that they're in they serve that my my son very specific niche
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.240]   I might my eight-year-old son watches minecraft if if I let him go he'll watch
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:20.200]   You know hours of someone sitting there
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:24.760]   It's the new stardom the old stardom was I look at someone I say
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:29.560]   You are someone I will never be and it's amazing. I get to see part of your life
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.880]   The new stardom is this person's like me
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.200]   This person has the same interest as that's he does the same thing that I do every day
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.720]   And it I like in fact his PewDiePie has gotten more successful. He's kind of being more rejected by his fans
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.200]   Oh, you've sold out you became hollywood
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.520]   Uh, well and I think that the other thing
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:50.520]   From the interactions that we've had with with for instance youtube stars
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.800]   Uh, they're not nearly as much like everyone thinks that I mean, you know, they they come across that way and everything else
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.440]   But these are folks that are very organized
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:05.320]   They are they work very hard and they like when they when they tweet when they post how they post what they say all the
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:09.640]   Things are good example. She knows exactly what she's doing. She's very very smart about how she's doing it
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:15.240]   Omg. Yeah, great example. I mean because his persona online is he's kind of disheveled and he's random
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:22.040]   Far from everything is so planned when he tweets all of his content when he creates it who he's hired to do the the production
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:29.400]   Right. And so he you know, he's he's doing a persona. Is that shared? Is that lore and knowledge shared between these people?
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.880]   How do they learn this?
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.880]   They said they know they they sit up there on panels and they talk about how they how they do that stuff and youtube does a pretty
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:42.200]   You could go to somewhere like that and study it and say I want to be this person here
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:47.080]   Look, it's it's one thing to say if I practice shooting a lot. I'll be an NBA star
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.480]   There's a lot that goes into becoming an NBA star
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:54.120]   Is it like that in the same way that it's not just practice you a hat?
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.120]   What what is the vertical that you're going to
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.640]   Serve that is going to be different than something that everybody else is doing?
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:01.160]   There's there's room for a handful of them
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:03.640]   But there's there's only so many people that are going to be all super star opening
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:08.280]   Opening toys. Yeah, that's my vertical. It feels like their verticals are being invented
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:14.520]   That we didn't even know existed they're being invented as we go like you who knew that opening toys would be a thing
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.480]   No one knew until they're doing that Megan you should be
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.840]   Every week exactly well, they're the same gatekeepers, right?
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.640]   I mean these kids are deciding what they want to see and there's so much of it
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.520]   So your kids watch different things than your kids that watch different things than your kids and my kids and you know
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:33.080]   The kids that you work with and so, you know, it's it's just we we don't know
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.280]   There's so much and so and also it's a lot of luck
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.120]   I think you could do everything right and not be lucky too like you're in the right place in the right time
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.720]   That sort of thing, but it's not the same
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:47.880]   It's not the old media where like there were a bunch of old guys in a room that were like what can we make for kids that we can put ads on?
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:52.360]   That's just not what it is anymore. Well and and and it's just these random, you know, the the
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.880]   I you know, I couldn't believe I was like, oh, I wanted to show someone
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:41:00.360]   I didn't want to try to explain it. I was just like, oh, just go watch a movie on how to how to solder an XLR cable
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:03.720]   And there's and we'll sit down on YouTube. Oh, no, there's a whole page is there
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:09.400]   And there's like there's pages of guys doing it and different techniques in the process and some are better video and some and some
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.320]   Of them are like hundreds of thousands of people have watched this video on how to do an XLR
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:17.400]   But that's the kind of thing is that and and that's the power of I mean, I don't know
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:21.320]   Not to be too willing but that's the power of the internet is that you can have these niches that are no longer
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.920]   a local niche of what happens in pettaluma. It's a niche of
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.840]   There is a hundred thousand people spread around the world that are interested in
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:33.480]   You know the world's a big place. They're a billion and a half people on the internet
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:39.000]   And so it doesn't yeah, there's gonna be more niche a lot of cones. Yeah, it's pretty actually it's pretty exciting
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:44.600]   That's it's the other the other side of the twitter thing the other side of the youtube's comment thing is yeah
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:50.360]   It's democratizing that means people all people get a chance to talk some of them are annoying
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.040]   Some of them are the next, you know big thing, but it's also it is what's changing
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:42:00.600]   You know how we look at law enforcement for instance? I mean, I think that's a hard conversation
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:04.280]   You know will Smith, but I think we said it best where he goes, you know, it's not that law enforcement got any worse
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:05.880]   Is it started getting filmed, right?
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:10.680]   You know and and so the the fact that we you know, it's it's been the same and and I think that the thing that
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:15.960]   You know, we're starting to see now with you know, we start to see movies, but we're gonna see probably in the next two years
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:19.320]   Basically a feedback loop where you see
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:25.000]   You know a live stream that creates a crowd reaction that feeds into the live stream
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.320]   You know, you know, like so, you know, something's happening on this corner in in petaluma people watch it live and go
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:37.240]   Do something about it while it's still streaming and I think that's scary, but I mean, but that's the but
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:43.720]   That's within the next two years. I think we're gonna start seeing these feedback loops of people because people have the ability to stream from their phones
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.280]   You know that that kind of stuff is gonna happen and I think that it you know, it's gonna change a lot
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:57.000]   We're gonna why there's not like the I've been stopped by a police officer app where you push one app one button and it automatically starts recording and sending to the cloud
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.840]   They ACL you mix it. Oh, they do. Yeah. Wait, really? Yeah
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.880]   So you yeah, it's an ACL you app
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:10.200]   I don't think it's actually called. I've been stopped by a police officer. It's the same idea. It immediately starts streaming
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.240]   Starts recording and it's illegal in some states, but it's illegal
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.080]   Oh, because you're filming a police officer in some states not all most states. It's not
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:26.120]   Um, let's take a break. Uh, we're gonna do a live week ahead. So prepare your script
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:30.680]   Okay, get the teleprompter is ready. I don't know what you do for that
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:35.240]   But we'll get that ready a second before we do do we we have a promo for this week, uh kerson

[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.080]   massive
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:24.600]   misreporting
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:28.600]   Across the entire industry of this microsoft
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.240]   secure boot golden key
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:33.640]   That did not happen. Oh
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:42.040]   They use the term golden key and and because they're right up was itself very confusing and dense
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:46.680]   What this actually was was an implementation design error
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.240]   That's all that is. There's no key involved
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.800]   All right close the door

[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.920]   Our editors work fast. We're gonna cut the ribbon in for the first time ever
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.040]   Yeah
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:12.040]   Side studio. All right
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:19.960]   To it broadcasting from the capital of the free world petaluma california
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:25.160]   By the way, I want to yeah, that was nice our editors worked fast because that was uh stuff
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:30.840]   Some of that was five minutes ago. Just a minute ago. Um, I do want to give a lot of kudos to Steve Gibson because
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.880]   Everywhere in the media and we reported it too. I reported it
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:41.400]   We talked about that microsoft golden key and I got fooled because you know, I tried to read the text and uh, you know, it was
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:47.320]   It was jiggling around a bit, but it looked like there was a bunch of hexadecimal code in there that was a key
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.880]   Uh, he read it closely and paid attention and more importantly understood it
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:54.520]   And said that's not exactly what happened at all
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.400]   Well, I think we were and the media in general was so anxious
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:02.520]   To find a story about why having a golden key is a bad idea
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:08.360]   So that we could spank the nsa and the fbi and and members of congress who want us to have a backdoor key
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:12.600]   That we were we wanted that story to be the case. It wasn't it had nothing to do with a golden key
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:19.560]   Um, it was an error and implementation of microsoft's part didn't really affect people as badly as uh, it might have
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:22.920]   Um, and i'm sure they will fix it at some point
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:27.000]   But uh, although difficult to fix because it breaks a lot of software if they do fix it
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:34.840]   Anyway, if you want to know the details, uh, I doubt very much you'll see uh articles on the uh, internet starting tomorrow saying
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.200]   Oh, it wasn't a golden key
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:41.560]   But if you want to know the details you can listen to steve security now from uh wednesday because he does talk about what it really was
[01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.360]   And what it really means as opposed to what we thought and I include myself in this what we thought it was
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:51.240]   Uh, we've got a great week ahead planned for you in the brand new east side studios mega moroni
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.000]   What are you gonna be covering this week? Uh, well, hopefully new get will come out nugah
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:59.320]   I it's called nugah. I call it nugah. I don't let any nugah
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:03.640]   I go back and forth because it's fun to new good be undecided. Yeah
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:09.480]   And so when nugah came out that was when Jason and I were gonna switch phones and he's gonna try a couple of sonya
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:14.040]   I'm i'm gonna bring you my iphone and you're gonna be using my iphone six s plus
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:19.720]   I'll wipe it for you. Okay, clean off the finger press. I'll use one of those mirrored which one you want to try the note
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:22.600]   Yes, yeah
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:27.640]   Okay, you're willing to be like, uh, oh, I don't want to go back to my iphone
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:34.040]   Uh, I'm willing to try are you willing to say? Oh, I don't want to go back to android that would kind of ruin your
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.120]   It's really difficult to do that
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:38.440]   Do so much with android for this
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:44.280]   For a job. I'll be using a blackberry. Yeah, and we're gonna make him use a banger. Yeah. Yeah. I got a passport
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:46.280]   Alex you got a windows phone. Excellent
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:49.240]   I'm ready burn
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.040]   Uh, well, of course gawkers gonna shut down this week
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.520]   Um, you know some some are mourning it
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:58.200]   We had a great interview last week with willary miss about that good reasons to mourn it good
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:03.000]   You know they there still needs to be gatekeepers for the tech elite people who are willing to
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.760]   Speak honestly about them and I'm sure there will like a lot of those people are going to other places in gawker
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:14.680]   Life stage launches this week. That's a facebook app, but you don't have to have a facebook account. It was created by michael seaman
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:22.200]   He's a 19 year old product guy from facebook has a great background definitely recommends looking into him if you're a young app developer
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.840]   It's for only people 21 and younger
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:28.600]   So you can use it if you're 22, but you can't see any of the other people stuff
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:32.120]   So it's people to try to get people, you know hooked into the facebook
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:39.880]   You know atmosphere so but you don't have to have a facebook account which anyone you know most 21 year olds and under are not interested in facebook
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:43.080]   So check out that friday is pluto is not a planet day
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.360]   2006 how dare they have a day for this
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:52.120]   That was when pluto was still better of course from planets to dwarf planet
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:54.840]   And also this week in 1991
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.880]   August 23rd tim burners lee opened the world wide web to new users
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:05.320]   So it was publicly available in august 6 but new users were allowed to come in 1991 august 23rd
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.400]   And there are some security conferences this week cyber security for critical infrastructure
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:12.280]   In exchange in san diego energy sec
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:15.880]   2016 in anahime and the cyber security summit in
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.560]   Chicago
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:22.600]   So wow you got a lot of stuff. Yeah, august is like security month security may have been
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:29.000]   We had a huge def con reveal last week and now and new stuff will be coming. Thank you mega moroni
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.200]   That's tnt monday through friday back to its time of four pm pacific seven p.m. Eastern
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:39.320]   2300 utc from the brand new east side studios tomorrow
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:41.560]   Barrow i'm
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:42.600]   Right
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.360]   I do want to talk about that galker story. I also want to talk about the nsa's
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.560]   equation group and what that leak meant but first
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.920]   Let's talk about this this is i'm so excited. I just got the new automatic. Did you know they have a new one?
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:04.120]   I know it's exciting so we've talked about automatic before this goes on the obd 2 port of your car every car since 96
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:09.000]   Has one you may not even know it it's right below your steering wheel. It looks like the kind of thing
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.120]   Well, yeah, that's the dealership. They're going to plug in a machine to that
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:17.400]   But you could plug the automatic into it and get the kind of information that previously has only been available
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:24.760]   Uh to a dealer the automatic will give you uh things like well, that's what this this is what that check engine light means
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.080]   It pairs to your phone via bluetooth
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:34.280]   You can get all sorts of information about how much gas you're using what your fuel efficiency is if you're a you know a good driver
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.320]   I get a score as I drive with my automatic
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:42.680]   And this is cool the new one the automatic pro and by the way, it's not just a few bucks more
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:46.520]   Which is really great. It is a little heavier because inside of here. I feel it
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:52.280]   There's a 3g radio in here and no monthly fees or subscription for five years
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:59.640]   So this automatic now is on the internet which gives it a huge range of things it can do for instance
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:06.520]   You'll always know where your vehicle is parked at any time or put this in your car and you can track your vehicle even when you're not with it
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:10.280]   So when annabella starts driving in a couple of years you put this in the car
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.280]   And you can have even geofencing because it'll know exactly where she is
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:18.760]   And you could say annabella you're not allowed to go outside city limits or you're not allowed to go to the highway
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:21.240]   And you can actually look on your phone. You'll be able to see where she is
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:23.400]   It works with if this than that
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:27.560]   Which means you can have it hooked up and do all sorts of things. I have it hooked up with my amazon echo
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:33.560]   I can say how much gas is left in the car and it'll tell me it doesn't do that with a tesla because there's no gas
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:40.280]   But it does do that with your automobile that uses petrol as they say you can link it to your nest thermostat
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:43.720]   So as you drive home, it'll turn the heat up or the air conditioning on
[01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:46.200]   Uh, you can even ask alexa
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:49.960]   Where did I park my car? Oh, I'm sorry a lot of people are just going to ask
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:56.760]   See if you had the if you had this and you even could get human help in a crash the automatic pro
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:51:59.240]   detect severe accidents and
[01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:03.080]   Calls the train responders for you even if you cannot
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.480]   This is awesome
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:10.360]   Every car says 996 has an obd2 port not every car yet has an automatic pro
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:14.840]   But it's my goal to get every car in the nation with one of these normally it's 129.95
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:19.720]   Which I think is a great price and by the way, no subscription fee you don't pay for the internet connectivity
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:24.920]   Uh, but use our exclusive offer to it. You'll get $20 off
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:30.280]   So now it's pretty much back to the price of the original automatic. That's a really good deal get all these new features
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:35.960]   Basically almost for free visit automatic.com/twit for more information
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:41.880]   And don't forget if you want to get $20 off use the offer code twit at check out the brand new
[01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:44.280]   automatic
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.920]   Pro 3g car adapter. This is this is huge
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:53.960]   Real-time driving location alone the crash alert. That's going to be fantastic
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:58.200]   You're watching a twit from our brand new east side studios
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:02.280]   We wrote well, you want to thank the live audience that came out to help us celebrate
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:07.720]   We seem to have a few bottles of champagne and some cupcakes and things that help you will partake feel free
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:12.680]   Uh, and if you want to be here and visit us in the studio just email tickets at twit.tv
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:16.280]   We'll make sure you can come in we're going to maintain our open studio policy
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:23.080]   I was thinking about that. We didn't do that in the cottage did we there was no room for an audience and have what would you put them in the host chair?
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:27.960]   Sometimes people came in occasionally in the door. Maybe sit in a corner corner
[01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:30.920]   Yeah, I remember that a few times it was hard though because there was no room for it
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:35.640]   So I think that this the having a studio audience really started with a brick house. Yeah for sure
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:40.440]   Yeah, I hadn't really I feels like you've always had a lot of medium seating like look stands
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:44.120]   We used to have that remember the screensavers they built a little little little little bleep
[01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:47.640]   Little one you can pull out and then just pull them out. Yeah, I think it's a good idea
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:52.440]   I think it's a good idea. We have a plenty of room for a studio audience. So that's nice
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.960]   So we look forward to seeing you people are asking about the bricks
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:54:00.120]   I don't know where they're going to go, but I think we're going to go line the hall with them
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:04.360]   Yeah, because this wall on the studio here as you come in the door
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:07.960]   Uh, be perfect place. You'd see your brick as you came. That's all white right now
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:10.280]   So this is a nice place to put some some texture
[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:14.760]   And you know what I really want to do Patrick Della handy had this idea and I'm going to figure out a way to do this
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.960]   The other wall on the other side also this long. It's just it's weird
[01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:22.280]   It's a long hall and everything comes off of that hall, right including the studio
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:25.960]   He wants to put a timeline a twit timeline along that
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:31.560]   Like you know when you go to a museum and you see first there were the birds and the dinosaurs and the rodents
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:35.560]   So we want to make like a timeline. We'd have all the hosts
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:40.760]   When they started their shows we'd have pictures of the hosts somebody else said, you know, you said this
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:45.240]   You we could get monitors and have little videos the harry potter picture frames
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:49.400]   Yeah, we could we could I I think this would be really fun. So we're going to figure out a way to
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:55.880]   It might take a while for us to do but put a timeline down the wall the kind of the history of twit and all the shows we've launched
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:59.560]   It's been 11 years. It's not as long as the dinosaurs, but sometimes
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:04.040]   Sometimes I feel like one the comet could be coming anytime now
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:09.800]   So let's talk about this. This is probably going to be a Steve Gibson subject
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.520]   I think we talked a little bit about it on wednesday, but more news keeps coming out
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:17.800]   uh, it was revealed by a
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.600]   security group
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:22.680]   that uh, that
[01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:25.400]   Nsa tools
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:27.960]   Older tools, but nonetheless tools
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:31.000]   They had hacked somehow hacked into the nsa
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000]   And got tools from the equation group
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.760]   Wicky leaks says they're going to publish these tools
[01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:43.160]   There was some question the shadow brokers who published two chunks of data
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:49.000]   Um, they say they'll they one was open to all and the other they're going to sell for
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.360]   Uh, the highest bidder at least a million dollars
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:57.480]   Wicky leaks says they already have the files for auction will publish them and do course
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:04.200]   The questions of course several questions come up when you read this story first of all are these really legitimate nsa
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:06.360]   hacking tools
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:10.040]   Uh second of all, uh, how dangerous are these tools?
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:13.400]   Can they actually you know if if hackers got a hold of them if some
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:19.320]   Hacking group spent a million dollars and got a hold of them would that mean the end of security would this be a big deal?
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:24.840]   Um, and uh, and finally who are the shadow brokers and how did they get them?
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:28.920]   You know, that's a big question, right because if the nsa is getting hacked
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:34.760]   That's not that's a little scary. That's a little worrisome. Well, we know the answer the first question now
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.440]   I think we do
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:43.080]   Because the stuff they've released so far jibes well with previously unreleased documents from the edward snoden hall
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.240]   the intercept released
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:48.200]   These documents and at least initial comparisons show
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:55.480]   There are some debate over this that these are in fact legitimate. These are the nsa tools that snoden
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:58.760]   Had information about that they match
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:00.840]   Uh
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:06.280]   The second question is a little more difficult to tell how dangerous these are so far what we see
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:08.840]   uh requires
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:15.640]   That you have ax it's a flaw in the in an older form of sysco router the pix routers pix operating system
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.840]   That uh a has been patched pix has been
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:24.520]   Obsoleteed for about seven years. I think so they they they are their older routers
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:31.320]   Most of them have been patched if not, um, then you should probably get a new sysco router and to fully use these exploits things like
[01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:33.880]   breaking into vpn
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.480]   uh
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:37.800]   In general, it sounds like you need to have access
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:45.720]   Already to the internal network infrastructure tools. Yeah, so once you're already in you can use these then to get more information
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:52.840]   I mean it sounds really bad that oh, there's a hacking package out there, but those exist we do those are legitimate like afio
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:58.200]   Mudge and his uh his penetration testing tools. Those are some of the most advanced tools on the planet and
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:01.080]   Yes, you could use them for bad things
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:04.840]   But I think what the nsa tools gives us is they give us a peek
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:11.720]   Into where the nsa may have their hooks into the internet's infrastructure because some of these tools access things
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:16.200]   That regular people don't see they they won't have access to well, not only that that
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:21.160]   Seven years is not a long time for a router. You know, I mean so so there are a lot of pix routers still in use
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:24.920]   And probably a lot of them that haven't been who how many people upgrade the firmware in their right?
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:28.120]   You know, you know, so I think that that is the that's the real challenge there and
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:32.760]   You know, and it wouldn't be hard to get physical access and you can get a job as a, you know maintenance guy
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:38.680]   I mean, but this this all it's going to become more and more important for every company to be constantly paying attention to
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:44.280]   You know all of their hardware, you know, you can't just have it like i'm just going to go down to best buy and buy
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:50.040]   You know, uh some routers or whatever and just expect it to be anywhere near secure
[01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.360]   And also
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:56.600]   The downside of a story like this is yes, it's nice to being people's attention to security
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:58.920]   It's they start thinking. Oh, I need some super
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:02.360]   Hacory tool in order to get access to blah blah blah blah
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:07.720]   Which is completely not true. I mean just a couple of weeks ago twit was at black hat and we spoke with
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:13.720]   A security researcher who showed how trivial it was to break into
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:16.440]   Five of the top 10 most powerful
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:22.600]   Popular home routers and small office routers that are out there and these are firmwares that will never be patched
[01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:24.840]   No one ever patches their home router because
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:29.720]   Security researchers have realized you don't need to own the big sisco switch
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:36.280]   That's in the core of an enterprise if I can own the home router that an executive uses to connect to the office
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:39.560]   I have all the same access and it took a whole lot less work
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:43.720]   So while it's good that people are thinking about security, they're thinking in the wrong direction
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:46.600]   It should be okay. I need to make my place as secure as possible
[01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:51.560]   Well, and the problem is that executive is probably also writing their password down on a sticky putting it on their monitor
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:59.800]   I've never seen that before assuming it is still under discussion how real these are. I've seen
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.600]   Stuff going back and forth both ways
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:06.280]   Is the is the greater and and we know they're old
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:08.840]   They're not going to be
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:11.160]   super dangerous
[02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:13.560]   Maybe a little dangerous
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:20.440]   But the real question to me is if if what kind of security is the nsa have it looks like the evidence is that all these files are stolen
[02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:24.600]   But before 2013 so whoever got in had access then
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:27.560]   but should I mean the nsa of all
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:33.080]   This this stuff should not be leaked out. That's the real question, but they're field tools
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.680]   So, I mean it could have been as simple as some some usb key
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:40.120]   It had left a computer or a usb key and someone got it
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:44.920]   It's and this you don't need to be on the nsa network in order to access these tools
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:52.040]   So I'm pretty sure it's it's not like someone did a social engineering hack where they got into Langley
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:55.320]   And they figured out exactly where these super keys are held and an evolved
[02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:58.760]   It was probably just some low level employee for got his laptop
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:02.600]   What about the theory that it's a mole that it's someone inside that did you believe that?
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:09.240]   Uh, well if if that's true, uh, I mean the nsa is actually very good at finding that
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.880]   There's some question the uh, demetriy a perivitch of crowd strike
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:19.560]   Um, knowing that the most recent file in this dump is from june 2013
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:26.920]   Uh, surmised that the leakers were sitting on the information for years waiting for the most opportune time to release it
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:32.120]   Which I why would it be now? Yeah, what is this why is this or city on a two-time?
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:34.280]   Well, it could be an opportunity because it's really uh
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:36.680]   Much less useful like it could have been aah
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:39.880]   Well, and i believe snowden has said at least
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.480]   Um on his twitter account that it's possible that the release now is a shot across the bow
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:51.320]   Uh from because some speculation has this, you know peg that like the russians is the russians getting access
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:53.160]   Yeah, with the with the dnc
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:58.440]   Uh hack and all that kind of stuff is kind of a shot across the bow to say hey check out what we've got
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:01.400]   You want to bring it we can bring it, you know
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:04.200]   Though it could could be for that interesting
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:08.600]   No surprise that the nsa has the equation group. This is these are the same
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:12.120]   kind of governmental operators that created stuck snat and
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:18.680]   While I think there there's a larger debate that I would love to see us have as a nation about
[02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:22.440]   How we want to participate in cyber warfare?
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:29.480]   We're very vulnerable. I mean we're probably among the most vulnerable if not the most vulnerable nations in the world because
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:35.560]   Uh, we're highly technological our infrastructure is very highly technological, but it's older
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:42.360]   And it's not well secured. We know the grid for instance is really poorly secured the people who operate our electric power
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:47.800]   Companies all over the they're they're all over the place some of them are private some of them are run by city
[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:50.440]   Some of them run by states some of them are like
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:53.400]   quasi public utilities
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:00.680]   Uh, they all have different means of securing their data some not very secure some of them are running windows xp machines
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:03.160]   I mean, it's a checker board and it's
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.960]   According to the people I've talked to
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:11.880]   Very vulnerable the nsa and others are trying to do the best they can to teach them better
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:17.080]   Security strategies and to help them secure it, but this is a this is a really a crazy quilt of
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.080]   companies and
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:21.480]   You know, we also know that if one
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:27.880]   Power goes out in one area tends to cascade and it I think would not be so hard to create for instance a
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:30.440]   Devastating infrastructure attack on the united states
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:36.440]   So should we be in this cyber warfare game where we are the most vulnerable? We we need hackers? I guess
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:40.200]   But uh, but isn't this you know opening up the door to
[02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:46.760]   Hacks against us their hackers are as good as ours. I would say well, I mean, it's it's a different
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:54.280]   Most of the infrastructure that we have that's vulnerable in the united states is because of old generation scotter devices
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:57.640]   Right for visory control and data acquisition guess what stucks net attacked
[02:03:58.200 --> 02:04:01.560]   But those were never designed to be on a network
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.880]   They weren't designed to be on the internet and so you've got these people who are putting things like gas pumps
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:10.200]   Onto the internet so that the whole mophis can check to see how much gas is pumped
[02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:15.400]   Well, that's great except the password is one two three four and you can't change it. It's hard coded
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.640]   Right and that's you know one example
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.000]   You've got you've got water plants where the the valve controls are old scotter devices from the 80s
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:29.800]   We had an entire village at defcon where they took scotter devices and they were able to reprogram the play tetris
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.880]   I mean, that's how open they are
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.320]   So
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.080]   In that sense, yeah, we shouldn't be inviting
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:38.360]   We're not holding a red flag out and saying people come attack us
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:44.280]   But we do need to build up some some homebrew capability to at least figure out where we're vulnerable
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:49.800]   Yeah, well defensive ability in other words as well as uh, well, there's no real defense for that
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.000]   Great. Yeah, I I think that it's
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.520]   In general. I mean, this is a general question about how the United States projects projects
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:03.480]   Is power whether it's cyber warfare or real warfare or anything else? You know, it is always going to be
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:08.680]   Um, not always positive, you know, and so it's not you know, there's always going to be
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:13.800]   Blowback from whatever we do in these areas and I think that I shouldn't stop you from
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:16.760]   Right. Well, it shouldn't stop us from interacting with it
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:19.320]   But I mean, I think the stuck next stuck is a
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.320]   It could be
[02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:25.560]   Could be very frightening about what it what it can and can't do as far as what they figured out how to do
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:28.200]   Right and it does open up a Pandora's box
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:34.040]   You know that we have to be careful of every time and I think that the US has never claimed responsibility for stuck nap
[02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:37.160]   But I think it's widely believed that it was the US and Israel
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:40.280]   I mean, I don't know what's in fact it might have been the equation group right?
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.360]   Dooku stucks net
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:46.680]   I mean what I heard is I look at it, but it's some of them most elegant code written
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:49.880]   Yeah, that's definitely whatever middle actor. Yeah. Yeah, and so so the
[02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:52.520]   Yeah, and so I think that um
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:58.120]   The problem you get into is that the people who are actually implementing these are more interested in in the
[02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:00.840]   In the battle. I mean they're they're there. They're in the middle of it
[02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:04.360]   They're trying to solve it and you do need to have someone step behind them going
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:10.520]   Okay, do we really want to open and someone who actually the problem really is is that someone who's making the decision to give them the the go
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:13.560]   Has to be someone that actually understands what go means
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:19.000]   And I think that's the diplomatic core which would normally make that decision is completely unable to understand
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:26.680]   The technology. I mean, it's like oh yeah, it might slow the randy is down, but it could invalidate the security of every usb device and you know
[02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:29.240]   I've ever made you know just just say and you know
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:34.680]   It's uh I have to watch Alex give me zero day because I think they cover this in great detail and I hear it's very good
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:36.280]   um
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:38.280]   You were at def con yes
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:39.560]   uh
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:43.560]   Funny thing before you arrived at def con there were uh eight
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:49.400]   Uh gsm towers around the valley in peris hotels at once def con took off there were 38
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:52.600]   38 cell towers all of a sudden 30 more cell towers
[02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:59.240]   They were just you know, they really wanted to make sure we could stay connected. Yeah. Yeah, so basically these were all stingrays, right?
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:04.040]   Yeah, well, it's scarier than that so there was a security researcher by the name of by the way
[02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:08.280]   You don't go to def con and you assume that this is the case. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, that's why I mean
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:13.080]   We're not joking when we tell people turn everything off. Yeah, don't join any Wi-Fi networks
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:20.040]   No, don't use your cell phone in in uh airplane mode turn off bluetooth turn off because the cell phone will automatically join one of these stingrays
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.520]   It does another difference. That's its job. Yeah, but uh there was a security researcher by the name of jeffree von
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:29.720]   Who did a scan of the area around peris and bally's where def con was held dc24
[02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:34.040]   And he found eight towers. Yeah on the day of the show. We did another scan. He found 38
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:38.920]   Now some of those could be the hotel turning on extra repeaters so that you get
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:43.080]   And I would like to say anyone who's gone to Las Vegas. They really do need 38
[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:48.520]   It wouldn't be a bad thing. This is constant this just shaking your phone like but
[02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:55.400]   Some of them some of them are probably government sanctioned imsi those are the dirt boxes stingray
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:58.120]   Well, you can but a hacker can build a stingray. That's the other problem
[02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.520]   Which is I could go down into the vendor area
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:04.600]   Actually not this year because there were no um software defined radio vendors this year
[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:11.480]   But last year I could have gone down and bought about two thousand dollars worth of gear and built my own stingray in about 30 minutes
[02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:16.440]   Right, so it's that technology is no longer in the realm of law enforcement anymore
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:20.520]   Your neighbor can build a stingray with instructions they find on the internet
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:25.320]   Um, that's to me. It's scary, but at the same time. It's kind of cool
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:29.880]   A stingray acts as a cell tower captures your phone
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:34.520]   Typically will they pass that traffic on to the cell network so the the way it works
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:38.200]   So it's a man in the middle the phone your phone is is actually pretty stupid about this
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:42.040]   All it knows is it wants the best possible signal. It will look for the strongest tower
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:45.560]   So let's say I set up a stingray in the room next to yours
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:52.360]   Automatically your phone will connect to my box and my box will forward the traffic onto an actual cell tower
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:55.320]   But i'm now a physical man in the middle attack
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:00.360]   So I and because the phone is only encrypted between the phone and the tower it trusts the tower
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:05.880]   It's now unencrypted on my side. So I can see your texts. I can see I can listen to your calls
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:08.120]   I can see what sites you're visiting what apps you're using
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:12.840]   It's uh, and it's actually pretty easy. They did a really good demonstration this year
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.520]   T-Mobile has announced there will be there will be but one plan
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:21.000]   one plan only 70 bucks a month on limited text data and
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:26.440]   A voice and that's that. Oh, yeah, no, no other uh asterisks
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:31.560]   Well, there's a couple if you are a super user. What was the what was the
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:36.920]   The number was like 36 gigabytes a month there was some huge number if you use more than that
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:39.000]   They well we may have to slow you down
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.800]   Well, you also have to pay extra if you tether to your you know, I pay extra for tethering like that
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:46.040]   And your video is going to be 480p
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.080]   Period that's the big one. Unless you pay for 25 dollars extra month for high death
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:56.200]   I I think I have a grandfather plan. I'm so this is prepaid. I pay month to month
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:01.000]   You have the 30 dollar plan. Yeah, I do too. That's that hundred minute voice plan
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.200]   Five gigabytes of high speed. It's a it's only pay as you go and you have to search for it
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:12.040]   It's in fine print at the bottom of the uh, the go phone page, but you have that too. I have it too
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.080]   It's a good idea works really well. Uh, will you be grandfathered in dina?
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:18.760]   Well, uh, I was told that if I switched switched off of it
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:22.920]   I wouldn't necessarily be able to switch back. Uh, so I think they want to get rid of it
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:23.560]   Yeah, of course
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:27.240]   And they're not legally bound to keep giving me that price because it is month a month
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:29.320]   They could just say we don't have this anymore
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:34.200]   But I like it 26 gigs of data the top 3% of its subscribers
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.840]   You use more than 26 gigs of data a month, right?
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:41.800]   We'll see some throttling so it's unlimited up to that would explain my mind. So
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:46.360]   26 gigs, what are you doing?
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:48.840]   Have to admit I don't give a day if it was accurate or not
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:52.840]   There was one point where I looked at my phone and it like it was it was I was I looked at the phone and I was like
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:58.520]   It said you've used into your last whatever it was like 90 90 gigs of a print and I was like
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:03.480]   I don't even know how that's even possible like I didn't want I was probably updating my phone and something much other stuff
[02:11:03.480 --> 02:11:05.080]   Mine's youtube
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.880]   I this is not my youtube, but you can't use a gig a day on youtube. Could you um if?
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:12.360]   Remember you'd also have to be outside of wifi ring
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:17.640]   I spend two to two and a half hours in the car driving to info the studio every day watching youtube
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.880]   Yeah, well no listening listening
[02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:23.160]   background background play right now
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:27.480]   So my my current on my phone my
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:35.160]   Um my current current is current period of 17 days and my current period cellular usage is
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:38.120]   64.8 gigs
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.240]   Wow, so I guess I'm I'm you with who's your carrier
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:45.640]   AT&T I'm in the old I have an AT&T and do you have the grandfather unlimited?
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.840]   Uh-huh you're the reason AT&T is going out of business. Holy
[02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:56.360]   How many Alex's is that what happens is you get I'm like I'll be downloading something in my foot and they wifi get slow
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:01.400]   And I just and I just turn over I turn off my and turn on on lte then it works fine
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:04.680]   You know, you know like and I'm having trouble with like my messages aren't coming through or whatever
[02:12:04.680 --> 02:12:07.560]   But you're right it's often faster to use the LTE than it is to use the
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.040]   Be the landline and you know what I think a lot of it is also is I take a lot of photos
[02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:14.680]   You know and I and I think I am
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:20.360]   Are you uploading everything to 15 different services? No, no, I think that it doesn't upload them
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:25.160]   Oh, but but Facebook will upload them all LTE or by far. All right, so I think that it's like grab
[02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:27.720]   Figure out what it is that's using
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:34.680]   You could do that right? Android has that I know iOS does read see how much bandwidth each app is oh for sure. Yes
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:38.040]   Hey, let's take a break and we can wrap up with gocker
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:42.840]   That sounds fun. Yeah, yeah, just like gocker got wrapped up. We'll wrap up with

[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:55.960]   But uh, can I suggest that you don't want to write it yourself? You know, I know you don't want to maybe you feel I can do it
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:58.520]   But don't it's uh fraught with peril
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.400]   Uh a shopping cart that uh loses people money is going to be a big problem
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:09.160]   Of course, you've got to have the confidence of your users and 70 percent of mobile shopping carts get abandoned
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:13.320]   And that's probably because users are looking at them going. I don't know if I trust this

[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:33.960]   Slash twit do we want to say uh, do we want to do a eulogy for galker?
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:39.160]   We want to be sad about gosh, where's the we say there's champagne around your show we say
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:44.280]   What do they say on battle star galactic? It was so say we all so say we all
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:47.320]   Yeah, I thought i was gonna grow you. Oh, no, I thought i was gonna be like
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:49.720]   So say we all i think
[02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:53.400]   I am not conflicted about this at all. I probably should i be conflicted
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:55.480]   I want to be conflicted, but i'm really not
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.800]   Uh, no, i'm not conflicted. I should I mean, I don't know
[02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:03.160]   I think that uh galker was mean and petty and I think they
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:09.320]   Went about they weren't that smart with a lot of the stuff they did and yet they uncovered a lot of big stories that a lot of
[02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:15.320]   Journalists are afraid to cover like, you know things about marx zuckerberg, you know his house things about
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:18.120]   You know, clearly you really need to know about marx zucker breach house
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:25.160]   Well like that not i mean i'm not when he bought all the houses around him because he wanted privacy
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:30.200]   When you know, he doesn't want the rest of people to have privacy like those kinds of things
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:33.880]   I think there was gossa for that. Yes, it was gossa, but there's room for that
[02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:39.560]   People in power need to be checked. They just do i think but i think there are other places for that
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:44.600]   I mean we talked about this on friday. I think satires are really good place for that like that's what the daily show did perfect
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:49.560]   We need a daily show nobody nobody says oh the daily show. I can't wait till they stop bot
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.640]   They were great right they were love. Yeah. Yeah, like a steven co-bear
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:56.680]   That's what we need that that's what we need because and
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:02.120]   Silicon valley the hbo show is a little bit like that's what we have like you know who they're talking about
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:05.480]   You know who they're making fun of they're not mean. They're not outing anyone
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:09.720]   You know, they're not doing those things and they're protected like, you know, they're protected satires
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:14.760]   Gawkers protected frankly gawkers protected by free speech, but you're not protected against a lawful lawsuit
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:21.640]   By somebody who's free speech, you know, who's the privacy violated and if the courts decided against you
[02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:26.200]   You lost in court. That's what happens. Uh, that's the checks and balances on this
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:31.560]   I don't think it's any free speech admittedly having petered teal funded doesn't the optics aren't good
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:33.560]   That's the thing. I mean like if teal
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:38.120]   But all but he didn't do anything illegal. He didn't he didn't but I mean if it was billionaire
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.800]   Funds lawsuit to take out the wall street journal then you have to trust the courts to do the right thing
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:49.800]   In other words, I mean, hulk Hogan and petered teal use the legal system appropriately
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:53.480]   I believe and the fact that gawker lost
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:58.520]   Is sufficient now you can of course use your money to harass somebody and tie them up in court
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:02.760]   Even though there's no merit to it and that would be wrong. I don't think that's what happened here
[02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:10.200]   Um, I do think gawker crossed the line many times and so for that reason, I think they're appropriately being chastened
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:16.760]   But I agree with you Megan. We do need people to speak truth to power. Absolutely. Just don't cross the line
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:20.600]   Right. You don't need to out, uh, you know editors at conding asked
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:25.880]   For public figures. You don't need to do that. No, um, and you that they went too far
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:31.960]   And I think that's going too far put you into a position where people are willing to spend a lot of money on somebody else's court case
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:37.080]   Yes, you know, you know, I think that that is uh, I think people do have a legit beef against them frankly
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:40.040]   I think he did and I think that I like it. I think more
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:46.840]   The average person just doesn't have the power. I mean we're people are upset because the average person doesn't own the power to properly defend themselves in court
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:51.960]   You know, I mean the reality is that you know that that uh hulk Hogan, you know, couldn't afford to go
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:57.320]   Right to go, you know, uh, even with whatever his his mansion is or whatever he can never afford to have those
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:02.600]   There's a lot of people who would have loved to sue galker and probably could have won a lawsuit against galker
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:08.760]   Right defamation, but didn't because galker had lawyers on retainer and they did not they weren't willing to undergo that
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.000]   Right and that that deep pocket is what's required sometimes to push a lot of the stuff down the path
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.840]   They also use shame, you know, they use shames but people are not going to sue because then oh well and it just becomes a bigger deal
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:21.960]   Like that's what they use that and I can't stand that so yeah
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:26.200]   I mean, I think but it's a scary world in journalism right now. I mean bezo sewns the washington post
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:33.800]   You know, all these companies, you know, AOL owns tech crunch and you know buzzfeed is supported by venture capital like we're in a world where
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:40.200]   Um, it you don't know who owns who in tech journalism. It's it's a scary world to be in we're you know
[02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:44.920]   We say what we want, but we you know, we're not beholden to anyone and that's nice
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:48.520]   But if we were ginormous, we might not be able to do that anymore
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:53.240]   Right, but I think the other thing though is the more if Peter teal decided he didn't like us for whatever reason that would be scary
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:56.120]   I couldn't defend against the laws. That's the big challenge, right?
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:59.160]   And that's that's where the lines get really blurry like say
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:01.880]   You want to start a new media outfit
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:06.200]   You're less inclined at least at least on the surface you're less inclined to
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:11.160]   Trust your instinct that this is worth covering and this is not because
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:14.200]   At least in the in the example of gocker and teal
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:21.400]   There is a world that exists where this man with a lot of money can decide that he doesn't like the line that you've drawn
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:26.920]   That's scary and that that's a chilling effect right there for for any new publication or existing publications
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:30.440]   And I think that's where the confliction kind of comes from. It's like we kind of get it
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:32.760]   You know, you you look at it gocker's content
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:36.120]   You look at a lot of the stuff that they did and it might not like it
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:41.160]   But when it comes down to it some guy with a lot of money decided he didn't like them
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:45.560]   And that he didn't didn't like the brand of of media and coverage that they were doing
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:49.400]   And decided to put his money into taking them out of existence and how
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:56.600]   You know, is it too far to too much to believe that that couldn't also happen to this media company or that media company simply for
[02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:01.720]   Reporting the things that i think are i have feelings on both sides of the equation. I don't know what the right answer
[02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:08.280]   I absolutely wanted gocker to die i did too, but it does it does sound like this is a huge chilling effect
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:13.400]   Jason's you know right on of the whole well what happens when they go after an outlet that you like
[02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.480]   Right is now it now it's bad where before it wasn't well in this
[02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:20.520]   You know funding other people's lawsuits
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:25.240]   For your own thing is not something new or even original or even interesting
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:27.800]   I mean it is something that happens all the time
[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:31.080]   You know and so you know you get someone and now it happened to happen to gocker
[02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:34.520]   But it you know in local politics this kind of stuff happens all the time
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:38.760]   You know somebody comes in and you start you have to trust the court system and maybe give tools
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:44.920]   Maybe like a slap tools where there you can if you lose a decision if it was if it was harassment
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:48.760]   Then you get punished for that there need to be some solutions so
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:50.360]   Absolutely
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.400]   You're
[02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:55.080]   In the case you lose a case the next the next law if you lose a case the next suit
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:20:57.160]   There's gonna be a counter suit for all the legal fees
[02:20:57.160 --> 02:21:01.400]   And so that's a that's kind of a known, you know danger that you're going down that path
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:03.880]   That's an appropriate damping in canada
[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:11.960]   They have a slap laws where you if you lose a suit you're liable for the legal costs and that's really reduced kind of frivolous laws
[02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:14.520]   And I think they want to make it easy to sue
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:18.840]   For real reasons you don't want frivolous lawsuits that are designed just to tie a company
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:20.840]   Well, but in the same time though those
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:24.920]   What's at stake has to be high enough that the media company is going to pay attention to it
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:29.800]   I mean if you look at a lot of the stuff the national choir or other people post they just post whatever they want to
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:34.920]   Because they know nobody's going to sue them well or they if they sue them that even if they win they make the calculation of oh
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.200]   I'll get I'll have to get paid
[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:38.760]   You know and so what this is also shown is that if you're going to start
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:43.640]   Putting out a bunch of stuff like that in breaking privacy rules breaking all these other things
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.400]   We're we're gonna actually
[02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:51.080]   You know, I wouldn't you know, I wouldn't feel that bad if someone took the national choir out because they were you know breaking people's
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:55.560]   It wouldn't be a loss to the national dialogue as I don't think the loss of gawker is a particular
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:58.680]   I mean you look at these you look at by the way the jalopnik and
[02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:02.440]   Gizmodo and some of the other properties jesebell will continue under
[02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:04.760]   The new owner univision
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:10.680]   But gawker itself that site is shut and I think the gawker writers are who haven't left yet are going to be spread around
[02:22:10.680 --> 02:22:14.280]   Yeah, and I would love to see you know a chilling effect on paparazzi
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:20.760]   You know like you know like I'd love to have them feel like like, you know, they're gonna you know, I will watch tmz whenever it's
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:31.400]   Don't you love tmz I have never watched tmz. Oh, it's great harvey levine and he go. Oh, I love it. It's just so good. It's
[02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:36.040]   Tmz has style just like the daily show at style
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:38.440]   Sort of hey this has been a lot of fun
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:42.520]   But I think we got a party to go to I I am really thrilled with how this worked

[02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:20.600]   I'm on a missing from dad. We had a mission for dad
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:25.080]   This weekend at a prize tech know how am I missing anything?

[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:50.360]   He's also one of our hosts, but he very kindly agreed to bow out uh because this
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:53.880]   Apparently when they designed the table they said leo
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:58.120]   What's who's the most number of people you would ever want to have on this show
[02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:03.320]   I said we would never want more than five people in this show. And Chris the very first show we do here
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:07.000]   I wanted to have six people and john said you said five

[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:34.840]   But we'll do an example that's in 4k stereo and you know, right that that still takes a little time to
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:37.080]   Put out
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:41.000]   But people who are watching it were thrilled they really it was fun for them to take a look around and see it
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000]   So we'll do some sort of 360 something
