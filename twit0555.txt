[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.840]   It's a nice tradition I'm wearing bunny ears as you can tell.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.200]   Very distinguished bunny ears.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.320]   They're blue sequined bunny ears.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.720]   We're joined today by Jason Snell,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.480]   who has taken time from his family
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.360]   much to their dismay.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.560]   And I'm sorry, thank you.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.880]   Well, I didn't say they were just made
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.040]   that I couldn't be with them.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.880]   (laughing)
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.720]   They say we had plans.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   I just had a thing.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.400]   And I'm not there.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   Yeah, that was more like it.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.320]   That's more like it.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.600]   Jason, of course, many moons as editor-in-chief
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   at Macworld Magazine and IG executive editor.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.600]   He's now at sixcolors.com, which is his own thing,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   which is great.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.240]   The incomparable and many other wonderful podcasts.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   It's nice to have you.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.080]   Nice to be.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.360]   Using, I might add an iPad Pro to be.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.320]   Yeah, the big kind of iPad Pro.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.880]   Weirdly enough with a full-size Apple wedge keyboard,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.720]   the Bluetooth keyboard.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.080]   Yeah, of course.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.120]   Why not?
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.200]   The best, only the best.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.720]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.080]   Jason was at the event, right?
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.920]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920]   So we will get some details on the new iPad Pro,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.320]   the new iPhone, also with us from Engadget.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   Devindra, Harder, War.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.240]   Good to see you, Devindra.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.640]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.240]   Hey, always glad to be here to Leo.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.240]   Love having you on.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.640]   Devindra is also the podcast, filmcast podcast host.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.000]   And we were talking earlier on, because both you and Jason
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.440]   talk about movies on your various podcasts.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.280]   Yes.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.400]   About Superman versus Batman.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.520]   And you were quick to say, don't go see it.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.120]   By the way, $170 million opening weekend.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.560]   $170 million.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.440]   So I guess nobody's listening to you.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.480]   Yeah, never.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.320]   I wish they were watching Midnight Special instead of Batman
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.280]   versus Batman.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.960]   OK.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.600]   What's Midnight Special?
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.520]   It's a little low budget indie movie from Jeff Nichols.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.920]   He did mud and take shelter a couple of years ago.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.880]   OK.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.920]   Oh, you're a hipster.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.240]   Senior editor from Engadget.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.120]   And also joining us, really thrilled to have Katie
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.200]   Banner from the New York Times.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.920]   Hey, Katie.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.400]   Hey.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.320]   How's your Easter been?
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.000]   Fantastic.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Interesting.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.520]   Did you--
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.360]   No ears, though.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.400]   Did the bunny come visit you?
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Yes.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   Yes.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.560]   There's been a lot of sugar and chocolate consumed.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   Excellent.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   Excellent.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   Excellent.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.240]   Did you go to the Apple event, Katie?
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.640]   No, I was actually-- I decided to go down to Riverside.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.200]   We split the duties.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.040]   So some of my colleagues went to the event.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.680]   And then I opted to go down to the courthouse.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   Oh.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.880]   And the exhibition of the big Apple versus DOJ hearing
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.480]   that I'm sure we'll talk about later.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.600]   Where you were much disappointed.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.080]   Not as disappointed as the Politico reporter who flew all
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.880]   the way from DC.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.960]   Oh, dear.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.080]   Oh, dear.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.440]   Actually, I've been reading with great interest
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.480]   your coverage of the Apple encryption debate in the New York
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.840]   Times.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.000]   We've been doing a great job keeping us up on what's
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.600]   going on.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.520]   In fact, you had an interesting dialogue
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.360]   about what might happen on Wednesday, none of which
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.880]   happened because at the last minute, five o'clock on--
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.120]   I guess it was Monday, Tuesday, five o'clock on Monday,
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.600]   the Department of Justice said, hold on.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.400]   Hold on, your honor.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.520]   And I guess we'll find out April 5th if the technique they
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.800]   think they've learned to break the iPhone 5C owned
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.640]   by the terrorist in the San Bernardino shootings will work.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.240]   Somebody came-- what happened, Katie?
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.920]   Barbara came forward and said, I think I can help?
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.280]   Yeah, so the timeline is that on Sunday, somebody approached
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.960]   the FBI and gave them a demonstration of a method.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.920]   And the FBI thought it was promising enough that on Monday,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.520]   they called the DOJ, and they spent all morning having
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.640]   these phone calls and meetings.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.200]   And then they alerted Apple.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.080]   And then they filed to the court,
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.480]   saying we'd like to postpone the hearing and got on the phone
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.200]   with the judge and with Apple and explain what was going on.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.000]   So some have said that the company that came to them
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.200]   on Sunday was an Israeli firm called Celebrite.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.760]   Is that correct?
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.840]   Is that credible?
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.400]   That's the rumor.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.000]   So the reason why I am not quite sure that I would jump onto
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.760]   that wholeheartedly is that if you look through all
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.360]   of the court filings in this case,
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.800]   the DOJ actually filed a brief from one of the FBI's own
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.080]   technology specialists saying that they'd already tried
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.760]   using tools made by Celebrite.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.720]   And that they didn't work.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.160]   So unless Celebrite has come out with something completely new,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.520]   I just don't see it happening.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.400]   And Celebrite is used often by the government.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.520]   They're used by the DEA all the time.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.120]   There was a filing that actually came out last February
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.920]   showing that the DEA was using Celebrite to open up several phones.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.800]   So it would be really, really strange if their Celebrite's just
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   now coming into this months after they've attempted to open the phone,
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.520]   the shooting happened in December.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.920]   And they started trying to open up that phone basically the next day.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   And so that Celebrite wouldn't enter the picture until March seems really odd,
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.480]   given the fact that the DEA contracted to have them open phones in February.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.960]   Celebrate on its website says we can crack iOS 8 phones,
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.600]   but this was an iOS 9 updated 5c.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.800]   I mean, this has been great advertising for Celebrite.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.400]   It's like, did they leak this themselves to the Israeli media?
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.440]   Because I'm sure that one of the stories,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.080]   because nobody in the US has confirmed it.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.360]   I think I'm pretty sure that everybody has only been citing this Israeli newspaper
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.560]   report again and again and again, saying that it's Celebrite.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   Celebrite made, if I'm not mistaken, I seem to remember,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.720]   they made a device, a physical hardware device that was widely used by law enforcement
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.240]   for years.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.760]   If you got pulled over by a police officer with probable cause,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.800]   he could request your phone, plug it into the Celebrite device,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.480]   it would draw all the data off the phone in a minute and give it back to you.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.800]   So this is something they've been doing since the late 90s.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.200]   Yeah, so it seems strange again that they just remember this company.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.600]   But you could imagine that maybe they've said,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.480]   well, we didn't have a way to do an iOS 9.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.760]   And let's get our team working on it.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.160]   And maybe they discovered something on Saturday.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.760]   I mean, that's not an impossible scenario.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.560]   It's hard for me to talk about this with bunny ears on.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.680]   Let me-- it's a little bit more serious than that.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.840]   It's like the Easter romance you've taken somewhere.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.760]   You wrote an article in The Times, Katie, suggesting that it's Apple's policy on bugs
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:28.400]   that explains why instead of going to Apple, a company like Celebrite might go to the FBI.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.280]   Apple doesn't pay for bugs.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:30.800]   Right.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.040]   They don't pay at all.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.440]   So it's tricky.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.280]   I don't want to overstate that because even the top bounty offered right now--
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.480]   and I think it's by Google-- is only $100,000, which is not very much money in the grand scheme
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.960]   of things given how much people will pay on the black market for bugs.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:52.760]   But because there's so many people always looking for possible exploits in Android and other systems,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.760]   there's just more eyeballs on the problem.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.120]   And so the value of the exploits are lower, you know, supply and demand.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.000]   So there aren't as many people always.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.040]   So because Apple wasn't encouraging people with money to come out and say, find whatever
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.600]   it is you can in our operating system and we'll pay you and we'll reward you and we'll
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:16.680]   feature you and et cetera, et cetera, a really robust black market sort of sprung up around
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   Apple.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.080]   Yeah, I think Apple-- I understand Apple's point of view, which is, you know, it's like
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.400]   you don't negotiate with terrorists.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.640]   You don't pay hackers for bugs, but Google and Facebook do it and they opened up their
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.800]   pocketbook quite wide.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.280]   On the other hand, as you point out in your article, last fall, Zerodium offered a million
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.400]   dollars, a million dollar bounty for an iOS 9 exploit.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   So--
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.040]   It was almost like Apple can't even compete at this point.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   Well, they could.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   And what are they going to do off for a million?
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   They could.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.040]   They could.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   They could.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.360]   They got more money than Bill Gates, but I can see why they don't want to get this
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.160]   kind of escalating marketplace of bugs because a million bucks a lot of money.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   Where's the FBI?
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.240]   I mean, where's the government will pay for bugs?
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.040]   And the head of the NSA has talked about the fact that the government does buy these
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.360]   exploits and that they don't have to reveal all of them after they've purchased them.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.660]   Right.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.660]   That's the problem, right?
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.880]   If Apple finds out, they'll fix it.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   Right.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.240]   If the NSA finds out, they'll make sure that's the best they can that Apple never fixes
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.560]   it because that's a great tool.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.760]   So what happens April 5th?
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.120]   So they haven't-- the DOJ has until April 5th to say whether or not the FBI has been
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.960]   able to open up the phone.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.480]   And if they have been able to open up the phone, it's-- everyone's pretty certain the
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.880]   government's going to move to somehow classify what they did so that we can never know how
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   it happened and they will drop this order.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.360]   They'll say, no need to order Apple to do anything for us.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.080]   We don't need them anymore.
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:50.040]   So it's a great outcome if you want the phone opened.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.960]   And it's a great outcome if you don't want Apple to be forced to build something against
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.040]   its will to help weaken its own security system.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.920]   It's a terrible outcome if you want to know what the flaw was.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.880]   And it's a terrible outcome also because it delays a fight that's inevitably going to
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.680]   happen between the government and some large technology company over what the government
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.200]   can force a private corporation to do in order to help with an investigation.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.880]   Defender, does the Department of Justice kind of taking-- putting this on the back burner,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:27.760]   give lie to the notion that this wasn't really about that phone at all but was about establishing
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.480]   a precedent that they could go to Apple or some other company and demand revised firmware?
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   Because that's what I thought.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   I thought--
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480]   You just picked-- they handpicked this case for a precedent.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.160]   I think-- I mean, it's a big case.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.640]   It's a very high profile case just seeing what happened with everything.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.680]   But there are conspiracy theories going around that, yeah, maybe Apple-- or maybe the FBI
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.480]   could have delayed this or announced this potential fix a long time ago, maybe not wait
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.120]   till the last minute because there's a lot of value if they were able to force Apple
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.760]   to kind of do what they wanted.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   But we don't have anything to prove that basically.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.400]   It's just right now there's so much we don't know.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.520]   There's so much like, yeah, there's a lot of subterfuge going on here.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.840]   And those holes lend themselves to conspiracy theories.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.280]   And I can think of new scenarios where perhaps the DOJ realized their case was weak, that
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:20.480]   Kalia would cause the judge, Sherry Pym to say, well, there's a law against Apple writing
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.160]   its custom firmware for you.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.080]   So no, I'm going to deny your case.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.720]   Maybe she hinted to the DOJ.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.120]   I'm going to rule against you tomorrow.
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.080]   So guys, maybe you don't want this ruling.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.920]   That's another-- and I should say that's conspiracy theory because we have no information
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   at all.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.920]   It is.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.440]   But yeah, speaking of conspiracy theories, Snowden did talk about-- it's funny, a couple
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.520]   of weeks before this happened, Edward Snowden mentioned that, yeah, there is probably other
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.600]   ways that the FBI could do this.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.200]   And they're just not being very truthful about it right now.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.680]   So it's funny to see him being proven right on Twitter for once.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.560]   Well, you saw the letter to the editor that James Comey, the director of the FBI, wrote
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.520]   to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.240]   He was pissed at the notion that we--
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   you are simply wrong to assert that the FBI and the Justice Department lied about our
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.320]   ability to access the San Bernardino killer's phone.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.440]   I would have thought that you, as advocates of market forces, would realize the impact
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.280]   of the San Bernardino litigation.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.160]   This is the funniest thing I've ever read.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.720]   It's stimulated creative people around the world to see what they might be able to do
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.800]   to unlock the phone.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.280]   And I'm not embarrassed to admit that all technical creativity does not reside in government.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.680]   Lots of folks came to us with ideas, including John McAfee.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.960]   I love that line.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.880]   I love that line because it's like anybody did assume that all of the creative technological
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.680]   talent exists to win the government.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.680]   Like, what is he doing?
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   No one assumed that.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:50.600]   I mean, he wasn't wrong though that he wasn't wrong that-- so usually these cases are filed
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.920]   under seal and we don't even know they're happening.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.800]   And Apple wanted it to be filed under seal.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.360]   There was some reason the DOJ said, no, no, we're doing this in public.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.440]   Yeah, and often these cases are filed under seal.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.720]   And we don't-- like, the ACLU has a FOIA request out looking for all-- asking for all the docket
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.720]   numbers where the government has under seal.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.520]   Some could say that's synonymous with secretly.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.440]   But under seal asked a technology company to do something for it so that we can figure
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.280]   out what's going on.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.320]   And I think that if this had been filed under seal, yeah, we wouldn't have known.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.960]   And these companies wouldn't have come out of the woodwork to help the FBI.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   Oh, really?
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   Because we wouldn't know.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   Well, we just wouldn't know.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   No, we would have no idea.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.840]   These are almost-- like, these are almost always under seal.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   You just don't know about them.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   All right, well enough about that.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.400]   We'll find out April 5th weather weather.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.280]   And by the way, the FBI kind of said, no, no, it wasn't celebrate.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.800]   So we don't know who helped them.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.240]   Could have been for all we know could have been John McAfee.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.720]   Maybe he was lying about lying.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.920]   Maybe he was telling the truth all along.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.160]   That would be the double bluff.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.440]   The double bluff.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.240]   The bluff within the bluff.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   He's crazy like a fox.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.240]   He was also crazy.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   And like crazy.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   Crazy and crazy.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.320]   I ran into him at CES this year.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.320]   And that was crazy.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   Really?
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.320]   Did you?
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.320]   I did.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   Was he wearing a shirt?
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   He was wearing a shirt.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   Yes.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.880]   No booze, no guns from what I could see.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.960]   But yeah, he's backing this startup that has like a little key dongle that'll like unlock
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.280]   your phone or computer if it's like near it.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.720]   And it's the dumbest idea because it's super insecure, but McAfee is backing it.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.720]   So--
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.200]   Just wave your phone at the-- if you're a bad guy.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.440]   Just wave your phone at the guy you still have-- phone for--
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   Exactly.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Before you run away.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   There you go.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.080]   That's such a great photo.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.080]   But I got to do a video interview with John McAfee and that was kind of terrifying because
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.600]   I just saw him get increasingly angry as I kind of pushed him about-- because he has
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.840]   crazy libertarian beliefs.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.920]   He was running for president also, which nobody will take seriously.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.560]   So yeah, it's just funny.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.320]   Well I think he's pulling the double McAfee.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.320]   That's what I--
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   That's-- but this-- actually there's a point in saying that which is that conspiracy theories
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.000]   in-- this is the nature of them, that they fill the gaps when you know nothing, you can
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.640]   say almost anything and none of it is provable or disprovable.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.240]   So really there's nothing-- the smartest thing to do would be just saying nothing and
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.760]   wait and see.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   But there--
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   I do like--
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   So that's our show for today.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.760]   Thank you.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   Thank you everybody.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   Good night.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.360]   All right, well no, we're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.440]   Let's talk about Apple's event.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.080]   Not the most inspiring event, but there's some stuff you saw.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.200]   We'll talk about it.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:37.640]   And maybe what we didn't see as well, the show brought to you by GoToMeeting.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   It's that time of year.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.080]   I don't want to cast dispersions.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.000]   But it is that time of year when a few of us maybe are spending a little less time at
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.080]   the office, a little more time maybe watching a certain basketball tournament.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.480]   That's why GoToMeeting comes in handy right about now.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.680]   It lets you collaborate with clients and colleagues from anywhere including-- I don't know-- a
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.960]   local sports bar.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.720]   Be a meeting MVP.
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.280]   Get your work done and get back to your bracket with GoToMeeting.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.760]   So easy to start a meeting with one click.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.640]   Makes it easy to meet with your team anywhere, anytime, even for your mobile device.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.840]   Hold a meeting from your iPad.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.800]   And then-- and what's great is you're on the same page so they can see your presentation.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.080]   You can collaborate on documents with them.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.600]   You can use your webcam.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.040]   They can see you and HD.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   You can see them.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.080]   It's like being in the same room.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.080]   Share your screen and get on the same page.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.480]   Pass off presenter duties with ease.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.800]   Even send private chats and video links.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.720]   It's like a meeting where you can pass notes.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.080]   It's awesome.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.080]   Go to meeting.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.080]   It'll help you step up your meeting game and get back to your bracket.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.400]   So easy to step up.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   Right now you can get your free account for 30 days at GoToMeeting.com.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.960]   You'll be able to have a meeting, your first meeting in minutes.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.000]   And the nice thing for your clients and colleagues, they don't have to have GoToMeeting installed.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.560]   It's very easy for them.

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.480]   They'll see you.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   See their screen.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.480]   You'll see theirs.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.480]   They'll see yours.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.480]   It's awesome.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.480]   Go to meeting.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.800]   Free for 30 days right now.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.640]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:18.720]   Apple's event, 60 minutes practically on the dot run, just like clockwork.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.200]   Tim Cook, master of ceremonies, didn't do a lot of, he did, you know, as we expected,
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.720]   make a statement about the Apple DOJ case.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.800]   I thought quite a good statement.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.520]   He said we didn't expect to be in a position of fighting our government, but we think for
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.880]   our nation, note the difference.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.960]   This is the best thing for our customers and our nation.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   It's our responsibility to fight this, and I can't disagree with him.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.440]   Yeah, they could have tossed it off a little bit.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.960]   They could have made a jokey aside about privacy and security and the audience would
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.200]   laugh and they could move on.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.760]   They decided, no, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   That's not Tim.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760]   We're going to do it head on.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.200]   I think maybe that might have been Steve Jobs move to just sort of do that head fake
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   and then move on.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.320]   But Tim Cook, you know, he laid it out there.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.680]   I think you really see Tim Cook in this event.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.920]   I mean, it started with that.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:15.680]   Then they immediately talk about health kit and actually before that, they had recycling,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.680]   right?
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.200]   They got a woman executive on the stage.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.920]   Yeah, Lisa Jackson.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.240]   She a former EPA official who, in fact, director of the EPA, administrative EPA for quite some
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.080]   time until she went to Apple in 2013.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.840]   She runs their environmental initiatives and they talked about the star of the show, Liam,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   the recycling robot.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   Right.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.400]   Loved Liam.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   That's cool.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.320]   I wonder what your job interview is at Apple when they say we'd like you to work at Apple
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.600]   and build hardware and you're like, all right, I finally made it.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.560]   Well, we actually want you to build a robot that disassembles phones.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.520]   Don't you think though it could easily reassemble or build phones to?
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.520]   Sure.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.520]   I think that's some of the speculation that I've heard is that there's always the question,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.160]   like, what is Apple doing?
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.640]   We know things like Apple builds its own chips for designs and builds its own chips or has
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.760]   them built for them, but they don't take something off the shelf.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:10.360]   Is it that far to speculate that they might at some point build machinery to build their
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.880]   products and control that part of their business too?
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   It's not unreasonable.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.280]   Maybe you bring it back on shore.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.240]   As Ian Thompson pointed out yesterday, you don't need suicide nets for robots.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   You know, it's solved all these issues.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   That's true.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.920]   Well, I mean, it would create new issues just in the same way that the robots in the auto
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.600]   industry created new issues where it changed what the jobs were and there were fewer of
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:37.040]   them, but it could certainly change the nature of factory jobs in China if there were more
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.760]   automated assembly of products.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.200]   Apple makes one product in the US.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   It's Mac Pro.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.280]   That's a robotic factory, I think, isn't it?
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.800]   I've been there, but I think all of these things are less robotic.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.760]   I think then you think they're going to be.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.920]   There's more hand crafting, hand tooling of tech products when they're being assembled
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.920]   than you might think.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.800]   I think we all imagine that it's just all robots and it's extruded and put in a box.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   It's not the case.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.400]   Even in the US factories, I think that's not the case.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.480]   But iron ore and one end of the factory and iPhones come out at the other end of the factory.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.320]   That was actually Henry Ford's dream.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.560]   He built a plant, the Rouge plant, the whole idea was box cars would arrive with lumber
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.480]   and iron ingots and then a Model T would come out the other end.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.040]   I don't think we're anywhere near that with these kinds of products.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.280]   After that, they talked about health kit and the new care kit, which is an intro.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.360]   Again, I feel like these are marginal products for the iPhone, but they're Tim Cook Cares products.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.120]   Well, they're more about what Apple wants you to see as their corporate values than
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.160]   they are about selling, directly selling products.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.880]   In the end, it's all PR.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.120]   In the end, it's a PR event.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.680]   But at the same time, I also do believe that these are things Apple considers to be important
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.640]   and part of its corporate values.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.400]   They wanted to take the time every so often, maybe once a year at an event like this to
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.080]   highlight some of this stuff, like what they did last year with a research kit and what
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.800]   they're doing this year with a care kit.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.040]   It's great stuff.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.360]   Care kit's interesting because it is a way for your physician to supervise your care
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.400]   or use the iPhone to monitor your condition.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.760]   I would love to see more of that.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.520]   But again, a lot of this stuff isn't going to happen for right away.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.800]   The FDA's got to approve it.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:17.960]   It's got to get into the market.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.800]   There's other companies making these things, not Apple.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.080]   It's Apple's just providing a hub for them.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   Right?
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:30.000]   I think as a platform owner, it's on Apple and on Google and any platform owner to do some
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.920]   of this groundwork because otherwise maybe it'll never happen.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   Right.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.600]   Good for them to take the reins here and do this.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.080]   Then they announced a new iPhone, much like the old iPhone.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.040]   A little bit from column A, a little bit from column B, I think.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.840]   iPhone 5 shape and size.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840]   Yeah, it is.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.120]   So there were lots of rumors about it maybe having iPhone 6 style curved glass on the
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   front.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.980]   And the most recent rumors right before the event were that it was going to be a dead
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.980]   ringer for the iPhone 5S.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.480]   So I brought my iPhone 5S with me to the event and I took some pictures.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.480]   And was it?
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.480]   They are identical.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.140]   No kidding.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.880]   If you're Sherlock Holmes of technology, you can look at the little chamfered edges, which
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.360]   are those little sort of like side carved out things, and they're matte on the SE and
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.240]   they're shiny on the iPhone 5S.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   Oh boy.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.520]   I got a screen on the back that says iPhone SE on the new one.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.320]   I feel like Johnny, I feel like Johnny, I maybe took the year off.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:34.120]   Well, I mean, I could make the argument that the iPhone 5 is a pretty nice design and why
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:40.400]   create some kind of like half one, half another kind of phone if the iPhone 5 design is nice.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:46.200]   I do wonder, for me, the big question is, was this a decision made because somebody said,
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.800]   you know, actually, the iPhone 5S is pretty.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.960]   Let's just leave it there.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.760]   Or was it more like it's cheap?
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.280]   We've got a bunch of them.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.520]   We know how to make them.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.880]   All the cases will fit.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   Really?
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   Is it that?
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.880]   Yes, it's identical.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   The case is identical.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880]   The case is what fit.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.960]   It is no different than the iPhone 5S.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.800]   But then those little tiny touches on the outside.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.160]   6S cuts.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.880]   On the inside, it is almost entirely an iPhone 6S.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.280]   It's not like not even the 6.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.800]   It is the what is currently the top of the line.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.760]   The processor is top of the line.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.600]   The camera is top of the line.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   The rear facing camera.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   I was very impressed by that.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.000]   Yeah, I think we all thought that maybe it would be a step back.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And ultimately it will.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.120]   They probably won't update this phone for a couple of years.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.720]   But for the moment, if you get this with the exception of slightly the first generation
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.320]   touch ID sensor and the fact that it doesn't have any 3D touch.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.680]   But otherwise, it's basically an iPhone 6S in that little case.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.760]   Was it you where we talking about the camera was you or it was Renee Richie who said it
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.760]   almost certainly would have to have 3D touch.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.800]   It's part of the user interface going forward.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   And yet it's not there.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.800]   It's not there.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   I don't know.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.440]   I had a good conversation at the event with a couple of people and we were talking about
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   3D touch and the feeling like nobody uses it enough.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.560]   And that almost what Apple needs to do is make it a more central part.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.480]   Like commit to the fact that a long press and a 3D touch are exactly the same.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.840]   So that because right now you can't make things count on 3D touch because so many iOS
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:13.840]   devices don't have them.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:17.280]   What's going to happen and as a developer you don't know what your users are going to be
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   using.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.680]   So it's more kind of out of these kind of out of a field applications instead of it
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   being central to the product.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   That's too bad.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.120]   Don't surprise, it would have been tough for them to fit in the 3D touch hardware into
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.280]   that case too, right?
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.440]   Because we saw what happened with the iPhone 6S.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.200]   It got a little bit thicker.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.360]   You know, it got a little bit heavier because of all the stuff they had to put in there.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:41.040]   And this is like an upgrade with the least amount of effort and work put in, right?
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   We got the cases.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   We got the hardware.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.040]   It's a good point.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   We got the screens.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.760]   And if that's a deal breaker, I think, right?
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.280]   That if you really are going to need to do more work in order to get 3D touch in there,
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.120]   well, let's not do it because we really want to fit it in this old hardware.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.440]   It is a better screen than the 5S though, right?
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.760]   It's a 1080p screen.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.960]   I think it's basically the same screen as the 5S.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.920]   Yeah, I think that's one of the things that hasn't changed about it.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   It's the old screen.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.520]   So it's not as bright and it doesn't have as much color range as the 6S.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.560]   So really this is just old parts.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   It's old parts on the outside and mostly new parts on the inside.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.480]   But if you think about it, Apple always wanted to have a 4-inch phone in their lineup and
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.160]   the 5S is too old now.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.600]   So now you've got one that does Apple Pay.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   I think that's a big one.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:27.360]   And it's not being priced higher than the 5S was.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.600]   It actually is taking the spot in the product line of the iPhone 5S and it has the same
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   price.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.520]   So this is not a brand new iPhone at a premium price.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.040]   This is a brand new guts in a product that is essentially priced like the two-year-old
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.040]   phone with price.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.920]   They've always had and I think it's important that they have a low cost kind of entry level.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.760]   This is the old free with two-year contract is what this used to be priced.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:55.440]   I think at 400 bucks, I think a lot of, they'll probably sell quite well.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.200]   They said that in the last year, I did the math, it's something between 10 and 15% of
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.280]   all the iPhones they sold in the last year were the 4-inch phones were essentially like
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.280]   the 5S.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280]   It was over 30 million.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   30 million was the number.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   Yeah, but if you think about it that way, if almost 15% of the phone was sold, it was
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.880]   a 2 and a half year old phone or a 2-year old phone.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.480]   What are they going to do with that in the next year?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.640]   Probably it's 15 or 20% of the iPhones they sell will be this phone and that's not, you
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.160]   know, it's not going to be their biggest selling phone, but that's a big market.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.520]   And I think in some more price sensitive countries, they've talked about this being a good phone
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.720]   for China, a good phone for India.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.400]   But I think throughout the world, there is a segment of people who want an iPhone but
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.560]   don't want to spend on the super high end and there are people who want a smaller phone
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.120]   because they just don't like the size.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.760]   Davindra, I mean, adding gadget, this is what you cover, is gadgets.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.560]   Maybe our minds are kind of twisted by our desire to have the latest and the greatest.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:58.760]   But is it your sense that the general populace doesn't like these giant phones and at least
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.680]   some percentage wants a small phone?
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.160]   I definitely hear from a lot of people that, yeah, they're never going to have great tiny
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.800]   iPhone 6 or success because it's so much bigger than the 5S and 5 was.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.880]   And honestly, after using a 6 in success for the past couple of years, I miss that feeling
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.880]   of the 5S.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.240]   It just feels really good in your hand.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.480]   It's so small.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.040]   And to me, the idea of having technology that's powerful, that's smaller, that's where cell
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.120]   phones were going before the iPhone and like the Galaxy Note and everything made screens
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.120]   bigger.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.960]   I remember I had like Sony Erickson's that were getting smaller and smaller and I was
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.960]   amazed by that.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.800]   So there's definitely a segment of the population who'd be into this.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.640]   But tech nerds have really locked onto this idea that bigger is always better for smartphones.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.800]   And I think that a lot of the general population doesn't think that way.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.440]   Katie, you lost.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.600]   Didn't you lose your iPhone?
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.160]   Did you replace your iPhone yet?
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   Oh, that's very funny.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   The whole story is fantastic.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.880]   But I think a lot of the general population hasn't even left the iPhone 5S.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   They're still using it.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.320]   And we see that in Apple's own numbers when they report that there are a lot of people
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.480]   still using the 5S.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:06.160]   So I don't think that, I mean, for me, I'm using the iPhone 6 that I've been borrowing
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.720]   from Apple and they're going to take back the mid-i-stop-cuff ring.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   Oh.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.760]   So there's that.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.240]   Which is fine because they wanted me to learn how to use 3D touch.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   So thank you, Apple.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.240]   That was very nice to do.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   The loaner will return.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   So that's a 6S.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   This is a 6S.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   Yes.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   And it's fantastic.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.600]   But I still have the 5S.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.800]   That's my personal phone.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.400]   It's so funny because I sent my son.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.160]   He's in Barcelona.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.360]   First day in town, he gets off the plane.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.280]   He wore his jammies on the plane.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.680]   And instead of going to the hotel like any sensible person, he goes out and parties.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.200]   His phone falls out of his jammy pocket.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.760]   So the first day, and he was so embarrassed, he called me up.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.280]   He said he got rolled by some gypsies.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.120]   But then I found out the truth was he was dancing and it fell out of his pocket.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.040]   So I sent him a new one, a 6S.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.960]   And he doesn't want to use it.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.200]   And he says, I think I have a 4S in the house.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.120]   Can you find it and send it to me?
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.680]   He wants the little old phone.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.680]   That's blasphemy though.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.320]   That's a little old phone.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   Little old phone.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.760]   I think, but now, Katie, I don't know how big or small you are, but didn't general women
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:17.560]   probably don't want these giant phones that us big old fat guys want.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.440]   Well, I mean, I'd like to not think of it as a small lady versus big fat guy market.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.640]   I just don't think I'd get it.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640]   All right.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   Okay.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640]   It seems unfair.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   It is.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.960]   But it's a big fat guy.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.680]   I do represent the large phone segment.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.040]   It doesn't look, see, this doesn't look big against my head because I have a massive
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   head.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.720]   I'm a commuter.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.880]   So in New York, I was always a commuter and I took the subway.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.960]   And what I dislike when I'm in New York is that this phone, I can't hold like the bar.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   You want a one-handed phone?
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.120]   I want a one-handed phone that I can use when I'm commuting.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.080]   And the same, I still take public transportation, San Francisco, even though people think it's
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.680]   like blasphemy because of Uber, that bus really does work just fine for me.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.280]   But again, if I'm standing and it's crowded, I can't use my phone.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.800]   I can't really do anything.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.360]   Well, you've been personal.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.800]   So it sounds like you got a iPhone SE in your future.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.200]   Oh, I think it's true.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.040]   Also, it's very affordable for me.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   It is 400 bucks.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.640]   That would be in my future.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.120]   No, I don't say, you know, Apple's never made a cheap quote cheap iPhone.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.720]   But I think there's a lot to be said for a $400 iPhone.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.960]   I think there's more than the size.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.960]   That's the market.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.320]   It used to be where they sold the two-year-old phone.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.640]   Now, instead, they've got a brand new phone that's filling that slot.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.640]   Right.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.560]   And it's also the only phone in that size, like a 4-inch phone with premium hardware,
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:40.560]   right?
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.560]   Exactly.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.560]   The newest hardware.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.560]   Sony has an Android phone from last year, I think.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.920]   A small version of their Z6 are one of their most recent models.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   It's nice.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   It's all right.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.400]   But that was your only option up until this point.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.680]   So that's-- phones are getting too big.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.760]   I don't-- I'm tired of giant phones.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.920]   I don't like phablets.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.760]   The iPhone, I'd like to go up to maybe five inches and just stay there if they can refine
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   the case.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.040]   But yeah, we got to get smaller phones better.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.520]   That's kind of where we need to go at this point.
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   It's interesting.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.080]   Somebody was also saying that the smaller phone makes them use their iPad more.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.840]   And that the larger phone, they use their iPad less.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.480]   And I don't know if this is something you've experienced.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.760]   But once I got the larger phone, I could watch TV and stuff really comfortably.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.480]   Things that I didn't do with my old phone, but that I would have wanted to do with an
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.480]   iPad.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.400]   So maybe that might help the company in other ways as well.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   For sure.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.320]   I think there's no doubt larger phones have cannibalized a little bit, cannibalized the
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   iPad market.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   Sure.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.480]   Well, we'll talk about the iPad.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.880]   There's a new iPad.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.840]   Also, not like a big breakthrough product.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.760]   Again, it's parts from different products being kind of shuffled around.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   What the heck?
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.320]   I'm telling you, Johnny, I've took a sabbatical and nobody told us.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.840]   I really swear to God, maybe he's focused on the iPhone 7.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   Come on.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.920]   Or if you read Ming Chiquo, the iPhone 8.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.120]   We'll talk about that rumor in a little bit too.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.240]   But first I want to talk about my ding dong doorbell.
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   Everybody ought to have a good doorbell.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   Usually you don't.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.800]   You notice that you get a new house.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.120]   Everything's been replaced except the old doorbell, which is practically hanging off two wires
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.400]   on the door jam.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.600]   It's yellowed with age.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   You press it.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.960]   Maybe this is just me.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.840]   And then the chime in the house goes bonk.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   And you can barely hear it.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.360]   I can never hear my doorbell.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.120]   So when Ring came along with this, I jumped on it.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.200]   I was really happy to get my Ring Video Doorbell.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   By the way, they also sell a chime that ties into the doorbell via wifi and can plug in
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   anywhere.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   You could have multiple chimes in the house.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.640]   But the thing to me that was great about the Ring is it not only rings the, you know,
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.720]   you replace your old doorbell and it not only rings the, you know, official chime in your
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.840]   house, but it rings your phone and your tablet, whatever else, you install the Ring software
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.800]   on even better than that.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.040]   It does that wherever you are across the world even.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.640]   In fact, I always have to remember when I get to the studio to turn off my phone because
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.400]   I have the Ring Chime goes off as people go in and out of my house.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.760]   It isn't just reading the doorbell, but when people do ring the doorbell, there's a microphone
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.680]   and a speaker in here and a camera, an HD camera.
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:12.520]   So you can see, here it is, you can see the person at your door and you can talk to them.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.080]   And you know, you can say, hey, I'm in the bathtub.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.040]   Could you just leave the package there or whatever?
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.880]   It also has a motion detector and you can completely control its sensitivity and where
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.040]   it's aimed.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.800]   So you can see when somebody comes up on your step, whether they ring your doorbell or not,
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.200]   you can talk to them.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.800]   It's kind of a great home security system.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:36.080]   It turns out 95% of all home robberies happen during the day when you're at work, burglars
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.240]   come, they ring the doorbell.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.080]   If you don't answer, they go around back and break in.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.960]   Now you'll answer even if you're, even if you are at work.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.760]   And even if you don't answer, you got an ice crystal clear video of them.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   It's lovely.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.480]   With a ring video doorbell, you could talk to delivery people.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.640]   You can keep an eye in your package when they leave it there.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.360]   If someone tries to mess with it, you get an instant alert and HD video of the whole
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.600]   thing.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.120]   I love my ring video doorbell.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:04.600]   And by the way, if you've got teenagers, there's nothing like, hey, I see you came home
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.800]   at three in the morning.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.240]   No, no, what are you talking about?
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   No, I didn't.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.640]   I've got the video to prove it.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   Mm hmm.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.640]   Uh huh.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   It's easy to install.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.400]   I'm no handyman, but the ring kit comes with everything you need.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.800]   Drill bit screwdriver.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.240]   You probably won't need the drill bit.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.840]   You don't, in most cases, you just take off the old doorbell and attach it.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.920]   Uh, it even has a level.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.480]   They come in a variety of finishes to match your house.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.760]   Uh, and this has a battery in it.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.080]   So even if you don't have a wired doorbell, you can use the ring video doorbell or put
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.320]   it in places where you'd like a doorbell, but none exists.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.560]   Like your bedroom door.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.320]   That's my next in project.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.640]   You never knock.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.680]   Now you have to ring the doorbell ring.com/twit.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.280]   You'll get free expedited FedEx shipping.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.640]   Try the doorbell at Time Magazine and USA Today named one of their top 10 gadgets of
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.560]   the year ring.com/twit.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.640]   With ring, you're always home.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.920]   Katie Benner is our guest from the New York Times.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.920]   She used to write it for the bits blog, but now you're just technology, right?
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.200]   They just took everything and moved it over, right?
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   That's right.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.600]   That's fine with me.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   I read it anyway.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.800]   I read it all religiously anyway.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.200]   And you've been doing a great job covering the Apple DOJ case, among other things.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.560]   Also here from Engadget senior editor, Devinder Harderwar, always a pleasure.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.920]   Thanks for joining us, Devinder.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   Always great.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:32.000]   And in studio, because he lives just down the road a piece, Mr. Jason Snell from Six
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Colors.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.280]   It's also nice to be in the studio.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   I like it.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   It was awful here.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   I would just be at home in my pajama.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.920]   I wish I'd get everybody to come in.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   We serve booze.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.400]   We do all sorts of things.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.240]   Today we're having mimosas for Easter.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   Would you like mimosas?
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.240]   It's fancy.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   I got to drive home though.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   That's right.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   It's no fun.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.240]   I ride my Segway.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.240]   You can't really drunk driving in a Segway is not exactly dangerous.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   Come on, maybe it is.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   You're going to get leathers now.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.200]   No, I do not.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.480]   All right, iPad.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:08.960]   Apple announces the new iPad Pro, which is exactly the same as the old iPad Pro, except
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   it's 10.7 inches.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.760]   It's a small iPad Pro.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.240]   It's like a mixture of the iPad Air.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.760]   It's not an iPad Air 3, but it kind of could have been the iPad Air 3 instead.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.680]   It's the 9.7 inch iPad Pro, which is not a catchy name.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   Does it mean that?
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.680]   I wish they'd call it something.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.640]   I have to call it like the baby iPad Pro.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.160]   Does this replace the iPad Air?
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.520]   Is it the end of the air?
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   I don't think so.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.640]   I think what they're doing is they're moving to something that's a more laptop-like naming
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.880]   system for the iPad.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   So just like you've got a 13 inch Red in the MacBook Pro and a 15 inch Red in the MacBook
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.040]   Pro, I think we are going to, from now on, have the-
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   iPad Pros.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   I wish the numbers were better.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.600]   I wish you could call them like the 10 and the 13 iPad, because that's essentially what
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.600]   these are.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.040]   But do we even need the name Pro anymore?
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   I mean-
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   Well, I assume that at some point there's going to be the cheaper models of iPad are
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:00.880]   going to either just be iPad Air and iPad Mini, or they'll just call them iPad and-
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.560]   The medium is small.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.480]   And have a small iPad and a medium iPad.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.400]   And maybe the Mini will be the small.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   Exactly, right.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.680]   Maybe the Mini and the Air will just become the iPads and then these will be the iPad Pros.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.920]   I kind of don't see the point of the airline anymore though, right?
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   If this is-
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   Right.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.160]   It's pretty much the same weight, same width and everything.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.320]   It's not physically any more of an iPad.
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.760]   So it's all about the hardware.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.360]   So I don't see how they can do an iPad Air 3 at some point.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.720]   Yeah, what would be the difference?
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.160]   I think the difference is it'll be a couple hundred dollars less than the iPad Pro.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.000]   Yeah, this is a hundred bucks more than the Air.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.120]   So the way Apple differentiates iPhones on price is they roll down the old models, right?
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.360]   And although now we've got the SE that's also down there.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.840]   On Macs, they don't do that.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.760]   On Macs, they differentiate on different specs.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.640]   So I feel like that's where they're going with the iPad.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.320]   Is that eventually there's going to be a cheaper iPad line and it's going to be the
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.120]   older hardware and it's going to be updated less frequently, but it's going to be cheaper.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.160]   And then the iPad Pro line is where all the cutting edge stuff is going to be.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.800]   I think where they're going with this, but they're in transition right now.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.680]   We haven't seen what happens next for those the cheaper old iPad.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.200]   I'm actually glad they did this new one because I feel like the iPad Pro is too big.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.960]   I like using a keyboard with the iPad and I like using the pencil.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.840]   I think 9.7 inches is probably going to work for me.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.840]   This is the sweet spot.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.840]   This is the classic iPad size.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.480]   The original iPad was 9.7.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.440]   All the iPad Air models were 9.7 inches diagonal.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:35.240]   If this picks up almost all of the features of the 12.9 inch iPad Pro and actually has
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.080]   at least one, actually two features I think that are not in the iPad Pro, which is kind
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.280]   of weird.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.360]   If you imagine Rinschungal money bags walking into an Apple store and saying, "Give me
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.320]   your finest iPad with all of the finest features," they wouldn't be able to do it because some
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   of them...
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.320]   So what's new in the little one?
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.880]   So in the little one, it's got pencil support.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.440]   It's got support for the smart connector.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.680]   So it's got its own little cover that comes with its own foldout keyboard, although it
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.200]   can't be full size like on the 13 inch model.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   How did you try the new keyboard?
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   Does it feel okay?
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.560]   Yeah, it feels just like the other one except all the keys are a little bit smaller.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   A little cramp.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.880]   So if you're a super finicky touch typist, you'll have some problems probably because
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.880]   all the keys are smaller.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.040]   But for most people, it's probably fine.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.960]   And it's a lot less bulky because it's smaller.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.000]   It's a lot less bulky than on the 13 inch.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.440]   I'm thinking this might be the sweet spot.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.440]   It has a better camera.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   Better camera.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   And it's got the weird.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.920]   True Tone feature that has not been in any iOS device before, which dynamically changes
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.760]   the color of your screen based on the lighting in your room.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:39.160]   I asked Alex Lindsey, who's a pro as it uses good quality screens for photography and
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.320]   video, if that was a selling point.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.920]   He liked it, but I wonder.
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:51.440]   I mean, I feel like pros are as much concerned about color accuracy and about the lighting
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   in the room.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.800]   It's important to them than a screen that might change its color depending on the lighting
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   in the room.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   That's kind of unpredictable.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.520]   If you want color stability, you turn off the feature.
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.120]   It's a switch in the settings.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   But if you're sitting in a room--
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   Who's just fourth in?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.480]   Well, I mean, the pro comes in different styles and you're not always using it for
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.440]   pro video editing, let's say.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.360]   But who wants it to adjust color in the room?
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.600]   Well, if you're sitting-- I've experienced this.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   It's late at night.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.080]   I'm sitting reading on my iPad in incandescent light room.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.680]   Everything is really warmly lit.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:27.800]   The white point on my iPad screen is this super blue bright screen.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.920]   Instead, it would match the white point, would match the white point in my room and in my
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.920]   vision.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.200]   It would actually feel a lot more natural.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.160]   I think this is a bigger feature than the night shift feature.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.920]   Night shift does somewhat of the same thing.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.240]   Which does a similar thing, but it just sort of shifts all the color automatically.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.800]   This is going to shift the color temperature based on where you are and what the light
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   is like.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   You can turn it off.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.320]   The camera is very similar to the iPhone 6S camera.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   Yeah, it may be, in fact, the same right down to the fact that it's got a little bump that
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   says--
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   I love that.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.680]   They're acknowledging, finally, something that no one wants to acknowledge, which is
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.600]   that people use their iPads to take pictures.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   They do.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.080]   You've got to embrace it because everybody's going to do it anyway.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.080]   I thought they should have been able to put it with cameras.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.880]   Because-- no, I hate it.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.320]   I mean, people holding up at concerts.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.120]   God, I'm just really annoying.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.280]   You're watching a concert.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.200]   Somebody's taking a picture with their freakin' iPad.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.480]   But at the same time, you understand why.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.560]   It's a great viewfinder.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.880]   You see the picture in-- like, it's real size.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.480]   And for video, it's-- and so I understand it's going to do 4K now.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.880]   Yeah, and the screen-- the color gamut on the screen is amazing.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.080]   I do think-- I was talking to somebody who is a video kind of hobbyist.
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:34.640]   They said that they can imagine the iPad Pro being used on camera rigs.
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.720]   Because it shoots 4K video, and it's a huge-- right there, you can see it.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.080]   You don't need a separate viewfinder.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.320]   Nice and big and bright.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.520]   What it does have is more-- it doesn't have the 4Gigs of RAM that the big iPad Pro has.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.720]   And the processors not quite as fast.
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.000]   So it's got some issues.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.240]   This bothers me.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.600]   So it is true that it has 2Gigs of RAM.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   What the what?
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.240]   It just called it iPad Semi Pro.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.680]   What a stupid-- what a stupid way to save money.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.200]   I--
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.680]   Well, it may be that they looked at the-- yeah, it could be the cost.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:10.080]   It could be that the size of the screen, there's less-- you know, less oomph
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.560]   that it needs in terms of its graphics power and all that.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.600]   I don't know.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.440]   It is disappointing.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.760]   I wish that it had 4.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.200]   It has shared graphics memory.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:17.720]   So--
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.240]   I think so.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.320]   So the display would use some RAM.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.680]   So you're freeing up a little bit.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.520]   It's a few million pixels worth of space.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.680]   But yeah, it is.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.320]   I mean, keeping in mind the iPad Air 2 when it came out with 2Gigs of RAM
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.040]   was the first, I believe, iOS device to have 2 instead of 1.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.000]   It 2 helps a lot.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.720]   So it's not a deal breaker, but a 4 is awfully nice.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.240]   The iPhone SE has 2Gigs of RAM as well.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.240]   Sure.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.880]   All the iPhone 6s have it now, too.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.560]   So 2Gigs is the standard on iOS.
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.060]   Right.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.000]   And then the big Pro model has 4.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.080]   But it's a little disappointing.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:49.800]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.720]   Again, that's one of those top of the line features
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.000]   that you can't get on the 9.7.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.720]   How much does a couple of gigs of memory cost?
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.800]   It's not a huge amount.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   And you're charging 100 bucks more for this iPad.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.440]   You could-- it just bothers me that they do that.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.280]   It really almost was a deal breaker for me.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.560]   I think the killer feature is the pencil.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.320]   Yes.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.880]   Just because it's a smaller thing, not everybody wants a huge thing.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.040]   But a lot of people I thought--
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:12.240]   But by the way--
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.160]   --taught it in a new iPad that would use the pencil.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.000]   And so this will do it.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.480]   And you don't have to get the 13-inch iPad together.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.240]   So you're paying 600 bucks minimum for--
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:19.600]   what is it?
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.760]   32 gig.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.400]   You're probably going to want 120 or 256.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.400]   Plus 100 bucks for the pencil.
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.360]   Plus 160 bucks--
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.040]   150 bucks for the keyboard.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.400]   If you want that keyboard cover, yeah.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400]   Sure.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.400]   The Apple 9.5.5.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   The Playa Call.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.520]   It's like the SMH.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.360]   SMH.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.400]   SMH.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.520]   SMH.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.480]   But I think you said it right before, Leo,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.000]   about the lighting feature.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.360]   But really, this iPad, who is it for?
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.560]   I don't quite know.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.720]   Like somebody who just wants to have a light iPad
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.760]   that they can take around and type occasionally on.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.440]   They can get an iPad Air 2 now for what?
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.480]   400 bucks.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.680]   Get a large a tech, make some great keyboards for far less
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.200]   than Apple does.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.720]   And then a real pro user would want maybe that bigger screen
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.080]   and that faster processor.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.680]   So they're going to go to the bigger model.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.280]   I don't quite know who would really want the smaller one.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:10.720]   I think it's--
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:13.400]   I think any apps come out, yeah, they would.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.640]   So this is the way I always thought of it.
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.800]   They're waiting for app makers to make this a really usable
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.520]   business product.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.680]   So they want this to be a product for hospitals or for
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.080]   architects or whatnot.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.520]   Apple's not going to make that software.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.240]   It's going to be the app community.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.480]   Have we seen any apps come out that make this iPad so
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.240]   essential?
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.480]   Or is it-- I guess that's the question.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.400]   Procreate, maybe.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.040]   Wait, I mean, there are lots of--
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.120]   there's lots of little niches.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.240]   I mean, I hear-- the art stuff on the iPad Pro with the pencil
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.880]   has already sort of gotten the boost.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.720]   And I would imagine this is a much more--
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.040]   because it's cheaper and more portable and more familiar
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.000]   in terms of size, I think that it's going to be very popular
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.680]   with anyone who wants to draw on their iPad or take notes
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:45:59.520]   on their iPad.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:02.360]   It's a much more realistic size than the Big iPad Pro
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.720]   for a lot of people.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.360]   You can actually hold it in one hand and draw it with the
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.560]   other, which you can't with the big iPad.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.840]   And the size and weight of the Pro made it so that it
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.640]   wasn't really a laptop replacement.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.040]   If you had a MacBook, you'd be better off just using the MacBook
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.520]   than bundling a big keyboard and pencil in your iPad Pro
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.160]   and your back.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.640]   Well, you can't pop the keyboard off of the MacBook.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:25.160]   I'm loving my 13-inch iPad Pro.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:25.880]   I would do that.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.360]   I have been loving it.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.680]   I can't wait to downsize.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.360]   I think that's 9.7.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:30.920]   But we'll see.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.120]   I don't--
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.920]   Can't give up that screen.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.560]   It's a big beautiful screen.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.680]   Do you use an iPad?
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:35.520]   No.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.160]   I was only using it for video anyway, and now that I have
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.200]   that bigger-sized phone, I can just use the phone.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.120]   Until Apple takes it back.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.600]   The real question for Apple is, is this
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.960]   going to be enough to stimulate iPad sales, which are tumbling?
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.640]   It's a good question.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.960]   I think they'll get a little bit of a boost, because I think
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.840]   one of the reasons iPad sales have been flat to down is they
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:00.880]   last--
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.240]   you don't need to replace them every year or two.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.160]   They're fine.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:05.480]   They last a long time.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.800]   So I think there's a group of people who have been waiting
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.920]   for, and I've heard from them, waiting for a new regular-sized
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.680]   iPad, and there hasn't been one since the fall of 2014.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.480]   So now there is.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.160]   So those people, I think, will be happy, and they'll sell a lot
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:18.760]   of this.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.680]   I think this will be the best-selling iPad of all the models
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.480]   in the price list.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.960]   But it's more expensive than the last big iPad.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.040]   There's $100 more expensive.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.520]   But I think it'll do OK, but I don't think it's going to
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.840]   change the fortunes of the iPad as a whole.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:36.400]   I think it's a real mystery about where average iPad sales
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:36.960]   are going to end up.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.760]   You, unlike Phil Schuller, you don't feel sorry for those 600
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.880]   million people using five-year-old Windows PCs.
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.080]   He really stepped in it there.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.200]   Oh, Lord, Phil.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.960]   I feel it's sad.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.120]   It's really sad that people are using old computers.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:52.960]   Old PCs.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.040]   Old PCs.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:57.040]   You see, because part of this is Apple being sad for everyone
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.000]   who uses a PC.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.520]   They should spend $1,200 plus dollars on an iPad Pro.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.680]   So sad.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.040]   Do you think that that was tone deaf or what?
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.880]   By the way, Paul Therat's reaction is, yeah, 600 million
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.240]   happy win users.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.320]   Yeah, of course that's Paul Therat's reaction.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.440]   I think that's a joke that totally makes sense if you
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.560]   understand the way Apple thinks.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.040]   And nobody inside said, wait a second.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.480]   That's not going to be read.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:29.200]   I know we get what you mean by that.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.360]   But the people in the outside world are not going to get it.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.760]   A little pity laugh.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:36.120]   Yeah, well, saying sad, like sad, you couldn't afford a new
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:36.600]   computer.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.360]   So sad.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.280]   That is not acceptable.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:39.240]   You poor people.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.720]   You poor people.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.720]   It's a little harsh, especially coming from a guy who
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:47.160]   wears these giant oversized dress shirts on the presentation.
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.800]   So it's like, come on, man.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.040]   Don't start criticizing other people before people
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.560]   start criticizing your fashion sense.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:53.440]   Great article.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.440]   It's been talked by the one duck.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:56.640]   So you think he should spend the money on a stylist?
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.280]   Maybe.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.320]   He's a little old to be wearing the blue jeans.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.800]   You never tooled to wear the blue jeans, man.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.880]   In the untiered shirt.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:08.880]   No, I mean, I get--
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.840]   He actually looks kind of sad in that picture.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:13.960]   The point is the old PCs can be replaced, right?
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:17.360]   And most people-- or a lot of people who bought a computer
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.600]   are not needing it for super-technical or powerful things.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.920]   They just want web and email.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.600]   And my mom gave up her laptop and went to an iPad,
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.560]   because that's all she really wanted to do was web and email.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.760]   And she didn't need a whole big computer for that.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.280]   I get where this comes from.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.200]   But it comes across as being Apple,
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.440]   making people on to do yes, buy, buy more things.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.120]   Buy more things.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.960]   It's sad if you don't buy more computers.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.200]   And it's not cool.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.280]   Why upgrade that PC when you could buy an un-appgradable product
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:49.640]   that will be obsolete in two years?
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.000]   Why?
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.920]   Why?
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.720]   And I also feel bad, because I think Phil has always given--
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:56.920]   he's like the vice president.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.760]   He's given the job of saying the nasty things,
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.320]   the toxic Hellstew comments.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.880]   That was Tim, wasn't it?
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.400]   Was that Tim?
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.840]   Time to tell Stu?
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.880]   But no, his persona on stage has always
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.560]   been that he takes shots at Microsoft.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.080]   And I think that's where this was coming from.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.240]   He's the guy who said innovate my ass when they announced
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:20.600]   the Mac Pro, which as far as I could tell, is a horrific flop.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:22.360]   Well, it's not even the fastest Mac at this point.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.000]   It's terrible.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.560]   Because they haven't updated in two years.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.200]   Somebody who's spent 5K is--
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.800]   I saw the amount of money on that,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.400]   and never was happy with it.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.680]   What a terrible piece of harm.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:33.480]   Was I'm probably like, he's saying, yeah,
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.320]   he really wishes Apple would have hardware that
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.160]   could run the R.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.160]   Stop making garbage machines.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.720]   Supposed to be the Mac Pro, but yeah, that's not going to work for you.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.960]   I'm sure the people doing DNA sequencing
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.280]   are happy with the Mac Pro, because it was designed for them.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.960]   But not for anybody.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.320]   Maybe, or they're using a Dell.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:51.040]   All right, I'm sorry.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.280]   I don't mean to be bitter and cynical.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.320]   And I immediately threw money at Apple and bought the new iPad.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.720]   Yeah, but that's a perception, right?
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:04.120]   Is that you touted the shopping list of now I bought the keyboard cover,
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.320]   and I bought that, and I upgraded the RAM,
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.840]   and all the-- where I've heard the storage, all those things.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.160]   That is a perception of Apple that is true.
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.000]   They don't sell cheap products, and they sell lots of accessories,
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.760]   and you end up spending a lot of money with them.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.720]   But when you have that perception, it's a lot harder to stand on stage
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   and say, oh, it's so sad that people buy a computer
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.080]   and then hold on to it for five whole years.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.200]   It's not good.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.720]   No wonder people are throwing old tomatoes at the Apple.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.760]   I just upgraded an old MacBook Pro that's eight years, nine years old,
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.520]   and I put an SSD in it, and it works great.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.960]   This is a four-year-old MacBook Pro.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:37.520]   It's fine.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:42.680]   All right, good news.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   Something happy.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.280]   OS X is 15 years old.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.440]   It's kind of hard to believe.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.800]   It is hard to believe.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.800]   We're getting rapidly to the point where OS X will have been the Mac OS
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.400]   as long as the original Mac OS was the Mac OS.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.400]   We're in the interim right now.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.280]   Do you think we'll ever see a new OS?
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.840]   We're kind of like now it's just update, update, update.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:13.880]   I don't think Apple or Microsoft or Linux is just versioned.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:19.080]   They just update the kernel, and I think where's the new OS?
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.520]   Where are the new OS is coming from?
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.160]   For all the mistakes Microsoft made with Windows Vista and Windows 8,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.360]   what they're doing with Windows 10 is actually pretty interesting,
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.960]   and even though it looks a lot like older Windows,
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.760]   like the idea of the unified apps is finally happening.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.040]   Maybe they'll have a mobile platform, but at least Windows on tablets,
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.160]   like using the Surface devices, that's really interesting.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.320]   It's weird to me looking at OS X right now.
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:44.840]   It doesn't look that much different than it did 15 years ago.
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:45.960]   I know the features are better.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.720]   I know certain things are better, but you look at it,
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.200]   and you don't see that progress.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.200]   That's just kind of weird.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.360]   I'm going to say something maybe a little controversial with the UI phone users,
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.920]   but frankly, iOS hasn't changed much since 2007.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.760]   It's pretty long in the tooth.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.280]   You still-
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.640]   For getting all the people screaming bloody murder when I asked,
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:04.840]   uh, six came out.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:05.400]   Maybe.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.160]   Right of all the skeuomorphism, but, but I mean-
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.280]   But you can't, you still, for instance, you can't, I mean,
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.720]   they just, they added folders finally, but you can't,
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:17.240]   you can't have multiple copies of the same icon and different folders.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.640]   You get one and only one, there's no app drawer.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.360]   Springboard is largely unchanged since 2007.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.200]   That's true.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:31.040]   Well, it's clear, too, that Apple's OS efforts are all about iOS right now.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.360]   And the Mac comes along for the ride and they do some things there.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.360]   But, you know, is there going to be a replacement for, for OS 10?
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.440]   It's like, well, yeah, there is.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.200]   It's iOS and they're going to keep developing it and iterating there.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.040]   But it seems unlikely that they would put like a, do a new project
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.560]   to do the third generation of, of fundamental like OS 10 interface.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.240]   Or Mac OS interface.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.120]   It just seems unlikely to be.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.840]   I think we may be, this is the end of the line for desktop operating systems, really.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.200]   Well, Windows and Mac will kick around for a long time.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.520]   But you'll end up with Android slash Chrome and you got iOS.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:07.320]   Well, even more than that, cloud is a platform and is agnostic.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.400]   And what about something like the Amazon Echo?
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.240]   Isn't that in a way a new OS?
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.920]   Kind of, we're starting to see, you know, Amazon did an interesting thing.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   They, they've released the Echo software.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.480]   They put it on, I think they put it on GitHub.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:25.040]   And so you can take a Raspberry Pi and turn it into an Echo, just to add a microphone.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.400]   The only thing you can't do is it doesn't have the always on right thing.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:31.800]   But that wouldn't be so hard to create a trigger system of some kind.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.480]   Very interesting.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.000]   What that shows is Amazon isn't really intending to make the Echo be a product.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.480]   They're, this is a platform, if you ask me, right?
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.800]   A global universal interface.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.400]   Every week there's news about like, I'm getting from companies and startups.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.840]   Like, Oh yeah, we've just integrated with the Echo.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.920]   We're doing this thing.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:55.880]   Um, it's interesting, but it's weird that, yeah, Google or Microsoft or Apple even like didn't do this first.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.280]   It's strange that Amazon's first company to get this sort of like voice control tech, right?
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:07.560]   There's a, so Sam Lesson, whom I'm sure you all know, he started a company called drop.io got bought by Facebook.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.640]   Uh, was responsible for the Facebook timeline.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.680]   Left Facebook retired.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.480]   His wife Jessica Lesson does the information.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.680]   Uh, she thinks she worked at the Wall Street Journal for a long time.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:20.280]   Uh, he's got a new startup called Fin F I N.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.800]   Dot com.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:27.080]   And it's about a voice interface primarily for the Echo.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:42.880]   It's a, you know, they're saying about fix your phone, but really this is an echo skill that you add to your echo, allows you to make calendar appointments, uh, answer questions, uh, you know, do all sorts of interesting.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:52.240]   Things. So, um, the idea is to use something like the echo to create the operating system that we saw in the movie, her.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.000]   Yes, exactly.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.040]   And this is where we're going.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.360]   So it's not just the end of like the desktop operating system.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:03.520]   As we know it's this idea of using bots to create a more naturalistic way to interact with machines.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:13.600]   And if you think about all the things that you do on your, on your laptop or on your computer, even on your phone, if you could just talk to your phone and I don't, I think we can agree.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.600]   I'm not really there yet.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.240]   If you could just talk to your phone and say naturalistically, which is what Sam's trying to do.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:25.760]   Hey, could you schedule me a lunch on Thursday with Sarah and remind me to pick up milk tonight after work?
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.160]   And can you send me a quick text message with all the things I need to do in the next three hours?
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.040]   You wouldn't even the typing goes away.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.320]   The time goes in almost everything.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.520]   They're just tiny instances where you need it.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:42.880]   So Amazon and I know it's shocking that they created this hardware because all of their hard work has been so terrible.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:46.200]   Yes, but they have so much consumer behavior data.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:50.720]   They know everything from, because I use Amazon Prime for so many things.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.400]   So I'll just use myself as an example.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.080]   They know when I need paper towels and they know the sorts of things that I shot for.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.640]   They can already make all the connections that my brain is made.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:03.680]   If I'm surfing for X product that I jump to the next three things, they've made all those connections.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.560]   They kind of have a profile of me already.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:12.680]   And so then if all the, if the last thing they need to really understand me is my voice interaction and voice command for the music,
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:17.400]   or I want or the podcasts or the recipes or the times that I'm in the kitchen using the timer,
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:21.800]   they have a more complete picture of me than in many ways.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:28.560]   But what, or as a complete picture of me as Apple does, and they just happened to get,
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:34.240]   they just happened to have that bigger vision right for how we're going to interact with machines in the future.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:34.640]   And what?
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.080]   And I got the voice technology right.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:36.560]   Right.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.160]   Apple couldn't.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:41.800]   And what's interesting is they're opening it so that somebody like Sam could come along and say,
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.560]   good, I'll make Finn be an Alexa skill.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:44.960]   And now it's or an echo skill.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.640]   And now it's in there.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.720]   All right.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.880]   I want you want to get scared.
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:52.040]   This is a, I love this article, a business insider from Eugene Kim 17.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.480]   It's Eastern on Halloween.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.800]   Scary time.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.000]   Hide your bunny ears.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.800]   17 charts that show you just how scary Amazon's $275 billion business really is.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:09.520]   And when you see, once you see these charts, you kind of say, oh, oh, oh my God.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.200]   Amazon.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:16.280]   So first of all, when they went public in '97, their stock was $18 a share, $675 a share.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.320]   That's Apple like multiples, right?
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.720]   Not quite, but close.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:27.800]   But what's really interesting in the stock market, I think, has grasped this is their income is basically as close to zero as you can get.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:33.080]   It's like Jeff, this, if you look at this graph, the orange line is revenue is not revenues net.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.240]   It's the money they take all that put in their pocket.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.680]   And it's just Jeff just turns a knob and keeps it close to that.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:46.520]   As the revenue has skyrocketed last year, $107 billion in revenue.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.880]   Now, I mean, their expenses are also skyrocketing.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:59:00.120]   Well, now you say expenses, but I say spend because the difference between the blue and the orange dot while massive is the is the bank role that Amazon has to throw into things.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:00.320]   Right.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.640]   It's this is their investment portfolio.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.800]   Like, for instance, fulfillment centers, which they built like crazy for years.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:12.040]   They're not they've stepped back on that, but who knows drones echo all sorts of things.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.120]   That's their same day delivery.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.080]   Same day delivery.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.520]   And AWS.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.920]   Hey, well, I'm going to get to AWS.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.520]   Everybody keeps on forgetting how much.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.040]   Yeah, multi-billion dollars.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.840]   Well, we'll get to that.
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.320]   So Amazon is now bigger than Walmart.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   Did you know that the Amazon is the purple line on this.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.760]   If you're watching video, Walmart's the green.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:36.560]   Walmart has gone down in the last year.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:42.720]   But that's probably coinciding Amazon's growth, which is very steady.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:48.480]   Amazon is the most popular e-commerce destination for everyday products.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:55.720]   So people do their shopping now increasingly at Amazon more than double Walmart, triple target
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.040]   and Safeway Kroger, super value.
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.960]   Alberts is just trailing off there.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.600]   I mean, that's groceries.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.680]   That's that's staples.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:10.080]   Also for personal care and beauty products, completely dominant in the holiday shopping season,
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:16.400]   totally dominant, more than half of us consumers plan to do most of their online shopping on Amazon.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:26.000]   But the really amazing thing is as dominant as they are in e-commerce, e-commerce is only 6% of total retail sales now.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   So the growth potential in e-commerce is massive.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   If Amazon maintains this share.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:39.840]   Do wonder about Amazon's long term plan for international because we here in the US, we talk a lot about a lot of these products.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:47.400]   But like, I think the Echo does not work outside of the US and a lot of their digital products are in like one or two countries.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.560]   You know, we can feel the echo strategy.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.480]   Yeah, it's an interesting different strategy, right?
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:58.080]   Because Siri and OK, Google do a lot of languages and earn a lot of countries and the Echo is English in the United States.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.040]   And that's what it does.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:06.960]   And maybe that's their strategy is we're going to work on getting this really, really great gear rather than being sort of OK everywhere.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:14.080]   But it is they unlike Google and Apple, Amazon chooses a lot of the times to turn their back on the rest of the world.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.840]   And that provides opportunities for competitors to succeed in the rest of the world.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:24.400]   It's possible that Amazon is looking across the seat of Alibaba and thinking it's going to be like Spain and Portugal.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.040]   And we're just going to divide the world at some point.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.800]   And so they're avoiding a head to head comp.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.000]   Maybe I don't know.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.400]   Jeff, I would not underplay Jeff Bezos's strategic command.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.960]   He seems to understand what he's doing, right?
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:45.840]   And as you mentioned, Katie, Amazon Web Services is huge and growing all the time.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.560]   And that can be a global business just fine.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.880]   Yes, that's absolutely true.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:02:00.240]   They're beating everybody, including Microsoft, IBM and Google and RAC space companies that you think of as owning cloud.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.680]   Not even close.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:08.880]   Well, we heard that we hear about Apple doing all their own cloud stuff, but they have a huge amount of investment in AWS.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.840]   And they're doing some things on Google and they've got some things on Azure too.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.000]   But they, you know, AWS runs huge portions of the web.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.200]   It's shocking.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:17.760]   Didn't they?
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:23.520]   Didn't Apple just go to Google and buy hundreds of millions of dollars of cloud services from cloud platform?
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.480]   That must have been a buy that Amazon was desperate to get or very interested to get.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.840]   But really,
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.840]   While Apple is also building data centers, but it's just not enough for most companies.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.560]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.760]   You just buy some time at AWS instead.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:46.400]   According to a McCarriic McCarriic capital and an analyst in the US,
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.800]   nearly half of all US households will be prime members by 2020.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.080]   That's power.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:02.880]   So you talk about the five horsemen of the internet, you know, Apple and Google and Microsoft and Facebook and Amazon.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.240]   But I think Amazon is the one to watch.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.440]   And I think when you talk about operating systems, it's not desktop.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.880]   You know, 15 years in, that's how we started this conversation.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.760]   Always 10 is just going to kind of coast along. Windows is just going to kind of coast along.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.800]   That's not the future.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.320]   Amazon is in our physical space and they've always been in our physical space.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.760]   And so we're used to depending on the first thing.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.520]   Like you can order an Uber now through the actual order physical goods.
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:35.040]   And I think that it would take longer for Microsoft to get there for us to be comfortable with this idea of like,
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.720]   oh, Microsoft is just going to be something we interact with every day to get groceries.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.200]   It's just Amazon got there first.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.560]   You said before the show began because we were asking about bandwidth that you don't have devices that
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.640]   spy on you like a Nest thermostat in your house. Do you have an echo in there?
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:55.280]   So I just, but here's the thing. So I just ordered an echo.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.240]   I broke down because I've been using other people's enough that I can understand the utility
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:07.040]   and that I really feel like the potential privacy tradeoff is enough for that utility.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.520]   Whereas with Nest, I was like, you know, I can push that button on my own. I'm good. Thanks.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.960]   Yeah, there's no real game.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:20.480]   No, drop cam. I don't feel the need to know what's happening in my house in that way.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.280]   I feel pretty secure. But with the echo, I was at a friend's house the other day and it was like,
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.800]   Oh, play Abbey Road. Turn up the volume. Can you set a timer for 10 minutes?
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.560]   You know, and then we had quest. We were like playing a game and it was like,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:35.760]   we nobody could remember who like the seventh president was. It was just like sort of,
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:41.760]   I mean, it felt like having just a very helpful person in the room, which again,
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:46.880]   I understand how creepy that sounds. No, it was also really great and helpful.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.000]   Yeah. So I thought, OK, this would be fantastic to have in my kitchen.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.440]   This is exactly where I would use it. I'd listen to a podcast and I would cook
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.040]   and I would clean up and I would need it for recipes and I'd be able to depend on it,
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.800]   like having a helper in the kitchen. I don't say I realized, I now have, by the way,
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:13.120]   four echoes and I have a two dots on the way, but I realized that it's not the device is not
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.120]   what you're talking to. You're talking to the house. Right. And you're trying to the air. I try to
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.640]   explain to people who say, well, you can just use Siri to do that because it's always on. It's like,
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.560]   no, Siri's in my pocket or it's laying being charged somewhere and with echo, you're talking
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.640]   to the air in your house. You can see B sort of anywhere, not even pointed in the right direction.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.600]   And it's funny. I think Amazon's failure with its phones has actually turned into this great
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:43.120]   success because Google and Apple keep sticking their assistants into their phones. And it works
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.360]   better with this little tower, which would you rather do talk to the air or talk to your pocket?
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:52.480]   Well, this and that's the answer is I talked to the air and it's and it's much better. And I think,
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.600]   I think when we're talking about the future of computer interfaces, I think there's something to
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.520]   that. And if you imagine a time when people are sticking a little thing in their ear and talking
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.960]   to their smart assistant, like in her, that makes it like Apple's lack of progress with Siri,
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:10.800]   a little more questionable and concerning. And Google, the rumor is there was a report this week
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   that they are working on an echo version and Apple needs to do that too because the echo really
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:23.280]   showed us all. There is great value in having that little friend. Like you said, that friend
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   who's just hanging around in the background who you can ask questions to and ask for favors.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.080]   The interesting surprise that Apple TV didn't go in this direction. I'm really curious.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:37.520]   I was surprised that when Apple TV came out, I wasn't able to be more interactive with it.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.560]   I wasn't able to ask it for stuff. And I guess it's not like Amazon has a huge store appended to it.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:47.200]   So you can ask it for groceries or for paying for towels or for whatever. But I was surprised they
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.640]   didn't do something better to integrate even like Wikipedia. So you could have that like,
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.680]   oh, set a timer or oh, who was the seventh president? You know what I mean? Like you could ask it.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.000]   Questions and interact. Well, it's stuck on the TV too. That's the problem is you've got to turn
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.840]   on your TV in order to ask your friend a question. That's not I mean, that's the great thing about
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.080]   the echo is that it's just always hanging out there. It's not in my pocket with my phone. It's
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:14.320]   also not on my TV, which is turned off at the moment. And that's the problem with I think that's
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.400]   problem with Apple strategy is they've embedded Siri into the remote on the Apple TV and they've
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.080]   embedded into your phone, but it doesn't get it in the air. It doesn't get it in your house.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.480]   I do have to say though, to be able to talk to your TV and say, skip back 30 seconds or what did he
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.160]   just say is phenomenal. It is a great feature. And but it just I just feel like Katie, you nailed
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:41.280]   it. The ability to kind of interact with your environment while you're doing stuff is huge.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:49.200]   And that is really so much better than what a phone or a desktop can do. It's just there listening
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:55.600]   to you. And I love that. I really do. All right, let's let's take a little break. We'll come back
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.880]   with more. Katie Benner is here from the New York Times Jason Snell six colors.com
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:08.160]   Devindra Hardowar from Engadget. It's always really great conversation. We had a good week.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:13.600]   I wasn't here this week. I went to New York City to see Hamilton. By the way, you can ask
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.080]   the echo to play Hamilton at will. It will. I love that. It's in prime music. I love it about that.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:24.000]   But we did have a good week even in my absence. Maybe maybe I should be watching what you're
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.440]   about to see a little movie about this week on Twitter. Previously on Twitter. Hey, you know what
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:37.040]   this thing this cost probably three cents. I are drone professional. This works. I flew with this.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:43.760]   Home theater geeks. There was never a lot of money in headphones until beats came along and
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:49.280]   smartphones came along. Headphones are just getting off the ground. There's another thing
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:55.440]   coming along immersive audio and the ability to create three-dimensional soundscapes that
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:59.680]   seem like they're coming from outside of your head. Windows weekly. But is there something
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:06.160]   that Microsoft maps you think does better than the other? Okay, that was easy. It's not terrible.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.880]   I know it's I really not crazy. If anyone from Microsoft is listening,
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.800]   Paul Thorett just came out with the perfect slogan for the build conference. It's not terrible.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:20.400]   The new screensabers. I'm sure you took some joy in Microsoft's.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:26.160]   T-A-I. They were speaking to Capitalize on the on the fallout from the go game last week and
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.600]   there's a bit of awful of talk about AI. We can't talk to your guys.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.080]   Oh no, we need some publicity for our system. Let's put it online. What could go wrong? And
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.960]   well, it went wrong. To it live from Petaloma here. Have an egg.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:43.440]   That time said you have you had to repeat yourself to your phone and then you end up yelling
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.240]   your phone. Oh yeah. Oh no, I yell at computers and phones and my neighbors and people I don't
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.240]   know in the street. I'm on Twitter. I'm kind of a sounds really we call them all.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.720]   Yeller. I think that's his that's his nickname. What's ahead? Let's find out Megan Maroney,
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:02.880]   the week ahead, please. Thanks, Leo. Microsoft build starts this week. We will be covering it
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.920]   all week and there will be a special Windows weekly on Friday. Lots of new products are scheduled
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:14.960]   to ship this week. If you order them on time, the new baby iPad Pro and the teeny tiny iPhone SE
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.840]   will ship also. If you ordered an Oculus Rift, you might be getting that this week.
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.600]   Yeah. PlayStation VR will be available for preorder this week. Plus Becky Wirley will be in the
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:32.080]   studio hosting the show on Wednesday and Thursday. We'll see a lot more big tech news next week.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:37.520]   Back to you, Leo. And Jason Snell will be doing iOS today with me. This is it this week or next
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:43.200]   week? It's on my calendar. It's soon. Soon. I don't know either. That's gonna be a lot.
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:49.440]   That's gonna be a lot of fun. I'm sure we'll talk new about the new iPad hardware and software
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:58.720]   as well as Apple TV stuff. I, you know, I am a Kickstarter Oculus Rift owner. So I think
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:05.680]   we might get our Oculus Rift soon. I'm hoping Palmer Lucky flew to Alaska to deliver the first
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.440]   Oculus Rift. Irony is the guy who got it. Didn't have enough computer to reuse it. So they just
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:15.760]   he put it on and looked around and that was it. We are not going to have that problem. We're
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.680]   building a $5,000 Ultimate Virtual Reality Gaming Machine. And we're almost done on the
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:25.760]   new screensaver is we just put the hard drive in. I think there's a we got to put the water
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.840]   cooling system in keyboard mouse. We're almost ready. So if the Rift comes, we could we could
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.080]   hurry things along a little bit. I'm excited. We'll talk about that VR and lots more the build
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.400]   conference in just a little bit as we continue with this. We can tech with first a word from
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   stamps.com. You don't want to go to the post office. You don't need to go to the post office.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   If you're in a business where you're mailing stuff a lot, if you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon,
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.840]   if you send out brochures or bills, you need to know about stamps.com and eliminates the need
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.600]   of visit the post office because you can do everything you would do at the post office
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:08.000]   right from your desk, including buy and print real US postage from your computer with your printer
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.640]   for any kind of letter or package or anything. In fact, they'll even make suggestions if they say,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.920]   are you mailing a book? Well, you should do this media mail. You could save a lot of money.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.840]   And then the mail carrier comes and picks it up. No more time wasted.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:27.200]   Drive into the post office, finding parking instead spend that time on growing your business.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.920]   And by the way, looking more professional because, you know, one of the things I love buying stuff
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:38.080]   on Etsy and from eBay, but yes, I'm in the packaging sometimes, you know, the brown paper with a twine
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:45.040]   and hand licked stamps going all the way around the edge. It doesn't convey professionalism. This does
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.960]   stamps.com. You print your logo right on the mailing label. The address he comes right from
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.200]   the website or from your address book. It understands all the address books and quick books. They'll
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.240]   calculate the postage using that USB scale. So there's always the right postage, not any more
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:06.640]   or less. You even get discounts. You can't get at the post office on insurance.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:12.240]   You could, it will automatically send out an email to your recipient if you're doing certified
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:20.640]   mail. The free USPS address verification, it'll fill out your forms for your customs or certified
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.320]   mail. Just automatically, I can go on and on. But what I want you to do is try it.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.400]   We got a special offer. Go right to the top of the page at stamps.com and click that microphone
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:36.160]   and use our offer code TWIT. You're going to get a $110 bonus offer. It includes $55 in free postage.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:44.880]   You get the USB scale. You get a four-week trial. It's a great deal. Stamps.com. If you're doing
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.320]   mailing right now, if you're going to the post office ever, get off that treadmill and get to
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.120]   stamps.com. Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner and use the offer code TWIT
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:04.960]   for our special offer. Stamps.com. People say we should do an echo show. You know what? If I think
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.280]   of it as a platform, I think maybe we should do an echo show. Audio podcast only, right?
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:15.040]   No, opposite. Video only. Because every time we say the word echo, people's echoes wake up and we
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.800]   can't do it. So there'll be no audio at all. You've got to do with sitting in my podcast for
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.320]   Siri. We call it a Hoi telephone. So you could come up with something that is not a
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:27.440]   telephone. You know, come up with a nickname for Alexa that is not Alexa. Has Amazon also ruined
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.640]   the name Alexa for children? Children cannot be named Alexa. You can't do it. That's sad. I don't
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.960]   even think about that. Yeah. This is the power of these types of things. I've said that Jeff Bezos
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:42.000]   is not an option. I want to be able to say Jeff Bezos is out of time or for 10 minutes.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   It would be funny. It should sound like you should have that option. It should sound like him.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.560]   And occasionally it'll braid his brain laughing. It should be funny. It'd be good. I want Jeff in
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:58.960]   my kitchen. Custom voices will be a great thing, actually. I cannot wait till that happens.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:04.800]   Like it's just like your GPS or whatever. I can't wait till her happens. Oh, yeah. I want
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.200]   Scarlett Johansson in my ear. And I don't care if I fall in love with her. I don't care at all.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.320]   I just wanted to organize all my emails. Yes. Was that awesome?
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.200]   And if she goes run off with some other AI and starts a new nation, that's fine. Yeah,
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.360]   totally fine. It's fine. It's OK. Yeah.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.720]   I love how subtle that movie is just in terms of like its representation of the interfaces,
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:30.480]   right? They never make a big deal of it. It's not like, oh man, look, no more keyboards,
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.240]   no more mice. It's just people talking to their tech. So it's kind of cool. Yeah.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.920]   I want to have to watch that again. Yeah. Come for a good one. Yeah.
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.040]   Let's see. What else could we talk about? There's so many things. I feel like I have tons of
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:56.320]   material for this week. I don't even I don't. It's too much. I guess we should be a big VR week.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.040]   You guys. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's do VR and then we'll do Tae.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:09.360]   OK. So now we got Riff. That's the Facebook product. HTC did a deal with Steam to make the VIVE.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.000]   That looks interesting. A lot of people love that. Sony coming out of nowhere with its PlayStation
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.880]   VR that'll work on the widest range of hardware. 38 million Sony gamers out there could be in the
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:29.360]   market for that. But with the lowest resolution, the lowest like presence for VR, basically.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.400]   You think so? Have you tried all of them? I've tried. I actually have the HTC VIVE
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.960]   pre-rate here, the developer unit that they sent out for testing. It's super cool.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.160]   Like people love that. Like the geekiest thing. This is like my I've had many geek milestones
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.880]   by having VR just sitting here in my office and being able to like jack in every day and like do
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   whatever is tremendous. So yeah, the VIVE is interesting. The PlayStation just because it's using
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.920]   you know, console hardware, older hardware. It's even though it comes with a little breakout box,
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:04.640]   that's not going to really push the hardware much forward. So it just can't look as good as
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:11.200]   PCVR, basically. Joanna Stern in the Wall Street Journal wrote an article on why you should try VR.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:15.120]   This is going to be the biggest challenge of course, and by the way, I should reload the
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:21.600]   article because it was so awesome. It starts off with a video of you putting on the VR and
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:28.480]   suddenly you're in this virtual world. This is going to be the problem is you can't communicate
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:33.440]   the experience at all. You just have to do it. Not everybody will have access to this hardware
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.280]   that you need to do it. It does take a significant amount of hardware to do it.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:44.480]   And some portion of the audience is going to get nauseous or nauseated. They'll get sick.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:51.200]   So all in all, I think that this is this may be a hard sell. I'm as bullish as you are to
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.400]   Vindra, but it may be a hard sell. We have like so that video showed like the Google Cardboard
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.160]   stuff. We have entry points along many different price ranges and kids. Anybody can really get
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.960]   access to Google Cardboard super easily because you just stick your phone in there.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:10.960]   And you have a semi like cheap virtual reality experience. It's pretty good for like the New
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.240]   York Times 360 degree videos. Then there's a gear VR, which is Samsung phone phones only right now,
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:22.000]   but it's a hundred bucks for existing Samsung customers. And they're also giving it away with
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.480]   the Galaxy S7. And that's it's better than cardboard. It's not as good as the Vive or the Oculus,
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.600]   but it is Oculus hardware. So it at least gives you some experience. I worry that people might
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.520]   experience cardboard or gear VR and say, well, yeah, it's the vibe that much better.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:46.640]   Yeah, for sure. It is because the what Vive does is it's it's room scale VR. You have two sensors
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.800]   that you put up in different corners of your room. So it knows like the mapping of your floor.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.360]   You can get up. It comes with two motion controllers. You can move around. You can interact with things.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:01.120]   There's a virtual mini golf game that kind of it sounds like the dumbest thing, but you put it on
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.840]   and you're just in this weird like the craziest mini golf environment you've ever seen. The motion
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.440]   controlling for the stick is like perfect. And these are just like the early demos. So I'm
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:16.640]   really interested in seeing where a lot of these things go. I've tried the Oculus, you know, the
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.720]   latest hardware too. You'll be hearing a lot about that stuff this week for sure.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.600]   Coming out March 28th, people are going to start getting them. So I'm hopeful we'll get our
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.720]   soon. We are going to do something interesting on Tuesday on Mac break weekly. It turns out one
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:37.920]   of our contributors, Alex Lindsey bought a $60,000 VR camera, the Nokia Oso.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:46.320]   What? Why? Because he guess he'll have clients who will pay a lot of money at premium to have
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:52.480]   immersive video of their event. We are going to have the keeping Nokia in business.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:58.400]   Yeah, exactly. So this little thing, this doohickey will be sitting on our desk on Tuesday. You want
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.000]   to come for Mac break weekly? You should be part of this. This is going to be historic.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.320]   Well, let's steal my soul. It will suck it right into that little multi-eyed ball.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.480]   That's the 500th episode. So we might as well do it.
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:17.760]   Well, it's a 500th episode. So that is a good point. We can't do it live. It can't be done in
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:24.480]   real time, apparently. And only in 45 minute increments. Well, we'll do a couple of, maybe four.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.360]   If you scroll down, the little cartridge that goes in the back is a...
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   That's what it records to? The battery and the recorder is all in that little back part.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.720]   So it does surround audio as well. Yeah. A little bit of a tour of your studio, Leo. Just
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.280]   being able to, like, walk around and see that. That'd be great.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.840]   All right. We'll do that. It's the toy store.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.640]   Well, you could always go to Google Maps and check us out on...
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:51.520]   We are on Google Maps. We had a 3D rendering of the studio. Actually, not a rendering.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.320]   It's real. I can't look at that in VR. So I want to put it on my headset.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.440]   Can't believe it's there. Alex, buy this. I can't believe he bought this. He's insane.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:08.320]   He didn't... That's a thousand Alex's. He didn't expand on why he has it. He just says he has it.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:11.280]   Okay. They might do you have to see the hardware out there.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:17.200]   He spent so much money on this stuff that we actually have a unit of a measure for dollars,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.240]   called an Alex. Alex is $700. It's one Photoshop, I think, was the...
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:28.880]   We don't talk about how much stuff costs. We talk about how many Alex's it is.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:34.960]   It's a different thing. Our Mac break weekly audience is well aware of how expensive his choices
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.760]   are. It's big. There are multiple Alex's, but this has got to be the most expensive.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:45.920]   Anyway, we'll do the show on Tuesday in 3D, and you'll be able to download
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.840]   an immersive version of this. That'll work on cardboard, or it actually plays fine on a 2D screen.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:57.360]   You just use your mouse to move around. Stick your face close up to the screen. It's almost like it.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.760]   It can make you sick. We have a heck of a week. So we're going to do the Ozo on Tuesday for
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.160]   Mac break weekly on tomorrow and Monday. I wanted to talk to this guy for some time.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:11.120]   Craig Richardson will join us. He's written a great book learning to program with Minecraft.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.640]   We'll talk about getting your Minecraft up and running with Python. What a great way to get
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.560]   your kids programming, learning to program with Python tomorrow on triangulation.
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:31.120]   All right, let's talk about Tae, which was really stupid, I must say. Microsoft got a bit of a
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:37.840]   black eye. They released a chatbot. I think it's very generous to say this was artificial intelligence.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:45.440]   This was artificial stupidity, maybe. They said, "Hey, we did this in China, and we never had a problem."
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:54.240]   Tae was a chatbot that was supposed to simulate a millennial.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:05.600]   You could tweet at it at Tae and you. Within 24 hours, it became a hate-spewing, racist,
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:13.840]   Eddie Semite. Do I want to show this? You could show it. It's terrible. Everybody's probably
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:23.520]   seen it by now. The thing is, like I said, I think Microsoft just didn't get that it was a little
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:27.200]   Twitter is a little different than whatever they were. I don't know if it was Waybo or whatever
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:33.520]   they were putting on it in China. The Chinese were well behaved and it was everybody. Microsoft
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:40.400]   said, "We were stunned. Everybody enjoyed listening to stories and talking to the bot. We just
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.920]   never thought this would happen. Obviously, they'd never been on Twitter."
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:55.840]   Reddit or anything. Or Reddit or 4chan or etc. In any event, one of the mistakes they made was
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:02.800]   they put in a command, "Tae, repeat after me." Most of the really awful stuff is just people
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:09.120]   saying, "Hey, repeat after me and say something terrible." It's been taken down. It was taken
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.400]   down almost immediately. It's not clear whether Tae was then learning something from that or
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:19.600]   if all of those tweets were just Tae parroting something somebody else said.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.280]   Even for a chatbot, it seems it would be tough to train it to say those specific phrases.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:29.520]   Certainly not within 24 hours.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:32.400]   How do you even let that feature get out there? Come on.
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.400]   I think they were feeling a little scoops. In fact, Microsoft has always had this. Not always,
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:47.280]   but in the last 10 years has had this. Why is everybody there? It's always catch up,
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.240]   always like, and they're rushing stuff. This is an example. I think they felt scooped
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:57.520]   by... It is weird to be calling chatbots AI, though.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:02.320]   It's not a lyser. You probably not old enough to remember lyser.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.840]   Say, do you have any psychological problems?
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.800]   Yeah, exactly. Lyser was a chat therapist.
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.520]   I don't know what you mean by chat therapists. Tell me more.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:16.960]   There's probably a lyser online. It was very dumb, but it didn't seem like it was any less
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.760]   dumb than Tae. Oh, God, they're all over the place. Here's one from...
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.000]   They're pretty dumb. Yeah. They're pretty dumb.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.840]   Talk to a lyser, the rogerian therapist. Hello, I'm a lyser. Hello, a lyser.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:40.560]   Are you having a nice day? You can do this at psych.filler.edu.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.520]   Would you prefer if I were not having a nice day?
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:55.440]   No, not at all. I was just inquiring. I'm trying to give it a lot of words to work with, right?
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:03.040]   Because if you just say no, it gets kind of dopey. And then she says, why not? Oh, dear,
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:09.680]   she really is rogerian. Because I like you. Let's see what if I have...
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:15.760]   When the original lyser first appeared in the 60s, it says, some people actually
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.640]   mistook her for human, not for very long. We were discussing you, not me.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.800]   That's a classic lyser. Just turn it right around.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.320]   That's a lyser in JavaScript. Not much, really frankly, much more primitive than Tae, if you ask me.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:36.240]   Microsoft did lose a significant court case. Actually, it wasn't even in court. It was an
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:46.240]   inter-par-tase appeal or review of a patent that Microsoft paid millions of dollars for.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:55.280]   It's one of the oldest and most profitable patent trolls, Unilock, claimed to own the concept of
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:02.160]   product activation on software. And of course, if you own such a thing, you go around asking people
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:08.800]   for big money to license it. And if you don't get it, you sue them. Sega of America, Ubisoft,
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.600]   Canbeam Learning Group, and Perfect World Entertainment decided, this is enough is enough.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:18.480]   And they pursued what's called an inter-par-tase review. They went to the patent office.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.800]   Actually, this was the same technique used to overturn the podcast patent. Instead of going to
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.680]   court, fighting in court, we had counsel from our, when the podcast patent was going around,
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:36.400]   we asked us for $2.5 million, we sought legal counsel. And we had a very good attorney,
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.920]   we had a lot of practice in this in Tyler, Texas. And she said, the risk of going to the patent
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:45.760]   office with the inter-par-tase review is if you lose, it just bolsters their case in court.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:52.800]   So it's a risky play. But Sega said, "No, we're going to take a chance." And yeah, they overturned
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:28:01.360]   the patent. Unilock has sued 75 companies. One third of them just said, "Okay, here, take some money."
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:12.800]   In Unilock's case, it gets Microsoft. They said, they lost, they won, I'm sorry, $388 million.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:21.200]   And in fact, the appeals court upheld the win. Microsoft settled for an undisclosed amount.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:28.640]   But that patent has now been overturned. It was used to sue Minecraft, Mojang as well.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:33.280]   Wow. Love those kinds of stories.
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.560]   It's good news.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:35.760]   Yeah. They got greedy.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:40.480]   Yeah, they got, I guess, or something, or somebody stood up to them. I think that's really the
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:47.040]   lesson in this is as expensive as it is, it really, the more people stand up to patent trolls,
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.960]   the better. And Adam, we thank very much, Adam Corolla, who did fight the podcast patent troll,
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.360]   and raised a lot of money, spent a lot of money. But it was ultimately the EFF who got that
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:06.720]   podcast patent overturned by going to the USPTO and doing an interpartase.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:09.840]   I know a bunch of app developers who've been bitten by the LODCIS.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:12.000]   Oh, the LODCIS one is terrible.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.280]   One. And these are small developers where basically they can't afford to fight it.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:23.520]   So they just pay them off. And it's like extortion. It is extortion. But they have no other place to go.
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:29.520]   You wrote about on six colleagues speaking of podcasting that this new adapter that Apple's
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:37.920]   doing for the iPad Pro, the Lightning USB 3 adapter, 39 bucks. It's a camera adapter.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:43.840]   Yeah, they still call it the camera adapter, which is funny because Phil Schiller stood on stage
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.400]   and said, oh, you can also use this to connect to your corporate ethernet network and podcasters
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:54.320]   can use it with microphones. And it's true, it's powered. So this new adapter for iOS devices
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:58.800]   has a lightning port on the outside for power and then a USB plug. It used to be you could like maybe
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.840]   find a powered USB hub and attach it and all that. But now it's sort of an approved feature.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:07.600]   And the other nice thing about it is you can do this for a while because it will also power
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.520]   your iPad. So it used to be if you wanted to use this adapter, you had to make sure you had enough
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.880]   battery to get through whatever you wanted to do because it was draining power from your device.
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:24.320]   And this one will actually charge your iPad while it's attaching you to anything by USB,
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:30.880]   a microphone or or an ethernet adapter or whatever, a camera.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.280]   I want them to go move to type C because this is the kind of thing type C does so well.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.400]   And it would be an easy thing. But what this adapter does, it plugs into the lightning port on your
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:46.560]   iPad and adds a lightning port so you can charge and then a USB port so you could connect ethernet
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:50.400]   if you wanted or which is kind of funny. I guess there's drivers for ethernet.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:55.200]   Yeah, you know, it's kind of invisible. But if you if you I turned off Wi-Fi and suddenly I was
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:59.520]   still on the internet, obviously it was working, but there was no way to see anywhere in the in
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:06.800]   the settings. There was nothing to set. But it did work. So I guess, yay. And you're saying that you
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:11.680]   could if you had a microphone that had a USB interface. Yeah, like the Blue Yeti is a good
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:16.480]   example of a common microphone that does not that draws too much power. And the iPad alone
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:21.440]   could never support it. But iPhones and iPads using this adapter can can use that. It doesn't
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.960]   solve like all the podcasting using an iOS device problems, but it does solve one of them, which is
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.000]   that it was hard to even attach a device because it wanted bus power that wasn't available.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.640]   Well, I was in New York. I actually recorded commercials on my iPhone using Shure makes a
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:44.160]   lightning based microphone. I got in bed and put the covers over my head to get a nice
[01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:50.960]   sound room and I recorded commercials and then I transferred them to Dropbox because it was
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:57.440]   no really easy way to do this. And then from Dropbox, I sent them to the station. And then what I did,
[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:03.600]   I realized, oh, I could do this for audio blogging. And so, but so I created an if this than that,
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:10.720]   that would watch my Dropbox folder. And then as soon as I uploaded a new audio track to the
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:16.320]   Motiv Dropbox folder, which is built into the recorder, would then set it to SoundCloud.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:22.240]   And then it's a podcast. Yeah, we're going to get there. It's going to be very, very soon. I think
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:26.960]   we're going to it's going to be very easy for people to just be anywhere that's quiet with their
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:34.880]   phone and record podcast. But we're not quite there yet. Yeah, getting there. But it's cool now that
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:39.760]   somebody on stage who represents Apple said, yeah, it's not just for cameras. You can plug any USB
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.480]   device into it. I'm going to buy one. It'll work for sure.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   I we kind of we started a little bit on this, Katie, but we were talking about platforms and
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.840]   the echo. But really, I think a lot of what we're seeing is people using messaging
[01:32:53.840 --> 01:33:00.560]   as a platform. And I wonder if that's in a way the same platform, the idea of kind of an interactive
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:05.920]   back and forth, whether it's by voice or by typing in your messaging platform. Facebook is now going
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:16.000]   to do a are they doing like a messaging app store for bots? Very, very interesting. What's happening
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:21.680]   here? I think this is in some ways the future of platforms is not tied to an operating system.
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:27.040]   It's something you can do while you're walking around. As long as Tae's not there. It's okay.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:36.560]   It's okay. It tastes a little violent. Yeah. Netflix has admitted. Well, we throttle video
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:42.880]   streams for Verizon and AT&T. They didn't say exactly. We're talking about the Wall Street
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.720]   Journal. They'd say exactly whether this was something that AT&T Verizon had demanded.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.960]   They did say we don't have to we don't have to do it for the others sprinting T-Mobile because
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:59.200]   they treat customers better. Oh, ow. This is an issue of course is of data caps.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:07.120]   We've been talking a lot about net neutrality. We're talking about binge on from T-Mobile,
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.520]   which it turns out does something similar, although they only throttle it down to one and a half
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:17.600]   megabits, which is much better quality than this, but it was a 600 kilobits that Netflix was offering
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:25.440]   AT&T and Verizon customers. Has anybody complained about how bad Netflix looks on
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:32.320]   Verizon and AT&T? I think people don't even notice. I mean, on phones, it's 600K is not much. So
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.680]   it may be just hard for people to notice. It's not crystal clear 1080p HD maybe,
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:43.600]   but it's I guess it makes sense for Netflix to do this because yeah, if people can stream
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:49.120]   more things, that's better for them overall. It's just a shame. This is the world we live in right
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:54.000]   now, right? They have to work around the limitations of the cellular companies. It's kind of a shame.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.400]   Here's AT&T's response. We are outraged to learn that Netflix is apparently throttling
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:06.480]   visitors a video for our customers without their knowledge or consent. We want them to pay for all
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.880]   that. We're outraged. Yes. That's why we put bandwidth caps in place.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:19.360]   It does point out that when you're talking about net neutrality, it's hard to know who the villains
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:25.440]   are and who's I mean, it really is hard to figure all that out. And the system is kind of broken.
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:34.320]   So yes, yeah, it's tough. Yeah. Andy Grove passed away this week at the age of 79,
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:43.040]   really amazing fellow who powered Intel. He was a Hungarian refugee, came to the United States
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:49.200]   after the Hungarian revolt of 1956 was crushed by Soviet tanks. I remember him telling me the story
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:56.720]   of crawling on his belly through a minefield and barbed wire in Hungary to get to Austria,
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.800]   to get over the border into Austria. He was probably around 20 at the time.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:09.360]   Young man came to the United States, studied chemical engineering, and got a job at a little
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:15.760]   company called Fairchild Semiconductor, where he worked with Charles Moore and then later CEO
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:24.640]   and chairman of Intel and really had a lot to do with the success of Intel in the 1980s and 90s.
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:31.440]   Really liked the guy. He was a tough competitor, but a brilliant engineer and more importantly,
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:37.440]   a great leader, famous for not having an office. He had a cubicle. I saw that cubicle once. It was
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:42.960]   a big to be fair. It was a very large cubicle with his assistant cubicle in front of it. Yes,
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:48.240]   but it was still a cubicle. Yeah. It's it's true. It was nice. He was he was I really liked Andy and
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:54.320]   very sorry to see him. As they say in Hamilton, immigrants get the job done. They get the job done.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.160]   What a great story. His life story is just amazing. Isn't it? Yeah.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:05.280]   By the way, that was a huge applause line. I'm sure. Yeah. They sing that and the show
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.120]   stops for a minute while I'm big. Yeah. Apparently, that's the biggest thing they had to do when they
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:12.880]   put it open on Broadway is that everybody knows the songs now. So they have to insert all these
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:17.680]   pauses while everybody cheers for their favorites. It's it's all right. So I'll do a little Hamilton.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:22.080]   I wasn't going to do this, but I was it was the greatest show I've ever seen. It was incredible.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:28.560]   Saw it on Thursday night. And but what's interesting is full. The I've never I've been I've seen many,
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:34.640]   many Broadway shows, including huge hits, including seeing rent when it first came to Broadway.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.800]   But seeing this was unique. First of all, no MTCs 10 minutes before the show begins.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:45.280]   The house is full, which is unusual. And it's buzzing. There is electricity. People are very
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.120]   excited to be at the show. It's it's impossible to get a ticket that's sold out through the rest of
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:38:00.880]   the year. And and when the show begins, they introduce Alexander Hamilton, Lynn, Lynn,
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:07.040]   Manuel Miranda, and he makes his appearance on the stage. And it's like the Beatles, the screams.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:13.840]   And the whole show just stops as as as it and I think it wasn't just girls screaming. I was screaming.
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.440]   People are screaming. He's it's I've never I haven't seen anything like this. It's like Elvis.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:23.600]   It was like the Beatles. And it's a really wonderful show. Have you seen it, Devender?
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.680]   I have. I took my wife to see it last year. Yeah, everything was sold out. But you could still get
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:33.360]   like second run, you know, tickets from Seakeake and those sorts of sites. So I paid way too much
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:39.280]   for it. But I honestly like totally worth it. And I'm I hope to get back this year because I want
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.120]   to see it before, you know, any of the cast goes away to. Yeah, well, that's part of the problem is
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:48.960]   that their contracts run out in the next couple of months. And they are going to do a tour. Of course,
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:54.480]   they're going to Chicago and they'll be in San Francisco in in March. And I've already bought
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:39:00.400]   tickets to their parents. I can't wait to see it again. I want to see it again and again. It is an
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:08.960]   amazing show. But yes, good line in there. Immigrants. I was thinking about it when I got
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:14.080]   it. Andy Grove. Yeah. Yeah. These are a great immigrant story. Yeah. 20 years old,
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.080]   crawling on this belly. We didn't build a wall between us and Austria.
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:28.400]   Let's take a break. Got some final thoughts, including a wild site called VNC roulette. Have
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:33.520]   you seen this yet? Oh, God, that sounds terrifying. Doesn't sound good. But our first award from our
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:39.280]   folks at brain tree. We love brain tree and everybody who does mobile app development loves brain
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:46.960]   tree because it is the way to add mobile payments to your app or your website that your users will
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:52.400]   love that you will love. And all I have to tell you is who uses brain tree? Uber uses brain tree,
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:59.120]   Airbnb uses brain tree, GitHub uses brain tree, stub hub uses brain tree. You've used brain tree.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.920]   It's the easiest way. What is the secret of Uber? What is so great about Uber? Because when the
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.800]   rides over, you get out of the car and it's done. You paid for it. That's brain tree making mobile
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:15.920]   payments fast, easy, seamless. You can add it to your app with 10 lines of code. And boom,
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.880]   you are ready to accept whatever payment form your customers want. Apple Pay, Android Pay, Pay,
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:26.160]   Pal, Venmo credit cards, even Bitcoin. And if another wake to pay comes along, but you're going
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.200]   to be able to do that with a check of the box, then your control panel, brain tree will sport that too.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:36.560]   I spoke with my good buddy Harper Reed. His company, Modest, was all about kind of
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.000]   seamless transactions. Brain tree required him not so long ago. And I asked about how brain tree
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.480]   is powering this new PayPal commerce tool and why it's important when it comes to contextual
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:54.880]   commerce. Listen, as a developer, we built a lot of these tools to be easy to use for developers.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:59.600]   So thinking about APIs, really, it's just about building blocks. So if you look at, you know,
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.000]   huge companies like Facebook and Uber, they're able to use these building blocks to do really
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.240]   neat integrations for their transportation services. But at the same time, the small business
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:14.400]   developers able to use these to bring retail customers their own businesses into this contextual
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.240]   commerce world. Brain trees, fast payouts, their continuous support mean you're going to be ready
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.520]   no matter what whether and they'll be ready for you, whether you're earning your first dollar or
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:28.080]   your billionth dollar, you'll see fewer abandoned carts, more sales, brain tree is amazing.
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:33.440]   If you haven't checked it out, go to braintree payments.com slash twit. You can play in the sandbox.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:39.840]   You could see how easy it is. You could see how their fast payouts, their superior fraud protection
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:43.840]   make life better for you and your customers. And by the way, if you don't have time to do
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:48.560]   the integration, they could do it for you. They power the Pinterest buyable pins. That's
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:54.640]   the modest technology through brain tree. Braintree payments.com slash twit and is a little
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:42:05.520]   incentive, your first $50,000 in transactions fee free brain tree payments.com slash twit.
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:12.880]   I found this on I love Hacker News. Always great stuff. Hacker News called VNC roulette.
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:19.440]   Somebody wrote a little script to go out and look at unsecured VNC connections.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:25.520]   And as you go through them, what surprises you is occasionally you run into things like
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:36.240]   hydropower installations, the grid. It's a kind of an interesting revelation here.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:44.720]   This is a whole category of tools that are great that allow you to search for flaws, exploits.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:51.200]   I used to have a screen saver that was webcams that had never been taken off their default
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:58.720]   settings. And it was like a bunch of puppies and then a river and then traffic in a city
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:02.560]   somewhere. And you got to recognize that there was a bar in Russia. And you could see when it
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:08.560]   was closing time at the bar in Russia. It was great. It was amazing. What is that? There's a search that
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:15.680]   Steve Gibson uses all the time that will find all sorts of flaws and holes and exploits.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:22.960]   I can't remember. He often refers to it. It's a great way to find issues
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:28.080]   out there. Anyway, VNC roulette.com. If you want just a little fun browsing,
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:36.960]   Shodan, that's it. Shodan is kind of amazing. It's the world's first search engine for internet
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:41.040]   connected devices. That's how they build themselves. But of course,
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.120]   since you heard about an exploit, you just go to Shodan and you can find it.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:52.560]   Turns out that music business isn't doing so hot. Here's a surprise. They're shift to streaming.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:44:04.080]   They've lost billions of dollars. Music sales in this graph going from 2006 to 2015.
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:11.280]   The big drop right about 2008, boom, and then flat as physical media disappeared and digital
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:17.120]   media increased. This is the Music Industries sales report, which came out this week. Streaming
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:26.320]   is up. Vinyl sales a little bit, still increasing. But record sales in general,
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:35.120]   way down. The number has hovered around $7 billion a year since 2010. Very little growth.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:43.760]   This article says that according to this report, it's about half a cent per play per song on streaming.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:51.120]   I did the math. If you take an average length album, because you think when you buy the CD,
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:55.360]   you get it forever, or you do the download on iTunes, you get it forever as many listens as you
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:04.720]   want. How many listens would it take for it to be equivalent revenue on streaming? It's like
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:10.240]   hundreds or thousands of listens to an album. Even my favorites, I don't listen to as much.
[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.320]   So it's just, yeah, the money doesn't work. It's not comparable.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:24.640]   Maybe with that era is over. Maybe that was a brief interlude,
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:32.800]   much to the benefit of musicians and rock bands. But maybe that wasn't even 100 years, 50 years.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.280]   Maybe that era is just over.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.200]   It's sad. It feels like, yeah, just giving up. I hear stories from people who used to work in
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:49.600]   print media. I would hear about their freelancing rates. When they would be sad about, "Oh,
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.840]   what they're getting paid now," it'd be like, "Guys, I used to write blog quotes for $5 a pop."
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:46:01.440]   I would never see that sort of world. You've got independent music production now. You've got
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.600]   all sorts of different ways for people to get their stuff out there. It is going to be
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:10.000]   positive of it. What this means for like Spotify and stuff. The positive of it is democratized.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.880]   It also means that the small number of people who are making millions aren't going to do that
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:21.360]   anymore. I mean, that's sad. I worry more about journalism, frankly.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.720]   Then I worry about the music industry. Katie, sorry.
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:30.800]   I think that once musicians stop working through record companies and start going to streaming
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:34.960]   services direct, for example, not what's going to happen tomorrow or anytime soon.
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:41.440]   I think the problem with streaming services is that the payments don't make sense. You're
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:46.400]   still an artist. You're still producing something, whether you're a huge, you love the weekend,
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.080]   you love Taylor Swift, or you love somebody who's not as well-known. Those people should get paid
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.960]   for the work they do. Right now, we are in a system where it's still really easy to find all
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:02.080]   the other stuff for free, which is not fair. As journalists, even though we don't make people
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.640]   pay per story, the stories are going out because of advertising backing it. It's not free.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:14.960]   There's no free journalism. There's advertising everywhere. I do think that there will have to be
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:22.000]   something that makes us economics work, where the money that Spotify has to pay per stream is
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:28.880]   more than half of a cent. Again, does that mean that only Apple can subsidize music or only YouTube
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:34.160]   can subsidize music maybe, but it's half a cent not enough. I think most of it would have.
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:40.720]   I have to wonder where the money is going because... It's going to the middleman.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:46.240]   I guess, historically, the story of the record industry is not like the artist
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:53.280]   really ever got the blind share of money. Part of the pitch of these streaming services was
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:59.280]   to the record companies. Wouldn't you rather get $10 a month every month from a user? That's
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.480]   like the equivalent of buying a CD a month. Isn't that better than the alternative, even if they
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:11.680]   were buying CDs? Do they buy a CD a month? You pay, don't you? Jason, I pay. I have two Google
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:18.080]   and iTunes accounts. But if the average subscriber now pays the equivalent of one CD a month and
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.960]   they're a music fan or they wouldn't be subscribing and they probably buy two or three albums a month
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:28.160]   before, there you go, you've lost half or two thirds of your revenue just right there. Regardless
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:33.520]   of how badly the artists are getting taken in by the middlemen, the pool of money is way down at
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.160]   that point. I think it's a little decimate, the middlemen. In a perfect world, this would just
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:43.920]   either force the record companies to get some sort of religion and understand that they have to
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.080]   redo their business and start distributing the cash.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:52.400]   Good luck with that, they've forever just decimates them and they get taken all together,
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:56.240]   which is what is happening. That's the thing that's happening. Those numbers show that these
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:03.920]   guys, most of these companies are run by marketing people, not by business. These guys don't understand
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.440]   what's happening to them and they don't understand that they're going to be pushed into extinction.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:12.560]   And eventually somebody would be able to, I mean, Spotify is already trying to do this, like,
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:15.440]   okay, well, we're going to do video and we're going to do music and we're going to people
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:21.040]   come play at our headquarters and record music just for us. And soon, wouldn't it be better if
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:26.000]   you can work your way out of your 10-year contract with Sony to then just work directly with Spotify?
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:34.560]   Right. I mean, subscription pricing is really cheap too. Spotify is like, what, 10 or 12 bucks now?
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:40.560]   I could see those things getting higher and not like losing many subscribers.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:45.520]   Should I feel guilty that I pay 10 bucks a month and I listen to Hamilton's soundtrack on Google
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:52.080]   play music instead of buying it? I mean, that's like a moral dilemma we're all kind of dealing with.
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:57.120]   But yeah, when I really like something, I try to go out and buy it, but mainly for like the
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:02.000]   independent producers, maybe for Hamilton. But also I have a lot of like, you know,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.280]   the smaller bands that I like, I'd buy their stuff. Yeah. But for a bigger band, no.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.080]   But that speaks to Katie's position point, which is you should go independent or maybe it was Jason.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:15.920]   Yeah. Well, the vinyl thing is funny because we all kind of turn our heads again as tech
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:21.680]   people at the rise of vinyl, but vinyl stuff is priced high. It's often sold direct from the
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:28.640]   artists to their hardest core fans. And that story says that vinyl revenue was more than artists made
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.680]   on from YouTube revenue last year. That's sad. Well, YouTube is another problem, right? I know,
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:38.800]   I look at my 21 year old and he doesn't buy music. He listens to YouTube music on YouTube.
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.800]   And that's free. That makes me super sad too, because YouTube stuff sounds terrible.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.000]   Oh, sounds awful. Nobody knows today. They don't care.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000]   All right. I think we're going to wrap this up and we'll wrap it up from our chat room with
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:58.000]   our VNC roulette image of the day. I don't know how you found this image, but it looks like
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:04.000]   it's a toilet that's asking you to rate it. Please rate our toilet. Excellent. Good.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.200]   Satisfactory poor. Very poor. And I love the tag land at the bottom. Don't worry. This screen
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:17.600]   is sanitized regularly. There you go, ladies and gentlemen. Thank God for VNC roulette.
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:23.760]   Please rate rate your hosts. Thank you, Katie Benner. Always a joy. Thank you. And you know what?
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:27.440]   We were all worried about your connection. And it was rock solid and sounded great.
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:33.920]   So I apologize. You'll find Katie at the New York Times and why times.com and on Twitter at
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:40.880]   K. Benner, right? It's K. Benner. K.T. of course. I left out the T. Always a pleasure.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:43.360]   What are you working on this week? Any stories you're excited about?
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:48.880]   I know. I think it's going to be more Apple stories. This is a big shock, I'm sure.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:55.840]   I think so. Yep. Also, Jason Snell, I know what you're working on. You're working on six colors.com
[01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:59.040]   and the incomparable and what else. So many things. That's just the big things.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:05.680]   Lots of podcasts at the incomparable.com. And I've got a few on relay FM. And yeah, all the writing
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:11.680]   mostly goes on mostly on six colors. Occasionally I write weekly for Macworld still, my old shopping
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:18.000]   grounds. I love six colors. I really, you know, speaking of journalism, I really feel like these
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.400]   blogs that have voice and persona and good content, really good content. And that's kind of sometimes
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:30.640]   missing from blogs that are all about voice. But yours has both. And I really think that's
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:36.080]   this cash. I hope you can survive and make it in this world because it's really exactly how it
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:44.240]   should be. I'm not getting the half a cent per play for my stories. But I've got some sponsors
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:50.640]   and I've got a membership program. And it's all good. Yeah. Yeah. I'm always thrilled to hear
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:57.200]   about people like you and Ben Thompson. We're really able to make it in the in the tough
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:03.360]   world of blogs. Stavinder Harderwar, also great to have you on senior editor at Engadget. What
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:09.600]   are you working this week? You can expect a lot of VR content. Yeah. A lot of like us talking about
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:15.200]   VR this week. I'll also be writing an editorial about 4DX at Stupid Theatre Technology because I
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.840]   hated it so much. I wanted to die. 4DX must die. So bad.
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:29.120]   Ooh. Yeah. We always do the. So this has wind, rain, fog, lights and sense. And it punches you.
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:36.560]   Punches you in the back. And the seats move. You're moving all over the place. Oh, it sounds horrible.
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:41.280]   Yeah. Can you turn the effects up and down or off? You could turn off the water. There's like
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:44.640]   a little dial pad on the water. Yeah. I don't want to wear my face. Yeah. The water thing.
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:48.880]   I would I just could never get used to it. How often does that happen in a movie?
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:54.240]   Like for Batman versus Superman was like whenever it rained, that would just get a little sprinkled.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:00.400]   And that's a rainy dark movie. So awful. I do not need that. It's in New York Theatre too.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:03.520]   So it's like you don't know somebody's just like making a spit take or something like you don't
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:08.080]   know if the safe water cannot you like wids in a public space. You don't want them coming at you.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:12.640]   Slash film cast. I'm sure we'll be hearing a little bit about it on this podcast as well.
