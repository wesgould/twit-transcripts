[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.720]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.880]   The show that covers your--
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.760]   what are you looking at me funny before?
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.480]   Oh my gosh.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.160]   Hello, little little John.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.320]   That covers all your tech needs.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.520]   This is our Halloween edition.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.200]   And I guess everybody's in costume today.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.320]   But before we begin, we need to press the green button.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.400]   Would you do the honors, little John?
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.320]   Little harder.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   I'll do it for you.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.480]   That signals the start of the show.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.360]   And electrocutes somebody in the state of Texas.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.320]   So it's very exciting.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.040]   Jolie Odell is to my left cowgirl Jolie Odell.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.540]   Howdy.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.080]   From venturebeats.com.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.680]   Good to see you.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.840]   Thank you for coming all this way.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.600]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.520]   It's nice to see you.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   To your left in the avatar--
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.280]   that's what we call those little TV sets on the table.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.120]   Mr. Ed bot from ZDnet's bot blog.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.960]   And his little friend, Walwart.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.360]   What's his name?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.880]   Kiwi.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.480]   Kiwi Herman.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.240]   Hey, Ed bot.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.640]   Good to have you.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.140]   Thank you.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.120]   Good to be here.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.080]   Ed and I regularly did a radio show in the early '90s.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.080]   With this fellow over here, King John C. Devorak.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   Hello.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.280]   That finally-- wait a minute.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.960]   You've got to get your jewel oriented to the front.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   Not that.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   Good enough.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.320]   It's really tight crowd.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.600]   There you go.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.560]   Actually, then now you look like the grand vizier
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.040]   from Aladdin.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.760]   Can't get it off.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.560]   Butter.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.060]   Butter.
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.360]   Things have been going well here.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.400]   Butter.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.360]   All right, I'm taking off the head.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.200]   It's too hot.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.600]   You may remove your crown.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.840]   And if you wish, you're P-way doll.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.800]   I'm staying.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.400]   You're staying?
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.920]   I'm staying.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.400]   I like it.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.440]   I think it's good.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.080]   It doesn't even look like a costume on you, Jolie.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.440]   It feels like this is how you dress.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.040]   It's just that she looks like she should be wandering around
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.600]   the streets of Petalduma.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.880]   Yelling, hey, you.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.720]   Hey.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.160]   You.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   You want, hey?
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.000]   So anybody has anybody been spending hours and hours
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.520]   as I have all week reading the John C. Devorak biography?
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.600]   The Steve Jobs biography?
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.160]   No.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.680]   Oh, you're listening to it on--
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.240]   I'm listening.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.640]   That cast is reading it.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.920]   Somebody's-- I get every-- the same words you do.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.080]   Yeah, but you don't have the same psychological effect.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   What psychological effect?
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.080]   When you read, you reread and you have a kind of relationship
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.680]   with the words as a writer.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.960]   These two belong together.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.320]   No, Chef Talia, she's right.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   They're both cranky.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.600]   I use read Marshall McLuhan as the mediums
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.280]   of massage or the message.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.720]   And--
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.680]   Different side of your brain, Leo.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.800]   Would you get-- I have the hardcover book.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.200]   I have a Kindle version.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.080]   I have an iBook version and I have the Audible version.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.680]   Yeah, but you're listening to the audio.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.800]   I'm reading him reading as well.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.640]   I'm reading him.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   I know you're changed it.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.560]   You changed the story.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.640]   Well, you know why I did get the hardcover book
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.440]   because I wanted to underline it and annotate it.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.120]   So that, you know, because I want to--
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.360]   frequently, it's been hard not to talk about it.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.520]   So you see, it's heavily underlined and annotated.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.880]   Did you see, in the New York Times,
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.280]   Mona Simpson's very-- I thought-- very touching--
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.200]   obituary.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.960]   Wow.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.560]   They printed this.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.400]   This is a toner printed book.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.040]   What do you mean, toner?
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.520]   You mean it's like laser printed so they could get it out faster?
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.720]   You mean it's cheaply printed?
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.480]   You know, there's not cheap.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.520]   But this--
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.080]   You could tell.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.840]   I would bet money, yeah.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.680]   That's not ink.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.560]   I would bet money.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.520]   I would bet money.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.200]   So is that common now in books or in effect?
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.080]   Oh, I think all books are eventually.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.280]   There's a certain irony to the fact
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.240]   that Steve Jobs, the guy who really brought us
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.640]   laser printing, affordable laser printing,
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.800]   his book would be laser printed.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.120]   This was not done with the toner based print.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.520]   How interesting.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.000]   He-- it is revealed in Mona Simpson's obituary
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.800]   what Steve Jobs' final words were.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.840]   Seriously.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.640]   Shall I read this?
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.520]   Yep, please do.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.040]   She talks about it their relationship.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.800]   It's really-- it's actually beautiful.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.680]   I believe this is the eulogy that she read, actually,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   at his service, because she refers to people
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.520]   in the auditorium and so forth.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.840]   She says, Steve was like a girl.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.480]   How about that in your eulogy?
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.960]   Steve was like a girl in the amount of time
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.120]   he spent talking about love.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.840]   Love was his supreme virtue as God of gods.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.000]   He was a romantic.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.560]   Isn't that funny?
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.280]   I would not have expected that.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.120]   But let me continue on to the final moments.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.440]   So he knew he was going to die.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.560]   He died on Wednesday, Tuesday morning.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.480]   He called his sister, Mona Simpson.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.320]   He's a strange sister.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.240]   Remember, he was adopted and didn't know his mother
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.560]   and his biological parents until he was about 25.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   He found her and her daughter, who
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   was his full sister, Mona Simpson,
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.480]   she turns out to be a fairly well-known novelist.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.880]   Tuesday morning, she writes, he called me
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.200]   to ask me to hurry up to Palo Alto.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.880]   His tone was affectionate, dear, loving,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.040]   but like someone whose luggage was already
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.800]   strapped onto the vehicle, who was already beginning
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.440]   his journey, even as he was truly sorry to be leaving us.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.640]   She started as farewell.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.140]   I stopped him.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.040]   I said, wait.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.480]   I'm coming.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.440]   I'm in a taxi to the airport.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.160]   I'll be there.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.040]   He said, I'm telling you now because I'm afraid you won't
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.200]   make it on time, honey.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.040]   When I arrived, he and his wife, Lorraine,
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.000]   were joking together like partners who lived and worked
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.240]   together every day of their lives.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.320]   He looked into his children's eyes
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.240]   as if he couldn't unlock his gaze until about two
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.000]   in the afternoon.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.680]   His wife could rouse him to talk to his friends from Apple.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.840]   This is how I want to go, John.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.360]   It's surrounded by friends, family, alert to the end.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.400]   And when we do the eulogy, like on a lively podcast,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.440]   that we start off with something with friends like this.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.160]   So we can--
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.120]   I actually had to prefer that.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.560]   Get the audience engaged.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.360]   You don't want him to be somber.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.920]   And I think he'd particularly enjoy the Android pumpkin
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   behind me.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.280]   You know how much he loved Android.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.720]   Oh, Lord.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.640]   This is terribly--
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.400]   OK.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.360]   He made it through the night.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.720]   Lorraine, next to him on the bed,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.480]   sometimes jerked up when there was a longer pause
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.240]   between his breaths.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.080]   She and I looked at each other than he would.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.480]   He had a deep breath in the beginning again.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.240]   This had to be done.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.960]   Even now, he had a stern, still, handsome profile,
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.320]   a profile of an absolutist, a romantic.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.160]   His breath indicated an arduous journey, some steep path.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.240]   Altitude he seemed to be climbing.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.560]   Steve's final words were mono syllables,
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.640]   repeated three times.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.400]   Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.720]   And for a long time at his children,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   then at his life partner, Lorraine.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.240]   And then over their shoulders, past them,
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:14.720]   his final words were, oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.080]   I'm not kidding.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.640]   Those words.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.880]   Are you auditioning for the next reading of the book?
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.960]   Is that the oldest final words?
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.280]   Oh wow.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   He was a hippie to the end.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.040]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.360]   I mean, my mind is blown.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.200]   By that?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.440]   Well, you'd say something profound, although in some ways,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.840]   oh wow is profound.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.400]   Well, it is completely profound because it makes you think
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.880]   about what is he seeing or feelings that's making him say
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.520]   those things.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.080]   And it's like they have a dead type stuff,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.600]   like the veil between what we know and what we don't know
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.560]   is so thin.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.320]   And Steve Jobs' dead is huge.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.840]   And so God knows what he was--
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.040]   Yeah, he was seeing the light.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.520]   He got notes.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.480]   He might have seen the light.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.760]   And he's going, oh wow, wow.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.000]   Now remember, in the book, he says
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.760]   that half the time he was a believer half the time
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.560]   an atheist.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.520]   He couldn't decide.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.680]   And maybe he was finding out the truth at the end
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.720]   and saying, oh wow.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.560]   Or maybe--
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.160]   Is this where the show is gone?
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.080]   No, I'm just--
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.640]   I think this is very interesting.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.200]   First point--
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.000]   You're just making religion?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   T-W-I-R-T-R.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Tour?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.500]   Tour?
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.280]   Sounds like a Beyonce thing.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.160]   Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.920]   You need an L in there.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.280]   So this week in religion and life--
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   There you go, twirl.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:27.780]   Twirl.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.520]   Now I like that.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.200]   I think there's a software package already named that.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.400]   I mean, I'm really not making light of it.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.200]   I think as you do, Jolie, it's--
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.560]   I mean, he could have said klatu barata nikto.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.000]   We don't--
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I mean--
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.600]   No, you're not making light of it.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.400]   I'm not--
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.720]   You start talking and clinging on it during the--
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.240]   No.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.200]   I think he said, oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.360]   It's very interesting.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.120]   After your whole life, you live your whole life, ups and downs,
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.440]   tragedy, comedy, your whole life,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.440]   you come to the end of this and you want some great insight.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.480]   What would your last words-- I know what your last words
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.320]   would be--
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.600]   Rosebud.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.100]   No.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:05.600]   No.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.080]   You sound like f-- off, get away.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   That's your last words.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   That, you know.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.120]   That's your last words.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.360]   There's got to be something like that.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   There's a reputation up here.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.040]   What would your last words, Jolie?
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.640]   Because you know what could happen to us any time.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   You're a young woman, but you could happen--
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.920]   as you walk out the door here, a bus could run you down.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.600]   That's true.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.160]   Oh, but I just want to know--
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.520]   In which case you say, oh wow, oh wow.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.040]   Oh, for shame.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.540]   Oh.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.880]   Well, I don't know if I just--
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:29.840]   I don't know.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.240]   I don't presume to have any idea.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.280]   I have no idea about what comes next or when we all
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.800]   die, what happens, or if anything happens at all.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.120]   But I hope it's something worth saying a wow about.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.000]   I hope it's wonderful.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.720]   You know what would have been interesting?
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.400]   If he'd said, oh, one more thing.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.080]   Oh.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.600]   And we do have a new product.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.280]   One another, I have an idea.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.240]   One more thing.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.360]   Oh, another revelation.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   He loved the Japanese designer, Isai Miyaki, so much.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.680]   He got him to design the trademark black turtlenecks.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.360]   And he ordered hundreds of them.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.640]   And he had them in his closets.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.320]   Hundreds?
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.520]   Literally.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.680]   And that's all he wore.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.800]   He felt he should have an iconic look.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.760]   This is really not so long ago, maybe eight years ago,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.960]   that he should have an iconic look.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.240]   And he ordered 100 or more t-shirts from I say, Miyaki.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.600]   I think that's kind of--
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.040]   I think it was quite beautiful.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.320]   Well, didn't Anna Winter do kind of the same thing?
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.200]   She had this one iconic thing that she ordered.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.320]   The editor in chief of Vogue, what was that?
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.880]   I forget.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.920]   But I think that's kind of-- it speaks
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.440]   to how he emerges traits of technical genius
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.400]   with creative genius.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   He does that weird, e-gimme-niable, creative genius thing.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.840]   Exactly what the book-- really, if you take away--
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   and I'm not going to talk about it all week,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.480]   but I'm not going to belabor this book.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.360]   Why stop now?
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.680]   Why stop now?
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.120]   The final lesson from the book is that what jobs really
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.440]   was good at is merging the artistic creative
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   intuitive side with the rational technical side.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.560]   And I think that that is really what I came away with was
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:11.880]   that was his real ability, was to bring those two sides
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.320]   together.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.880]   Ed, you wrote an article actually about Steve Jobs
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.600]   and the battle for the living room.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.120]   His last product--
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.600]   Might indeed be an Apple TV, you think?
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.760]   Well, it's been rumored since what, 2006, 2007?
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.200]   Yeah, it has.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.960]   So it took like four or five years for the iPad
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.400]   to come into being.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.320]   So I think-- but I do believe that what he told Walter
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.600]   Eisigson is probably accurate.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.120]   And I would say that when we see iCloud fully implemented,
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.840]   that you'll get a lot more hints of what's
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.840]   going to be in an Apple TV next when it finally comes around.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.520]   But it's at least a year away and maybe two.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.040]   Right.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.760]   He says in the biography, I'd like
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.600]   to create an integrated television set that's
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.360]   completely easy to use, seamlessly synced
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.200]   with all your devices in with iCloud.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.800]   It would have the simplest user interface you could imagine.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.240]   And here's the important part.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.960]   I finally cracked it.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.720]   Some say what they believe what he's talking about is Siri,
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.400]   that he was the voice control.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.440]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.520]   Play Gossip Girl.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.400]   I like the theory.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.040]   Record next week's Gossip Girl.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.360]   Something like that?
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.200]   And then it won't do anything, of course.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:36.640]   Well, that would be--
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.560]   It seems to work.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.160]   No, come with that.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.080]   Shut up, Phil.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.400]   Because real problem with all of this stuff
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.800]   is the business relationships with Hollywood
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.640]   untened providers.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.240]   And possible.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.680]   Cracking the code for the iPod and iTunes
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.600]   meant working out business deals with every single one
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.720]   of the major music labels so that they gave him
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.120]   the rights to sell digital copies of their music
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.040]   and then ultimately unprotected.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.920]   And that's the code that has to be cracked in order
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.160]   for something to work in a TV format.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.560]   You know how he did it with the music industry was piracy.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.320]   He said, guys, you're getting robbed blind by pirates.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.600]   He said, it's bad karma.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.560]   I don't want people to be suffering the karma of stealing,
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.000]   bad karma of stealing music.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.840]   We're going to make it possible for them to buy it.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.040]   The music industry didn't want to sell 99-cent songs.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.400]   They didn't want to break up albums.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.840]   They absolutely were terrified of digital distribution.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.080]   But they realized that because of piracy,
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.920]   if they didn't give people a way to get it legally,
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.240]   they were dead meat.
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.440]   Is that also going--
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.800]   I mean, piracy is becoming a problem in movies and television.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.520]   Is that going to move the movie and TV industry?
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.120]   Well, so Apple is going to buy a bit torrent.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.000]   It would be a logical conclusion of that.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.120]   I don't know that piracy is such a big deal on the video side.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.720]   There's a lot of bit torrent users,
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:09.280]   but they're this much of the market.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.360]   Because it's difficult to get bit torrent going.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.040]   You have to be kind of geeky.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.400]   And they're a giant file.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.440]   They'll only be popular stuff.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.280]   If you try to pick up some old classics,
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.640]   you'll never get them all a bit torrent.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.040]   Go ahead and get them all a bit torrent.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.440]   But with CT, I would love it.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   You can do it.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.560]   There are a lot of--
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.400]   Jolene knows how.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   --and there's something less--
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.480]   I have nothing to say about anything.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.120]   I have never downloaded a file that we've seen.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.720]   I bit torrent stuff all the time.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.200]   It's OK.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.480]   You can--
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.560]   --line on a Sunday.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.440]   You're Muck's friends.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.480]   OK, well, no.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.480]   There are a lot of more user-friendly web clients now
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.600]   and downloadable software.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.000]   Transmission is very simple, not complicated.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.920]   And I think it used to be complicated.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.400]   And I think it's becoming less complicated as people
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.160]   are discovering that, oh, why am I paying when it's all out
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.120]   there free and why am I making it hard on myself?
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.000]   So do you think it's a threat to the industry?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.600]   And do you think that they know that?
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.760]   I think--
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.640]   you know, I think that that is one industry that's
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.040]   keeping up a little better than the music industry did
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.360]   because they're doing deals with Netflix and with Hulu.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.320]   That Netflix deals really interesting, isn't it?
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.960]   I mean, the whole thing and then being
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.560]   able to buy some shows on iTunes, I think.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.840]   Yeah, but I was so frustrated.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.960]   I wanted to watch a show on ABC this week.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.320]   What?
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.240]   Was it Gossip Girl?
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.600]   No.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.120]   You can tell me--
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.880]   Hey, buy the way.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.680]   --your mother's friends.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.120]   --saburgatory.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.640]   OK.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.120]   That's terrible.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.600]   That's terrible.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.440]   That's good.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.920]   That's where--
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.600]   you'll say that because my friend is the star of it.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.600]   It's terrible.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.000]   The young girl, Jay and Libby.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.240]   She's a family friend.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.920]   We grew up with her.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.000]   She's wonderful girl.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.840]   She lived just down the road.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.000]   But it might be a terrible--
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.500]   --Grim.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.000]   --crim.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.280]   --see, I want to see it.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:33.800]   But I've never--
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   --great.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.080]   So I'm trying to watch "Saburgatory" because I want to see Jay,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.960]   not because I want to see it show.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.480]   You better see it soon.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.200]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.640]   No, no, no.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.000]   They got a whole season.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.920]   Sure they do.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.320]   But ABC-- it's not on Hulu.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.240]   It's not on Netflix.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:47.960]   It's not anywhere.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.240]   It's on the ABC website.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.520]   And it's only there for a couple of days.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.280]   I couldn't watch last Tuesday's episode.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:52.800]   Oh.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.280]   Two days.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.240]   Well, that's stupid, isn't it?
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.840]   Why do they do that?
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.200]   Because they're stupid.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.560]   Because I'm--
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.360]   That's why you don't work for these guys anymore.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:01.880]   Suits.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.040]   Suits.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.800]   So Dana Burnett, he was on "Tryingulation."
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.320]   He's a producer.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.760]   Got a producer of "Social Hour."
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.200]   He was on this week on "Tryingulation."
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.920]   He is the guy who sold "House of Cards" to Netflix.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.000]   This is a full series.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.640]   It was a British series.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.760]   Very successful.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's going to be about Congress, not about Parliament.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.040]   It's a prestige production.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.680]   Kevin Spacey stars.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.960]   He was able to sell it to Netflix.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.240]   He's very excited about that because Netflix not only paid him
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.080]   more but gives him a lot more flexibility.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.760]   This is the beginning, isn't it?
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.960]   Of disintermediation, of eliminating the networks.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.600]   I say the "Social Hour" or the "Social Network."
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:33.960]   Thank you.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.840]   I always say that wrong.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.680]   It's the "Social Network."
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.000]   We have a show called the "Social Hour."
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.600]   It's a wishful thing.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.240]   It's the "Social Network."
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.920]   You know that one, Facebook?
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.440]   The show, the Zuckerberg movie?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.120]   He produced that.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.440]   OK.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.240]   And he's always got a series called the "Social Network."
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.440]   No, it's called "House of Cards."
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.160]   It's the first-- there are others now.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.760]   Netflix has bought a couple others.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:52.960]   But don't you think that's interesting?
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.440]   That they have the money to spend.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.080]   Maybe not anymore.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.440]   They have the money, but do they have the expertise?
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.680]   I think that's the thing that's been weird about it.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.040]   They don't need the expertise.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.440]   Because they go to the producers who make the show, right?
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.640]   So they hire the expertise from Hollywood.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.840]   And this is what he says.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.760]   He says, "The smart people in Hollywood are the content people,
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.880]   not the produce, not all the other people."
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.000]   And they're making the suits.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.800]   They're making the deals.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.840]   And that's the future.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.080]   And they realize that's the future.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:19.840]   And it's the suits.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.120]   He said the problem with the suits is they know it's going to happen.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.520]   They just say, not on my watch.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.760]   That's what Corey Doctor has said about the music industry, too.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   They just hold on.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.480]   They retire.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.600]   And then they know it's going to all change.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.280]   So this is Netflix that was doing it?
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.120]   Netflix bought-- he didn't say-- wouldn't say how many episodes.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.480]   He said it's more than we would have sold to the network.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.440]   They were this close.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.320]   They were literally a day away from selling it to a network.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   They're about to do the deal.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.120]   And Netflix called.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.200]   And they decided to do the deal with Netflix because of create--
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   listen to what they got.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.080]   Creative control.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.080]   Isn't that what every artist wants?
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.040]   More money.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.720]   Good.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.000]   And Netflix-- I don't know how Netflix is going to distribute it.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.120]   Are they going to do it once a week?
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.800]   They don't need to.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.360]   That's a television trope.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.640]   They could do what they do with Breaking Bad.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.560]   Just put all the episodes up and watch them.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.280]   But wouldn't you pay for Netflix streaming
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.680]   if there were programs that you could get there that were really
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.160]   good that you could only get on Netflix streaming?
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.040]   Doesn't that help them?
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.080]   I think promotion is a huge part of what networks
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.960]   have.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.200]   And Netflix--
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.800]   They don't have it?
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.480]   They don't have the ability to do promotion like that.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.360]   They have to buy more ads on Twitch.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.720]   Just saying.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.840]   Did it buy ads on Twitch?
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.720]   They do.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.280]   But I think that you're absolutely right, Jolie.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.720]   Because the cross promotion--
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.760]   I mean, what makes you want more--
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.320]   No, you go off and there's stock.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.000]   But that's the thing is, I think people
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.240]   are saying that Netflix is dead.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.400]   And I don't know if it's dead.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.960]   I know the movie industry would like it to be dead, right?
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.360]   And that's what's really going to happen.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.360]   Who is this they with a capital T that's saying--
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.160]   Everybody who's this capital--
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.800]   Who's this capital everybody with an E?
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.760]   The stock market.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.560]   The Wall Street says Netflix is dead.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.320]   I don't trust the stock market as a barometer of what people
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.520]   actually think and how companies are really performing.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.440]   I agree.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.080]   But they have subscribers.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.400]   They can put them out of business
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.400]   by just making their stock be a buck.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.600]   I think Little America is not going to let Netflix die just yet.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.840]   No, in fact, a new study says that Netflix takes up
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.280]   32.7% of internet bandwidth.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   But it's dead.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.280]   I remember they said so.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:19.320]   One third of all the internet bandwidth used is Netflix.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.160]   It's pretty high.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.320]   Pretty high.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.120]   Pretty high.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.360]   This is from Sandvine, too.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.440]   These Sandvine guys are actually pretty smart.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.840]   Don't believe everything you read on the internet, man.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.560]   Well, I believe this.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.120]   Sandvine analyzed 200 internet service providers in 80 countries.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.680]   This isn't just the US.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.400]   And found that real-time entertainment apps--
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.960]   And look at that.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.040]   Prime time 6 to 10 PM is the peak times for people watching
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.680]   crap on Netflix, just like they went on their television.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:46.920]   I know.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.560]   They don't need to.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.280]   But they're home from work.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.840]   My daughter watches in the middle of the day.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.360]   But she doesn't have a job.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.960]   See, most people have jobs.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.080]   Yeah, really.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.080]   Netflix is a student.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.760]   Actually, in this country, that's probably not true.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.200]   What?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.040]   People don't have jobs, right?
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.840]   No, everybody's unemployed.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.680]   Everybody's unemployed.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.760]   So Sandvine says 60% of peak downstream traffic
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.240]   is real-time entertainment apps.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.920]   That's up from 50%.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.320]   Can I say that again?
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.400]   Between peak hours of 6 to 10 PM,
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.320]   60% of downloading traffic is entertainment,
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.840]   is Netflix, and it's brethren.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.240]   Hulu and all that.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.920]   60%.
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.200]   Well, that's the bandwidth, though.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   So a single click on a Netflix program
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.600]   is going to take--
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.000]   Gigabytes of megabytes, or gigabyte of stuff.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   And I can click 1,000 web pages and not even come close
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.760]   to a third of that amount of bandwidth.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.760]   And get more entertainment value for your dollar.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.640]   And a whole bunch of cat videos on YouTube.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.680]   Which, by the way, YouTube did something similar this week.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.560]   Yes, let's talk about it.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.000]   They launched their new Google TV.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.080]   And they're going to have a bunch of YouTube channels
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.680]   that they're funding that sound, in a way,
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.480]   like a low budget version of what Netflix is doing
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.600]   as you just described it.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.520]   They signed deals with Shaquille--
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.840]   I don't really understand what they're going to do.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.720]   They have $100 million at least that they budgeted for this.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.960]   They signed deals with people like Martha Stewart,
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.760]   Shaquille O'Neal, to do channels, right?
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.400]   So do you have an insight into what that's going to be?
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.960]   Is it going to be you'll go to the Shaquille O'Neal channel?
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.560]   There's going to be 100 channels.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.720]   And in fact, I think this is the--
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.480]   throw it up against the wall and see what sticks.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.520]   I agree.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.800]   And most of it's--
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.160]   I think this also covers up the fact
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.680]   that Google released their transparency report.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.120]   Oh, we got to talk about that.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.680]   Wait a minute, let's not shift because that's a good story.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.800]   I will do that after the break.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.600]   Let's finish this.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.080]   But yeah, the break, where we sell things.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.200]   I got a slap chop.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.800]   You ever try it?
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.360]   Oh my god.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.120]   Slap chop.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:01.640]   Slap chop.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.680]   You're going to love us to try it.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.640]   You--
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.140]   What I have to store for you.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.840]   Really?
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.800]   Yeah, I used to work for--
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.280]   Let me see.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.840]   Do you have all five fingers?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.960]   You worked for somebody who sold slap chops?
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.400]   The guy who made them.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:11.840]   Really?
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.240]   I did.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.080]   We'll talk that kind of crazy off the air.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.600]   Wow.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.000]   No, we won it on the air.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.960]   You worked-- wait a minute.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.120]   This must have been a not that guy.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.640]   This is when you were right out of school or something.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.160]   You were young.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.680]   You didn't know?
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.440]   It was in between jobs.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   It was last week, actually.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.120]   I was doing a lot of consulting.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.040]   This was in '08, right after the big market crash.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.000]   Oh, recently?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.960]   I mean, oh wait, I guess that's recent.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.800]   Not the guy.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.400]   Not the sham.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:33.720]   Wow.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.240]   Not the sham.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.000]   Guys, same guy.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.560]   Oh, it's the same guy.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.960]   He invented the slap chop?
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.720]   Well, you don't think somebody else invented it.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.200]   He was the master of slap chop.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.320]   The guy was brought in as a shill.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.480]   No, he's like a whole.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.160]   What's his name?
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.120]   So he's a genius.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:45.920]   I love this guy.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.160]   Oh, no, you don't.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.920]   Oh, really?
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   Google him sometime.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   He's the guy who punched the prostitute or whatever.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   She's biting his tongue.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   Were you with Vince when that happened?
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.440]   No, but I had to go on a business trip to Europe where we went into the places in Germany
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   where they actually make the sham while we were trying to get a better deal on them.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440]   You know, it's made Germany.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   Germans make great stuff.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.440]   They do.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   Camera guys.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   We had to go to the embassy.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440]   It was a nightmare.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   Oh, my.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.440]   I don't want to say anything.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.440]   I don't want to watch this guy.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.440]   Bring up the audio.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.440]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.440]   I don't want to talk about it.

[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   I'm going to talk about it.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.660]   It says something about the United States that we have more processes here where people
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:23.040]   can file requests like this.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.480]   There is a process for it.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.960]   I suspect it's much more difficult in Turkey or Hungary or anywhere they protect the privacy
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.720]   of the citizens a little better in places like Turkey.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:39.000]   No, that it might be more difficult for someone to even get a complaint through a governmental
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.440]   agency and then on to Google.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   Yeah, right?
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.440]   See, Ed's the voice of reason, which takes all the fun out of this.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:54.200]   It's a milk toast response to a situation that's dreadful.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.960]   You don't have enough data to say that.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.760]   You may believe it and you may be right.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.600]   You may be right in believing it.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.000]   But based on the data that you have here.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.320]   No, I'm just shooting off my mouth because I feel that based on the things that have
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.640]   been happening, I think I'm probably right.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.880]   Well, what would your alternative be then?
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.320]   What's the ideal way to handle if somebody makes a death threat?
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.080]   How do you handle the right thing for the death threat?
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.080]   Well, yeah, but he had to go.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.080]   Can we go through the police?
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.920]   The police went through the police and the police had to go to the internet.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   You have to go through it.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   Do process.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   Do process.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   That's what this is.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.960]   I'm not saying this is to do process.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.560]   I'm seeing them calling up Google and saying, look, this is the attorney.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.160]   They have to have warrants for all that stuff.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.840]   No, that was the Patriot Act anymore.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.200]   Does warrants or forget it?
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.880]   We don't need warrants for any of this stuff.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.240]   There's no warrants involved in any of this.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   I can assure you.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240]   Well, that's not true.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.240]   Well, what do we know?
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.320]   We have to call Google and then listen to their spin doctors and filter that.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.880]   I'd love to know.
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.880]   Would you get to work?
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.880]   I can make a call on that.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.880]   By the way, how do you do like me so much?
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.880]   I'd be working for Lance Ulanoff over there.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.560]   She didn't work in Mashable anymore.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.560]   She left.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.080]   Zip in it lock and it put in it.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   I don't.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   And she quit?
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.080]   You left.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   Yes, I did.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.120]   I work now for Matt Marshall and he is a gentleman and a journalist and I love it.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.120]   Where's this?
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.120]   Entropy.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   Oh.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.120]   Woohoo.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.120]   You left before Lance joined Mashable.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.280]   Oh, you left before Lance showed up.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.280]   I did.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.480]   Long enough before that you can't impute that it was Lance.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.880]   Yeah, because he has Lance on the show all the time.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   No, Mashable.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.880]   We all like Lance.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.680]   Mashable and Lance, I don't know anything about that relationship.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.920]   Mashable, there's other stuff which we'll talk about.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.640]   You and I later.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   Okay.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   That's it.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   She's full of secrets.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   She's a secretive woman.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   She's full of secrets.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.640]   I got all the dirt on everybody.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   I know where the box is.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   Who's worse?
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   Vince or Lance?
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.640]   Vince?
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   Well, I don't know Lance from him.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   See, there you go.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.000]   So, great article.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.560]   Ed bot wrote a great article.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.320]   Actually, I love Ed, by the way.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   We all love Ed's.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.320]   We all love Ed's.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.320]   We all love Ed's.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   We all love Ed's.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.440]   And I understand that you're saying this was one of the most red articles on ZDNet in
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.440]   five years.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.200]   This is the number one article on ZDNet.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   Is that right?
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   That I've written.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.200]   That you've written.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.080]   I don't know about it.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:17.120]   But as far as I know, it's been the single most red article that I've done in five years.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.320]   And I think it's this picture.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.520]   Tamblad PC is super cool.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.520]   That's, you know, that was, I looked at the...
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.640]   Microsoft tried to get me fired from PC Magazine because of this piece of crap that they were
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.940]   trying to sell.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:37.160]   So we were at a award ceremony and I was giving them nothing but grief because I've
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.560]   made allusions of the fact.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.560]   This was in like '99.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.640]   I said, "You were predicting it's going to do this and that and this is not going to
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   sell any."
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.640]   Bill Gates wanted tablets to be successful for 10 years.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:52.800]   He put his heart and soul into selling tablets and he could not make it work.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.720]   And it must have galled him endlessly.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:55.720]   Yeah, it's just...
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.720]   That Apple comes along with the iPhone.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.720]   It's falling off the log.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.720]   Boom.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.800]   But, you know, and the article is called A Decades Worth of Windows Mistakes that changed
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:08.240]   Microsoft for better and worse was a tablet PC better or worse?
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.920]   Well, it was worse for a long time but it has changed them for the better.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:20.280]   I think they finally woke up and realized that tablet functionality is not a feature
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.440]   that you put into a laptop.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:29.600]   It's an experience that you integrate into a unified hardware software package.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.760]   Have they learned that lesson?
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.320]   Will they know better with Windows 8 on that tablet?
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.320]   Ask me again in February.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   Yeah, I guess we'll know.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.320]   That would be interesting.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.680]   Did you try the way I mentioned something to the chat room who said I was bullshitting
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.800]   them when they came to this.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   They tried to get me to buy this.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   Oh, no, I'm sure they did.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.960]   No, Microsoft was the worst for this.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.360]   Nobody did anything, of course.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.280]   They call your bosses at ZDNet or whoever...
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   It was at ZIF.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.280]   ZIF.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.480]   And they say, "Hey, you know, we didn't appreciate what the VORAC did at that presentation."
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.840]   And by the way, we spend how many millions of dollars a year on display ads that was the
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:04.080]   irony of Microsoft, they were so cheap that they didn't spend enough money to get me
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   fired.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.080]   It was great.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.080]   Hey, they had bought more ads.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:08.080]   They might have had a shot at it.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.080]   Let me tell you how cheap they were.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.080]   It's a good little story.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.160]   So I'm in Brazil and going down...
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.320]   Because I'm writing for a magazine down there and I was also licensed to PC Magazine.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:20.640]   Brazil, for a while, so I was hanging out with the publisher and he tells me that Microsoft,
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.480]   as soon as he starts the magazine, they come in and they say, "Here's what we want.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.480]   We want this page.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.480]   We want the inside front cover page.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.480]   We want two ads inside."
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.480]   And I says, "Okay."
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.400]   And he says, "This will cost you this much."
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.400]   She says, "Oh, no, no, no.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.040]   We're not going to pay for these ads."
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.040]   What?
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.200]   And apparently this is standard procedure with these guys.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.200]   He says, "What do you mean you're not going to pay for these ads?"
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.200]   "I'm not going to give you these ads."
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:46.120]   He says, "Oh, no one is going to take your magazine seriously if we're not advertising
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   it."
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.120]   You know what?
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.120]   They have a little bit of a point.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.320]   Not anymore, but in those days they had a point.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   And he said, "No."
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.040]   And did anybody take the magazine seriously?
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.920]   No, they didn't fold it.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:01.240]   They didn't say they had been in business for two or three years, but it was because of
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   Microsoft.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.240]   I think that's a good point.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.040]   But Microsoft, that's the kind of thing they do.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   Who did that though?
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.040]   Is it Wagner Edstrom?
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.040]   Is it actually Microsoft?
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040]   No, no, no.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   It's our sales guys.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   The people who buy the ads.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.040]   Okay.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:16.000]   This was 1998 or '99, right?
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   In that era, yeah.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   So that was pre-antitrust.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Right.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   They're still cocky.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   They're still cocky.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.640]   This was cowboy Microsoft.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   Right.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.640]   Very, very worse.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.800]   They were still doing the per-processor licensing for MS-DOS.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:37.200]   They were still doing the restrictive clauses on things that you could add on the desktop.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:42.320]   I mean, they were at their monopolistic best.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.160]   They were very arrogant at that time.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:52.040]   And Google has been studying the playbook from the 1990s and is replicating every single
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.560]   one of those things today.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.880]   I mean, it's just staggering to watch it today.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.400]   Just sitting there going, they're doing this and this was 1997 Microsoft.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.640]   They're doing this, this was 1998 Microsoft.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   They're getting the attention.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.160]   Give me one example though.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:12.640]   Of something that the Google's doing that's like the arrogant Microsoft of the end of the
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.200]   '90s.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.080]   They just changed the APIs for Google Maps.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.600]   Oh yeah, there's a very good example.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:28.200]   After wiping out the competition, basically owning the marketplace in this and getting
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:36.280]   small application developers, newspapers, especially to build these things that are getting
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:43.160]   page views based on Google Maps API calls, now they start saying, "Okay, you get more
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.320]   than 25,000 page views a year.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.800]   Boom, you got to pay for it."
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.680]   That's classic Microsoft.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:51.280]   That's what monopolies do.
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.160]   Drive out the competition and then start charging for it.
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.800]   But they are, they're in there getting the same kind of scrutiny that Microsoft got from
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:58.800]   the DOJ.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.440]   I mean, this could very well end the same way.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:09.160]   I've read through the years, a couple of years ago they were literally days away from
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:15.600]   having an antitrust action filed against Google and the Department of Justice and Google
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.800]   worked something out the last minute.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.240]   They do see it.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.000]   And the whole Motorola thing?
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.640]   Buying Motorola.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.640]   Buying Motorola.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:30.960]   And I know that Andy Rubin says, "No, we're going to run Motorola as a hands-off business
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.880]   at arm's length."
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:41.520]   But if I were HTC and Samsung and the other Android makers, I would have my lawyers on
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:47.840]   the phone with the DOJ every single day asking them what they're going to do about this.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.680]   They did flip-flop because originally they said, "No, we're not going to make handsets."
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.560]   And then they said, "Oh, well, of course we're going to make handsets."
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:01.120]   And back in some discovery for the Oracle patent trials, they found that Microsoft, what
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.600]   am I saying?
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:08.160]   Google had been giving extra lead time and special consideration to Motorola and Verizon.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   All along.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   All along.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:14.320]   So nothing's really changing, but now it's a much more obvious relationship.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.600]   It has been asserted that there are hidden APIs in Android that people who are like Motorola
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.840]   now, I guess, actually old Microsoft games.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.160]   We've heard that before.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.880]   Have you heard that phrase before?
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.080]   When did we last hear hidden APIs?
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.720]   I think it was about 1995.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.720]   1990?
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.080]   Okay, so number one tablet.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.720]   Let's scroll through some of these horrendous mistakes that Microsoft made.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.360]   SAP adds a firewall, a good firewall.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.360]   But in the original edition?
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:43.640]   They had a very good firewall and then they didn't turn it on.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.360]   It wasn't turned on by default.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:55.160]   And it's the result blaster worm and code red and Sasser all just, I mean, there was
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:03.120]   one week in August of 2003 when I think I made 10 house calls to fix this thing on people's
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   PCs.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.720]   But they learned, because service back to turn it on.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.720]   Not the firewall.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.280]   And that, by the way, is probably the single most important security move ever made by
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.960]   any company in the history of computing.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.840]   So why did you move to New Mexico?
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:18.440]   Have you ever been here, John?
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.440]   Yeah, I've been to.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.440]   It's the land of enchantment.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.440]   It's the land of enchantment.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:23.240]   Lightning storms in the world.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.360]   I find that enchanting and I've got my New Mexico hat on to prove it.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.720]   But why did you move there?
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.720]   It's not like a tech center.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.720]   Yeah, why did you move there?
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   Is his wife?
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.720]   His wife.
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.720]   No, no, no.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:36.040]   We can live anywhere we want.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:42.920]   And we really lived in Silicon Valley first and then we lived in Redmond and we got tired
[00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:50.520]   of being surrounded by people living in a bubble who could only talk about themselves.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.680]   And so I'm out here.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:56:00.240]   I cover products for people who actually use them and it's actually, it's very interesting
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:05.360]   to watch it from 700 miles or 1,000 or 2,000 miles away.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.560]   You get a much clearer perspective on it.
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.560]   That's not here.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.080]   Exactly why Twitter is not in San Francisco.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   We thought about it.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.600]   It'd be easier to do this in San Francisco.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.600]   Very close enough.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.120]   No, I don't think there's that bubble here.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.360]   I don't think there's that sense.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.040]   When you meet people here, they're not talking about Twitter.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.120]   Oh, yeah, Ev was in the cafe.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   It's a very different place.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.920]   I didn't know about you.
[00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:26.680]   It's still drive down to the valley.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.840]   Well, that's why it's kind of perfect because it's close enough that I can get you and Jolie
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.000]   to come here.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   We can drive down there.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.600]   But I don't, by the way, I don't do vendor meetings.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.600]   I don't do any of that stuff.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   I want to keep it arm's length.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   I'm with it.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.600]   I'm with it on that one.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.040]   No, we weren't coming to the Twitch studios.
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.560]   No, we don't do it ever.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   They try.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.520]   We were in We were in Healdsburg last week.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.520]   Isn't it great?
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:49.120]   It's a wonderful little town visiting some old friends.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.760]   There was not a, we didn't talk much about tech.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.760]   Right.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.760]   We went up to dinner.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:57:01.480]   We didn't hear people around us talking about the latest deal or what their latest pivot
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:04.880]   is or getting a series B round.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.320]   There was none of that going on.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.080]   People were talking about wine.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.440]   I find it enjoyable.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   What?
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.720]   That people are talking about all the stuff around you everywhere you go and you can
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.240]   spy on them and listen to them.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.240]   I find it so annoying.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.080]   And, well, yeah, you would.
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:20.760]   I can see though, for you, it's great because you might get some tidbits.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.680]   I get lots of tidbits.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:26.440]   But I think that it poisons the well if you're a journalist covering this stuff.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:31.000]   You really do have to keep your, it's hard to keep your feet on the ground.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.600]   What if you're, if you try to do it?
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.040]   You don't have the problem because you hate everybody.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.040]   I do.
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.080]   So that doesn't, you don't care.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   You don't mind.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   I don't care.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   I'm cynical.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   I think everything's bull crap.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.040]   But me, I have the problem because I want, I want, I want people like me.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   Yes, you do.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.680]   You're the, you and you are like a little person.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.520]   Well, as a journalist, you have to accept the fact that everybody hates you no matter
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.520]   what you do or say.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.440]   So you just kind of get used to it and do your own thing.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.600]   But don't you, Julie.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.360]   I mean, oh, look, there's a little kitty cat.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.480]   That's something else you don't get in the, in the savages.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   There's cats all over the city.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:03.200]   So they're only on YouTube in Silicon Valley.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.480]   So, but, Julie, you probably go to all the events, the parties that you don't.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.480]   No, no.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.480]   You don't.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.160]   I think that's a real problem when a journalist does that because they start to get sucked
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.160]   in.
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.160]   What do you mean, friends with people?
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.160]   You can't afford to be friends with them.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:17.160]   I don't want to be friends with them.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.160]   Because once in a decade, you're going to really have to screw them over.
[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.160]   Exactly.
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.080]   You're going to have to tell objective stories about their lives and personalities and
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.720]   you cannot be emotionally involved.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   Right on, Julie Odell.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.640]   You're just as grumpy as John is.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.640]   We're journalists.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:29.640]   You both hate people.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.640]   I do.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:31.640]   We know actually that's not true.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.880]   And she's being disingenuous.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.880]   She doesn't hate people at all.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:34.880]   I don't.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:37.920]   She just likes the idea of the objectivity of the...
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   She's right.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   That's her job.
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:40.920]   And I wish writer she's an introvert.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:41.920]   She's good.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.920]   She's good.
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:43.920]   I am an introvert.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   And I don't like being around people.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.080]   And when I'm around people, I don't like to talk about work, which means I don't have
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   a cell phone.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   I don't get on the line when I'm not working.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   What?
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   You don't have a cell phone?
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.080]   No.
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.600]   Remember the old days, like 10 years ago?
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   No.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:58.080]   She uses a landline, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.080]   Five years ago.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.080]   Wow.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   Five years ago.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080]   No, I have to have a cell phone.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.080]   I use...
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:04.080]   I try to keep my personal life in my life.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.720]   I don't keep the technology at arm's length because I need to...
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.240]   But that's where we're different because I review cell phones.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.600]   So obviously I have to use cell phones.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.080]   No, it's because you're a gadget junkie.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.080]   I am.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   Because you can use cell phones without having one.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.080]   No, you can't.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:18.080]   He has all of them.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.080]   He is it to say what you do.
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.400]   You cannot review a cell phone unless you use it for months and get a sense of...
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.480]   You are a gadget junkie.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   At least two weeks.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   Well, listen to me.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   Okay.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   That's a nice man.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.120]   He's a gadget junkie and he uses this as an excuse to buy all this stuff so he can take
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.360]   a tax ride off.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.360]   I don't deny that.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.360]   I don't deny that.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.360]   Get him.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.600]   But what I don't want to do is make friends with you.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.920]   I don't want to make friends with these people.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.440]   Oh, you're the friendliest guy in town.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.960]   That's why I stay away from them because I would make friends with them.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   Yeah, you would.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.280]   But here, drag this back to the topic at hand.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:54.880]   If you want honest political coverage, do not ask a reporter and want to tease you.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.880]   Exactly.
[00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.880]   Because they, I agree with that.
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.240]   They are all being invited to all the parties.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.440]   And in fact, being invited to those parties is how they curry favor with their sources.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.840]   And so they have to be careful about what they say and they have to go to all the right
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.000]   parties and talk to all the right people.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.440]   If you live in Silicon Valley or you live in Seattle or you live in, you know, Route
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:21.120]   128 or any one of those places, you are going to be sucked into that culture and you're
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.760]   going to make friends with these people.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.720]   And every time you write a story, you're going to be going, oh, can I really, maybe I should
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:34.320]   tone this quote down because maybe this guy won't take my call the next time I call him
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.360]   up or he'll snub me at the next party that I go to.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:40.360]   And it's really refreshing not to be in a culture like that.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.320]   Well, I'll tell you what the problem with that theory is.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.400]   And I appreciate that you're in New Mexico.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.120]   I would live in Paris if I had the chance.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.800]   But I feel that when you're in the milieu, I think it's critically important because
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.000]   you get a second sense, kind of a deeper sense and understanding of things because you're
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   in the milieu, whether you go to the party or not.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   It's true too.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   You can be in it and not a thing.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   In and out of it.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   This could be an observer.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   It is possible.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.280]   But to be in it makes a huge difference.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.200]   You have a, well, that's why I had a little moment.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.400]   I'm posting a credit credit.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.280]   Well, you get these other people like us coming in to keep you kind of.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:15.760]   You are the milieu.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.760]   You hook me into the milieu.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.400]   I just say you're in my boat time cowboy hat and go milieu is French for bubble.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.000]   It's so best line you've done in your life.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   Good for you.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Congratulations.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   Finally, I've been waiting.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   Okay.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.640]   A decade worth of Windows mistakes that changed Microsoft.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.720]   Here's one.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.800]   The stupid search dog.
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.800]   Oh, yes.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.920]   The only good thing about the search dog is when you said turn the search dog off, it
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.040]   would put its tail, literally put its tail between its legs and wander off into the distance.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:51.600]   Like you'd hurt its freaking feelings.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.280]   It's just not good.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:02:00.520]   Well, it was a whole, there was a whole time when Microsoft's interface designers were
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.320]   wedded to the notion that people were afraid of technology.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   It's patronizing.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.560]   And it was completely patronizing.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.000]   And somebody on Twitter this week said, well, how is this different from Siri?
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.240]   And I just want to, you know, let's, let me count a thousand different ways.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.760]   The whole thing with Rover, the dog, the search dog is it was, it was an unnecessary distraction.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.880]   It was adding steps to a process that you should be simplifying.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.880]   Yes.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:35.440]   Siri, Siri is a way that they may, it may go overboard slightly, but it is a way for you
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:42.920]   to construct a query in a, in a way that's familiar to you and to get an answer back in
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.200]   a way that's familiar to you.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.840]   And I don't think that they've imbued the thing with too much, too much personality.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.840]   I think Apple's done that much.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.600]   I actually love, I'm surprised myself because I thought Siri would be a gimmick.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   I wouldn't use it.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:56.600]   I use it all the time.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   I really love it.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   Doesn't really work though.
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.840]   I mean, we've had people in our office try to use it and it works great and that it
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.840]   works.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.840]   Unless the networks down.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.400]   I want to say, just a little off topic here.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.240]   Ed is sounding what?
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.680]   Like, like this is such an on topic show, please.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.440]   Ed is sounding enough like John Doar that I believe that we can use him for some practical
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.440]   jokes.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440]   I would be just fan-tapped.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.280]   John, not only off topic, but totally obscure.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   It's good.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.760]   He's going for the trifecta here.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.360]   I think we could work just a little of the pacing and then we got it.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.920]   My wife once worked for John Doar.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.360]   Oh, he could ask.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:30.240]   Well, she probably knows what his case is.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.440]   He's an adventure capitalist.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.720]   Yes, a very famous adventure capitalist in Silicon Valley and a lot of boards.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.400]   We could have him call people up and fire him.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.000]   And what is it about it that he likes, that he sounds like him?
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.120]   Is it that he likes Siri?
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.520]   No, it's the voice.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:44.520]   His voice.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.520]   His actual vocalization is very much like John Doar's.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:51.040]   A little, maybe a pacing thing here or there, but generally speaking, he sounds like him.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040]   This is a great--
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.520]   Where were you raised, Ed?
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.560]   I was raised in Central California just over the ultimate pass from the--
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.760]   Because John Doar is actually from St. Louis.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.720]   I wonder if there's any-- probably not.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.280]   I could go on because they're quite--
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.320]   So you should skip to probably numbers eight and nine are the worst offenders there.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.080]   Well, number eight, of course, is user account control going overboard.
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.280]   Which had absolutely-- it did.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.280]   It annoyed people.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.880]   In fact, it had the negative impact because people got to the point where you just say
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.120]   cancel, cancel, cancel, whatever, or OK, OK, OK.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.280]   They stopped paying attention to it.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.280]   I think it was a good idea.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.040]   It was a good security model, but the problem is you bug people, they're going to just
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.160]   say OK and keep going.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.040]   And then, of course, I agree with you on this.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.720]   The product, copy protection in Windows.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.520]   It wasn't enough just to have serial number protection.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.320]   Then they had to have genuine user-- what is it called?
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.520]   Windows Genuine Advantage?
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.520]   Like that's an advantage?
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.080]   Well, they've gone through several different names for it.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:02.520]   The problem with WGA, Windows Genuine Advantage, when it was introduced in 2006 and 2007,
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.160]   was that it didn't work.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.920]   And it caught in one study--
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.920]   I mean, I--
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.960]   They said-- Microsoft admitted 5% false positives.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.800]   They admitted 5%, but I did my own independent study.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.360]   It was probably where I made my bones at ZDNet.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:25.640]   42% of the complaints that they were getting in the first year for Windows Genuine Advantage
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:30.840]   were people who were being unfairly tagged as pirates.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.480]   And it just wasn't right.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:38.560]   And I think over the course of three years-- now, I will give--
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.120]   this is one of those cases where Microsoft changed for the better as a result of getting
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120]   criticism.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:53.840]   Even when I was pounding them every week on this for months, maybe a full year, I was
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:59.840]   going up to Redmond and having these incredibly tense meetings with people.
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:01.200]   And I would say, you need to do this.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.560]   And they would say, we're doing that.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.800]   And I would say, that's not enough.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:11.440]   They made some very serious changes to what they had done.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:18.760]   And today, you have not heard users complaining about activation being a problem in the last
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760]   two years.
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:20.760]   None.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:27.960]   It's a non-issue because they finally figured out that the tie goes to the runner.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   Yes.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.800]   If there's any kind of a doubt--
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   Yes.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:38.480]   And in fact, their original thing was a kill switch that they had for windows that would
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.040]   turn your screen black.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.440]   And after three days, make windows stop working.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.240]   Eventually, they came up with a switch that they have in their offices in Redmond that
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.760]   if they detect that the activation servers are doing anything out of the ordinary, they
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.600]   flip that switch and--
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.600]   Everything's OK.
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   Everything's OK.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:56.600]   --everybody's--
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:01.040]   --conflict is resolved in favor of the customer until they figure out what the issue is.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.520]   And that's what they should have done all along.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.920]   And they finally figured that out.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.080]   But it was a couple years of nightmares.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:23.320]   And every single one of those people who were impacted by that, they say one bad recommendation
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.000]   takes-- wipes out 10 good ones.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.640]   And this is an example of where that was completely true.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.760]   We-- Ed Bon is here from ZDNet.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:36.560]   And really, one of the best reporters on the scene there is perhaps because he lives
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.720]   outside the bubble in New Mexico.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.720]   The milieu.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.720]   In the milieu.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720]   He's outside the milieu.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.080]   He's outside the milieu.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.440]   Inside the milieu, John C. de Vorac, who is also-- see, he just shows-- there's many ways
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.440]   to do it.
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.760]   One of the best tech reporters in the world.
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:53.760]   Channeldevorac.com.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.440]   There's just so many shows you do that--
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.440]   There's no agenda show.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440]   --noagendashow.com.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.240]   You can run into that occasion.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   Great show.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.240]   Great stuff.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.240]   You're doing this new--
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   That's that you would--
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   The new X.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.240]   What is it?
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240]   X marks the spot.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240]   X marks the spot.
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240]   That's the show.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   Now, X3 shows--
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240]   What is that about?
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.240]   What is that about?
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.440]   I got two guys and just three of us.
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.440]   You know what I did?
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:19.680]   I kept bringing these little panel shows down to the point where I don't want to book anybody.
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.440]   I don't want rotating guests.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.440]   They don't show up.
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.440]   But they bitch about the time you do.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.440]   The same three guys over and over and over.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   The same three guys.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   The same three guys.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   --constantly.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   Over and over and over.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.440]   You got it.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.440]   And what do they say?
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.440]   It's like the same three guys on a sitcom.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.440]   It's not like you're complaining about that.
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440]   No, it's like Larry Moen Curly.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.440]   It's like Manny Moen--
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.440]   And that's what they call us.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.440]   --this is Larry Moen.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.440]   And Curly.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.440]   And what do you talk about?
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.440]   Movies.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440]   No, we talk about tech news.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   Tech news.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.440]   What's inside the movie?
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.440]   We have a different model for the way it's done.
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.440]   We have a super, really a geeky guy that's like a real--
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.440]   You have prototype archetypes.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.440]   Archetypes.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:04.440]   Yes, exactly.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.440]   The crank, the geek, the stoner.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440]   It's perfect.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   The crank, the geek, and the stoner.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:11.440]   Which one are you?
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:16.440]   If that's not like a model for success, I have no idea.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.440]   But no, so you've reinvented the panel show.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.440]   Yes, I've gone over and over all these models.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.440]   Brilliant.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   And how's that show doing?
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   Good?
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:25.440]   It's killing.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:26.440]   It's killing.
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440]   It's hot.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.440]   It's number one.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   Well, I don't know about that.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.440]   X3.mivio.com.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.440]   And then we have another one called Generation X3.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.440]   No.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:36.440]   Yeah, and I got two, three millennials in me, and I grill them about social--
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.440]   What is with you kids?
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   What's wrong with you kids?
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.440]   What do you know?
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   You pay for music.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.440]   If they don't cry, it's not a good show.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.440]   Right.
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:45.440]   It makes them cry.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.440]   I haven't gotten to that yet.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:47.440]   Work on it.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.440]   Julia Della's Venture Beat.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.440]   What is your title?
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440]   Writer, Chief Writer, Story, Architect.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.440]   Just writer.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   We don't put too much in that.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.440]   No, I write stuff.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   I'm Chief Twit.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   Good on you.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.440]   I just pass that along.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.440]   This show brought to you by the folks at audibleaudible.com.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.440]   Folks, if you are not yet an Audible member--
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.440]   Ooh, you're missing out.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.440]   Some great stuff on Audible.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440]   Of course, we were talking earlier.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.440]   I do listen to the Audible books.
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440]   I feel it's just like reading.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.440]   And their book, the Steve Jobs book, is very important.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.440]   Steve Jobs book is very nicely done.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.440]   Now, this is a long book.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:25.440]   And the best way to-- by the way, I'm not going to say anything, but you can get it on iTunes
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.440]   for like 30 bucks or $19.59 on Audible.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.440]   They have the best price on this book.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.440]   Really nicely done.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.440]   Same exact book.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.440]   It's a Simon & Schuster production.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.440]   And it is a long book.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.440]   So this is the way I would listen.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.440]   25 hours.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.440]   But now that sounds like a lot.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.360]   And if you're reading it and you go fall asleep, every three pages is going to take you a year to
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.360]   read it.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   But I've read it an entire week because I spend time in cars.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   So when you drive to work, that's a couple hours a day.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.360]   You pick up the kids at school.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.360]   Go to soccer practice.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.360]   You don't have to watch the game.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   You can read a book.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.360]   You drive five minutes to this job.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.360]   Sometimes I drive around and around and around because I'm so excited by the book.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.360]   Just saying.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.360]   I do it while I'm in the gym.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.360]   Actually, you know where I'm mostly at getting my time in the gym is because that's an hour
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.360]   a day and I listen in the gym.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.360]   It's good.
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   Anyway, this is a fantastic book, highly recommended.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.360]   But there's so much more on Audible.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.360]   You like Neil Gaiman?
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.360]   I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.360]   And they have done something new here.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   Let me see if I can find the link on this.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   It's a Neil Gaiman collection introducing Neil Gaiman presents.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.860]   So I'm reading American Gods, which is one of his great novels of all time.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.360]   But what he's done is he has selected books from Audible.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   So if you like his style, you want to check this out.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:44.360]   This is from the Audible Creation Exchange.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.360]   Not Neil Gaiman books, but books that Neil loves and recommends.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   See, that's great.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.360]   One of the things that's fun about Audible, it's a bookstore.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.360]   75,000 audio books and shows and speeches and stuff.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.360]   But the fun thing is it's like browsing a bookstore.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   I just downloaded this.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360]   It's supposed to be good.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.360]   Haruki Murakami's 1Q84.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.360]   It's 1984.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.360]   The city is Tokyo.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.360]   It's a dystopian Tokyo.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   It's supposed to be fantastic.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.360]   See, that's 46 hours.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.360]   I wouldn't tackle a book like that if I didn't have Audible.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.360]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:18.360]   Audible.com.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360]   Here's the deal.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.360]   You get two books.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.360]   Two books.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   All you have to do is go to Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.360]   That's the platinum account you'll be signing up for.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   That's the subscription two books a month.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   That's exactly, in my opinion, the right amount.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:32.360]   Because that's about what I go through, two books a month.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:34.360]   But your first month's free, your first two books are free.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.360]   You can cancel it anytime so you never have to pay a penny and the books are yours to keep forever and ever and ever.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:44.360]   They work on the iPod, all the iDevices, but also the Zoom, the Kindle, many GPS devices.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.360]   Of course, your PC and Mac.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.360]   I just love it.

[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:53.360]   And by the way, check out the Audible app on Android and on iPhone.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.360]   It's really a great app.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.360]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.360]   Two books, yours forever.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.360]   And there's a few that you might want to choose.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.360]   Just some really good stuff out there.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.360]   Alright.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.360]   I get that Steve Jobs book right away.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.360]   It's worth reading.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.360]   I was surprised because I thought it's authorized.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   It might be kind of a hagiography.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   But...
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   I like to use big words in John because he just makes a line.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   Where's my pen?
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.360]   That's the word of the day.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.360]   That's the word of the day.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.360]   I hate geography.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.360]   I found it actually anodyne.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.360]   It was, yes, it was refreshing.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.360]   It's the day of an anodyne.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.360]   It was like a stiptic pencil in the eye.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.360]   It really, there's some very, you know, in fact, in the after reading,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.360]   listen, I'm sorry, I know you don't like me to say reading, even though I am.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.360]   After listening to the book, I found myself a little saddened.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.360]   Oh.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.360]   I felt like this was an unhappy man.
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360]   Who?
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   Mr. Jobs.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   Oh, yeah, probably.
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360]   Yeah, miserable.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360]   You seem miserable.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:57.360]   Aren't we all?
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   Yeah, aren't we all?
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   It's true.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360]   I'm unhappy.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.360]   So, are you unhappy, Julie?
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.360]   I do my best.
