[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.280]   a show that talks about the week's tech news.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.760]   Thanks first to Mike Elgin for filling in for me last week.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.440]   No, I was here last week.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.480]   (laughing)
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   I just don't remember it.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   Mike did not fill in for me.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.720]   I was actually here.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.360]   You mean I've been to London and back since the last show?
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.560]   Is that what happened?
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.760]   Unbelievable.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.040]   Joining us now, Christina Warren from Mashable
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.920]   good to have you, Christina.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   Glad to be here.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.720]   From her evil lair in New York, New York.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.760]   It is evil and it is the lair.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.920]   Yes.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.000]   And from his evil lair in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.320]   Mr. Ed Bot of ZBLEF fame, hi Ed.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.360]   Hi Christina.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.000]   Did you come up Ed for the briefing,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.800]   the Microsoft briefing this week?
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.120]   I did.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.960]   The one hour briefing.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.160]   Flew up one afternoon and flew back the next afternoon.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.360]   Paul Therat just spent the whole day bitching
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.440]   about the fact that he had to fly out for a one hour briefing.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.480]   Was it worth it?
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   Yes.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   It's a big story, right?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   It's a huge story.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480]   It was a big story.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   It was bigger than I think any of us thought it was going to be.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.480]   Well tell me about that.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   What did you expect and what was it that you didn't expect?
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   I think I expected Windows 8 update too.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.480]   And there's clearly more to it than that.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   And you know the choice of the name,
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.480]   Windows 10 was startling to say the least.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.480]   And they clearly have some ideas more than,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   this is more than just transplanting a start menu onto Windows 8.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   There's some interesting stuff happening there.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   So yeah, because I mean,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   I think a lot of us before the event thought that Windows,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   well, threshold, which is the code name at the time,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.480]   would be to Windows 8 what Windows 7 was to vest a polishing of the edges,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.480]   fixing of some of the cosmetic stuff.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.480]   Is there stuff under the hood that's significantly different?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.480]   Well, we haven't seen it yet if it is.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   Well, you're using it right now, aren't you?
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.480]   Yes, but this is a technical preview.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   And in historical terms, this one is missing.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.480]   This reminds me a lot of Windows 8 when it first appeared
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.480]   and didn't have, you know, there were several key features
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.480]   that appeared in it later that didn't exist in Windows 8,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   including I think some key aspects of the start screen
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   and Metro apps and so forth weren't there.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.480]   So I think we're going to see another build of this probably in January
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.480]   that'll have a lot more stuff in it,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.480]   including some of the stuff that was bizarre to me about this week's event,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   what they positioned it as an enterprise preview.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   Right.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   And yet most of the discussion is about the things that are fairly superficial
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   on the desktop and the new features that are going to be in the enterprise edition
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   aren't going to appear until later.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   So we're only seeing the beginnings of this.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.480]   One thing that surprised me was they said that the release of this is a year out.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   Not a year.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   Middle of next year.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   Middle of next year.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   Okay.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.480]   Yes, that's probably nine months, which means three months from now
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.480]   for consumer ready beta, three months after that for a release candidate,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.480]   three months after that for a release to manufacturing
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   or release to the web, whatever they want to call it these days.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.480]   So I think you're probably six months away from having a feature complete product
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   and nine months away from having a commercially finished product.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   So this is really pretty early in the cycle for.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   Still, yeah, it's early in a compressed and fast moving cycle also.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.480]   Yeah, there seems to be some hustle to get a replacement for Windows 8 out as quickly
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.480]   as possible.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   Well, next year will be three years.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.480]   Which is right.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   Right.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   That's the normal timeframe.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.480]   It's the normal timeframe.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.480]   So it's not really a hustle.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.480]   They've just been.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480]   Just feels like a hustle.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   It's like we just got Windows 8.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.480]   Well, it'll be three years except it'll be six years from Windows 7 and they're still
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   trying to, you know, they had good enterprise upgrade uptick on that,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   but they didn't really have that on Windows 8, which they said a number of times
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   during the event.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.480]   So I mean, I think that's to me, the big takeaway was that it's an enterprise
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   focus, right?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   But it's enterprise focus in the sense that they want to talk to the stakeholders
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   and the people making purchasing decisions now before they set their
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   budgets for next year so that they can go ahead and budget to upgrade to, you know,
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   Windows 10 and not lose another, you know, upgrade cycle for these businesses to, or even
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   worse, you know, lose them going to, you know, Chromebooks or God forbid Macs or, or, you
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   know, virtual machines or something like that.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   They want to keep them in the Windows ecosystem and it's important for them to talk to them
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.480]   as early as possible because Windows 8 was such a huge failure on the enterprise front.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.480]   Well, and that's the first thing that leaps to mind for me is our desktop
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.480]   operating, our desktop operating systems, important going forward, they seem like they're less
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.480]   and less important and who knows by next year how important they'll be.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:26.480]   Ed, do you feel like, clearly Microsoft made its bones with Windows and to a less
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   to be office but it also seems like the future is operating system independent, it's cloud
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.480]   and it seems like Nadella is very aware of that.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   He's very cross-platform.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   How important is Windows 10 to Microsoft going forward, I guess is the question.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   You know, it's a key part of their DNA.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   Still their flagship.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   They can't afford to screw it up and they have basically good architectural underpinnings
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   for it in Windows 8.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   They just have a bunch of deployment blockers that they need to remove there.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   The desktop PC market space isn't getting smaller.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.480]   It's the number of screens that we have on which we can interact with our world is getting
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:23.480]   so much bigger that as a proportion desktop PCs are less important because there's so many
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480]   other ways that we interact with things.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   That's a great point.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   There aren't fewer PCs out there.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.480]   We just have many other ways of computing.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   Right, and so that's with things like Office 365, for example, which will be released on
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.480]   Android I think this year.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.480]   It already exists on iOS devices.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:51.480]   It exists on Windows devices and so you can, with a phone, a tablet, a tablet or a PC,
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   you can do work.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.480]   And you'll be working likely on the same document in the cloud on each platform.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480]   Exactly.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   It might be in a private cloud on an Office 365 enterprise server that's managed by an
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   enterprise or it might be in a publicly available free cloud like OneDrive, which is more of
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   a consumer service.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.480]   But in either case, you're going to be interacting with that on whatever screen you want running
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   whatever OS you want.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   I think Microsoft has pretty much realized that it needs to make sure that that experience
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:42.480]   is good, solid, capable, productive regardless of what the operating system is and what the
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.480]   screen size is.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:52.480]   And I would guess that security is another, you already mentioned the blockers from the
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   point of view of the enterprise, which are mostly user interface issues, right?
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   Things like the start menu.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480]   Right.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:05.480]   And you know, most of the coverage is okay, they got a start menu with tiles.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   So it's a little bit of both, but it's still a start menu.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.480]   They've got a menued Metro apps now no longer full screen.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   I went windowed, I shouldn't say not menued.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   They're no longer.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   They can be full screen.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480]   There's the option for full screen.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.480]   That's just how it should be.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.480]   Sometimes it's appropriate for full screen, especially in a tablet environment, sometimes
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.480]   not.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.480]   Give me the choice.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.480]   So, you know, to sort of close the loop on a question, a really good question that you
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.880]   asked just a couple of minutes ago, I think the real challenge for Microsoft next year is
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.480]   going to be to establish that it can deliver mobile devices.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   What the hell was that?
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   If you're watching at home, Chad just decided that we would, did we get it?
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.480]   Oh, we got three points.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   That's good.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   Okay.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   No, that wasn't there.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.480]   I just thought I had said something right.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.480]   That's only for you watching home for the audio listeners.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   Nothing to see here.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   Sorry about that.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   So, but it is an issue is desktop operating systems are not clearly as important to Microsoft.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   They can't abandon Windows.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.480]   But they also have to acknowledge the fact that the world has changed quite a bit since,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   you know, 1995.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.480]   Right.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.120]   So you have these tablets and you have these two and one devices, which Intel and Microsoft
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.120]   and a lot of the OEMs, Lenovo in particular have been very successful with getting these
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   two and one devices.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   Have they been successful?
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.120]   The convertibles, they've been successful?
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.120]   They have been.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.240]   I think the latest numbers that I saw said in the retail channel, something like, I should
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   probably look it up.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.840]   But I think it was about one in four PC sold in 2014 are going to be convertibles.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.840]   Interesting.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   So, yeah.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.560]   And what is that really reflects just people are confused and they don't want to, you know,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.560]   I don't know.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.560]   Do I want to tablet it?
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.480]   Do I want to, I don't, let me get one that does everything.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.560]   Or is there really that's what I want?
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.960]   I, you know, there's an awful lot of choices out there and a lot of people make their choices
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.360]   on the basis of whatever random factor, including price, including availability.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.640]   Including what you would add they saw last.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.360]   What add they saw in the Sunday paper?
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.160]   You know, if they still read Sunday papers.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.480]   But I, you know, I think there really is a genuine business case there for people who
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:35.480]   are using a computing device for work and for personal.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.680]   That dual use kind of thing.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   It's a hybrid.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   So, yeah.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.160]   So, you know, so you can take that thing and you pull the keyboard off of it and you're
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.000]   sitting on the couch and interacting with Twitter as an 18 in a baseball game is going
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   on.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Holy cow.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Yes.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You know, and so you can do that.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.640]   Or, you know, you reattach the keyboard and you're sitting in a hotel room trying to get
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.440]   a PowerPoint presentation done at 2 AM.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.680]   It is a little bit of acknowledgement though that Windows is most important to the enterprise.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   Right?
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   That's where they really focused.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:15.720]   I don't think there's ever been any lack of acknowledgement of that.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.040]   I think Windows 8 was a big misstep with that though.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.240]   I would actually disagree with you there.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.400]   And I think that Windows 8 was them thinking that they could dictate how the enterprise
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.840]   would move forward.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.520]   And I think, you know, Sonofsky who was so gung-ho about the ideas of Windows 8 and on paper,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.880]   you know, I think they looked really great.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.400]   And then we all saw and we all seen the feedback in the early previews.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.960]   And, you know, it was funny.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.120]   I remember when we were preparing our coverage for Windows 8 and I was really, really kind
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.600]   of like, I don't know guys.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.320]   I think this is going to be a bigger bust than we're thinking.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.920]   And some of the people I was working with like, no, no, no, this is going to be huge.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.120]   And I was like, no, we need to start prepping how to get the start menu back.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.240]   Like articles like we need to start.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.240]   We need to start on this.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.240]   I know that this is going to start happening.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.440]   The mashable is very consumer focused, right?
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.440]   We are.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.600]   But what I'm saying though is that we also, I think that there's actually a lot that goes
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.800]   in hand with the consumers who don't like change and the enterprises that don't like
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   change.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.760]   I think there's actually a whole lot of crossover there.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.000]   And the focus was so much consumer side on Microsoft's part.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.560]   And when that didn't work and they were kind of trying to push that into the enterprise
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.640]   part, which, you know, didn't want to be, you know, encumbered by some of the start screen
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:28.040]   stuff and some of the, you know, artists formerly designed, formerly referred to as Metro, you
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.960]   know, the modern design stuff, that that was a real step back.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:37.280]   And that puts, you know, kind of a lot of the good will that they built up after Vista
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.200]   with seven on the back burner for a lot of places because I talked to a lot of businesses
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.800]   who were really buying tons of iPads and were happy to start building iPad centric, you know,
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.720]   software for their salespeople, but were not at all impressed with Windows 8 because they
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.040]   saw it as kind of a clutch and it was confusing to their users.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.120]   And the IT people just didn't want to be bothered because it was confusing to the users.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.640]   They didn't want to bother with it.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.600]   It's got to be a little frustrating because there's no perfect solution.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.080]   iPad's not a perfect solution.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   No, it's not.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.080]   No.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.440]   And in itself, maybe they weren't happy with Windows 8.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.880]   If you look at the stats, you know, Windows 7 is about half of the installed base.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.040]   XP is 25%.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.800]   Windows 8 is 12%.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   Right.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.480]   And I mean, I think that honestly, I mean, I look at Windows 10 as on an honest acknowledgement
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.680]   that their whole there can be one operating system for everything strategy.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.520]   Well, that's the other thing that I find fascinating.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.360]   There's one product, one platform, one store thing.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.920]   And what the hell is that all about?
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   I'm going to call BS on it until we see it because we've been hearing this since the
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.800]   Java days and it never works.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.360]   Not just to tell it said this and it was a kind of a shock and then Microsoft backtrack,
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.320]   but maybe he did mean one Windows.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.320]   Right.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   And what do you think?
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.400]   I mean, what do you think about that?
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.160]   What about the whole one Windows thing?
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:05.160]   Well, that's generally when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, he held it up and said, and it
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   runs iOS.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   I mean, it runs.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   It's 10.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   It runs.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160]   It's 10, which it didn't.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.160]   And well, which it didn't.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.440]   But in a way, he was saying one OS.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.360]   You know how to use it.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   Sure.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.800]   So the kernel is the same and a lot of the directions of application development and
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:36.200]   user experience on Apple's desktop and Apple's touch oriented devices are converging on
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   the same place.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.040]   So they started with two different operating systems built on the same kernel with similar
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:49.080]   user experience guidelines that converge somewhere into the future.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.840]   That's what people really want.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.360]   And Microsoft is doing the same thing, but they've taken a different path to it.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.200]   And I think, you know, Christina, you're right about the tactical errors.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.600]   There were profound tactical errors in the launch of Windows 8.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.920]   But strategically, Microsoft needed to accomplish two things.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:17.520]   It needed to get its enterprise customers off of XP and onto a modern operating system.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.320]   And I think they knew that that was going to be Windows 7.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.360]   That's the long term support version.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.080]   And so they succeeded in doing that.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:33.120]   And they thought that they could build this consumer focused thing and then converge them
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.480]   in the future.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.360]   And you know, I think just as you did, I looked at it when it came out and I said, this is
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.600]   going to be jarring and uncomfortable for people.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.920]   And there's going to be a lot of people who are going to reject it.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.320]   And it played out exactly as we thought it was going to play out.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.560]   So what about the convergence?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   What about the Windows 10?
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.800]   Now it's time to bring the paths together.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.280]   Is this what we, is this it?
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.120]   Is this going to be it?
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.960]   I think there's a bit of marketing in the convergence part.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   One thing that you get is the opportunity for developers to build universal apps and
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:18.680]   to sell them so that they can be licensed and used on multiple screen sizes and multiple
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.280]   OS's across multiple locations.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:28.520]   That's probably the biggest advantage of the one Windows thing is, you know, if I'm selling
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:34.640]   an app, communications app or a social media app or something like that, I don't want people
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:40.880]   to have to go and pay for it all over again every time they go to a different location.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.520]   I want them to be able to pay once and use it anywhere.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.720]   Microsoft's not in the way with that, with Office, right?
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.280]   That's kind of how Office works.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.280]   Right.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.040]   Well, I mean, that's a subscription, you know, kind of offering to and that works really.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.280]   Well, I guess to play Devil's Advocate, I would say I think that the idea behind one
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.400]   Windows and one, you know, core kernel, one core kind of set of libraries that can be
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.160]   shared across things, core set of, you know, user interface things that can be shared across
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.720]   data that can be shared across.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   That's great.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.840]   Except we haven't seen anybody embrace, you know, modern apps on any sizable level, any
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.640]   big companies bring out modern apps, at least you charge for on any large level at all.
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.960]   I mean, Microsoft doesn't even have the modern version of Office out.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   And so I'm genuinely like curious, you know, I don't want to be a hater, but I'm genuinely
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   curious.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.640]   Like, at what point do we just say, this is a really great theory, but is anybody actually
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.920]   going to change how they're developing software, are they going to build the apps that will
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920]   run on the phone?
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.560]   Are they going to build phone apps that can also run on the desktop?
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.600]   Are they going to build the game stuff that can go everywhere?
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.000]   Or are they going to continue to do what they've been doing, which is to have siloed out stuff
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.320]   where you're building your application for Windows for the traditional desktop, as you
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   always have.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.120]   Maybe you're doing some sort of, you know, web interfaces and maybe some APIs so that
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.080]   your libraries can talk to one another, but they're not building something for this store
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080]   environment.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.640]   And that's what I'm not convinced about.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.920]   And that's, I guess, why I hear this one Windows stuff and I go, yeah, but we've been hearing
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.480]   this for years and no one's actually bothered to build anything for it.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.440]   Yeah, but maybe the time wasn't right.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.920]   Maybe maybe now this is the step they need to take.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.040]   We're going to take a break and come back.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.520]   I want to ask also, Ed, why Windows 10 instead of Windows 9?
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.520]   That's going to.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.680]   And maybe that was just that was I'm sure there's good reasons, but seems like that got
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.360]   all the attention instead of all these other things that really probably Microsoft would
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.520]   rather be talking about than the numbering of the product.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.520]   We got it.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   I can get this camera working.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.240]   All right, we have a little technical difficulty with that.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.440]   We're going to get him back online.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.360]   He's using Windows 10.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.880]   So that's a brave thing to do.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.480]   You sure you want to do in that, Ed?
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.120]   It's easy enough to switch.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.560]   We're going to give you a moment to decide.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.440]   Also Christina Warren from Mashable.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   We're talking tech.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.720]   We'll talk more about Microsoft.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.400]   It is the third anniversary today of the passing of Steve Jobs.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.000]   We'll talk a little bit about that and a lot more.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.680]   Maybe now that the dust has settled iPhone 6 stuff too.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.160]   Our show today brought to you by a great place.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.600]   If you are looking to fill that position perfectly, ziprecruiter.com.

[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.680]   And each one has different audience, different kind of people that you might be talking to.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:34.360]   Posting on 50 different job boards is a lot of trouble unless you use ziprecruiter.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:41.680]   Ziprecruiter lets you post once and get your listing on 50+ job boards plus Twitter and

[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.880]   That's important too by the way.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.720]   You're going to get submissions and ziprecruiter makes it a lot easier to sort through them and
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.520]   find the right person.

[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.960]   of this week in Tech Ed bot.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.640]   Is he back yet?
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   Should I've taken longer to do the ad?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.200]   We're still working on getting it.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.680]   Why were you thinking?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.440]   You know, Paul Therat does this to me too.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.800]   Oh, I got the new Surface Pro.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.560]   Let's see how this works.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.400]   You guys, I guess you have to dog food your stuff.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400]   You got it.
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.720]   If you're going to talk about it, you have to use it.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.760]   I love Tim Moynihan's article on Wired Magazine.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:26.560]   He says, "Ambicious Windows 10 is an attack designed as a retreat."
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.240]   He like many feels observed that I certainly felt like, "Oh, it's Microsoft's giving up
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.280]   on this whole new UI, but it isn't really."
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:42.160]   I think, "Well, it's an interesting, is it a pivot?
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.480]   Is it a retreat?
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.640]   I don't know if it's an attack."
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:52.200]   He says, "Windows at its best is most boring, is its most boring as a blank napkin for productivity."
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.200]   Well, maybe.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.120]   Why Ed, are you there?
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.280]   Yeah, we got them now.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:59.280]   Now we don't have as audio.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.280]   Yeah, we hear you.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   Good.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   Okay.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   Why 10?
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   I saw one speculation that at first I--
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.680]   Yeah, I saw that with you.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.080]   I first I thought, "No."
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.760]   And then I thought, "Yeah, then now I think you know again," which is that programmers
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:20.080]   in the days of Windows 95 and 98 and XP would do a check on Windows 9 star to see if it
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.920]   was 95 or 98 to check for compatibility.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.520]   And Microsoft might be afraid that a lot of that code, which is probably the case, is
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:33.200]   still out there and it wouldn't work with Windows 9.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   Is that credible at all?
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   No.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.680]   It's vaguely, barely credible.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.720]   Well, it plays in the fact that we know Microsoft pays a lot of attention to legacy.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.520]   But I think it's more a matter of numerology.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:58.680]   In all seriousness, if it's Windows 9, it's just another version.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.800]   And everyone's going to say, "No, let's just see, let's wait for Windows 10."
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:11.400]   This one, they really and truly did say, or the meta message they were sending was,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   "This is the last one.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:19.840]   This is the, you know, everything that will be beyond this is an incremental update to
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   it and there'll be..."
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.000]   That's interesting.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.640]   And, you know, there won't be a Windows 11 or if they're, you know, just as OS 10 was introduced
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   in what, 2001?
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   Right.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   Right around...
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   Yep.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   OS 10.10, which is very confusing.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.680]   They don't like to say that.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.840]   They even say to me, they're like, "We're just calling it OS 10 Yosemite."
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.800]   I'm like, "OS 10.10 Yosemite."
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.640]   They're like, "Christia, stop."
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   Yeah, too many 10s.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   Too many 10s.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.680]   OS 10, 10.10 is actually what the full name would be.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.760]   That is what the full name is, 10.10.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.520]   And I can't wait for 10.10.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.960]   I mean, just, yeah, it's getting ridiculous.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.240]   My friend John Marshall, who's icon master on Twitter, he said, "But I think it's the
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.640]   funniest thing that's also probably true."
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.840]   He said that the reason they called it OS, Windows 10 is because 9 is too close to 8.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.440]   And they want to get as far away from 8 as possible in people's mind.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   Right.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440]   I like somebody else said it's because 7.89.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.880]   That was actually, it was actually the official joke at the event.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   Oh, I like it.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.960]   You know, dead humor.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.200]   It's dead humor.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.400]   It's high school Yuba, Koomir, or dead humor.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.000]   It, it, but really, come on, this is a big, this is a grown up company.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.200]   But do they really think 10 is fooling anybody?
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   It's the next version.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.400]   But I think, I think that's right though.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.920]   I mean, numerology is a real thing.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.320]   I mean, I think when you go, I mean, blackberry kind of, I mean, okay, they failed, but they
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   tried to do the same thing with going from, you know, blackberry 7 to blackberry 10.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.920]   And now I think they're going from bez 10 to bez 12.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:54.360]   There is something about going into like a big firm two digit version number that signifies
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.760]   this is for real and this is a really big deal.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.000]   But nobody thinks that Microsoft had been working on 10 or 9 and decided, oh, we'll make
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.920]   it one better.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.720]   Nobody knows it's the next version.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.440]   But, okay, but to be fair, I mean, have they ever been great at branding?
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:16.840]   I mean, we went from like 3.11 to Windows 95 to 98 to Millennium Edition to 2000 to XP
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.280]   to Vista to seven to eight.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.520]   I mean, you know, plus there's been like in T 4.0 4.5.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   There's been all this stuff in the middle.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.200]   Isn't the, somebody, somebody told me the internal numbering is it's 6.2.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   Is that right?
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   6.4.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.160]   Yeah, no, this 12.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.400]   No, Windows Vista was 6.0.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   Okay.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.200]   Windows 7 was 6.1.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   Windows 8.6.2.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.600]   Yeah, Windows 8.1.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.240]   I think it was 6.3.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:50.080]   And is it, is it a no, is it because it's an odometer number?
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.440]   It's like 10.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.840]   I might call it Windows 1000.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.960]   No, when it was 10,000.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   What?
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.120]   It's a brand.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.120]   It's a brand.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   It's not a number.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.120]   It's a brand.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   A version of number.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.880]   That's by the way, already used by Apple.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880]   They have no pride.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   Exactly.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   They have no pride.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.680]   Well, they were, look, they're on a yearly release schedule.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:19.160]   If they did Windows 9 this year, they would do Windows 10 next year, you know, one year
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   later.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   That's.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.680]   Are they on a, what do you mean they're on a yearly release schedule?
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.920]   You said it's three years since Windows 8.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   They did eight.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   They did 8.1.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   One update.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.920]   And 8.1 update.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.440]   I mean, so they're already, these, these really should have been, you know, from a consumer
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.240]   point of view, these are big somewhat momentous releases.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   Right.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.960]   And the branding is just bizarre.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.760]   It's just from my point of view, it's just one more version of Windows I won't buy.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.320]   But anyway, but that's, that's just me.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   I'm a bigot.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   And I did it.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.080]   But if you, so if you go back and look at all of their commercial messaging, it's all
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.360]   based on the latest version of Windows.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.360]   Yes.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   The latest version of office.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.400]   It's the best version of Windows we've ever made.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.800]   Might as well steal that from Apple.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.200]   That's not what I'm talking about.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:14.440]   They're trying, they're not, they're trying very, uh, deliberately not to use a number
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   version name.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.120]   It's just Windows with anything.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.120]   That's the new thing.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.320]   By the way, that's, if they want to be hip, the nuke, all the new, all the kids today,
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.080]   no version number at all.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.120]   This is the iPad.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:31.880]   And most people see, uh, see, we live in a tech bubble.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   Yes.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.480]   We, we know things about version numbers and branding stuff.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.160]   Most people just go, they buy a PC and they use it for four years.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.800]   They buy an iPhone, they use it for two years.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.920]   They buy their latest Android device.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.000]   They use it for a while.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Updates show up.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   They accept them.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   They don't accept them.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.240]   If something goes wrong with the update, they call their most technically sophisticated
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.520]   friend or they go online and try and figure out what went wrong with it.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.560]   I don't know what, but then, but the number I just definitely just,
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.600]   No, I know that on the radio show, I'll ask people what version of Windows you're using.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   I don't know.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   Same, same with my dad.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   You have to look.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   Mm hmm.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   So, okay.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.720]   So there's nothing to be said about 10.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   It's just the number.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.200]   It's just the next version.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.520]   But, and maybe this was intentional, maybe unintentional.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:24.240]   Seems like much of the press attention has been on the number.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.240]   Is that?
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.840]   I mean, really, that's not, I mean, is that what they wanted?
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   Oh, good.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.320]   Let's everybody focus on the number.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.120]   Well, I mean, I think that they very clearly, by going with a different number, I think
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.480]   to as pointed, it's very clearly going for a different brand and they're making a big
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.880]   statement whether they want to acknowledge that maybe it's because Windows 8 didn't
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   work.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.440]   Maybe it's just because they're going in a different direction or what it is.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.200]   I mean, but it's very clearly making kind of a different definition.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.640]   I mean, they even joked about saying, oh, we could have called it Windows 1, you know,
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.360]   kind of like Xbox one and whatnot.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   But, oh, we've already done that.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   I just thought they might do that, actually.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   I did too, actually.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.080]   And I think that that would have won Windows.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   I mean, that's been kind of--
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.080]   Yeah, Windows 1, Windows 8.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.040]   That's kind of their long-standing philosophy.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.240]   But I think that, yeah, I mean, there's been a lot of discussion around the name.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:17.000]   But I think there's also been kind of a discussion about the fact that this is in a greater sense,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.680]   a return to what they're really good at, which is kind of what Satya Nadella has been
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.560]   really saying his whole time as CEO is really kind of trying to get back to their roots
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.000]   and get back to what Microsoft knows it's good at and really pushing that forward rather
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.240]   than maybe trying to be everything to everyone, which I think is a good thing because Microsoft
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.880]   is really, really good at being Microsoft.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.800]   But where they falter sometimes, I think, is when they try to branch into areas where
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.680]   maybe they're not as adept.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.960]   And that's where we all kind of suffer.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.360]   But I mean, to the same, I mean, I think you'd be hard for us to say that there's a better
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.360]   office suite out there than Office 365.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.800]   And I think that for a lot of people who are managing thousands of computers, you'd be
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:01.320]   hard for us to say there's a better client workstation system than Windows 7 or presumably
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.960]   Windows 10.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.840]   And so they do a lot of things really well, but it's just when they kind of try to get
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.200]   out of that bubble and go into other areas where they falter some.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.040]   What is Microsoft really good at?
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.720]   What is the positioning that Microsoft would like to tell the world?
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.280]   What is it?
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.440]   Ed, what do you think?
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:30.760]   If you were if you were sitting in the corner office, whoa, whoa, something wrong?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.120]   I just promoted you as CEO of Microsoft.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120]   Okay.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   Did you hear it?
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.080]   Did you get a big hit of noise or something?
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.880]   Right back.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   Uh oh.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.880]   Okay.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   All right.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.080]   We're going to take a little moment.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   Windows 10.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.240]   Love it.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.560]   This is, but this is, this is the same thing with Paul Theron.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.120]   These guys have to use the latest stuff.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.720]   I don't know why he has to use it on us.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.240]   What are you using, Christina?
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.640]   Yes, somebody, but it's, but it's, but it's in, but it's in GM now.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.520]   So I just got, I just got it when I was gone.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:13.440]   My Mac rebooted and I got, uh, uh, I guess so the goal master means we've got this is
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.440]   it.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440]   This is what this is going to come out.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.280]   I'm thinking there'll be one more update, but this is like the, the gold master will,
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   you know, candidate.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.480]   You know how I know this is real because they changed the about OS 10 box.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.520]   Finally, they did.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.520]   They did.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.920]   Um, and I mean, it feels pretty stable.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.000]   I've been, I've been using it.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.920]   I, um, Apple gave me a review machine to use, uh, through the beta process, but at this
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.440]   point I've now actually got it running on everything.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.680]   Um, now that the GM is out.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.960]   So I have to say the last version, I'm using it on my Mac Pro.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.360]   The last version really felt sluggish.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.760]   I have a very high res, you know, that 4K display.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   It felt really sluggish and something they fixed it, whatever it was.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.200]   I don't, whether it was debugging code in there or they really were having performance
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.760]   issues or they hadn't tuned it yet.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.480]   But boy, this feels good.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   This feels like it's ready.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   It really does.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.480]   It really does.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.000]   There were a couple of the betas that especially the forecast that didn't feel quite as good,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.400]   but now I mean, it feels solid and, um, yeah, I mean, they've done a good job with it.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   I've enjoyed using it.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.960]   It was a, I kind of held that for Microsoft because Apple decided to release the GM.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.960]   Same day.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.000]   No, during the presentation.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.840]   During as soon as the presentation started, they released the GM and I was like, really
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.600]   guys, really, do you think that's an accident or do you think these guys are sta-
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.800]   Are you all doing this?
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.240]   Google, Facebook, Microsoft, they're like, mmm, mmm, mmm.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   Grow up.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.960]   Why doesn't an accident come on?
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.360]   No, it's not an accident.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   I kind of agree because it didn't make it hard for us because we're trying to cover
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   both things at once.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   I'm like, I don't have time.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:48.240]   You know, um, October 16th, according to recode and John Pachikowski is pretty good on this
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   stuff will be.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   And you know what?
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.640]   We know, we already know because Jim Daller in both the loops said it's not October 21st.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.280]   Uh, October 16th will be the day that Microsoft at the Apple ships Yosemite, right?
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.080]   Yeah, that's what it seems like.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.640]   It seems like that might also be the day they have an iPad event.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.640]   iPad event.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.120]   With the gold iPad with the touch ID and faster processor and maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.080]   knock on wood, a new Apple TV.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   We'll see.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:18.200]   It's, that's how, that's how bad it's gotten at Apple that the new iPad, it's gold.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   Basically.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.640]   Oh, it's going to touch ID touch ID.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.640]   That's a significant.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   That's going to be awesome.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   But let's also be honest.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.320]   I mean, the iPad AR to me is the best tablet ever owned.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.320]   It's fantastic.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   I don't, I don't, I don't.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.120]   Why can't we in this industry just say something's done?
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   It's not, that's it.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   It's got everything.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   We're not going to make it better.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.120]   It's done.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.040]   I mean, I feel like honestly, do you feel like from a design perspective, you can obviously
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.480]   you can update the specs, you can make the guts better, but I feel like it's the same
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.920]   way once they got to the current MacBook Air design, which I guess they did, I think
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.920]   in 2010, 2011.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.760]   And it's, and it's basically, it's perfect.
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.360]   There, you, you get a certain point with the design that you can't make it any better.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.160]   I feel like the iPad Air is that point for this iPad.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.600]   I kind of don't know how you can make that any better from a design perspective.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.000]   I feel like it's done.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.160]   You can update the guts.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.760]   You can add touch ID, but the design itself, it's perfection.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.200]   So now we got to add buyback.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.000]   We thought we'd just talk about Apple.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.880]   So that was in belief.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.880]   Oh, no.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   Now it's something else.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.880]   Now it's his audio.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.880]   We don't hear yet.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.880]   Okay.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   I heard that.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.320]   No, this is not Windows 10.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.720]   This is actually, it's the, there's a short in the microphone.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.960]   Oh, all right.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:34.960]   Okay.
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.160]   Those are by the way, I just want to point out Apple earbuds, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.760]   And so these are Marley.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.920]   Oh, they look just like Apple.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.920]   Marley.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:44.920]   They ever heard of Marley.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.520]   Is that a good thing?
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.440]   Somebody should know about Marley?
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   Bob Marley.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.400]   Is it Bob Marley?
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.640]   It's the Marley estate.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.640]   Yes.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.840]   That did all these things.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.160]   You know that Dr. Dre making lots of money on the headphones, man.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.600]   I got to do that.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.600]   It's a little cork.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.480]   Oh, I put cork on it.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   I make it.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480]   No, they're actually really nice.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.520]   They, the stuff they do with them, they just made with Motorola.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.520]   Didn't they Ed?
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   I think they.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.040]   It's such a high margin business.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.600]   I should make it freakin' Twitter headphones.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   You should, Leo.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   You're not even joking.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   I mean, I know.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   No, I should.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.000]   I remember when I worked in retail, the, we would automatically get a 50% discount on
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   anything Bose.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.360]   But I remember the markup on certain audio equipment sometimes was up to 90% for certain
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   brands.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   90% markup.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.440]   That was the employee price, which means that there was already, there was even greater
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.440]   markup than that.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:47.360]   So I mean, for home audio, for car audio, for, you know, personal audio, the markup is insane.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.520]   Which I mean, I think that's why it was, to me, I thought about the more it made sense
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.760]   for Apple to buy Beats because that thing is a cash cow, which just has no size of stopping
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.760]   it as a margin.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.200]   Yeah, except that some analysts said that the margin on Beats had disappeared once they
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.480]   stopped having Monster make them and started trying to make their own headphones.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.680]   Well, and that might have been true, maybe the huge margin, but I guarantee you that with
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:17.000]   Apple supply chain contacts that that, that any advantage that Monster had, Apple has,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   you know, 10 times, like, guaranteed.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   Windows 10.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.920]   Just one more thing.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:32.120]   You say in your review, and by the way, it has a really good review on his ZDNet blog.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.040]   You say that this is design primarily make life easier for mouse and keyboard aficionados.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.960]   It's the return of the desktop, basically.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   Yes.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:46.160]   And so what's interesting is that, like I said, there's going to be multiple milestones
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.320]   along the way.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:54.560]   And this is the one where if you take Windows 10 and install it on a touch capable device
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.400]   that you've learned to use with Windows 8.1, you're going to go, "Ack, what happened?"
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   Right.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   They took my touch out.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   They did.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.080]   No more charms.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.440]   It's so, the charms are still there on that screen.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.080]   They're just, that all works as expected.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.520]   There's no metro version of Internet Explorer.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.560]   There's no touch friendly version of Internet Explorer.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.000]   There's just one browser in this.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.280]   That's a really, because that was crazy having two different browsers with two different
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.280]   ways.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   It was.
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.480]   But here's my problem with that is that they lived in two different worlds.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.360]   So if you had a website open in the touch version and then you went to the desktop version,
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:35.800]   the website wasn't open there.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.880]   So your tabs didn't, the states were completely separate.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.200]   That is what drove me nuts.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.680]   That to me was like, what was unconscionable?
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.720]   Like, if you want to have two different interfaces, fine, but at least hell up my websites live
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:50.040]   in both places, having them be completely separate, to me, I was like, "You know what?
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.200]   I can't do this.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.520]   I can't do this, Microsoft.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.520]   Sorry."
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.720]   So the rumor was that they were going to sense what you were on and be appropriate to the
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.720]   device you were on.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.720]   Is that what they're doing?
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.120]   Well, that's not just a rumor.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.360]   That's actually something that they showed off in a mockup.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360]   Remember, I've been in London.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.360]   That was the rumor before they showed it.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.000]   So it's coded, it's not coded into the technical preview, but the idea is, and again, this is
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.720]   intended for those convertible devices, those two-in-one devices.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:23.880]   So that, and they did, if you can, I think I might have linked to it in that article,
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.520]   but maybe I didn't.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:33.400]   But they did a video and they showed how it would work if you take a surface or an HP
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.120]   X2 or HP SEP-D.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:43.600]   One of those convertible devices, a Lenovo Yoga, and you switch it from, you either remove
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:54.000]   the keyboard or switch it into tablet mode, and their goal is for some interface affordance
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.160]   to come up and allow you to say, "Okay, I want to be in tablet mode now," and that
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.440]   would make the touch targets bigger and so on.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:07.200]   And then when you reattach the keyboard, you could say, "No, I want to be back in mouse
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.760]   and keyboard mode now where the touch targets get smaller because you've got a fine precision
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:20.960]   pointer that you can go after them with," and you can take advantage of richer apps.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:27.080]   That's a really fine problem to solve and a really difficult problem to solve.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:34.160]   So it will be enjoyable at the least to watch how this develops.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:41.040]   I mean, it could be a train wreck or it could be a thing of beauty and you just don't know.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:47.440]   Larry Dignan, before the event, gave some strategic goals for Microsoft.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:54.440]   He said that Windows, he's at 9, but 10 needs to be a cloud jump off point, keep Microsoft
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.680]   relevant, be the last of Microsoft's big bang releases, entice the enterprise to remain
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.120]   Windows based and advance Microsoft's mobile ambitions.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.840]   Those do seem like kind of big goals that Microsoft needs to focus on.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.680]   Do you think that this does that job?
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   Acknowledging that Larry's your boss.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.360]   Brilliant, brilliant piece.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.640]   But this does seem exactly right.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.480]   In fact, it's kind of some of the stuff we've already touched on.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.840]   It is.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:32.040]   They need to circle the wagons in a sense for enterprise customers.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:37.640]   There really aren't a lot of options for enterprise customers out there.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:43.200]   So the question isn't to keep them from going elsewhere.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.680]   The question is to keep them happy and in the fold.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:54.080]   So you're going to see, so what you didn't see in terms of the name and the start menu
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.800]   and stuff, you didn't see a lot of the security features that are coming in.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.680]   One thing that was leaked in a blog post from a Microsoft employee, it was pulled about
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.560]   two hours later when somebody came to him and said, "You weren't supposed to publish
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.520]   that stuff," but he published a detailed list of the enterprise features that are going
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   to be in there.
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:19.080]   So there's a lot of multi-factor authentication stuff, for example, that's going to be baked
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:28.640]   into the core authentication of the operating system, not a layer that's added on but baked
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.840]   in there.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:37.800]   The ability to compartmentalize data on a device so that if you bring a personal device into
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:46.840]   work, your management using lightweight device management tools, the same thing that they
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   use to manage iPads and phones, now they can use that to compartmentalize the data on your
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:59.800]   device so that when you leave employment, they can zap the work files.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.160]   You not touch your personal files or apps at all.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.360]   Those are the kind of problems that people are looking to solve in the enterprise today.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.680]   It's funny because those are problems that the mobile platforms have been trying to
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.880]   solve exactly those problems.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   Everything's becoming a mobile platform.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.680]   Really, the screen is just an endpoint.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:27.280]   The idea of whether you get to it on a laptop or on a big tablet or a small tablet or a
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:37.880]   smartphone, you should be able to get to the backend that has the thing that you need
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:43.160]   to do and control it from whatever endpoint you happen to have, whatever the size of it
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   happens to be.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.960]   That's, I guess, getting back to my original question, which is how important is the desktop
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   anymore.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:55.280]   It's just one kind of avatar of what you're actually doing.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.400]   It's an abstraction to what's really there, which is your data.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.640]   It seems to me that Microsoft has to, and I think it probably knows this and is working
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.880]   very hard to do this, has to really have a strategy that goes across all these different,
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:15.520]   I hate to use a word avatar, but that's kind of what it is, this realization of what is
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.920]   at core, which is your actual work, the data you're doing.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:27.360]   Apple desktop tablet, and it sounds like they want to own all of these instant situations.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:33.400]   They want to be playing in all of those, whether they can own them or not.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:40.680]   I don't think there's sort of a cult of monopoly in Silicon Valley where you're only successful
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.720]   if you have at least 90% market share.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:50.760]   So that, oh my God, Apple only has 31% share selling $700 devices each with a profit margin
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.440]   of 30%.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   In a market of a billion devices, you don't need a monopoly to be a significant player.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.000]   Microsoft understand that coming from this being this monopoly company for two days.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.600]   I think they understand it extremely well.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.160]   I mean, I think they understand how lucky they were to get the desktop monopoly and they
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:24.680]   understand how difficult it is to get a meaningful share, a meaningful market in mobile devices.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.040]   So plays well with others is going to be a big part of that overall strategy.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.680]   Well, that's a part of their overall strategy.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.120]   It certainly isn't Google's strategy.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.680]   It's not Apple's strategy.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:45.800]   Apple plays well with anyone who plays well with us and Google's strategy plays well with
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   us.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.640]   And you're playing well with your data.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.480]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.800]   Ed bot is here.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.760]   He's now fixed the short circuit underneath his table.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.000]   What are you are using a USB interface?
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.800]   Is that what it is?
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:10.120]   Yeah, it's the yeti microphone headphones plugged into that.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.840]   And it just blew you out.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.760]   Yeah, nice little crackling in the ears there.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:21.400]   Well, it's good you use a normally headphones mom because that insulates you against it.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.880]   It's not Bob, it's Ziggy.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:31.800]   I think it's the Marley estate Ziggy Ziggy's kids getting old.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.080]   Also here from Mashable Christina Warren.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:39.120]   And we're talking about the week's tech news.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.160]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.200]   There's the good news on Squarespace.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.800]   You don't have to worry about Fads.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   What's happening on the web?
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.280]   It's changing so fast.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:56.440]   I just saw that one of our favorite web 2.0 companies got sold.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.800]   And I think somebody wrote an article saying it's the end of web 2.0.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.000]   This stuff moves so fast.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.160]   Adaptive path is now part of it.
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.240]   It's just crazy.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.800]   You don't have to worry about that with Squarespace because they take care of that for you.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:15.240]   It's something we've really experienced in designing our own websites every six months.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.200]   There's a new, oh, now you got no more hamburgers.
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.800]   Can't have a hamburger.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.960]   Can't have you got to have the parallax view.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.320]   You got to have the big images.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.360]   No, no more.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   This is it.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.420]   You don't have to worry anymore.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.160]   Your data is separate from your design.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.960]   Your designs are state of the art.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.320]   Every Squarespace template is written to take advantage of the latest web technologies
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.120]   like responsive design.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.040]   So your site looks good on all sites.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:42.240]   And when that new trend or FAD comes out, you don't have to worry about the Squarespace
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   engineers.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240]   They'll be on it.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.520]   And so will your website.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.760]   Squarespace is the best hosting plus the best software, an all-in-one platform that makes
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.440]   it easy for you to create a website.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.800]   You worry about your content or your business or what you're selling or your portfolio.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.080]   Let them worry about the crazy stuff that's going on in the internet.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.360]   Make your website state of the art.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.640]   Separate content from display.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.240]   Do it right with Squarespace.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.880]   And by the way, if you need some help, they've always had the best support 24/7 from their
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.880]   own offices in New York.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.080]   They've never outsourced it.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:20.520]   There's a completely redesigned customer help site, self-help articles, video workshops,
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:25.360]   webinars, and e-commerce available on all plan levels.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.000]   That means you can sell stuff, but you can also accept donations, which is great for
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   nonprofits.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.560]   You could do a cash wedding registry, a school fund drive.
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.160]   All of this starts at $8 a month.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.120]   That includes a free domain name when you sign up for a year and they'll wire it all
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   up for you.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.480]   Great apps like the metric app for iPhone and iPad that lets you check site stats, unique
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.720]   visitors, social media followers.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.800]   The blog app makes it easy to update and monitor comments.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.480]   The code is gorgeous underneath.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.520]   You are getting state of the art stuff.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.320]   If you're a photographer, you've got to take a look at their portfolio app, which takes
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:02.880]   your photos from the website and puts them on an iPad or iPhone suitable for display
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.880]   to your clients.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.440]   So they've even got workflow built into this.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:12.960]   It's just so cool and always updated with the latest, greatest stuff, always secure squarespace.com.

[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:33.920]   All I ask when you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIT and you'll get 10% off and

[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.160]   Squarespace.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.800]   Yeah, I mean Adaptive Path is an interesting story.
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.640]   Here's a company that really created Web 2.0.
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:59.040]   And Wired says Adaptive Path and the death rattle of the Web 2.0 era.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.040]   Who do they sell to?
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.960]   Capital One, like the credit card company.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.960]   Like what the hell is that?
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   So close.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.280]   And so, I mean, really everybody uses it.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.720]   Merlin, man, everybody we know, they all had Adaptive Path and everybody used them and
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.800]   they would tell you how to make your site usable.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.360]   They would UI design and stuff.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.360]   They say we're not going to take any more customers.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.160]   All of our attention are going to Capital One from now on.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.160]   Wow.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.160]   Wow.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.160]   I'm feeling old.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:31.160]   All right.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:36.760]   Speaking of feeling old, it's been exactly three years to the day that Steve Jobs passed
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   away.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.120]   That was a very sad day here.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.600]   We were interviewing, who were we interviewing?
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.000]   We're doing triangulation.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.840]   Kevin Marks, right?
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   Kevin Marks.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.480]   As Apple had worked for Steve Jobs, when the news came that Steve had passed, we knew everybody
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:51.480]   knew he was very sick.
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.760]   He had already stepped down as CEO of Apple.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.080]   Still a real shock.
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:04.240]   Tim Cook sent out an email to Apple employees on Friday.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.280]   "Team Sunday will mark the third anniversary of Steve's passing.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.880]   I'm sure that many of you will be thinking of him on that day, as I know I will.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.760]   I'm sure I hope you will take a moment to appreciate the many ways Steve made our world
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   better."
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.720]   His vision extended far beyond the years he was alive and the values on which he built
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.960]   Apple will always be with us.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.520]   Enjoy your weekend.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.240]   Enjoy your weekend, especially for those of you who will be working here all weekend long.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.280]   Thanks for helping carry Steve's legacy into the future.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.800]   One of Steve's legacies we learned from Dom Melton's interviews on the debug podcast,
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   Renee Richie's great podcast on I'm War, was that the weekends really weren't weekends
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:45.880]   for Apple employees, especially executives because Monday was the big meeting day and
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.760]   you had to have everything ready for your boss to bring to Steve on Monday.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:55.440]   So Sunday nights were extremely high pressure for Apple employees.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.600]   I wonder if that culture has changed.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.480]   As you remember all those great things about Steve, he was also a tough man to work for,
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   I think.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.200]   But is that different from any other company?
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   Is it or not?
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.120]   And he's successful.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.360]   What do you tell me?
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:16.960]   Not when you get into the executive ranks of a big tech company today.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   You were 24/7.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:23.760]   If you don't do it, you get your lunch eaten.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760]   Right.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.720]   I think the difference here was that it wasn't just the execs, it was all the underlings
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   too.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:33.720]   And I've talked to a lot of people who were on Craig's team and on Scott's team on the
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:38.720]   Mac and the iOS side and who had to do those presentations and their bosses were the ones
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.680]   who were obviously up all night, but then the people below them had to be up all night
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   too.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.720]   And so it kind of became part of the culture where everybody, you know, in Don's interview
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.600]   and the other, you know, people who were former employees were kind of alluding to that was
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.240]   that, you know, you kind of got mad at the people who worked below you if they got a
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.400]   good night sleeping, you didn't.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.400]   So it kind of permeated from the top down.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.040]   And I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.720]   And I don't know if that was really sad when the Sopranos ended because you knew when
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   the Sopranos was on, Scott forced all loved the Sopranos.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:11.000]   You knew you would have one hour so you could go to the bathroom, have a conversation with
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   your family, whatever.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.720]   But after the Sopranos ended, there goes our hour.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.720]   Right.
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.960]   Which, I mean, and I don't know if it's that way at Google or not.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.000]   You know, I mean, you only hear mixed things and the...
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.080]   Probably depends who your boss is there.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.480]   Well, I was going to say, I think that that's one of the big differences is that at Apple,
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.920]   you know, especially if you were, I mean, at Apple, I think what's different about versus
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.720]   how it is at Google is that at Apple, the designers are kind of king and they kind of
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.840]   sit above where the engineers are, whereas at Google, obviously the engineers are king.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.360]   And the hierarchy is much more flat, I think, at Google versus at Apple.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.920]   So, but, you know, I mean, it differs from company to company.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.760]   I think you could make the argument that I don't think that at Yahoo, for instance,
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.880]   I don't think there are a lot of people who would get, you know, feel compelled to be
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.840]   up until four o'clock in the morning, Sunday night.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.880]   And that's not really a criticism, eh, who I just think.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.440]   It's a difference.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.280]   But, you know, yeah, I mean, I think a lot of these consumer companies, I mean, yeah,
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.400]   if you want to be, if you want to make it, you've got to work sometimes these insane
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   ridiculous hours.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.960]   But that's also, I think, one of the reasons why you see so much burnout from people, right?
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.040]   Because there's a certain point in your life where you're going, I can make this much money
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.880]   working, you know, for any number of companies.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.600]   Do I really need to be doing this when I'm however old I am?
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.520]   And if I have a family, do I really need to be in a position where I can't, you know,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:34.240]   go to bed until three or four o'clock in the morning on Sunday night because I'm presenting
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:38.800]   to someone and my boss who never sleeps might be sending me an email that I've got to be
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:39.800]   ready for.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.560]   But if I'm Steve Jobs or I'm Tim Cook, I want that kind of employee, right?
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.960]   And you're going, those are the guys who can get promoted and well, yeah, but I mean,
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.520]   you get promoted, but promoted to what, right?
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.640]   I mean, I mean, I think that's, that becomes the big question.
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.400]   Well, burnout's an issue, of course.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.600]   Well, that's what I'm saying because I mean, at a certain point, if you're doing this your
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:00.480]   whole life and your whole career to what end, I mean, if everybody at the top is still
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.520]   having these sorts of work hours, then what are you working towards exactly?
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:04.520]   Right.
[00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.720]   If taking a vacation means you also have to check your email four times a day and that,
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.200]   you know, I mean, that was one of their points that on vacation, you, and you would, you
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.520]   would say, oh, only four times, but you know, Dom was kind of secretly judging somebody,
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:18.000]   you know, he even, and he was much on that podcast.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.600]   You know, you only checked email four times on vacation a day and you're thinking, okay,
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.880]   well, well, you also kind of wonder, okay, well, maybe I just don't want to do this.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:31.560]   I mean, there are a lot of jobs where you can make good money and get to have a life.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:35.640]   And I mean, to me, that's kind of why I see some of the big perks that these companies
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:40.680]   offer, you know, notably Google and Facebook as kind of being bad things, right?
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:44.480]   Because it seems to me like they're really just encouraging you to like live at the office
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.760]   and to make your entire social circle, your entire, you know, work life, everything revolves
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.440]   around the office and you think, oh, it's so great.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   I can do my laundry here.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.440]   You know, I can sleep here.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.440]   I can eat here.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.840]   I can do all this other stuff.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:00.800]   It doesn't, that at a certain point, just me that your entire life is your job.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.560]   And I mean, maybe that's okay.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.720]   Maybe that's what you want.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.640]   But I think that for a lot of people, we like to have the idea even if it's fake that
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.840]   we can have lives beyond what we do.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.440]   Melton says, when someone came into my office and said they want to be a manager, I asked
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.880]   him, how did you sleep last night?
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.760]   They say, oh, fairly well.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   I said, good.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.840]   Because that's the last good night's sleep you're going to get.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.200]   Is it like that a Microsoft?
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.080]   I know it's not like that at ZDN.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.040]   Oh, well, it was like that at Zipped Davis.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   Was it?
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   What I worked there?
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.040]   Absolutely.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.320]   Bill Ziff, I'll call you in the middle of the night.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:44.400]   Bill, or executives from Zipped Davis, you'd get that call in the middle of the night and
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.520]   you'd be expected to respond to it.
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.680]   Yeah, Lisa, it's funny because I had a different take when I read this.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.360]   I said, oh my God, this sounds horrible.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.920]   And Lisa, our CEO here at Twitch said, what are you talking about?
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.520]   That's exactly how it should be.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.480]   It's like, oh, okay.
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.800]   Well, I think that there's balance, right?
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:04.760]   I mean, there's certainly times where if there's breaking news, I mean, all hands on
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.160]   deck, we all get on board and we do it.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.800]   And it's kind of one of those things where people know that they can call me at two o'clock
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.920]   in the morning and I'll be waking up.
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:17.800]   But it does mean that startup culture is going to attract a certain kind of person,
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:22.680]   usually young, no family, no life.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.240]   That's who you're going to get.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.240]   That is.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.240]   Devoted.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   Focused.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   Right, because those are the people that can afford to get that sort of stuff up.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.400]   It gets harder to make the decision to be able to put all of your life into that when you're
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:35.400]   older.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.240]   I mean, I'm 31, but I have to say it would be harder for me.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:46.320]   I'm married and I've been at this for a while to be willing to work 18 hour days for a job.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:50.320]   If I didn't have significant equity or I weren't building it out myself, but if I were just
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.160]   being hired as a cog in the wheel, I don't know if I'd be willing to do that if I'm being
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.160]   honest.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:59:01.720]   When I was 20, 21, 22, sure, but even just in the span of a decade, things change because
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   what you value in your life changes.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.960]   I think it's especially different if you're married or if you're a partner or especially
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:13.760]   if you have children where you go, I don't know if you want to give those sorts of things
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:18.080]   up in exchange for the perceived potential benefits.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.400]   That's why there are so many young people in startups.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:25.880]   I think to the detriment because the startups could actually benefit from having people
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.920]   who are more experienced and have gone through things more and have a better perspective,
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.200]   but you just can't find people who have that sort of experience usually who are willing
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:41.560]   to give up their entire lives for the company and to be in that go, go, go, go working
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.560]   18, 19 hours.
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:49.080]   Not that new because I was in London this week, and it was the Tower of London stuff.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:53.840]   Actually, Westminster Abbey where everybody's buried.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:59.040]   What becomes really apparent is that the British Empire became an empire upon the backs and
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:07.520]   the blood of millions of young men, mostly some women who were willing to give their lives
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.680]   for this cause of the British Empire.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.600]   This really isn't anything new, is it?
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:21.960]   You get glory, but I guess this has always been the case of, but then I think the people
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.360]   who buy these iPhones aren't really thinking about the blood, sweat, and tears that went
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.360]   into them.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.560]   Not just in Cupertino, but in China and everywhere else.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.600]   No, no, we don't like to think about that because that's really depressing because you
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   get still life.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   Is that life?
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.920]   Yeah, it is and it's not.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.440]   I think that there is a huge disconnect though.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.680]   There's a certain amount I think of disconnect when you have something like this which costs
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.400]   a lot of money and that we see as a status symbol and then you see how it's made.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.000]   There's a certain amount of guilt as I think there should be when you think about the sacrifices
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.200]   that go in to being made, the people who are sourcing the materials, the people who are
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.880]   putting these things together.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:01.640]   Not to mention, to be honest, I feel for some of the people who are building the software,
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.280]   but I'm not going to cry river for somebody who's making a six-figure salary by their
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.280]   choice.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.760]   I'm going to cry and feel bad for the people that are being paid pennies an hour to put
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.040]   these things together, the people that are sourcing the minerals that make this stuff.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.440]   But I think that that's one of the interesting dichotomies with tech, at least for me, is
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:25.160]   that we are surrounded by all this amazing stuff that makes our lives so much easier,
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:31.560]   but at the same time, so many of those advantages come at the expense of a real human capital.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.320]   That's not a fun thing to really address or look at and I think that's why a lot of us
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:42.600]   don't because it's very uncomfortable to put those two things in juxtaposition.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.040]   But it's something we probably should do more of.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.920]   It actually reminds me of the Tony Shea story that's going around about downtown Las Vegas.
[01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:02.000]   Tony Shea, who is the former CEO, or no, still CEO at Zappos even after the Amazon acquisition.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:10.560]   Really great guy, I love him, wrote a book about bringing happiness to everyone and had
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.800]   decided, and I thought this was a really interesting project, to revitalize downtown
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:23.720]   Vegas to create startup capital funds down there and bring startups in there.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.280]   It's Shea just stepped down.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.920]   30 of the 300 employees have been laid off and the worst thing is there have been three
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:36.720]   suicides this year by people involved with the downtown project.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.520]   Of course, the headline in newspapers is, "Is it possible to be happy when you're trying
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.240]   to bring happiness to everyone?"
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.400]   It's damaging.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.360]   This is another side of this.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.800]   Shea says, "Hey, there's suicides everywhere.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.600]   You shouldn't focus on that."
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:03.800]   That's a fair point, but it's also, I think, in that case, you have to look at the big
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.040]   culture of things he was bringing in where you're talking about a very stressful thing
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   of having a startup.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.640]   My father was tired now of what he was an entrepreneur, and I know what it was like
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.720]   growing up, where my mom was the stable breadwinner.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.280]   My dad, sometimes things would work out really well, sometimes they wouldn't.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.360]   Starting your own business is very difficult, whether it's a startup, you have funding,
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.680]   where you're starting a restaurant and getting a small business loan or you're doing something
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680]   else.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.200]   It's very tough, and most of them fail.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.400]   The reality is most of them fail.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.400]   It's hard on you.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   It's hard on your family.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.400]   It absolutely is.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.880]   You have a situation with the town down in Vegas, the downtown project where, yes, they
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.640]   had a lot of money where they're trying to revitalize this very downtrodden, very dilapidated, very
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:49.080]   crime-ridden area, and trying to do a civic duty and also treat it like a tech startup.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.800]   You convince a lot of people to leave their homes and their support systems, come to this
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:04:01.080]   new place that has its own issues, and then power together through the spirit of kumbaya
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.320]   and build something bigger.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   It's a great idea.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.120]   I certainly don't want to condemn the idea, but I definitely feel like that does become
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.440]   kind of a perfect storm in a sense for the problems that are going to exist anyway to
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:20.800]   only become even more exasperated once you look at the situation of where you are, what
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.640]   the economy is like, what the people in the town are like, and then you've got all the
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:30.800]   other day-to-day, really realistic struggles of starting a business, especially when the
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:36.080]   person that's leading the command is very charismatic leader who wants everyone to be
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.520]   happy to the point that I feel like maybe that becomes a negative thing because you feel
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.280]   like, "Well, if I'm not on the outward looking like I'm happy, but I don't talk about my
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.120]   struggles, if I do talk about my struggles, maybe that's going against the message, and
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.760]   so maybe people don't feel comfortable to be open about what they're struggling with."
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.120]   And so, yeah, I mean, I think it's a real shame.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.440]   But I mean, I think the downtown project, I mean, they obviously had to do some layoffs
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:05.520]   this week, and we don't really know the whole story behind that, but I feel like that's,
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:11.520]   I don't know, I love the idea of trying to go into a downtrodden area and try to build
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.760]   it up and do good, but I don't know if you can apply some of the lessons that you do
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.680]   with a typical startup if you can take out the civic planning.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.600]   I don't necessarily know if the people who were in charge, what's been kind of coming
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.560]   out has been that maybe some of the people in charge of some of these things weren't
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.520]   the best people to be in charge.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   And civic planning is hard enough.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.840]   Doing startups is hard enough.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.160]   Doing both of them together, I don't know.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.720]   I mean, maybe it was too ambitious, but I hope that the project is able to be ultimately
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.600]   successful, you know, more that it can work out better, you know, going forward.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.360]   Yeah, I think Tony's a great guy.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.400]   And I know his heart is in the right place.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.400]   Oh, without a doubt.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.360]   And I think he's done a lot for the downtown Vegas community.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.040]   I just feel like, you know, it's one thing to build a successful business.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.720]   It's another thing to build a bunch of successful businesses and a community that can kind of
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.960]   build upon itself.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.080]   And I mean, to his point, you know, he released a letter that said, you know, look, we knew
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:12.920]   this was a five year plan, you know, we're accelerating the typical process much faster.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.360]   So they're going to be successes and failures that accelerate faster, too.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360]   And that's a valid point.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.920]   I just think that, you know, the narrative that we'd like to see as journalists and as
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.600]   storytellers and as people who follow the media, we want to see things happen in a certain
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.600]   way.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:30.360]   And I think so many people went to downtown Vegas and were kind of enamored with the process
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.080]   and then when it doesn't work out, you know, become upset that it didn't work out.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:40.120]   But I mean, we're only in the middle of kind of what they think their fighter plan is going
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.120]   to be.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.040]   And so I think it's hard, definitely, in the right place.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.280]   And definitely I'm not willing to count these things out, but I think it's just proof to
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:52.600]   all of us that, you know, money alone isn't going to be able to create success and that,
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.440]   you know, it's hard work to build a business and it's a hard work to build communities.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.280]   And there's a price paid by the people who choose it.
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   Absolutely.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.720]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.920]   Bill Gates says, "Apple Pay is a good thing."
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.440]   It doesn't say why Microsoft didn't do it sooner.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.920]   But first, they tried or did they?
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.480]   I don't know.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480]   You know, they had a watch.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.000]   They had that spot watch was awesome.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   I don't.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.640]   We're going to take a break and be back with more in just a moment.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.800]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.080]   Here's something we can all agree on.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:37.560]   The best way to relax and to seal out the world and all those 3am phone calls is an
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.160]   audio book.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:44.080]   And as somebody who spent a lot of time on an airplane this week and last week too, I
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.840]   got to tell you Audible is a lifesaver.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:52.360]   You know, in England, there's Audible ads in the tube and the underground station everywhere
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.760]   on the trains.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:54.840]   And what was the slogan?
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   I loved it.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.480]   I can't remember. It was a great slogan like, "There's always time to listen" or something
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480]   like that.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.520]   It was wonderful.
[01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.520]   It's true.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.080]   If you commute, if you spend time in the car, if you spend time at the gym, if you just
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.800]   do housework, anything, there's lots of time in the day when you can't hold a book, but
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.760]   you could be listening to a book.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.840]   And you'll be amazed.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.560]   It brought reading back into my life when I started listening to Audible 14 years ago.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.920]   I started in the year 2000 because you know, we have busy lives who has time, but it turns
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.200]   out there's a lot of time where you could be listening and Audible brings those books
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.200]   into your life.
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:38.360]   I'm right now I'm listening to, I think I used to have this rule one book at a time.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.520]   I don't know how I got out of that, but now I have like three books going right now.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.720]   One fiction, one nonfiction, and then maybe one random one.
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:50.720]   There's so much great listening at Audible.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:58.920]   50,000 titles recorded, not just by readers, but by actors, by people who bring these books
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.440]   to life in such a great way.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.760]   And sometimes it's by the author.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.040]   I just listened to the Neil Young autobiography and he's reading it.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.480]   That's really great, not Neil Young.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:13.680]   Well, that's one actually, there is a new Neil Young book, Graham Nash, actually the next
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.000]   one on my list is Neil Young because I love the rock and roll stuff.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.120]   I'm also about to listen to Gone Girl, you know that movie's coming out I think this
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.840]   week, a thriller, but I got to tell you as good as a two hour movie can be, there's nothing
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.880]   to compare with the novel as you're listening to it.
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.040]   And this plays out in your mind, your mind makes the best sets.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.480]   Sometimes I think I've already seen this movie because I've read or listened to the book.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.760]   And that's what, so if I always recommend before you see the movie, get the book Gone
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   Girl.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.320]   Don't know what the movie will be like, but I know you're going to love this book.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   Here's the deal.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.320]   I'm going to get you two books free.
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.320]   What about that?
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:57.480]   All you have to do is go to audible.com/twit2, that's audible.com/twit.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.400]   And the number two, you'll be signing up for the platinum plan.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:06.840]   That's two books a month plus the daily digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.680]   Cancel anytime of the first 30 days, those books are yours to keep forever.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.520]   You pay nothing, but I think you're going to want to be a member for life.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   I know I am.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:16.520]   I'm that's it.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:21.480]   Oh, New Neil Gaiman, a full cast production of the graveyard book.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.640]   I haven't read this.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.840]   Have you read the graveyard book, Christina?
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.040]   Because it seems like you'd be a Neil Gaiman fan.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.040]   I am.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.040]   I have not.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.720]   I have not, but I saw Gone Girl yesterday and the film is great.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.960]   The film is fantastic.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.120]   The book is amazing too.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.640]   And actually the audible version, it's like 20 hours.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.200]   It's a really, really good one.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.720]   I mean, that's the thing, how could a two hour movie get that all the nuance of a 19 hour
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.720]   novel?
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.560]   You know what, remarkably well, but it's two, it's two hours, 45 minutes.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.720]   Would you list some of the book first?
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.560]   I would, I would, but I would say that if you don't, Jillian Flynn adapted the novel,
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.160]   she asked to get screenplay.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.160]   Okay.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.400]   So it's one of the rare times where I think, well, A, I think venture in general is really
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.960]   good at adaptation, but she did a really good job at the script.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.080]   But yeah, I would definitely listen to the book or read the book first if you have a
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.080]   chance.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.600]   And then you know the other's going to spoil it, right?
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.080]   Because then you'll know what's going to happen.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.640]   You're going to know, but it's one of those things where you will still enjoy it.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.960]   My husband hadn't read the book and loved the film.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.000]   And I loved the book and loved the film and the entire theater, I mean, I'm not going
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   to give anything away.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   It's kind of a thriller.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.680]   But the entire theater, when it was over, I've never seen it full theater, full of people
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.400]   literally have a WTF face.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.160]   I want that experience with the book always first.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.160]   And then I'll do it with the movie.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.880]   You know, I think that's personal.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880]   That's personal.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   Definitely.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.680]   No, I like to read the read the book first if I can.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:48.760]   I always read the before I see the movie, I almost always try to read the book first.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.320]   I just for some reason, that's just how I am.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   Audible makes it possible.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.280]   And I again, I think your mind is better at creating scenes, creating building the set
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.280]   making it happen.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:03.440]   That's why to me science fiction, as much as I love those great sci-fi movies and TV shows,
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.680]   you got to read the book.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.160]   The book comes to life.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.360]   Whatever it is, Peter F. Hamilton, Isaac Asimov, great selection there too at audible.com.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   Try it today.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.960]   Two books, you're free for you.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:20.480]   Audible.com/twit and the number two, audible.com/twit and the number two.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:24.640]   There's always, I think I said, there was always time to listen.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.160]   Something like that.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.280]   Oh, Lisa's happy because the Niners won.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.760]   I thought she was cheering for Audible.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.680]   I like Audible too, she says.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.240]   She listens to, she's listening to Nora Roberts.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.760]   I think you're going to go through all the Nora Roberts books and John Grisham.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.280]   She likes those thrillers.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.280]   It's fun.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.240]   She's in the gym eight hours a day, so she really needs something to listen to.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:58.960]   Bill Gates, in interview with Bloomberg TV, Eric Schatzker, talked about a lot of stuff,
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   talked about Bitcoin.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.400]   See, Bill's explained his change a little bit now that he's a philanthropist.
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.640]   He's not so interested in business.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.760]   He's interested in how the world, especially for the poor, can be transformed.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.240]   And he thinks, for instance, Bitcoin is huge for that.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:23.080]   But he also thinks that virtual forms of virtual money and virtual payment are really important
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.640]   because especially in the developing world, a lot of people don't have bank accounts,
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.720]   but they might have cell phones.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.360]   They can't write a check, but they can pay by a cell phone.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   He says, "Apple pay."
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:39.000]   The quote from the interview is a great example of how a cell phone that identifies its user
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   in a pretty strong way.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.600]   I guess he's talking about the fingerprint, the touch ID.
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:46.560]   Let's you make a transaction that should be very, very inexpensive.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.880]   So the fact that in any application I can buy something, that's fantastic.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:53.480]   The fact that I don't need a physical card anymore, I just do that to that transaction.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.840]   You're going to be quite sure about who's on the other end, and that is a real contribution.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.160]   And all of the platforms, whether it's Apple or Google or Microsoft, you'll see this payment
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.200]   capability get built in.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.640]   But he thinks Apple will help it get to critical mass for all of the devices.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   I think he's right.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:14.680]   I think this is something we've been poised on the verge of, but Apple pay is just going
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:19.560]   to be, I think it's going to be that final bit that puts us over the top, especially
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.760]   because of the touch ID, which works very well on iPhones.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:31.120]   Well, they also have a very deep connection to a very wealthy, core demographic.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.160]   And so that is-- Which merchants would love to get to.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.160]   Exactly.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.680]   And that's what makes it possible for the payment system to be successful is because
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:45.640]   you know that people are going to be coming in with money on their phone that they can
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.720]   interact with.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:55.440]   And so-- He also says it's Apple's in it for the money, not philanthropy, but it will
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.240]   spur philanthropy as well.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:02.680]   Or it will help the economy of the developing world greatly.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.760]   No, he's-- I think he's right.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.680]   I mean, it's interesting actually because if you look at the developing world, they've
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.960]   actually been further ahead, at least, than America when it comes to paying by phone.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:14.960]   They do it in different ways.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.560]   You know, I remember speaking with Osama Badir, who was at PayPal at the time, and then he
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.640]   was at Google, and I'm not sure what he's doing now, but he was at the time PayPal's
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.040]   big payment sky.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.760]   And he was telling me about how-- I mean, this was probably in 2009 or 2010 that a lot of
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:35.080]   people in Africa would have, you know, dumb phones and would use, you know, these kind
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.320]   of micro payments to buy things, kind of with, you know, individuals acting as kind
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:43.840]   of banks to transfer, you know, funds from one device to another.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840]   And they were--
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.440]   The technology widely used now in Africa and India is in PASA.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.440]   Exactly.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.920]   That same sort of thing.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:57.240]   So people buying things through SMS, and so I think, you know, bringing it to the developed
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.240]   world, it's needed in Apple.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.280]   I mean, I think obviously NFC is not a new thing, but what hasn't happened in America
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.960]   anyway is that the merchants haven't gotten on board.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:09.640]   And to Ed's point, you know, they will get on board when you know that you've got 10
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.440]   million people buying an iPhone, you know, six, you know, the weekend it comes out.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.400]   And when you've got a few hundred million people with Touch ID, you know, capable devices
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:22.920]   who are going to be going into places like Whole Foods and, you know, Target and the
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.720]   Apple Store and other places to buy stuff.
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.480]   And that means that upgrading your equipment and your point of sale terminals makes more
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.480]   sense.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:36.240]   And we've talked a little bit about that on Macbreak Weekly, that timing is critical because
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.400]   in the US, we're going chip and pin by the end of 2015.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.960]   That is a federal mandate.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.560]   This will have to buy new credit card equipment anyway before the end of next year.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.000]   So your timing is excellent.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.640]   If you're a merchant, you're about to do this.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.400]   Well, you're going to make sure it works with Apple Pay.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:58.840]   And obviously, since Apple still is not even half of the universe in the United States,
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.800]   you're going to make sure it works with Google Wallet and NFC and any other touch to pay
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.800]   system.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:06.920]   And I'm sure that that's exactly what's happening is the companies that make these devices are
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.440]   now making sure they're completely compatible with all the possible touch to pay stuff.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.440]   And that's going to empower.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.000]   We were in a London taxi.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.560]   They take touch to pay many of the London taxis.
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.960]   I could have paid with it my Google Wallet.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.800]   It was like poised over it, but there's a hump to get over.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.960]   It's like the first time you use a credit card online.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.120]   There's just a little hump to get over.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.840]   I think that might be as much as anything an age-related thing.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840]   Leo, it's...
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.280]   Are you saying I'm old, Ed bot?
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   I am.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.280]   Well, you're right.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.920]   I'm saying we're old, buddy.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:47.400]   Well, you know, what I find fascinating is that the most widely developed, well-developed
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.200]   and widely implemented payment system so far is one called ISIS.
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.200]   Yes.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.040]   Which was Verizon's attempt to get onto my phone.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.040]   Yes.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.040]   And so it's now called Softcard.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.040]   It's not called Softcard.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.360]   It's a smart idea to change the name all the software is still called ISIS.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.280]   I mean, I haven't had an update yet.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.480]   No, that's the one that the carriers and Verizon.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.920]   So it's everybody with sprints and then MasterCard and Visa.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:16.520]   Which was horrific because they kept Google Wallet off of all of their phones.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520]   They did.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520]   I mean, that was why Google Wallet.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.520]   I remember when I beta tested that and reviewed that, gosh, at this point, it was three years
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.520]   ago.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.360]   It's like this month or last month, it was three years, you know, that I used that on
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.640]   a Galaxy Nexus on sprints.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.880]   And I connected my Capital One credit card to it because that happened to work and I
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.760]   was able to, but it only worked with the Capital One MasterCard.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   It wouldn't work with Visa.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.280]   It had to work with the MasterCard and only for a couple of payment carriers.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.280]   You know, but I just...
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.760]   So is Ed Wright since Ed and I are old farts and you're young, are you comfortable with
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.760]   touch to pay?
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.760]   Is that something you do?
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.440]   I mean, I don't have a card with a chip in it.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.440]   There aren't enough readers, but I definitely would feel comfortable with that.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.760]   For me, the bigger hump has actually been, will this recognize my existing banking system
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.720]   or do I have to go to another bank?
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.960]   The big thing I think that Apple has that was absolutely a requirement and they obviously
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:14.200]   thought to do this is that they are going to be coming out of the gate supporting Bank
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.120]   of America, Chase, you know, Citibank.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.200]   All of the major banks are begging to get on board and then, you know, MasterCard Visa
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.040]   American Express for all on board.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.280]   And so when you've got that ability there, if I can very easily add my existing card
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.680]   to the wallet very easily and I don't have to go through a bunch of hoops, which I had
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.680]   to do with Google Wallet and which you kind of have to do with ISIS, I think that either
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:40.240]   even for people who are not maybe comfortable, if you can get over that hump of easily adding
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.920]   your card, just scanning your credit card and having it in the wallet, that's a lot easier.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.440]   I think I'll be comfortable very quickly.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.240]   Just I need to do it a few times and then just not much opportunity to do it.
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:54.720]   I do think the touch ID and iPhone will make me feel better.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.120]   I gather what happens with wallet is you have to enter a pin.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.600]   You have to enter a pin and then, you know, the NFC might be working.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.880]   Maybe it isn't and it just it was clunky.
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:08.120]   It was clunky when they introduced it three years ago and because of the ISIS back and
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.360]   forth, they never really got it off the ground.
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360]   And it was serious.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:16.520]   It was seriously, but I mean, but it was a great, you know, first attempt.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.760]   But I when I was using it three years ago, I was like, there's no way this will go mainstream.
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.480]   Apple for whatever reason, a, they're really likely with the timing.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:29.520]   As you said, people have to upgrade machines anyway, but I think B, they aren't going to
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.000]   launch a product that is not that is going to have that sort of experience.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   They're not going to do that.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.680]   You know, they will wait until the ecosystem can be where it is now because if it were just
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.720]   about launching a product, they could have launched something like touch ID or Apple,
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.360]   you know, pay a couple of years ago, but in countries out there.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.760]   In countries like Australia, where it's widespread, England, people are very it.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.520]   Have you done it, dad?
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.000]   And you still electronic payments?
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.800]   Yeah, I'm a touch to pay.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.720]   No, no, because there's nowhere that does it.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:09.040]   Because the American banking system is so is almost as backward as the American mobile
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.040]   data.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.040]   It's true.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.040]   It's true.
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.560]   They're both, you know, it's as all you have to do is leave the borders of the United
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.920]   States to see what civilization should look like.
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.320]   And then you come back here and you just go, we have all these smart people and all these
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.640]   amazing companies and these horrible, horrible infrastructures.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:34.120]   I mean, we were in Europe earlier, I guess, last month.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:37.440]   And I mean, I just I was embarrassed handing over a credit.
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.960]   I'm sorry, you have to swipe this.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   Great.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.200]   You know, terribly embarrassed.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.200]   And they'd say, that's okay.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.360]   We understand you're American.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:51.440]   You know, but we're, you know, we were horribly behind on GSM.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   The rest of the world adopted it wholesale long before us.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:03.080]   And I think the rest of the world is going to benefit from electronic payments long before
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.240]   the United States does.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:11.040]   Yeah, no, I mean, Canada, Canada is, you know, they do the chip and pay it, swipe and pay
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.040]   stuff.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.520]   And if you, you know, if I go to Canada, it's the same sort of thing you feel embarrassed
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.880]   if you have to have them swipe the card, you know, I mean, at least they'll take $20
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:24.120]   bills, but you know, it's, you know, for the most part, depending on what part of Canada
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:28.200]   you're in, they'll pretty much take up to a 20 and have the same conversion rate.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.160]   But yeah, I mean, it's, we, we are definitely way behind.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.680]   I hope that Apple Pay is what pushes us to catch up and that the other payments, it won't
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:39.680]   become the de facto standard of course, but that will be what will force merchants to
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.680]   finally get on board.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:46.560]   And as Gates points out, authentication really is the big issue and having a comfort level
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.160]   with touch ID and having that built in, that's going to, for me anyway, make me feel a lot
[01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.160]   better about it.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.520]   I mean, I think although to the worth pointing out that, you know, with all the breaches
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:01.480]   and credit card breaches we've had over, you know, the time it hasn't been worse than
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.480]   this.
[01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:08.640]   I was going to say, I mean, honestly, you know, I feel like NFC, if anything, or shoot RFID
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   seems safer than, you know, the systems that have been going on.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   That's true.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.880]   And we really, we don't like to think about how unsafe our current credit card systems
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:19.520]   are that they're being swiped and sometimes manually written down and, and that sort of
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.880]   stuff, the fact that anybody, you know, you give your number over the phone, you know,
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.840]   anybody could be writing that number down and putting it someplace else.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:31.280]   I mean, our payment system as it exists right now is very insecure because we've still are
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.440]   using these antiquated practices that the rest of the world kind of looks at us and
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:35.440]   they're like, really guys?
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.440]   Really?
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:37.440]   I thought that you're like USA.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.240]   Well, you know why?
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.240]   Well, you know why?
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:44.280]   Because we were in the forefront of protecting consumers in that regard and because consumers
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:49.000]   really don't pay, at least not directly for any losses the banks do, there's been very
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   little pressure for consumers to come up with a more secure system.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   It's all coming from the banks.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.240]   The banks don't pay, they're able to push it on to the merchants.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:01.560]   So if there's a, you know, if it, a lot of times it goes back to the merchants.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:02.560]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:03.560]   I didn't know that.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:04.560]   Who eat it?
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:06.560]   It's.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.320]   So it's the merchants who should be saying we want touch to pay.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.800]   They should be except they don't want to pay for the upgrade of the system.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.440]   So it's been kind of the historical thing.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.280]   They don't want to pay, you know, fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred dollars for a new
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.200]   terminal, you know, if you're a small business, which is why a lot of people, even after the
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:24.200]   target hack, we're fighting this, you know, federal mandate that we're all going to go,
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.400]   you know, chip to pay.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.800]   But at this point, there have been enough problems that, yeah, I mean, they're going
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.240]   to have, everybody's going to have to upgrade.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.480]   But even after that mandate comes through, you know that there are going to be tons of
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.760]   businesses just like there are in Brooklyn where there are tons of people who don't
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:39.520]   take credit card because they don't want to pay the taxes on it.
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:44.520]   You know, they take cash only or, you know, they use things like Square, which are, you
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:49.720]   know, kind of a, you know, less expensive way of having to get around the system.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.720]   So I don't know, we'll see.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.240]   So I'm looking at a Wall Street Journal article.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.240]   They got it wrong too.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.400]   They've corrected the article.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:03.120]   Apparently, you'll still be able to sign after October 2015, but you will have to have
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:10.920]   the pin in your credit card and it will be encouraged that people use chip and pin as
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.160]   opposed to chip and sign, which is all for--
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.240]   Which is the same way it is in Europe.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.400]   Yeah, I could sign for stuff.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.760]   Simple as world right now.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:23.560]   You can still swipe and sign, but it's strongly encouraged.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:28.640]   And you're much better protected against fraud if you're using a chip and pin system.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:35.120]   I think the big cultural shift that we're going to have to make is starting to think
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:41.280]   of smartphones as like they literally are like your wallet.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   You don't want to pick it.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:49.120]   You don't want a pickpocket to take that from you because it's as valuable as a wallet
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:52.000]   filled with 20s and 100s.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.480]   Well, that's again where the fingerprint, where Touch ID gives you some reassurance.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:01.400]   Apple has also improved their-- I think this is great.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   Their activation system.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.760]   Now they have a tool you could put on a phone and say, "Is this a stolen phone?"
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.560]   They make it very hard, in fact, to steal a phone and then use it again.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.560]   All of that stuff.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.560]   More than a kill switch.
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:16.200]   I mean, it really kills it.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.200]   Dead.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.360]   All of that stuff really is important.
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.600]   And Apple really can lead the way, but I hope that Android devices will follow.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.440]   I think they definitely will.
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:29.800]   I mean, I just think that Apple, because they are-- even if they have less market share
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.120]   than Android as a whole, when it comes to an individual company, they obviously have
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.160]   the most market share for a single type of device category.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.800]   More iPhones are sold than anything else.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.920]   And so they have a huge opportunity at that point.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.120]   But yeah, I mean, I think that you're absolutely right, Ed.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.480]   I mean, we've got to start thinking of our phones like our wallets.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:50.680]   And I mean, to be honest, I've lost my phone once and I was able to get it back, but it
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.920]   did feel like a violent-- I mean, I felt this was a sense of loss.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:01.040]   I felt not having my phone was akin absolutely to losing a wallet.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:06.160]   And at this point, there's as much personal data about me on my phone as there usually
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.160]   is in my wallet.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.880]   Maybe I don't have to go-- just as I don't carry my social security card with me, maybe
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:18.280]   there are certain things on my phone that might not be as inherent to my identity, but
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.440]   losing one or both is basically kind of the equivalent.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.440]   You feel screwed.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.680]   You feel violated without-- with either piece of information.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:30.120]   But I think that the concept that we can just say, oh, it's just a phone.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:36.160]   No, your phone becomes this core part of your identity in a large sense.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.160]   Ed, you were saying something?
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.160]   No, no, it's just a short circuit in the mic again.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160]   Ah!
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:51.200]   You know, here's an interesting sideline to this.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.400]   According to this new law that goes into effect October 2015, there's also a shift
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:02.440]   of who is liable for fraud.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:06.440]   The person with less technology is liable.
[01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.440]   Right, right.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.960]   And that's what they're trying to get people to upgrade.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.960]   So you didn't have--
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:17.160]   If there's a card fraud, whichever party has the lesser technology will bear the liability.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.160]   Wow.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.160]   That's smart.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.160]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:26.040]   No, I mean, I think that that's honestly-- that's probably the only way they can convince some
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.160]   of these merchants to upgrade is if it becomes a liability issue.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:35.080]   And at that point, it would come down to-- for some retailers, it would come down to is
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.480]   our insurance that we have out against fraud.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.560]   Is that going to-- is that right or going to be more or less expensive than what we would
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.920]   have to pay to upgrade our systems?
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.440]   And then it just comes down to whatever's cheaper they'll do.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:51.400]   But I think that that's probably the only way you can get places that have hundreds of
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:56.360]   thousands of terminals to upgrade on mass, is if you start saying, okay, well, if you
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:01.800]   don't have this system in place, then if there is a breach, we will hold you responsible
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.720]   and you will be liable.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.120]   And your insurance or whatever's false, you've got an into effect, will have to be responsible
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.120]   for this.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:18.120]   Well, the risk of being totally cynical, I'm going to predict that the regulations will
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.320]   be written in such a way that the banks win.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.880]   Yeah, what a surprise.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   Oh, of course.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.880]   Of course.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:24.880]   Thanks.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.920]   I have the most dirt technology, not the less dirt technology.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:33.160]   And even if they don't, the rules will be written in such a way that their technology
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.040]   will be defined as the best.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.600]   Apple's strategy, not to get back on Apple, but I think it's interesting that Apple has
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.400]   decided that they're going to be the privacy company, the security company.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:50.680]   And even despite the fact that these iCloud accounts got hacked and so forth, I think
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.880]   that's a smart move.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:56.160]   And it is in a way seeing the writing on the wall that people are going to depend so much
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.520]   on these devices that you need to be.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.240]   For instance, Apple says we're not going to be able to decrypt.
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.920]   We're not going to help you anymore in law enforcement.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:08.520]   If you ask for a decryption on the iPhone, currently there's a queue, you can get it in
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.520]   a few months.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:13.800]   Apple will give you decrypted data from a bad guy's iPhone.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.680]   Apple says we're not going to do that anymore.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:20.880]   Although Matthew Green, the cryptographer, has pointed out that it's not really any change
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.880]   in the way Apple works.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.840]   They're just going to move more data than before and to there.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:32.600]   The past mail, text messages, photos were excluded from the normally encrypted data
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.960]   on your iPhone.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:42.640]   Now everything, including attachments, managed books from the book program iBooks, app launch
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:50.280]   images, location data will be encrypted with keys protected by the user's passcode calendar,
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.880]   shooting attachments, contacts reminders, notes, messages, photos and health, ancillary data
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.280]   implement protected until first user authentication.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.560]   So this is a good move on Apple's part.
[01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:01.640]   They see the writing on the wall.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:06.080]   This is a way to make more money, some more iPhones.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.680]   And Microsoft has been doing the same thing with mobile devices for a couple years now.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.640]   Encrypted by default, they don't have the keys.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:20.080]   And that's the real issue is who has the keys?
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.080]   Yes.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:29.120]   If the keys and the Washington Post did a spectacularly naive editorial yesterday where they talked
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:35.920]   about, well, there has to be a way for law enforcement to be able to get this data.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:43.600]   So maybe the wizards, Apple and Google could come up with a magical way to create golden
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.760]   keys that they can save and reserve.
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.720]   It's called a backdoor.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.320]   Well, it's called key escrow.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.320]   Key escrow.
[01:31:53.320 --> 01:32:01.080]   Which has been, you know, do you trust them?
[01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:06.720]   Yeah, no, I think this, I understand law enforcement is upset.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:12.040]   They don't want there to be anything that they can't look into if they need to.
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:18.160]   But I think, I don't think there's any question Apple is the right to do this and that consumers
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.160]   want this.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.160]   Absolutely.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.760]   I mean, especially when we've seen how law enforcement oversteps their boundaries.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:29.400]   I mean, I want you to have a warrant and do your job as a police officer to detectives.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:33.800]   And I recognize that maybe not having access to some of the stuff might make your job harder.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.080]   And that's too bad.
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.200]   But what did you do before there were cell phones?
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.120]   What did you do before all this information was around?
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:44.840]   Just to play devil's advocate, shouldn't we then be making sure that law enforcement
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:49.680]   follows the proper procedures and does have warrants and its court supervised, but still
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:50.680]   have key escrow?
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.480]   I mean, shouldn't we, and why did you say that was a naive proposal?
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:59.960]   I mean, we do need some way of investigating terrorists and criminals, don't we?
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:04.240]   Well, we had the Patriot Act, which was passed in 2001.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.360]   Well, let's fix that though.
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:08.400]   Well, I understand it.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.880]   I understand it didn't work and there was no oversight.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.160]   But what if we could make it work and have good oversight and have good court oversight?
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:19.040]   Wouldn't that be better than just shutting off the hose?
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:26.840]   I think we just bring a unicorn to court for every warrant hearing and then everything
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.080]   will work properly.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:35.400]   The reality is we've already proven beyond a shadow of a doubt in this country that under
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:42.280]   the proper fear level, legislators will pass laws that make it possible for things to
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.720]   be done in secret that we don't know about.
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:57.880]   So if you have a key that is held in escrow and you have a law that says we are the government
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:04.680]   and we can have a warrant and you can't talk about this warrant for national security reasons
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:11.080]   or the purposes of fighting terrorists or for whatever, then that escrow key is used
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:15.640]   to decrypt your data and nobody knows about it.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:22.080]   And you can talk about all of the procedural safeguards for making sure that constitutional
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.320]   rights are respected in a situation like that.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:31.960]   But the reality is that if you have the key and someone else can get to the key and they
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:37.520]   can hold a gun to your head and say, "Don't tell anyone that I got this key from you,"
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:45.480]   then whoever thinks they are the actual owner of that data doesn't really own it.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:50.840]   The only way that you own that data is if you are the sole owner of the decryption key
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:55.160]   and nobody else can access it except you.
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:00.200]   I just worry that there's some pretty horrible actors out there like the Islamic State.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.040]   I wonder if these people are within all switched iPhones.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:09.600]   But that's the thing that's a false premise I think because just because Apple's not offering
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.880]   up the decryption keys doesn't mean that people can't still access this data.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.080]   It doesn't mean there aren't still people who can reverse engineer things.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.080]   And people in fact do.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:23.080]   I mean in fact there are a lot of people who, Jonathan, Z, D, Z, I can't pronounce the
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.080]   glasses.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.480]   Zdarski, who's fantastic.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:31.800]   And he wrote an article on his blog and he's pretty much, I would say, the foremost iOS
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.600]   kind of a security and forensic guy out there.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.840]   There's still software and tools out there that these agencies can get.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:43.280]   And I would think especially at the high levels of people who are wanting to do things like
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:45.120]   investigating the Islamic State.
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.000]   What this doesn't make it as easy for is for say like the Polk County Police Department
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.240]   who's trying to investigate a drug user's iPhone.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.920]   Maybe their job is going to be a little bit more difficult.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:56.920]   But let's be honest.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.400]   I mean maybe it should be.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.120]   Maybe they have been to this point.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.080]   We're not sure because as Zdars pointing out these things that are in place where people
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:10.240]   are able to gain access to these warrants without having to have any sort of paper trail
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.920]   or any sort of transparency.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.720]   We don't know how they've been getting access to stuff.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.840]   But I firmly believe that just because Apple's not handing over the keys, it in no way means
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.040]   that there's no way to access this information.
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.400]   And that's, it just becomes more difficult, granted.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:29.520]   But I think that's kind of one of those trade-offs we have to have with being a free society
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.280]   and having a system of laws is that if we are going to say that we have rights and that
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:39.360]   we have a right to privacy, that means that companies shouldn't feel as if they have to
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.120]   hold hand over the keys to all these systems to the government.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.440]   Because I mean to me that really bothers me fundamentally as an American.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.640]   The idea that we would entrust the government automatically with this stuff and say that
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.880]   just because you're law enforcement, you get access to this.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:00.560]   Because there are probably easier ways than even going that far for people who are skilled
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:04.480]   to break into this stuff if you really need to get the information.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:07.560]   So I feel like it's a false economy.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:12.600]   Or in care of saying things like, "Oh, this is pedophiles or whoever the man was who said
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.560]   the pedophiles will all use the iPhone."
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.320]   Okay, first of all, that's really incendiary language.
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:20.360]   And it really bothers me kind of using that sort of rhetoric.
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:25.040]   Second of all, it's not as if you're going to say that no one can ever break into this.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.040]   That's not what it's saying.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:29.560]   It's simply saying that Apple from a matter of liability, and let's be clear, Apple's
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.360]   not doing this because they loved her users.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.160]   They're doing it because they don't want to be liable for having to be responsible to
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.160]   unlock this stuff.
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:40.200]   It's also a very good positioning for Apple to say, "Where's the privacy company?"
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:44.520]   Although there will be some backlash from people who quite reasonably say, "Yeah, but
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:48.080]   now who's going to protect us against terrorists?"
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:51.400]   So believe me, I'm playing devil's advocate here.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.480]   Oh, I know what I get in my eyes.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.000]   But I don't think it's unreasonable for people to raise that issue.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.120]   I remember talking to Phil Zimmer and about PGP.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.760]   And of course, the first thing he'd say is, "Well, great.
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.720]   You're now providing completely secure email for everybody, easy to use."
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.720]   No, it wasn't.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.960]   Does it turn out that easy to use?
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:09.960]   Easy to use.
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.600]   Aren't you empowering terrorists?
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600]   And Phil was very clear.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:18.160]   He said, "Yeah, but we live in a free society and it's important that people be able to
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.960]   protect their privacy."
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.680]   And it's like the First Amendment.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.240]   You just have to do it.
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:31.640]   Well, it's no different from a law enforcement agency saying criminals live in houses.
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.640]   Right.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.320]   Houses have front doors with locks on them.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:40.280]   We need to ban locks because the police need to get into criminals' houses.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.280]   Right.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.680]   And when, whenever it's necessary, fine.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.120]   You need procedures to break through locks.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:53.440]   There will, I guarantee it, be ways for law enforcement and especially national security
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:58.280]   to target the information of the really, truly bad guys.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:03.160]   They're just going to have to deal with a landscape that has shifted in favor of privacy.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.640]   And we need to take that.
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.400]   I like what Apple has done in terms of talking about law enforcement, but I want to see that
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.720]   shift to the commercial sector as well.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:24.440]   I want to see far fewer web properties and advertising agencies and data marketers indiscriminately
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:30.440]   gathering wholesale amounts of data on people from around the world just because they can.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:35.680]   I would love to see not just for law enforcement, but for everything to see the expectation
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:40.680]   of privacy shift to something that is in favor of the individual.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.720]   You're here.
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:45.000]   I agree.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.960]   Now on that note, let's take a small break and continue in just a bit with more with Ed
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:52.320]   Bot of ZD net, Christina Warren of Mashable.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.280]   If you missed anything, which I did actually, I missed the entire week.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:00.000]   So fortunately, we prepared this brief video to let you know what you missed and I missed
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.560]   this week on Twitch.
[01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.760]   Let's go to the stop story.
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.160]   It's all about Windows 10.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.520]   Now Windows 9, not Windows the Rod.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:07.600]   Where do Windows 9 go?
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.960]   Why is it called Windows 10?
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.960]   Because 789.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.680]   789, right?
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.720]   So, you know, I thought I was so close.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:16.720]   On Twitch.
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:17.720]   Windows Weekly.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:20.400]   This is the last major version of Windows they're saying.
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:23.960]   They literally are putting this out at a much earlier point than they ever have.
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.600]   And this is the new way they do things.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.320]   They want, is this what you want?
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.160]   No, let us know what you want.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   Right.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.160]   Security now.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:34.160]   It's not that it's a bad thing.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.160]   It's not that it's a bad thing.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.160]   It's not that it's a bad thing.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.160]   It's not that it's a bad thing.

[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.160]   It's not that it's a bad thing.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.160]   It's not that it's a bad thing.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.160]   It's not that it's a bad thing.

[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.160]   Sony has announced a new Blu-ray capable Blu-ray player that's 4K.
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:23.160]   It's going to have to buy a new one for 4K video.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:26.160]   I guess 4K is so big.
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.160]   You're probably not going to stream that.
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:30.160]   You can't with Netflix a little bit.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.160]   It's not good quality.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.160]   No.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:38.160]   The thing is, it's got to be 15 megabits sustained, which most people, if you're getting Netflix, you can't have that anyway.
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:40.160]   It's got to be a huge pipe.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:44.160]   Then the quality is not as good as if you could get it standalone.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:49.160]   For 4K, I was actually at the beginning of the year, I was on some news program and I was making predictions.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.160]   We were talking about 4K.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.160]   I kind of half-joked was half-series.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:56.160]   I was like, "Well, actually, maybe just we'll come back because of 4K."
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.160]   But I only say that because the file size is so big.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.160]   But for everything else, I think until 4K TVs are really out there in abundance.
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.160]   I love physical media because I like the quality and I like the extra features.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:14.160]   But if I'm being honest, 99% of what I watch is still from streaming from other places.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:16.160]   It's convenience Trump's quality, I think.
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.160]   Sadly.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:19.160]   No, I found it.
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:22.160]   No, that's not like I missed my extra features.
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.160]   You can get DVD commentary.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.160]   You want me to do...
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:30.160]   And then I decided that I was going to change the script.
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:34.160]   No, I love DVD commentary.
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.160]   Do they still do those?
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:37.160]   They do.
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:40.160]   That's the only way you can get them is if you buy the Blu-ray and the DVD.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.160]   I think we can fix that.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.160]   We could.
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:47.160]   Sadly, fewer and fewer people care about that.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.160]   That's the reason.
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.160]   They don't do it because no one wants it.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.160]   I know, but I worry because I got into filmmaking and I got into film history through laser
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:58.160]   disc and through DVD and things like that.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.160]   And I worry about the generation coming up who's never going to discover that sort of stuff.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:09.160]   Francis Ford Coppola's commentary on Godfather One is a graduate course in filmmaking.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.160]   It is with that it out.
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.160]   Scorsese's commentary on Taxi Driver is one of the best.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:17.160]   Roger Eber does a commentary on Citizen Kane, which is fantastic.
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:19.160]   Oh, I'd like to hear that.
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.160]   He also does one with Spike Lee on Do The Right Thing.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:25.160]   I mean, they're all these great commentary tracks where you learn so much about the film.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.160]   I had to do the right thing on laser disc, but it didn't have any commentary on it.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:32.160]   Yeah, the DVD from, I guess, 2001 did.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.160]   Now iTunes now has DVD extras.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.160]   They're crap.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   They are.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.160]   They're awful.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:39.160]   They're not.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:42.160]   There's like the one thing I want is the commentary.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.160]   Exactly.
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:46.160]   And the video equivalent of a free U2 album.
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.160]   Yeah, thank you, Apple.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.160]   Basically, yes.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:51.160]   They do feature ads for maybe some deleted scene.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.160]   Yeah, they're feature ads.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:55.720]   And the feature ads, what's not good about those is those are the ones that like you make,
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:00.760]   the studio makes to promote the film that they put on HBO in between movies and no one cares.
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.160]   So it's not even a real like documentary because there's some things like there's like this
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:09.240]   two hour JAWS documentary that was on the laser disc and then on the DVD and the Blu-ray,
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:10.240]   which is fantastic.
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.160]   If it was that quality, great.
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:13.160]   Awesome.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:14.160]   But it's not.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.160]   So like I don't want to see the studio, you know, I've heard.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.160]   I've heard studios say we don't do extras.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.760]   We don't do commentary because nobody wants to do them.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.760]   Like the directors don't want to go in there and do this.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:26.760]   They say there's a chore.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.760]   It's a chore.
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.160]   I think that's a chore they don't get paid for either, by the way.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.160]   Well, they usually don't.
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:33.160]   But there've been so many good ones.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.560]   Jeremy McGuire, Cameron Carl, of his commentary, is agreed.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:40.960]   But there was a great the whole cast got together and Tom Cruise and the director for
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:46.400]   virtually McGuire and that one was really good and actually so just the podcasts and
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:51.520]   put a thing that says start DVD now and then we can do it.
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:52.520]   I know.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:53.520]   I know.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:58.320]   I've been kind of joking and not really joking about the fact that I kind of want to get
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.080]   an underground group of people together to collect all the TV commentaries.
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:03.560]   Why is Kevin Smith doing this?
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:05.200]   He loves doing commentaries.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.200]   He does.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.200]   He does.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.600]   And I think he does actually as for some of his podcasts, he does some of those things.
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.800]   I know battles to article actica, a lot of the episodes there, they did the commentaries
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.240]   as podcasts and they released them on the DVDs.
[01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.400]   More directors need to do that.
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:19.400]   I don't know.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.120]   I feel like we lose so much when we get rid of some of these extras.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.080]   I'm not so concerned about the films that are out now.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.960]   I'm more concerned about when stuff goes out of prints and then you have, I don't want
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:32.560]   to lose copellas commentary on Godfather 1.
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.600]   I don't want to lose that time.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.000]   I don't want to lose some of this stuff when these things go out of print and the rights
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.920]   are gone and then they're just lost in the ether and we've got this historical moment
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.600]   which is so incredibly important and it's such a great educational resource and then
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:53.320]   it's gone just because technology moved forward and we didn't bother to bring over the extras.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.400]   All anybody cares anymore about his selfies.
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.920]   Well, and what they care about.
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.760]   What do they care about?
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.760]   What?
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:04.760]   What?
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:07.560]   Tell me, what do they care about?
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:08.560]   I'm going to never know.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:09.560]   I'll never know.
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.560]   This microphone out is the microphone.
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:14.200]   We will never know.
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:17.320]   This thing is trying to kill me.
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:19.040]   It's the ghost of Bob Marley.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.040]   Basically.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:23.640]   What do they care about, man?
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.560]   I'm just, I'm not going to move.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:28.840]   I'm going to sit here perfectly motionless.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:32.560]   No, what they care about is selling you data.
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:33.560]   Right.
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:37.680]   Well, the only reason they did commentary was to sell DVDs.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:40.080]   Was to fill the space on DPDs.
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:44.440]   And so what I thought was fascinating this week, what I thought about as soon as you
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:53.280]   started talking about DPD extras was AT&T is now doing a big promotional special where
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:58.960]   if you sign up for a new account, they'll double, if you sign up for the 15 gigabytes
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.560]   per month plan, they'll double it to 30 gigabytes.
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:04.880]   So twice as much data you'll never use.
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:09.800]   Only crap who would use 30 gigabytes of data per month.
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:14.440]   But if you are using that as your only source of data.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:17.920]   No, we'll charge you for that.
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:22.520]   And all of a sudden, I mean, they, you know, these guys aren't stupid.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:28.680]   Are they anticipating a world two years from now where my measly two gigabytes of data
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:34.200]   a month that I use suddenly becomes 20 and I have no choice but to pay for their high
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.200]   price plans.
[01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:41.680]   But the bottom line is that the, you know, the movie producers have always been the
[01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:43.680]   listines.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:49.200]   And you know, they do not care about the quality of the art.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:53.440]   They care about butts in the seats and tickets sold.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.880]   That's why we have podcasts for people who want to lose money.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:58.880]   Why we created them.
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:02.800]   Oh, we're going to look at that term sheet.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:08.600]   You said one lose money podcasting.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.200]   Hey, so much fun to have you guys on.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:15.160]   I'll tell you why I do these shows because I get to talk to people, smart people like
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.920]   a Ed and Christina and spend some time with them.
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:19.480]   I just love doing it every week.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:20.840]   And I thank you both for being here.
[01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:22.360]   Ed bot, what do you want to plug?
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:23.360]   Give me something.
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:25.200]   I got to get something to you.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:27.360]   Just don't buy these damn headphones.
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:28.360]   Never buy Marley headphones.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:29.360]   No, no, no, no.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:31.360]   They're actually really nice headphones.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.600]   They're made of wood.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:36.280]   I've been writing some really good stuff on Windows 10.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:37.280]   Yes, you have.
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.280]   Yes.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:44.440]   CDnet.com/blog/bot or just Google my name and CDnet and it'll all come up.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:47.080]   But they're much more stuff in the pipeline.
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:56.000]   Bot has two teas and the Ed bot report, zdnet.com/blog/bot is absolutely a must read if you want to keep
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:57.000]   up.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000]   I don't know.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000]   We didn't mention this, but I think it's interesting.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.080]   Microsoft actually, you can sign up.
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.960]   Anybody can sign up and get the Windows 10 right now.
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.120]   The technical preview.
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:09.120]   Should they do that?
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:10.800]   Is it how reliable is it?
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.440]   Does it short circuit your microphone and make your ears bleed?
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:17.680]   No, this is Windows 7 doing this to me.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.680]   Okay.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:19.680]   All right.
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.320]   No, so people can actually, Microsoft has a site where you can go and you can get it.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:26.320]   Right.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:31.600]   I would recommend this for anybody who, if you have successfully installed Windows on your
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:38.040]   own PC and you know how to do backup, you have satisfied the two requisites.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.600]   And is it version complete enough to do work with or is it just something to look at?
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.160]   No, no, no, no.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:47.560]   You can use it.
[01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:48.560]   It's a Windows.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.880]   It's very, very, very solid.
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:53.040]   I would call it Windows 8.2.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.040]   8.2.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:58.320]   You know, something like that.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:54:59.800]   It's very solid.
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:02.760]   Missing a few little things.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.640]   And if you sign up for it, the Insiders program, they call it, and you install it today, you
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:10.920]   will get the updates installed automatically.
[01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:12.600]   That's part of the deal.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.320]   So I should do this in my VM on OS X, for instance, be a good place to play with it a
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:18.320]   little bit.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:22.480]   One interesting thing about it is that this is finally a version of Windows post, Windows
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.440]   7, that works well in a VM.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:30.800]   The Windows 8 interface with the corners, you had to touch to make things happen.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:31.800]   It's got me crazy.
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.840]   Oh, it was nuts in a VM because getting your mouse, oh damn it, I went into the parent
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.240]   operating system here.
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:45.040]   So you click the start button and there's the start menu and everything's in a window
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.760]   and everything has a menu.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:52.440]   And so it's for somebody who's coming from Windows 7, it should be a very familiar experience.
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:56:00.280]   Ironically, for people who have adapted to Windows 8 and 8.1 and have learned the workflow
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:08.960]   and great all the shortcuts, it's going to feel like two steps forward and one step back.
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.600]   Christina, I see in the chat room, you installed this in a VM on OS X. It works great.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.600]   It does, it works great.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:17.440]   I did it in parallels and it's working excellent.
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:19.520]   And I also put it on a Surface Pro 2.
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:25.080]   So I was able to test it both on real hardware and then in a VM and it's great on a VM.
[01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:27.280]   Insider.windows.com.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.280]   It's free, right?
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:29.280]   You just join?
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:30.280]   It's free, yeah.
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:34.400]   And if you're doing it on a Mac, just here's what you need to do.
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.800]   Set your user agent for Windows for Internet Explorer and it'll let you download the ISO
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.600]   and then you can install it on your VM.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:45.040]   Otherwise, if it recognizes that you're not on a Windows machine, they won't let you
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.200]   download the ISO.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.640]   But if you change your user agent, that's all you got to do.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.000]   Yeah, I'm in an Explorer, yeah.
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.280]   That's it, version six.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.400]   Christina Warren is at Mashable.com.
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:01.760]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:02.760]   You do podcast galore.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:03.760]   What do you do?
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:09.640]   So I've got a podcast with my friend Brett Terpstra, TT Scott Fonz, what are called overtired.
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:14.080]   And so tune into that overtired on a 5x5.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:18.560]   It's just basically a random 80D nerd's just talking about nerd stuff.
[01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.800]   So it's just, there's no particular portfolio.
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:26.600]   No, we just, we have kind of a list of topics that we don't talk about each week and we
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:32.440]   just kind of go on tangents about things that are keeping us awake at night and that's
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.640]   basically it.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.640]   Overtired at 5x5.tv.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:39.160]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:43.640]   We do Twitter every Sunday, three o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:47.640]   That would be Pacific time, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC.
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.520]   Please tune in and watch live if you can.
[01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:50.920]   Chterum is always welcome.
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.160]   We have lots of fun.
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:56.080]   We didn't mention HP spinning off its PC business.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.080]   Who cares?
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:57:59.600]   I don't care.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.400]   Leo Leo Apothecare.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:02.400]   Do you care?
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:04.400]   Leo Apothecare.
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.400]   I wanted to do this.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.440]   Now they're doing it.
[01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:10.440]   What happened to Leo Apothecare?
[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.440]   He's been 10 billion.
[01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:18.360]   He spent 10 billion dollars on that company that they then have to write off $8 billion.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.360]   Was it Overture?
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:20.360]   What was that?
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.440]   It was sort of an A. I can't think of the name.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]   Them.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.440]   Yeah.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:28.440]   The one that there was like all the financial misgivings.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:31.600]   Hey, by the way, I'm an insider.
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:32.600]   Thank you, Ed.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:34.440]   But I am an insider now.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.160]   You're very welcome.

[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.040]   I might.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.840]   It has a very good article on installing Windows 10 if you want to know more.
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:46.360]   If you can't watch live, we do have on-demand audio and video available after the fact,

[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:01.000]   Windows Phone, iOS, and Android.
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.360]   And there's lots of other ways to get it.
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:03.440]   I'm sure you'll find a way.
