[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.700]   Joining us today, Mr. John C. Devorak.
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.260]   Hello.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.340]   And channel devorak.com.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.460]   Star of cranky geeks, no agenda, and many other fine
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.980]   internet podcasts.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.220]   We do our best to do our part.
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.700]   Used to be the world's most prolific computer columns.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700]   Now you have to do new media to make.
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.940]   So sad.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.380]   It is.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.380]   So speaking of new media, look who's here.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.260]   Sam Whitmore is here.
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260]   Haven't seen Sam in an age.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.060]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.860]   How are you?
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.740]   Sam and I worked at Tech TV, right?
[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.940]   Or no, was ZD we worked at?
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.620]   You were never at?
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.340]   Were you at Tech TV?
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.300]   No.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.620]   This was the site.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.780]   This was 1997.
[00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.140]   Oh my god.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.740]   MSNBC's the site.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.660]   That's right.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.140]   I have lots of reminiscence, but we won't
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.420]   bog the show down with them.
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.260]   But--
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.100]   I'm sure people would enjoy that.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.460]   So let that O'Brien, Devknoll, all that stuff.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.780]   Oh my god.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.500]   So you were a ZD guy.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.060]   I remember very well, Sam, sitting in an airplane with Sam.
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.980]   He said, I'm so bored with this tech stuff.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.420]   I'm going to go fly a plane.
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.580]   I no longer fly, but I did get an instrument rating.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.940]   I had 700 hours when I finally quit.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.700]   You burned out, and I can understand.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.100]   I mean, this stuff, you have to be obsessive.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.740]   It's night and day, an endless cycle.
[00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.020]   And if you're not just like crazy about it,
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.740]   I can see how easy to get burned out.
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.660]   What I learned was I loved media.
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.020]   And I still do it.
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.620]   In fact, I had to go start my own business in order
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.100]   to build exactly where my passion was.
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.460]   But I still love tech.
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.300]   And you couldn't avoid tech today, even if you wanted to,
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.580]   Leo.
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.620]   It's everywhere.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.220]   Especially in media.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.740]   Exactly.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.820]   In fact, I was interviewing the publisher of the Economist
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.020]   on Friday, and he was saying that he
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.620]   is a big fan of agile software development.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.940]   And in fact, his previous job was
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.220]   at IBM doing social media.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.540]   So here's the Economist, probably the stodgiest
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.940]   title of all time.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.340]   And the guy that publishes it is this agile software
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.540]   development freak who is trying all these new European
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.940]   rapid deployment app dev jobs.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.100]   It's fascinating.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.540]   It's really quite amazing.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.220]   And I tell you, you couldn't have picked a better time
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.100]   to say, I'm going to focus on media,
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.660]   because boy, has this stuff exploded.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.620]   One super quick anecdote before we get going.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.260]   When I was doing on air for the site in '97,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260]   I didn't have an idea.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.980]   And I said, Leo, I've got to do--
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.740]   with Soledad, I've got to do a segment.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.420]   What should I do?
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.700]   And you said, well, there's this audio format called MP3.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.940]   And I think it's going to be big.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.180]   And so what I did was a Pepsi Challenge sort of thing.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.140]   I took a CD of B52s, and I said to Soledad,
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.100]   OK, I'm going to play 15 seconds of Love Shack.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.820]   I'm going to play another 15 seconds of Love Shack.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.820]   And you have to determine which one is the digital copy
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.260]   and which one is the original CD.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.180]   And I took a chance that she couldn't tell.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.380]   And of course, on camera, she couldn't tell,
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.180]   so it was perfect.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.940]   So I give you this public thank you, Leo, for that.
[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.740]   I invented that.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.460]   MP3s, that was my idea.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.020]   I remember the way I found out about it.
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.060]   It was a kid, 15-year-old kid named Glenn--
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.020]   or maybe 16, Glenn Rubenstein, who I had known for years.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.500]   He was one of those little kid bloggers who did a gaming
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.100]   blog who went to college.
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.500]   And he told me he said, Leo, everybody is doing--
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   they're taking their CDs.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.100]   They're making MP3s out of them.
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.780]   They're putting them on central hard drives
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.180]   available on the college network.
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.780]   And that's what we listen to for music nowadays.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.980]   And I thought, well, that's an interesting transformation
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.940]   of the business, isn't it?
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.020]   And it was.
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.100]   It completely changed how music was performed and bought and sold.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.220]   Also here with us-- thank you.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.060]   It's good to have you, Sam.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.100]   Thank you for joining us today.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.740]   We really appreciate it.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.500]   Also here with us today is Nicole Lee from CNET.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.300]   She does the dialed-in podcast for CNET.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.620]   She's their expert on cell phones.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.820]   It's good to see you, Nicole.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.540]   It's you.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.340]   She came up just for Valentine's Day with her hubby.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.820]   And I enlisted her.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.300]   Yeah, I brought you some Chinese New Year.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.020]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   Gong Hei Fat Choi.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.620]   Yeah, it's Chinese.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.660]   You're the tiger, Johnny.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.660]   You're saying you say it right.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.140]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.180]   How do you say it?
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.540]   Gong Ho Fat Choi says Johnny.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.540]   And I'm go.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.700]   I'm go.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.580]   They did no agenda this morning.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.420]   Tell me why you butchered it?
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.180]   Well, because I believe we were working on the title
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.660]   for the show, and Adam had the right spelling, which
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.740]   is unpronounceable to me.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.620]   I said, no, everybody says Gong Ho Fat Choi.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.060]   Because I changed it so it now reads Gong Ho Fat Choi.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.580]   So it's almost an epithet.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.180]   Yeah, Gong Ho Fat Choi.
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.380]   But for SEO love, just specifically
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.660]   for software engine optimization purposes.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.420]   The only reason you do things nowadays.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.580]   Nowadays, it's all link bait to everybody.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.500]   Isn't that true?
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.420]   Just wasting your time.
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.380]   So the big story of the week, Apple, Macworld Expo,
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.020]   all the big announcements.
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.460]   Huge.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.500]   What are you laughing at, Nicole?
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500]   There was one thing in the house.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.500]   It took me half an hour, half an hour,
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.660]   to see everything at Macworld Expo.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.460]   That long?
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.700]   I mean, Apple leaves last year was Apple's last year,
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.260]   Macworld Expo.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.940]   Did you go, John?
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.460]   You were there.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.740]   I saw you there.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.820]   You bumped into me.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.940]   I bumped into you there.
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.340]   Stagger didn't you think?
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.660]   In fact, you gave me two shots of the ribs.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.540]   When you almost broke a rib, yeah.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.580]   I elbowed you like I checked you.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.060]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.180]   You were just roaming around this place like you own the place,
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.620]   and you gave me a rib shot because you were trying
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.700]   to get moving aside.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.540]   Out of the way!
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.100]   And then I said, hey, Theo.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.180]   I thought you were just one of the little people.
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.460]   So--
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.620]   Yeah, it was pretty small.
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:26.940]   And it wasn't that small.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.700]   It was hurt by-- well, it was very small.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.700]   Half the size of it was--
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.060]   Cap and Paris and--
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.020]   And I mean, the whole South Hall was closed off.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.380]   It was just in the North Hall.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.540]   That's where the Apple booth would have been.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.940]   But there were a lot of people, though.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.780]   There were a lot of people.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.780]   In fact, I talked to Paul Kent.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.900]   And he said, attendance on the first day
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.860]   was just a few hundred below the first day last year.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.540]   So that's good news.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.660]   That's good.
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.260]   However, I think part of it was in the shadow of the iPad
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.420]   because you can't say anything because we don't know
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.100]   anything about it.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.740]   But that's clearly--
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.540]   And the Apple had nothing to talk about.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.260]   There was a whole segment where they were doing a big speech
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.820]   in Room 132 where Mac--
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.820]   Macworld-- Jason's not Macworld did a thing.
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.900]   And it was like they just had a styrofoam mock up.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.860]   They don't even have--
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.380]   There's nothing to talk about.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.900]   It's pathetic.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.300]   It's so cool, my pet.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.980]   In fact, I even had-- it was to the point
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.660]   where I had some people saying, does Apple hate IDG?
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.140]   Does Apple hate Macworld Expo?
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:18.900]   Are they actually--
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.820]   I was going to ask them some millions and millions
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.580]   of dollars ago that--
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.740]   I think Apple cares about Macworld Expo.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.300]   I think they're a consumer company now.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.740]   They have the--
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.380]   I need the enthusiasts.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.740]   My point was that they were--
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.780]   they've got an Expo 24/7 at all these stores.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.980]   The New York Slice is obviously--
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.660]   Yeah, all the stores.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.060]   It's for--
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.260]   is essentially a Macworld Expo.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.940]   So it's just-- I don't see the point of this.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.180]   And by the way, this will be the last one, I'm sure, of it.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.380]   Because when they stopped going to the Boston show,
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.700]   Boom Boston was dead after one.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.180]   It took one extra show.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.860]   I think we've got this last one.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.140]   I don't know, but I hope not.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.540]   The friend went to Apple--
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.740]   the Apple store in San Francisco just a few blocks away.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.820]   And there was no signage.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.660]   There was no welcome.
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.060]   There was no nothing.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.220]   And there weren't a lot of people even from Macworld Expo.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.980]   The manager, the general manager of the store said, no.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.700]   We've seen zero bump in traffic this week.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.460]   Wow.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.500]   It's not.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.820]   But that doesn't mean it's bad for Apple, does it?
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.500]   I mean, isn't Apple--
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   Has an Apple tree sent you this?
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.100]   No, I think Apple's fine.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.300]   I don't think it's got any to do with Apple.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.620]   They've transferred it for the show.
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.340]   And somebody shows her dead anywhere.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.060]   And if we're all going to get to H1N1,
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.620]   drop dead in the streets, you know what they're proud.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.620]   Is that what it is?
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.540]   Sam, is it over for trade shows?
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:27.700]   Yes, it is.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.620]   Well, especially for Apple being so vertically integrated,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.460]   I mean, normally, a vendor would want application development
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.100]   to be done for their platform.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.420]   That's why CA has its show Oracle.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.980]   And also, they have big distribution networks,
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.860]   these big vendor-specific shows.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.780]   But Apple is its own distribution.
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.140]   It goes direct to customer.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.260]   It doesn't really have middlemen.
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.900]   And also, it now controls app development directly.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.700]   So there's really no need.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.420]   It is a consumer company.
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.140]   There's no need to cultivate relationships.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.060]   It's just not an ecosystem like it.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.620]   Like it was under-- what's his name?
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.780]   They're Emilio.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.780]   Emilio.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.740]   Clones.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.020]   When he had clones, and they had three or four different kinds
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.420]   of word processors, three or four different kinds
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.380]   of spreadsheets, it's all a close shot now.
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.940]   Apple has a developers conference.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.180]   They can get people to WWDC in June.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.820]   It's the only conference Apple does.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.340]   I think my position is Apple's become a consumer electronics,
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.300]   just as you said, a consumer electronics company.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.220]   So the geeks who go to Macworld, the 30,000 of them,
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.020]   are really the enthusiasts, the cult of Mac people.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.500]   And Apple no longer needs those.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.900]   So the other thing is what Mac was there.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.100]   I mean, this was about iPhones.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:41.580]   There was nothing.
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.660]   All iPhones I was like.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.740]   It has been for a long time the iPod iPhone accessory show.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.420]   For sure.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.580]   There was a whole--
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.060]   Oh, sorry.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.060]   Go ahead, Nicole.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.340]   I was going to say last year was MacBook Air.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.180]   Right.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.340]   Last year was MacBook Air.
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.020]   That was the showcase.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.140]   But we've moved on from that.
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.540]   And because there was no Apple and no iPad there,
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.500]   the vendors are kind of hungry.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.860]   There was a whole little section called--
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.180]   the Tiny Tiny Town, the Mobile App Town.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.660]   Right.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:07.740]   And that was probably--
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.700]   that was very busy, actually, all the little mobile app
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.380]   applications.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.900]   The problem is you make so little--
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.500]   most of you make so many little money on an iPhone app
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.700]   that you really can't justify a booth.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.180]   I know.
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.060]   In fact, I can't tell you how many people--
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.300]   The flashlight guys were there.
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.540]   Maybe they could all do a one booth.
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.100]   We should have a fart booth.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.220]   Just all the fart apps could have their own booth.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.620]   And maybe we could put that somewhere else outside.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.540]   Different country.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.540]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.660]   Now, Leo, I saw you had a session at a Mac world.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.420]   You were doing some presentations, I think, not maybe
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:41.940]   this year.
[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.420]   But--
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.380]   Oh, we've done it in the past.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.900]   We've done many, many presentations.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.740]   This year I did one event, which was the Mac World Live.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.060]   And it was really like a talk show.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.060]   We had Roger Maguenna, the bird, your friend, John.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.260]   I was hoping you'd be there, actually.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.100]   That was there.
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.860]   Oh, did you come by?
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.060]   I wanted to introduce you.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.420]   Do the Ed Sullivan thing.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.740]   And our audience today--
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.500]   And you'd stand up--
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.380]   No, the place was packed.
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.100]   I couldn't get in.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.460]   It actually was a sellout.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.380]   Roger McGwin, Adam Savage of the Mythbusters.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.180]   Heather Gold, my friend who's a comic and the rock band
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.780]   Warp 11.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.820]   It was just like a talk show.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.740]   It was fun.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.660]   But it had nothing to do with Apple or Macs.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.380]   In fact, I wore a black tie that
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.500]   had tuxed the penguin at the bottom of it.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.260]   And I said, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.220]   Wardrobe malfunction.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.900]   And then I said, it could have been worse.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.740]   And I pulled out a t-shirt that said, I'm a PC.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.100]   That was my model.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.220]   That was your bit.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.180]   That was your bit.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:30.860]   No, there was another--
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.900]   Now I'm glad I didn't get in.
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.260]   Yeah, you didn't miss a whole lot.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.260]   I also said, I feel uncomfortable up here.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.660]   When something's missing.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.780]   And the IATSI stage hands, because it's a union shop,
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.700]   brought my little rubber ball that I sit on.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700]   They brought that.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.860]   That got a good laugh.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.940]   And then I rolled it down the thing, and the guy took it.
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.980]   And I--
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.780]   No, because I said, I was joking.
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:51.620]   I said, I'll give it away.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.180]   And then he came up to me and said,
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.860]   would you sign your ball?
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.700]   He had deflated it.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.780]   He said, oh.
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.700]   Oh, he said, oh.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.900]   And I said, oh, I felt so bad.
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:00.860]   I felt so bad.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.300]   I said, can we have it back?
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.700]   Because I don't have another one.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.660]   And I kind of need it tomorrow.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.420]   And the guy, his face fell.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.380]   I felt so terrible.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.060]   He said, OK.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.100]   But I've DMed him on Twitter.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.740]   And I said, as soon as I get another ball,
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.700]   I'm deflating this.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:18.180]   I'm a sign.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.180]   And I'm going to send it to you.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.180]   So just give me your address.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:20.700]   You can have this ball.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.060]   I just needed it for today.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.820]   So you took the guy's balls away.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.620]   No, it's one.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.460]   He only had one.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.340]   It was blue.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.740]   Oh, God.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.980]   You know, with the last ball burst, right?
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.900]   Everyone saw that.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.300]   You were famous on the internet for a bottle.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:35.820]   It was my meme.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.380]   He was a viral video.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.500]   I got to be a keyboard cat for a bit.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.620]   You almost looked as though you hurt yourself.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.260]   No, but it could.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.860]   You know, you could.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.020]   Because when they burst, it's kind of scary.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020]   I've had it happen twice.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.340]   It's like suddenly nothing's there.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.980]   It's like, you know, when somebody pulls the chair out,
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.620]   you're literally just in the air and you're on the ground.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:52.780]   There's no like slow deflated.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.980]   But you're on the ground.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.260]   Well, it kind of went down for a little bit for about one second.
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:56.860]   I was.
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.780]   And then you went.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.260]   And then it went and went.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.060]   So you know what we did?
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.020]   In fact, we have them in the other room.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.940]   We cut the ball up into about 100 pieces.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.060]   And I could send anybody who wants
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.500]   a autographed piece of my ball.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.740]   What are you guys laughing at?
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.060]   Hey, listen, I'll tell you, go to the chat room right now.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.140]   It's full of LOLs.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.700]   We must be about 100 LOLs.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.900]   They all love the ball.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.780]   Yeah, they do.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:17.980]   It's the--
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.700]   They took my ball away.
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.380]   I can't tell how much mileage I get out of that.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.100]   It's ridiculous.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:22.980]   All right, let's face it.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.500]   This big story of the week was not Macworld Expo.
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.780]   It wasn't even close.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.620]   We're going to talk about-- actually, it was all Google,
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.140]   all week.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.420]   I mean, this was the week of Google.
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.940]   And we're going to talk about some of those big stories
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.340]   in just a bit.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.540]   But let's take a little break here and say hello
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.660]   to our friends from Citrix.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.980]   Hello, say hello to my little friend.
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.100]   Go to meeting, folks.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.100]   If you have ever had a conference called Drag On and On,
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.260]   kind of like this show, just you're playing Tetris.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.380]   You're playing Solitary.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.980]   You can't-- you're losing the audience.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.100]   Let me tell you what Go to Meeting can do for you.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.100]   It makes those boring old conference calls something
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.580]   visual, something that works.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.300]   You could show the PowerPoint.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.260]   You can collaborate on documents together.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.260]   You could do the training.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.220]   You know, it's-- you don't have to--
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.140]   I'll give you an example for training.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:08.940]   You set up a meeting.
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.700]   You go-- if I can do it right now for free, for 30 days,
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.820]   unlimited meetings.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.780]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.260]   You set it up.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.140]   It takes about a minute.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.500]   Before I'm done talking, you'll have an install.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.860]   It's very quick.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.580]   Now, the next time you want to work with somebody,
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.980]   let's say you want to do some training.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.820]   You've got the program on your system.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.780]   They don't-- they don't need it on their system.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.420]   You just say, go to GoToMeeting.com.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:28.300]   Go to this website.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.700]   Click Join a Meeting.
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.580]   You give them the meeting ID.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.620]   Now, suddenly, they're seeing your computer.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.740]   You say, OK, now you're in-- I'll show you how to use it.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.580]   Now, you try it.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.460]   You give them control.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.180]   And it's as if they're using your computer.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:40.900]   It's so easy.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.820]   They can take control and show you their computer.
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.220]   You can collaborate on documents together.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.820]   This is remote access done right specifically
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.380]   for meetings, unlimited meetings.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.220]   Never watch the clock.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.060]   You never count the meetings for $49 a month.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.180]   That includes phone and voice over IP conferencing.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.060]   It is such a deal.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.820]   And more and more businesses are using it.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.580]   We use it all the time, not just for meetings, but for shows.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.260]   It's a great way to show screens, for instance,
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.460]   on our video podcasts.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.260]   Give it a try free.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.660]   30 days, unlimited use.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.900]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.540]   Show the boss.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.380]   I think he'll like it.
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.500]   Or she will like it as well.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.060]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:25.660]   Before we talk about Google, somebody in the friend feed
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.340]   room is saying-- and I think it's a good point--
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.180]   that we should talk about Kevin Smith.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.620]   You know what happened with Kevin Smith?
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.460]   What happened?
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.180]   The fat guy.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.140]   The fat guy.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:38.660]   Yeah, he was refused a seat on a Southwest Airlines.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.740]   He doesn't look that fat to me.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.340]   Because he was fat?
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.820]   So here's the weird thing.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.420]   So Kevin Smith, who is the director, he--
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.700]   of course, he did clerks and silent Bob and Jay.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.700]   So he's doing it in Oakland is the bigger question.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.460]   No, he came up for a Mac world.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.420]   He gave a session at Mac world.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.460]   And I saw him at Mac world.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.220]   And he's a big guy.
[00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.180]   He's not like--
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:00.700]   He's not--
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.860]   I've seen bigger.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.460]   On planes.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:09.740]   So he flew up on Southwest, done with his thing yesterday.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.100]   He wants to fly back on Southwest, gets on the plane.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.780]   And he tweeted the whole thing, by the way.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.220]   If you go to Twitter.com/--
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.700]   Yeah, they're embarrassed to give him 100 bucks.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.660]   Yeah, they give him 100 bucks.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.300]   That, Kevin-- I think they're going to give him more than that.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.940]   Oh, because he tweeted about it.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.100]   Oh, my god.
[00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.420]   They tweeted about it.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.460]   So I mean, I like 100 tweets about it.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.380]   He said, I just got thrown off the airplane
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.780]   because the pilot said I'm a hazard because I'm so fat.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.140]   But the plane wasn't even full.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.420]   That's the worst part.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.380]   He had already put down the armrest.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.780]   So he wasn't overflowing.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.860]   The pilot just didn't like his movies.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.220]   Well, that's what Kevin's point is, look, I flew up.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.380]   They didn't throw me off.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.580]   They threw me off this plane.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:52.620]   And I got on the next flight Southwest and went home.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.060]   So we don't know what really happened.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.140]   And it could be that he was acting badly in other ways.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:57.900]   It could be that they said--
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.380]   Could be.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.420]   You know, we don't know.
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:00.580]   But we do know it from the tweets.
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.060]   And the point is not so much whether what they did was wrong or not.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.100]   But the point is that he tweeted.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.900]   What did he tweet?
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.340]   And--
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.020]   He said tweet.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.220]   Now, listen, as a former pilot, there's this thing called weight
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.540]   and balance.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.900]   And you do want to balance the load.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.940]   So for example, if he was sitting in the front where
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.060]   a lot of the luggage is located, maybe they could--
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.420]   Just 737 for God's sake.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.460]   I mean, how much have you-- you could be 100 pounds more
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.060]   than a normal person, right?
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.700]   It's not.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.020]   But couldn't they have-- I've had that.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.940]   I've gotten on a small-- on a commuter jet where they said,
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.740]   OK, we got to read back.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.300]   We move you around.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.260]   But you move you around.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.620]   And they look at me and they go, you, sir,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.180]   could you sit in the way back?
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.540]   So I'm used to this.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.540]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.780]   He's pretty heavy.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.100]   He said, I did not need a seat belt extension.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.380]   So he can't be that heavy.
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:53.820]   Can't be that heavy.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.220]   Yeah, it can be that big.
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.740]   They offered him $100 credit.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.820]   But I think really what it was, they didn't realize he was
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.940]   that Kevin Smith.
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.540]   And look at the power of Twitter.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.620]   In fact, ABC News called him and said,
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.220]   we'd like to do a story on this.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.020]   Well, he's like--
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.660]   He declined.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.300]   He said, you know what?
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.980]   I've done it on my podcast.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.180]   He does a podcast called Smodcast.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.540]   And he said, I'm going to do a podcast for Southwest tonight.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.820]   It will go up tonight, Sunday night.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.260]   And in fact, it should be upright about now.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.820]   And he said, that's all I have to say about it.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.780]   But boy, let me tell you, Southwest
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.060]   is jumping around trying to make this guy happy.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:34.940]   Yeah, they should be.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.700]   And by the way, anybody in the chat rooms,
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.220]   the official Southwest blog is called Nuts About Southwest.
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.340]   And that's a good place to express your concern.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.620]   Because they do invest a lot in that resource Southwest does.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.420]   Well, it is interesting.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.100]   It just shows you how--
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.260]   by the way, it's down.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.940]   Nuts About Southwest.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.540]   It's had so much server traffic.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.500]   I don't know if it's being DDoS, but it's been down all
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.700]   afternoon.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.340]   But they did do an apology, apparently.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.900]   And nobody could tell because I can't see it.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.700]   But apparently, they did do an apology on the blog.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.660]   A nightmare.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.100]   It's a PR nightmare.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.660]   And I guess the point I'm making
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.220]   is not that Kevin Smith was right or Southwest was wrong,
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.220]   but the power of social media to really cause a problem
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:18.900]   for a company.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.980]   He's got 1.6 million followers.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.740]   He's carrying a big stick.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.460]   Yeah, that's pretty-- that's a lot.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.860]   But in a way, couldn't that turn somebody into a bully?
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.100]   It could be a huge problem for companies because--
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.300]   Imagine Cali Canis getting a hold of that many people?
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.060]   I think he has almost that many people, wasn't he?
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.820]   Not that many.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:39.340]   Not that many people.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.340]   No way.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.260]   He never listed as a-- you just sign up for--
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.420]   Oh, you have to be the S-U-L.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.420]   Suggested.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.220]   So but I mean, it's very interesting how much power
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.740]   that gives, that confers on somebody.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.780]   And if somebody wanted to be a bully, and just--
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.980]   and you could even blackmail companies, you could say,
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.740]   hey, I want a better seat or I'm going to tweet it.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.100]   But you still need it in justice done to you.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.060]   And it also has to be an experience
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.660]   that many people themselves have gone through.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.700]   Like everyone flies.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.180]   So you can relate to that.
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.780]   Like how would you feel if you were kicked off the plane?
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.220]   Eric, take your bags and get the hell out.
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.060]   I got an email from an airline pilot.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.300]   He's a 767-7757 and 727 pilot.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.860]   I'll just call him Captain Paul.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.140]   He said, "I'm very disappointed in your encouraging tone
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.420]   concerning the Kevin Smith Southwest Airlines incident.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.980]   By law, the captain is responsible for the safety
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.540]   of his or her passengers, crew, and airplane.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.020]   If he or she feels for a millisecond that safety
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.860]   is compromised, here she must take action.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.740]   Leo, it's the law.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.500]   My source is inside Southwest, and this
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.460]   is maybe the story here.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.980]   Tell me that Mr. Smith was acting irrationally
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.620]   and was possibly impaired by alcohol,
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.300]   which would explain why he was allowed to take a later flight.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.860]   I wasn't there, so I won't speculate
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.660]   that this was the primary reason he was asked to leave.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.780]   The bottom line is that this captain was acting well
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.220]   within his authority to remove Mr. Smith.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.660]   The fact that Mr. Smith decided to out the captain's name
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.580]   in his tweets, which he did.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.220]   He mentioned the name we won't.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.660]   Further degrades the safety of not just his flight,
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.060]   but all flights.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.780]   The captain was doing his job, and now his name
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.740]   has been added to millions via Twitter and the mainstream
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.620]   media, and maybe he's going to be-- and other captains
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.860]   will be a little less likely I'm adding.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.580]   This part is editorial here--
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.020]   to call people on safety violations,
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.140]   especially if they have 1.6 million Twitter followers.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.500]   First I should-- when you check in,
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.900]   they have to ask you why you're a main Twitter.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.100]   How many followers do you have?
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:26.540]   Followers.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.020]   Yes, that's right.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.340]   If you're over a million, then they say, OK, we get--
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.300]   you put him in the front.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.940]   He says, and I can't say I disagree.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.980]   The sad fact is our society places
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.900]   such a high value on celebrities, which
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.380]   in turn gives them untold wealth and power,
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.140]   as this incident illustrates when power is abused,
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.100]   as it clearly was in this case, everybody loses.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.100]   I think they should have waterboarded him.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.020]   Well, but it does raise the issue of how much power--
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.700]   and can can a celebrity become a bully, especially
[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.500]   with his go directly to the audience?
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.940]   But you make a good point, Sam.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.420]   There has to be something that resonates.
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.900]   Yeah, I think that was the element here
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.100]   that people could relate to being humiliated.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.180]   It's humiliating enough to fly Southwest many times.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:10.620]   That's true.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:11.540]   That's the real story.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.780]   It's the cattle car airline.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.620]   I don't fly it anymore.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.300]   I happen to like it, but I live in Oakland.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.300]   It's a good hub for me.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.620]   It's a great airport to fly out of.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:21.900]   It is.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.220]   But it's easy.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.300]   There's no legroom in those planes,
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.940]   and it's not hub and spoke.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.020]   It's point to point.
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.860]   So it's a bus line.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.780]   It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase,
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.460]   do you know who I am?
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.020]   Do you know who I am?
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.220]   People often say you could get better treatment
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.580]   lea with the tech companies if we would say that.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:45.900]   But I don't-- I hate doing that.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.020]   Do you ever do that, John?
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.020]   I'd know.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:48.540]   No.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.380]   Only people-- I don't know.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.020]   It's embarrassing.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.580]   And if I--
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.020]   It's embarrassing.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.100]   And you'd rather let the situation get out of control
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.700]   anyway, because it gives you something to write about.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.940]   My point exactly.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.140]   I want them to mistreat me.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:57.700]   And believe how these--
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.940]   Please mistreat me so I can tweet about it.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.900]   Their morons.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.700]   You can't get any material if you push yourself.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.980]   So the big story, really big story of the week.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:12.460]   And I apologize for pausing moments
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.340]   with some other stories.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.660]   But this is really a huge story.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.620]   Google on Thursday, without warning, without any notice,
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.380]   did something that could really rock the social media world
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.420]   they announced and released at the same time,
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.780]   something called Google Buzz.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.940]   If you went to your Gmail account,
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.420]   you may still want to go to your Gmail account
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.740]   if you haven't seen it yet.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.180]   You'll get a big screen that says,
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.900]   hey, we got something new called Buzz.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.660]   You want to participate?
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.060]   And if you say yes--
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.460]   Well, it's actually interesting.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.420]   Google's already changed what happens if you say yes.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.100]   And the first few days, if you said yes, Google would set it up.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.700]   And they would look in your Gmail.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.780]   They would look at your Google profile if you had one.
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.140]   They would build a social graph, a list of all the people
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.700]   you knew and follow and so forth.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.700]   Pick the ones you were most likely to want to follow
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.860]   on a Twitter-like service and automatically subscribe.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.340]   But even worse, automatically subscribe you.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.220]   So I was subscribed immediately to, I think, 41 people.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.420]   Which is, by the way, a small part of my big social graph.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.820]   So I don't know how they ranked it.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.500]   But this is the worst part.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.300]   At that point, anybody can go to your Buzz profile
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.980]   and see who you're following.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.300]   And they get the full email address.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   They get the Gmail address.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.380]   It would have been a good time to score some interesting--
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.740]   So it immediately publishes and affects people's email
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.620]   addresses without their permission.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.620]   All right.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.620]   That was the big full part.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.380]   That was the big privacy.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.020]   I like it.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.900]   There were blog posts.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.140]   There was a blog post from a woman
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.220]   who had been stalked, victimized.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.460]   I believe raped.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:41.620]   And she said, look, I'm at risk here.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.820]   Google put my life in danger.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.740]   They did fix it, Leo.
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.060]   Well, that's what's-- yeah, that's the second half of the story
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.380]   is they responded very quickly.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.060]   Well, you know what?
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.820]   We talked to-- we had Yuri Engstrom and Kevin Marks,
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.420]   both former Googlers.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.860]   Yuri had worked on-- he invented Jiku.
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.340]   And so he worked kind of on a credit--
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.020]   Oh, so Google bought Jiku in that one.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.820]   Google bought Jiku.
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.620]   And he says it wasn't the Jiku code,
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.180]   but it's very similar to Jiku, which
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.820]   was a Twitter with threaded conversations and locations
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.260]   and so on.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.540]   And so he'd been using it for a year.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.180]   And he said, you know, the problem is,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.180]   we'd been using it for a year within Google.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.700]   Nobody at Google had this problem.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.140]   And everybody knows everybody's address.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.180]   So nobody even thought of it.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:19.860]   Interesting.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.380]   And so we just--
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.100]   --had a big happy family over there at Google.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:22.860]   We just put it out.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.780]   And immediately it was obvious there was a problem.
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.940]   And to their credit, within a day, Google fixed it.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.180]   Now when you join Buzz, it's safe to do so,
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.660]   because you'll see an opt-in list of the people.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.620]   And there's check boxes.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.620]   And there's very clear instructions
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.060]   on how to hide that information.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.860]   But does anybody think this is going to go anywhere?
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.540]   Buzz?
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.380]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.220]   What do you think?
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:40.820]   I don't know.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.540]   I haven't even looked at it.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:43.580]   Jason, your favorite.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.300]   Jason Calicanis said, immediately, on this day,
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.300]   Facebook lost one half of its book value.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.860]   He thinks it's that important.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.860]   No.
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.420]   That's--
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.540]   Jason being PT Barnum, that's what he does.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.980]   And he's got a lot of traffic.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.020]   But I think he looks really foolish right now.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.700]   There's no way that they could ever
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.420]   do that much damage to Facebook.
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.580]   Have you been on there, Leo?
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.140]   I mean, have you?
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:10.700]   Oh, I use it.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.180]   By the way, this just in, Kevin Smith is watching.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.380]   I'm sorry, Kevin, because he has tweeted--
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.740]   let me pull this up--
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.140]   ha ha ha.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.740]   Some pilot on Twit Live wrote in with insider info
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.740]   and phuring, "I might have been drunk."
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.020]   That's really, really funny.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.500]   Yeah, apparently someone in the chat room
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.460]   said that he doesn't drink.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.860]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.020]   So that is BS, that is bogus.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.620]   So the pilot is a stooge for Southwest.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.780]   Well, I don't know about that either.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.860]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.940]   Let's just say that I apologize, Kevin.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.100]   I just read that email, and I didn't know what the situation was,
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:42.940]   and I take it back.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.180]   And we don't-- as I said, the very beginning.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.060]   So he has a crawler out there looking for anyone
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.940]   mentioning his name.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.420]   Probably.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:50.780]   He's not--
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.260]   I would guess that Kevin's not listening.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:52.980]   He's just people.
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.700]   Kevin, if you're listening, I'm following you.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.740]   You can DM me with your Skype handle,
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:27:59.740]   and we'll get you on the show.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:00.420]   But I know that it's--
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:00.900]   That would be good.
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.980]   --smodcasts already covered it.
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.640]   So--
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.220]   Yeah, it'd be good.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:03.660]   Kevin's a show.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.460]   Look, I love Silent Bob.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:08.340]   I love Kevin, and Geeks love Kevin,
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.860]   and I think they're very well disposed towards him.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.700]   And I think that's one of the reasons the Twitter sphere picked
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.660]   this sucker up.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.420]   Well, I think that.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.940]   He's not that fat.
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.220]   And he's not that fat.
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.100]   That's the main thing.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.020]   You know, one time I was at the Alaska Airlines
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.700]   counter, I swear to God, it was the weirdest thing
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:25.860]   because this woman was actually trying
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.420]   to get a special seating for herself.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.740]   I actually, I shouldn't even tell this story because it's--
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.100]   Well, we're all-- you know, all of us Geeks are a little--
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.020]   No, no, we're talking about somebody
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.260]   who I swear to God from this shoulders up at the counter
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.460]   looked absolutely like-- maybe almost like a model thin.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.260]   And then she had just a weird body.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.940]   And so it'd be just a load of waste.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.740]   A little calipidges.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.180]   It was unbelievable.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.100]   Stadia had a pidgeous.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.820]   I've worked with that woman, actually.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.560]   I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.060]   All right, so let's move on real quickly
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.280]   because it's only getting worse.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.320]   Kevin, if you would like to call--
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.360]   We would love to have you on.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.360]   I know you're going to talk about it on the podcast
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.440]   that people can get the real story there, at least from Kevin.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.860]   And Southwest did apologize, but apparently their site is down.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.360]   That's just--
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.800]   I wonder why.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.920]   I think they made some enemies in the Geecosphere.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:15.840]   They totally do.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.960]   I like Buzz.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.120]   I think Buzz-- I'm not going to maybe go as far as Jason did
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.760]   to say that Buzz is a Facebook killer or a Twitter killer,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.920]   but I do think really is true.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.000]   And this is especially true if you look at the APIs
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.440]   and what is apparently Google's intent
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   is that this solves a problem I've had all along with Twitter
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.320]   and Facebook, which is that there are information silos.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.120]   You go to Twitter.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.640]   We're all pumping huge amounts of value into Twitter.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.520]   But that information Twitter holds on to.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.720]   In fact, you have to apply to them
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.960]   to get what we call the fire hose, the tweets.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.640]   And they only award it to some people.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.520]   They're very careful about who can get it.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.840]   Through the API, you're limited to only a certain number
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.800]   of calls an hour, so you can't see all the content in there.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.240]   They're really holding on to it.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Why?
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.480]   Because that's the value in Twitter, right?
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:07.960]   I don't know.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.040]   Yeah, that's the value.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.400]   So there's--
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.040]   That's just what's the value.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.360]   Well, how do you monetize Twitter?
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.920]   Somehow, it has to do with the content that we're pouring into it
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   is somehow in there in that equation.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.080]   In any event-- I don't know why.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.680]   I've asked them that question directly
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.520]   and have been told a variety of different things,
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.720]   including, no, we're going to open it up.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.160]   And that was over a year ago.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.360]   So what Google has done, essentially,
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.600]   has said, no, look, there's open standards here.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.080]   We're going to create an open platform.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.920]   We're going to encourage Facebook and Twitter
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.800]   and others to play to pump their data and us
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.200]   to let our data pump into them.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.440]   And then it won't matter.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.600]   You can go anywhere you want as a user.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.480]   You can participate in any social network you want.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.640]   Does anybody but me think that Google maybe seriously
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.040]   considered buying Twitter and then Twitter
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.520]   wanted too much money?
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.240]   So it's like Google originally wanted to buy a Friendster.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.520]   And they wouldn't sell it.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.320]   And so they started--
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.160]   Well, they have or quit.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.560]   Well, no, they started because they couldn't get Friendster.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.840]   So they did a make-by decision.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.720]   They said, well, hell, we'll just do it ourselves.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.880]   They created their own system.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.440]   And I think they're doing the same thing here
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.120]   to try to screw a Twitter.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:08.920]   Is that possible?
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.640]   Am I wrong?
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.080]   I don't know that they're that worried about Twitter.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.200]   Twitter hasn't made a dime yet.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.360]   No, but they wanted it.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.560]   It's something that Google could monetize
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.000]   because they could see the direction of tweets.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.760]   They could do a large analysis of huge numbers of people
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.200]   for marketing purposes.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   There's a lot of possibilities there.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.600]   I don't know.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.000]   I just feel like Google Buzz, as it stands right now,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.600]   it's so-- it's so new.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.320]   It's so nascent.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.800]   There's so many problems with it personally
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.880]   that the comments were one thing.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.320]   They're not collapsible.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.880]   So you keep on seeing this really long comment thread.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.080]   You can't collapse.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.120]   If you follow somebody like me or Jason or Robert Scoville,
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.520]   we take over your inbox because every time a comment's
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.080]   posted on one of our posts-- and of course ours
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.680]   get hundreds of comments-- they float back to the top.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.320]   Because the top means keep on seeing the same buzz
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.480]   post over and over again.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at this stream
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.200]   and I'm dominating it.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.280]   Just to observe.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.600]   Chatroom says that buzz will be big in Brazil.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.200]   As Orkut is, right?
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.400]   As Orkut is.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.360]   I read somewhere that if you press the M key, M is in mic,
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.720]   you can mute a particular dialogue.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.040]   So if a scoville is--
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.720]   Right.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.840]   Yeah, so that's a relief fail.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.080]   It's hard to unmute it though.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.240]   That's one issue, which is you can mute it.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.480]   In fact, there's even a dropdown that says mute this post.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.440]   I would just look for having a little plus minus thing
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   to collapse the comments.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.480]   Just avoiding the whole plot.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.760]   I think they're going to have all of that.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.920]   And I think this is the key.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.760]   If Google does commit to it and put as much energy into it,
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.000]   see, it could be a Jiku or a Kut.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.360]   Or if we could think dodgeball, we could think of hundreds
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.440]   of Google projects where they created it or bought it
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.800]   and just let it go shh-dah.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.560]   No, this is not always--
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.800]   But if they don't do that, if they put resources behind it,
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.280]   they've already responded immediately in this privacy thing.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.600]   If they respond that quickly to users,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.120]   and let's see if in the next week they
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.040]   put collapsible threads because I think it is the number one thing.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.560]   What is the thing they released it as a gold product?
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.240]   Google released something as a gold product.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.440]   I know.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.280]   I think they shouldn't have done that.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:06.640]   It's a beta.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.320]   I mean, Gmail was beta for years.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.640]   Google was beta for years.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.160]   And why was this not a beta?
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.240]   Why was this just gold?
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.560]   That's a good point.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.920]   There's some nice features, though.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.960]   I mean, for instance, on your iPhone or my Nexus 1 Google
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.800]   phone, it's got four-square-style locationing.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.200]   It's threaded comments.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.880]   I love so much more than Twitter's broadcast model.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.680]   There's real conversation going on here.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.680]   On the other hand--
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.040]   How much conversation does a person
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.960]   need in their life on a day-to-day basis?
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.640]   And to amplify that point, John, do we really need another place
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.080]   to check out?
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.320]   Yet another social--
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.160]   I don't.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.720]   That was the first reaction.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.680]   A friend of mine told her about it.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.760]   She said, one more spot to do?
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.680]   I don't have room for that.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.440]   There's Facebook.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.440]   There's Twitter.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.840]   There's-- I don't know, MySpace.
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.000]   Now, the thing is that they are bolting this.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.400]   I don't think we've made this clear yet.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.520]   Is they're bolting it onto Gmail.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.080]   It's not a destination unto itself.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.800]   And yes, Gmail has 30 million users.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.320]   But let's face it, we all know people that don't even use
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.000]   email.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.320]   They text, especially younger people.
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.240]   And so I think they're making a big mistake to tether it too
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:23.760]   tightly to Gmail, because they may be missing a large swath
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.080]   of people that might enjoy what they do.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.880]   You can-- if you're a Gmail user and you hate buzz,
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.440]   of course, you could say no upfront,
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.440]   or go down to the very bottom of the page.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:39.000]   And there's a little tiny turn off buzz thing.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.280]   You can control privacy a little bit.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.960]   It does encourage you very strongly
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.040]   to create a Google profile, because that's
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.480]   where it gets a social graph from.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.880]   If you don't create a Google profile,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.920]   you can't block people.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.280]   Right.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.400]   You have to create a profile.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.600]   You have to create a profile to block people.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.120]   We just like--
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.600]   So I guess some of the pushback on this
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.240]   is that Google's pushing us to do it their way.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.560]   I'm like joining.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.560]   I like it.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.640]   You know what I like everything?
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.840]   I mean, let's say it's reality.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.680]   I like it.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   I love it.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.360]   I love the conversation.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.840]   Leo, doesn't it?
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.400]   It looks like Unix.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.720]   It's alpha and numeric.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.040]   I mean, part of the elegance of Facebook
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.320]   is how it looks-- the fonts, the shadings.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.440]   And it's much more visual.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.840]   And it's prettier.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.040]   And also, it's a huge application platform, right?
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.440]   It's all those cool applications.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:28.920]   And--
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.840]   Well, that could be a problem as well as a plus.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.800]   I mean, the applications could take over Facebook as well.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.360]   I mean, it becomes the Farmville game.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.080]   Well, it hasn't slowed them down.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.560]   And then the other thing that Facebook hasn't really played out
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.720]   yet is the friend feed guys, right, that they bought.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.880]   They haven't really delivered the value yet.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.520]   They're still in the labs unless a mistake.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.000]   And have they really in your view?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.480]   I mean, they were bought in last summer, I think,
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.560]   July or August.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.000]   And they've had six to eight months,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.880]   and they haven't really iterated Facebook with all
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.880]   that many to many capability--
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:04.880]   No.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.880]   --that your friend feed has.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.280]   No, and I deeply love friend feed.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.880]   And one of the reasons I'm attracted to buzz
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.120]   is it looks like they were very influenced by friend feed.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.400]   And so while I'm afraid that friend feed,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.280]   I mean, it's the kind of red-headed stepchild now.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   Facebook is not going to be long for this world.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.760]   At least there's this buzz thing, which
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.640]   clearly is influenced by it.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   I'll be honest.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.800]   I think Facebook is as bad as AOL.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.720]   Facebook is the AOL of the decade.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.680]   It's a silo.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.520]   It's got huge privacy issues.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.480]   Every time you play a game or answer a quiz,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.400]   marketers are collecting not only information about you,
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.200]   but your entire social graph.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.880]   I have no problem with Facebook.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.960]   I'm not a member.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.680]   Well, that's why--
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.400]   That's why you don't have a problem.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.320]   There's somebody that has a Devorak page on Facebook, maybe
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.480]   too, that actually looks like it's something I might have done.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.920]   Well, there's another problem.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.280]   Yeah, well, that's another thing.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:03.440]   But it's not bothering me because it seems to be a fan or something.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.680]   No, Leo, go ahead, Nicole.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.720]   Well, I have to say that the only way Facebook was actually
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.480]   usable for me was I went into my privacy settings
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.080]   and I just tweaked it.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.280]   And I micromanaged it until I could separate my friends
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.360]   from my coworkers.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.560]   I had to go in there and micromanage my privacy settings.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.440]   But that was the only way it was like palatable for me.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.720]   I'm in Facebook a big time.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.240]   I have many Facebook pages and I use it
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.000]   and it's a promotional vehicle as well as a personal vehicle.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.560]   It's how I stay in touch with old girlfriends.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.000]   But I don't think that--
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.480]   You know, that's where the 5,000 limit really becomes a problem.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.280]   No, you're 5,000 girlfriends?
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.720]   No, you're more like 6,500.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   It's too much.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   You know, and I'll tell you those last 1,500 are just bitter.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.880]   It's just bitter about it.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.880]   It's like, I'm sorry.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.800]   What else are people saying in chat about certainly
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.480]   other people of players?
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.840]   It's a very polarizing technology.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.760]   There are people who love it.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.520]   Mostly it's those social media mavens like Calla Canis
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.080]   and Scoble who see another platform or me.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.000]   And then there's a lot of people who say exactly what
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.640]   we've all been saying, which is we don't need another one.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.160]   It's not very attractive.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.880]   We talked about it on this week in Google and Kevin Marks.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.880]   One of the things he said it needs and I agree with him
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.280]   is faces.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   You get it on the posts, you get the faces of the person
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.280]   who made the posts, but not of the commenters.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.840]   And that's a huge--
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.040]   Well, that's one of the things that the reason Orcutt, I think,
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.640]   took off in Brazil, which is the most of social of all cultures
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.400]   that I've ever visited.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.520]   And because it's all photos.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.080]   You want to see the person who's talking.
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.000]   Got lots and lots of photos.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.880]   And so it's like--
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.600]   Very visual.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.200]   You go through and you see somebody else's friends
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.400]   and you go, wow, who's that?
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.800]   It's actually quite entertaining.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.440]   I think we like-- humans like this kind of thing, don't we?
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.480]   We like photos.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.320]   We like photos.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.080]   Photos are easy.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.800]   Our monkey minds can grasp it.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.880]   We can sort them.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.320]   [YELLING]
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.440]   Speaking of Facebook, did you read this read/write web story
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.040]   about the Facebook like it?
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.200]   Let's talk about that in a second.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.680]   I think that was a huge story and very, very interesting.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.360]   I want you to explain it to me because I've been watched.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.560]   By the way, this is why I like stuff like Buzz.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.680]   It's why I like Twitter, too.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.520]   But I think Buzz is going to be more useful this way.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.600]   Is it surfaces what's going on?
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.080]   I feel like I stay connected by virtue of watching Twitter
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.520]   or watching Buzz and watching the conversation.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.240]   I can see what people-- I found out about Kevin Smith that way.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.040]   I find out what is the topic of discussion.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.320]   It's the internet's water cooler.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.760]   And I like these kinds of platforms.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.240]   However, we are going to talk a little bit about the Facebook
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.400]   read/write web story.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.760]   I think a very interesting story.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.840]   Before we do that, though, I want
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.760]   to mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.160]   This is a great engine, I would say,
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.320]   is probably the best word.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.760]   It's web hosting, yes.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.760]   It's hosting, but it's also software.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.160]   And that's the key on Squarespace.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.800]   It does both.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.120]   Very affordable.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.160]   Start at $8 a month.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:04.960]   But what do you get?
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.680]   You get an amazing platform behind what you're doing.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.720]   With things like an iPhone app that's just to die for.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   It's beautiful.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.120]   Best way to blog.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.080]   The ability to import and export content from WordPress,
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.040]   TypePad, Blogger.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.120]   So you're not trapped, but it's easy to get your blog moved in
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.000]   and moved out if you want some amazing statistics.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.240]   People love the templates.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.880]   It comes with-- I don't know, something like 15, 20
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.040]   templates to start.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.560]   But then they're so customizable that really every page
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.080]   looks unique.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.360]   In fact, you can find out by going to squarespace.com
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.880]   and clicking the examples link.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.360]   You'll see these squares.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.200]   You know when you go to a WordPress blog, you know it's
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:46.880]   a WordPress blog.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.160]   When you go to Drupal, you know it's Drupal.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.960]   They just look like Drupal or WordPress.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.360]   I guarantee you, you would not know if you go to say
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.040]   MatthewAnderson of photo.com and take a look at it.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.280]   Let me just load it up here.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.760]   This is a Squarespace blog.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.400]   Great directories.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:02.800]   Great.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.080]   Photographers love Squarespace.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.840]   And because Squarespace is using a very sophisticated form
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.160]   of virtual server technology based on Java,
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.720]   you never run out of bandwidth.
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.920]   Every Squarespace site pops up, is instantly usable.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.240]   You could be dug and slashed out of it and twitted all
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:21.920]   at the same time.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.120]   And you still can handle the traffic.
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.000]   They just turn on more bandwidth automatically.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.960]   Beautiful, beautiful websites, easy to run.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.520]   You could focus on the content and let Squarespace do
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.280]   the engineering.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.040]   Try it right now.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.840]   You can go to squarespace.com/twit
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.600]   and try it for free.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.640]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.720]   Just play with it.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:44.960]   And then if you decide to sign up, 10% off, if you use the coupon
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.920]   code TWIT, social integration, form building and data collection,
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.640]   the best way to post web or phone, squarespace.com/twit.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.600]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.120]   We're actually talking to them.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.800]   They moved into beautiful new offices in Manhattan.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.360]   And I'm thinking we might want to use their old offices for a
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.720]   TWIT East Coast studio.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.760]   Oh, you're expanding to--
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.720]   Whoa, East Coast.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.720]   Oh, you're expanding to--
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   Oh, East Coast.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   You know why?
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.240]   You got a bedroom in there?
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.080]   Someplace you can--
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.200]   Well, no, I can afford a hotel now.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.240]   No, no, I'm sure--
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.840]   For guests.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.200]   Oh, you want to go.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.120]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.080]   OK, you tell me--
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.240]   You tell me.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.080]   So we were thinking--
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.360]   In New York, is anybody here?
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:27.920]   I was thinking--
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.560]   --in the suite.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.560]   You could be somewhere that way.
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.760]   We could call it the Twit Club.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.360]   Yeah, you could be there.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.200]   Like the Yale Club or Harvard Club, the Twit Club.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.480]   For Twit alumni only.
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:35.840]   Right.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.400]   You can go and stay there, spend the night or a couple of days
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.800]   upstairs instead of having to spend the night
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.360]   in an expensive hotel.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:41.760]   OK.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.880]   And boom, you're done.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.640]   OK.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.560]   That's kind of what is here.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.600]   You know, we have a shower and a--
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.440]   Yeah, get a whole thing out there.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:46.440]   --off a tub.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.520]   We get a whole suite upstairs.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.200]   That's a good idea.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.640]   As long as somebody doesn't hog it,
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.680]   you just say, make a rule.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   You know, I spent two nights.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.160]   I can't imagine who would hog you--
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.480]   Who would that be that might hog it?
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.560]   So the idea is--
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.880]   Stretch the budget, man.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.840]   The idea is--
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.200]   John's been living there for six months.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.120]   Can we get him out?
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.520]   The idea is--
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:09.240]   The idea is we want to do a morning show.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.240]   There's no geek.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.200]   The zoo?
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:12.720]   But a--
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.240]   A zoo?
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.240]   Yeah, I got to tell you.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:15.920]   You want to be on it?
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.440]   You can be on it.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.280]   A zoo?
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   But it's a zoo for social media types and geeks
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   and stuff like that.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.440]   Because we are now on all these mobile platforms.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.200]   You can now go to your iPhone, go to live.tv and Safari,
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.440]   and you can start watching live.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:29.920]   Sure.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.640]   It looks great.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.520]   It works beautifully.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.040]   On the iPhone?
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.680]   On the iPhone.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.920]   We're working on other phones.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.840]   iPhone to analyze it right.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:35.840]   Is it Android?
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:36.680]   Android doesn't do it.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.520]   We're going to get that working.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.520]   So we're talking about--
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.880]   So the idea is you wake up--
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.640]   OK, you're in bed.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.280]   You're a geek.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.240]   Instead of the radio--
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:43.800]   You get up what?
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.280]   --or the today show.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.400]   You get up at noon.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   Well, that's-- I'll explain why we're on the East Coast.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.280]   So you set the alarm.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.160]   You wake up.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.560]   You're listening or watching, because we do both.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.320]   You get in the shower.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:54.880]   You get out of the shower.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.360]   You have breakfast.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.000]   You're still watching.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.880]   You're getting the subway.
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.440]   You're getting the car.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.840]   You still can listen and watch, because we're portable.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.640]   You get to the office.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.480]   You turn it on.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.720]   You can watch a morning show.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.520]   And the idea would be it's going to be the stuff that you care
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:05.720]   about.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   It's going to be the stuff you're into.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.280]   But the reason we have to do it on the East Coast
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.600]   is because if we wanted to start at 6 a.m.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.960]   and we wanted to air it nationally,
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.680]   we'd have to start at 3 a.m. here.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.600]   So we thought we'd have to be on the East Coast to do that.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.920]   What do you think?
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.120]   Trackdown David Lawrence.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.680]   David Lawrence would be good.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.040]   Do it.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   You know what?
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:24.520]   You know what?
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.000]   He said it's in that radio.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.200]   Yeah, I remember.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.880]   Didn't go so well.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.520]   But that's another matter.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.720]   That's why you should track him.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.520]   Maybe I should ask him what he did wrong.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.280]   I'm watching you on the iPhone as we speak.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.000]   Yeah, isn't that cool?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.880]   That's streaming HTTP streaming.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.440]   That's not flash.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:48.800]   Now, I think it was so good we should hear it twice, don't you?
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.640]   Such a good bit.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.400]   Turn it sideways.
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   You'll get the full experience.
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.160]   There you are.
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.160]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.200]   Let's talk about Read/Write Web.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.400]   OK, thank you.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.520]   OK, now Sam Whitmore has become the John C. Devorac at work.
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.080]   John's finally gone off the deep end.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.560]   So what happened to Cole with Read/Write Web?
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.760]   Let's check that.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.520]   OK, well, what apparently happened
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.760]   is that Facebook users are Googling for Facebook login,
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.000]   the phrase Facebook login, because how is it
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.600]   going to log in to Facebook?
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.040]   Clicking the first result, which is--
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.320]   Yeah, first of all, this is the problem with people.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.360]   In general.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.840]   They Google Facebook login.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.000]   They Google Facebook login.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.600]   Like what the hell?
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.880]   You go to Facebook, dude.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.480]   What are you talking about?
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.040]   OK.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.440]   Anyway, go ahead.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.840]   Well, a little pre-story was that apparently Facebook
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.240]   redesigned their login page.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:39.840]   Oh, they couldn't find the login.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.640]   They couldn't find the login.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.960]   Anyway, so they Google Facebook login.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.600]   Oh, this is because of the redesign.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.160]   I get it.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.120]   Anyway, so they clicked the first result, which
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:51.000]   was a story on Read/Write Web about Facebook login, assuming
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.560]   that the site itself is Facebook.
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.920]   Scrolling to the bottom to get the comments form.
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.200]   Still thinking they're on Facebook.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.560]   And then using the comment form to complain about how this
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.840]   Facebook looks horrible.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.840]   So Read/Write Web had to put up an announcement on their page
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.760]   that they said, "Dear visitors from Google, this site is
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.640]   not Facebook.
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.360]   This is a website called Read/Write Web that reports on news
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.160]   about Facebook you moron."
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.880]   That's your Facebook users.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.080]   And you can't however click here.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.680]   I should call you right, but you're well.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.200]   That's it.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.920]   I should call my mom.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.520]   Just see.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:32.360]   Hey, mom, do you know the difference
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.360]   between Read/Write Web and Facebook?
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:35.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.440]   That John's a good guy.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.360]   She loves you.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.600]   She would love it if I would--
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.560]   Did you say hi to him?
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.680]   She didn't ever get to say hi.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.520]   I talked to her this morning.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.680]   I wished her Happy Valentine's Day.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.240]   And she said, how is John?
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.520]   She's got a great mom.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.360]   I love my mom.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.680]   She is fantastic.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.880]   So is this just stupidity?
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.640]   Is this just an example of dumbness?
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   It's a--
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   It's a--
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.240]   It says, for future reference, type Facebook.com into your browser
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.360]   address bar or enter Facebook in the Google.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.120]   Sounds like the zoo already.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.240]   This is-- this is-- don't you think a morning show?
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.240]   I'm telling you.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   But this is--
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.000]   We just need some sound effects.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   And here I am.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   [GROANING]
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.960]   Leo, this underlines this big pitch battle right now that's
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.000]   going on in the publishing business about let's optimize
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.480]   everything and let's get as high up in the engines.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.920]   For example, people in the chat can do this now.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:35.560]   Go to Google and type in the word cheapskate.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.400]   OK.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:42.320]   The number one hit ought to be the CNET blog.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.480]   The cheapskate.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:44.560]   Called the cheapskate.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:45.560]   It is.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:50.520]   Now, the editor in chief of CNET showed me that late last week
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.960]   and said, this is amazing to us.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.640]   Cheapskate is a word that is commonly--
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.000]   It's an English language word.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.320]   There are 6 million hits for cheapskate.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.040]   And it's a tech blog that's number one.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.600]   So they're very smart people all over the world.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.920]   They're trying to optimize publishing results and get them up.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.200]   And you're going to see more of this--
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.040]   SEO, maybe.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.080]   SEO.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:16.560]   So if I type Twit into Google, the first result is--
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.440]   oh, me.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:18.720]   Right.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.960]   And Twit is a--
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.440]   But now that was a good choice, though,
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.120]   because it's not a really common English word,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.240]   cheapskate's pretty impressive.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.640]   So what are you saying, Sam, that this-- is that good?
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.280]   I'm saying that we will be three or four times a year.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.560]   You're always going to be able to talk about an example
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:40.360]   of a search result being skewed because a publisher had
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.760]   that number one spot.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   Right.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.120]   Right.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.600]   This is going to happen all the time,
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.120]   because the professionals now are gaming the system.
[00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.760]   And they're so good at it that confusion is just
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.440]   going to be part of the web experience,
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:56.120]   not for people that are tuned into this show,
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.920]   but for the bottom of the iceberg,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.280]   there'll be some confusion.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.240]   That's what happens to read, write, web.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.480]   Read, write, web came in very much higher
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.040]   than it ought to have for the search Facebook login,
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.640]   because they are apparently good at SEO.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.520]   Is it possible to be that good at SEO?
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.680]   They do some amazing things.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.040]   Some good news.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.480]   Those guys are super technical.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.960]   Well, like what do you do?
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:17.720]   Don't tell them.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.520]   Don't tell them.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.680]   He's already too big.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.520]   Because I haven't done I haven't done Diggly,
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.000]   and I'm still number one.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.480]   I know Leo, but you could probably--
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.280]   You know what I did?
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.480]   Before me, it would be number zero.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.560]   It would be higher.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.360]   You know what I did?
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.120]   I had a lot of people link to me.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.120]   That's all you do.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:34.960]   True.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.300]   Right?
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.400]   Isn't that what matters?
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.200]   Yeah, but also part of it is you have to link out.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.920]   You also have to link out to popular people
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.040]   on a regular basis too.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.080]   That's something that if you're not doing it,
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.800]   then that will advance your result.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.560]   Yeah, but he doesn't even answer his email.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.320]   No, wait a minute.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.640]   Every single show we do is--
[00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.920]   we have show notes that are rife with links
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.040]   to other media outlets.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.680]   And that's why you're so high.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.880]   That's one of the basic things that--
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.160]   Just the high SEO rating besides being high.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.080]   But let me just say that--
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.760]   and this is actually is a great segue.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.640]   Because on the radio show today, somebody called me
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.600]   and said, I want my site to do better.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.040]   And I said, whatever you do, don't hire an SEO guru.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.440]   Is that wrong?
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.600]   I thought this was snake oil.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.080]   Well, there's some oil at the bottom of the tank,
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.880]   but there are some basic things that--
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.520]   So what are the basic things?
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.520]   All the public short headlines.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:30.320]   And also, the scene that editor said,
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.120]   always take the name of the company
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.320]   and the product name right next to each other.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.240]   Jux deposed them.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.840]   Because that will give you a better result.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.000]   And shorter headlines are better.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.040]   Never write a nine word headline when a six word headline will do.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.440]   He didn't give me everything.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:53.880]   But I'll give you a New York Times, Wall Street Journal,
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.640]   all have training, not only at the copy desk
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.160]   and the headline writing desk, but also the reporters
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.880]   use words in their leads that are known to be attractive
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.720]   in a search result.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:06.880]   Linked bait.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.320]   By the way, these things are movable.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.400]   These are not these rules--
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:12.240]   The moving target.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.000]   The moving target is Google is constantly fighting off
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:15.800]   with anything they see it.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.000]   Well, that's what I was going to say.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.120]   The Google's job is to not let you game the system.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   Right.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.920]   The most important thing is good content.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.480]   Wordstream.com, I think, is a free utility
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.320]   that allows you to type in a word,
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:39.720]   and it will give you the 10 most common searches on that term.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.880]   Anybody can do this.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.280]   If you're a blogger, you get a website of your own,
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.160]   you should look into that.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.440]   I just search for--
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.560]   OK, that was a search on the site.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.000]   So enter a keyword and try it now.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.120]   So I'm going to enter in tech news, right?
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.520]   Because I would like to show up high in tech news, right?
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.200]   That would be my SEO.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.920]   That's not going to happen, since John.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.840]   And then this shows--
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.280]   Turn keywords into profits.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:07.200]   What am I getting here?
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.480]   That this graph, what is this telling me?
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:11.880]   So enter one key.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.480]   These are related phrases.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.160]   Yes.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.240]   So then the related phrases should be phrases
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.760]   that I should use in storey.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.720]   In your writing, yeah.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   In your writing or in your marketing copy.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.600]   It looks like bull crap to me, too.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.560]   This is bull crap.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.160]   So in other words, when I write about tech news,
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:29.600]   I should make sure that Jobs Group Company--
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.200]   This keyword is John Jobs.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.520]   Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, or Moer.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.160]   John, you think-- you would be getting so much more
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.200]   traction if you put the word tractor in every podcast.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.120]   I think it's got an implorel to tractors, Moers.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.680]   Sorry.
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.600]   That's a classic.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.520]   Oh, here's a good one.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.000]   Back ho.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.920]   If you just enter Devorak, you get Kordi, Novatny, Antonin,
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.320]   Orloff, and Smitana.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.640]   Yeah, this is nonsense.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:58.680]   What the hell?
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.600]   No, you should be happy, because after Devorak
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.280]   and Devorak keyboard and Antonin, Devorak, or Devorzak,
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.840]   you come in number four.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.640]   I'm also Ubuntu John Devorak.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.600]   And PC Magazine John Devorak.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.320]   And No Agenda Adam Curry John Devorak.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   Oh, wow.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.520]   Well--
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.880]   So you make an interesting point, Sam.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.760]   So is this good for--
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.640]   it's good for media that can spend the energy to figure this
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.840]   out, but it's really kind of bad for users, isn't it?
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.200]   Because their results are skewed.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.120]   It is.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:30.680]   In general, people in the publishing business
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:36.960]   are being accused of polluting the search results collectively.
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.480]   I don't know if you guys have ever talked about demand media
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.880]   or what Saul Hansel is doing now at seed.com.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.120]   Saul at the New York Times.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.680]   In fact, we've interviewed Saul many times
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.760]   that there was a very good reporter.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:47.160]   So what is it?
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.160]   What is he doing?
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.800]   Well, he's doing content farming.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.880]   In fact, for next month--
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.040]   Oh, this is creepy what he's doing.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:54.540]   Yes.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.800]   What's content farming?
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.360]   Let's go.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.480]   I was just talking to somebody who's working for him.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.800]   And it's reprehensible.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.960]   It's not real content.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.640]   Come on, let's--
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.640]   Oh, you know.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.000]   Oh.
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:04.840]   I got--
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:06.640]   Well, Sam, tell us what content farming is.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   Yeah, go for it.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:12.720]   Content farming is the practice of paying people peanuts
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:19.120]   to write about service journalism,
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.760]   how to change a tire in the rain, how to--
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   Yeah, I have a friend who is, for instance,
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.280]   an auto journalist.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.320]   She is a car reporter who does freelance.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:37.160]   She's been hired to edit the car section.
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.640]   But they pay people like bloggers five bucks
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.840]   to write an inane article that just has a lot of keywords
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.320]   in it.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.200]   Oh.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:45.760]   And links.
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.840]   And links.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.000]   And then she does this curation thing
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.600]   where she puts these all together.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.680]   And now, what are they selling?
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.520]   What is the-- are they putting ads on this?
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.120]   What happens?
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:56.600]   What is it?
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.640]   Yeah, I think they're ads on them.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.760]   Yeah, well, the bottom line is that when people go to a search
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:05.400]   engine, they want to be able to get valuable content, not
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.960]   just one or two links, but three or four pages
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.400]   of valuable editorial content.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:14.440]   And a lot of this quasi-adveratorial slap
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:18.560]   chop sort of stuff is getting optimized so high up
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:21.520]   in the search results that it's hard to be
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:24.200]   able to pull down high quality content--
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.680]   not today, but tomorrow, there's a lot of concern
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:29.280]   that there'll be so much drag in the search results.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.400]   Like an advertorial, essentially,
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.200]   that it'll be a very unsatisfying process
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.080]   to search for content.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.480]   By the way, Jason should talk about this
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.560]   because he's actually-- his mahalo practices.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:40.400]   It's all about SEO.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.600]   It's all about that.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.600]   About this stuff.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.120]   Although he provides good content.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:45.480]   He's not--
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.160]   Well, if you really want to go back to the originals,
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   I mean, about.com is the originator of this entire idea.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:55.560]   And then if you really want to take the idea further,
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:58.000]   Wikipedia, which is always ranked very highly,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.840]   even though they don't do it for the purposes of advertising,
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.640]   essentially does the same thing.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.280]   These are all just things that are--
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.720]   But that's what Google says.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:07.640]   They say you want to get hits.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.520]   Do good content.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.040]   That's what you're saying.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:13.480]   But the problem with these content farms is this business--
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.240]   I'm kind of disappointed in solving for doing this.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.400]   I guess he decided to go for the gold--
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.640]   is that they're polluting content
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:24.560]   with the purpose of generating hits for advertising reasons.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.520]   Now, I have to point out, this isn't the first time this happened.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.880]   I mean, Google had a big problem just a few years ago,
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:30.920]   where you'd search for something,
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.320]   you get all these link farms, right?
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.200]   They fixed it.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.360]   Yeah, they fixed all that.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.640]   I hated it at Parker sites.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.560]   But this is a middle ground, though.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.600]   It's not quite that as reprehensible.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:45.400]   But to Sol's credit, next month at South by Southwest,
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:49.480]   he has an objective to have every single session covered
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:53.520]   by one of his 20 buck reporters.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:00.120]   So he's trying to mix sort of swarm reporting along with this
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.160]   direct.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.480]   So now, that's interesting.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.720]   Is he really looking to put good content up,
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:10.480]   or is he looking to deflect criticism by having kind of something?
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:10.840]   No, no.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.880]   You'd have to ask him.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.720]   But the point is that I think what he's going to try to do
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:19.520]   is elevate the editorial quality within the content farm,
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:23.360]   which is to say he wants to be the tallest dwarf, or--
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.360]   What?
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:29.040]   --the least smelly skunk, or whatever metaphor you want.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.560]   The fact is that we really have to collectively watch
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.760]   that the search experience could become much less satisfying
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.440]   than it was in the past decade.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.320]   Well, you know who?
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.160]   It's bad for me, because if somebody's
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.440]   searching for a legitimate tech coverage,
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.800]   and they find these sites are bubbling up above me,
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.080]   it's very bad for anybody--
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.400]   But it's not happening.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   Not yet, but I think--
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.440]   It's not going to happen.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:52.960]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.080]   But the battleground will not be on editorial reputation.
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.880]   It will be on how--
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:58.880]   SEO.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:01.520]   How deftly you can push your results to the top.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.320]   I believe that this is just something
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.520]   that's just another--
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.240]   one of these--
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.320]   SEO business is a moving target.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.160]   And that's why you don't see big websites that
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.240]   reveal all the secrets.
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:16.600]   Because once the secrets are revealed that are trial and error
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.480]   secrets, then the Google just says, oh, let's fix that.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.600]   And that's the end of it.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.320]   Isn't it interesting, though, how the position Google is now
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.840]   in that we've kind of given them, which is it's up to them
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.320]   to save us?
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.960]   That's a little scary, isn't it?
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   You know the number one provider of video to YouTube?
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   Take a guess what it is.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.440]   CBS and BCS.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:43.360]   I don't know.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.160]   See, you're thinking like a media guy, and I am too.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:49.520]   But the number one provider of video to YouTube
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.040]   is Demand Media.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.320]   What is Demand Media?
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.200]   Demand Media is the number one provider
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:04.920]   of this advertorially cheap factory produced content.
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:06.360]   But they do have branded sites.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.440]   They have eHow.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.520]   Have you ever been to--
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.440]   Yeah, eHow's OK.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:09.760]   Yeah, eHow.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   They have eHow.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.280]   They have almost--
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.120]   --for real results.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.160]   They have Live Strong.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.680]   They're also going to come out with a branded site
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.960]   for gardening.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:21.560]   These are like-- you know, John remembers the Bill Ziff,
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.480]   passion verticals days, right?
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.280]   You'd come out with magazines that serve photography and--
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.720]   But these are phony, right?
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.800]   They're not-- this is the thing.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:30.320]   I'm passionate.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.320]   I'm passionate.
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.600]   I'm passionate about phony.
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.240]   But they're just really insipid.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.320]   There's like common sense.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:43.120]   There's no editorial horsepower behind it.
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.240]   It's service journalism.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:45.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.880]   Like John said, go to about.com.
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:48.640]   That sort of thing.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.480]   That's the model only at scale.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.320]   Well, then maybe I'm just being a snob.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.920]   So that's not real journalism.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:55.400]   Absolutely.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:57.000]   That's just some 20-buck blogger.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Yeah, 20-buck reporter.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.480]   20-buck reporter.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.400]   And so that's just the people's medium.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.320]   Well, it seems cynical to me.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   It seems like some wise guy said, yeah,
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.320]   that people use the tickets.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.680]   You know what?
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.720]   Leo, there's one point-- and we probably
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.560]   shouldn't spend a million hours on this.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.480]   But there's one point I left out, and that is that before they
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.760]   assign these articles, these bots that Search--
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.120]   that Demand Media has, for example, and AOL has,
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.320]   these bots go out and search the entirety of content
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.200]   on the internet, and they look at what is under-covered.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.440]   I'll give you an example.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.880]   Harley Davidson belt buckles.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:35.800]   What?
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.480]   Is a topic that very few people write about,
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.200]   but there's a lot of passion about it.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:40.960]   Sure there is.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.000]   And so the bot goes out and it tells us all, "Hancel, hey,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.320]   there's a supply and demand opportunity.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.800]   There's not enough supply to meet the demand for Harley
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.040]   Davidson belt buckles.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.360]   Let's create content about Harley Davidson belt buckles,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.880]   and then we'll sell AdWords off of it and add sense.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.440]   I guess I have no problem with that if the content is good,
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.880]   real content generated by enthusiasts.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.440]   That's for the media.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.760]   If it's generated by-- well, Media does this too.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.680]   No, my son was right.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.240]   Media invented this.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.560]   Let's face it.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.560]   Well, I know you're vice president of Media.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.640]   They could have done-- if they invented it,
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.480]   they could have gotten a little more credit.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.960]   They should have done a better job.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.120]   Guy in New York Times.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.360]   No, but I think that's-- it's OK if they do it
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.600]   and they bring an enthusiast if you find some real Harley
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.840]   belt buckle wizards, and they're really right about Harley
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.520]   belt buckles.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.720]   And it does, and then they--
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.520]   There's your people who care.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520]   I have no problem with that.
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.280]   I think over time, Google will take care of this issue
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:35.120]   and it'll be something else.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.080]   Help us Obi-Wan, Guinoubal.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.960]   So I'm on eHow.com right now.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.240]   And the top story is how to cope with Valentine's Day
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.160]   when you're single.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.520]   And there are four other stories called
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.320]   how to have a Valentine's Day.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.720]   Sounds like people magazine to me.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.160]   If you're single, how do they pay more?
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.640]   How to cope on Valentine's Day.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.400]   How to cope with being single on Valentine's Day.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.440]   They're all separate articles.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.800]   Apparently, there's a lot of demand for that.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   Yes, there is.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.760]   You know, it's funny because I actually have on my eye
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.800]   Google, I have an eHow box.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.280]   Oh.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.360]   How you have duped.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.000]   I've been duped.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.440]   I didn't realize that they--
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.680]   Well, maybe not.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.440]   Maybe it goes to WikiHow.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.000]   But I like that because let's see what's on my how-to of the day.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.080]   Five ways to enjoy being single.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.320]   I noticed that this.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.440]   Get a few extra curtain hooks, make a bracelet,
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.440]   and how to make a biscuit joint.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:19.760]   OK.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.720]   Now, Leo, that's not editorial, right?
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.800]   That's content.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.880]   But it's a service journalism play.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.680]   People care about these things.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.480]   Sure.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.160]   And they're getting great traffic.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.320]   And the search results for that stuff
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.320]   are going all the way up to page one.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.920]   Well, in that case, if it's genuine content--
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.520]   I don't care if it's a professional journalist,
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.320]   but if it's genuine content, I think
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.040]   this is the democratization of media, and it's a good thing.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.720]   If it's a cynical attempt to get advertising dollars
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.680]   by putting bogus content up there, then I'm not crazy about it.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.080]   But so which is it?
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.120]   Is he real content?
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:54.600]   It's real content.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.040]   It's my son.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.360]   When he was writing this stuff, he would tell me all these crazy things.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.840]   He researched and found out it.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.400]   He cared about it, and he wrote it well.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:03.360]   Did you know that deodorant's made with a combination of the idea
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.360]   of how you do a thing like deodorant, how the chemical analysis--
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.640]   Well, in fact, it sounds like there's
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.400]   going to be jobs for young people.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.920]   Not at these prices.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.920]   So how much was he getting?
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.800]   He was getting the same thing, 20 bucks or whatever.
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   That's kind of sad.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.960]   Well, he's an intern.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.000]   Now let me ask the question.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.320]   Because when you started out--
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.080]   By the way, you've never seen my son type.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.680]   He's got a hundred.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:30.800]   When you started out, and you were a copy boy in the early days
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.560]   of the newspapers--
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.160]   Yes, boss.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.200]   That's how you started out.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.640]   You didn't go to J School.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.320]   You started out.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.760]   Some guy, some curmudgeon, invited you over, said, kid, I think you're ready.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.080]   Write a headline.
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.520]   Right?
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.040]   Isn't that really how newspaper used to work?
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.840]   Well, maybe it wasn't my idea.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.600]   This is the road to riches that I took.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.840]   Copy.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.200]   All right.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.280]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.000]   There is another Google story.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.960]   Google, really.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:03.600]   I don't know if I love Google, but I love how they're thinking.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.000]   We'll talk about this in just a second.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.600]   You know who passed away just today?
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.600]   The great Dick Francis.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.200]   Did you ever read any Dick Francis novels?
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:11.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.760]   Those horse great horse great ideas.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   Oh, he was going to fast read.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.920]   He never believed in using adjectives, so he just blew you the story.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.480]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.080]   Yeah, they were quite good.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.520]   You're the one who taught me not to use adverbs,
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.680]   but he went even a little farther.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.400]   Nothing was hot or cold.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.840]   It was just.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.720]   Dick Francis passed away, but you can get so many great Dick Francis novels at audible.com.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.040]   And maybe in honor of Dick, we should mention a few of these great racing stories, high
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.560]   stakes, even money, second wind, dead heat, fast reads.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.440]   This is kind of, you know, sometimes people say, I'm a little afraid of getting into the
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   audiobook thing because, you know, it's going to be dull.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.160]   It's going to be boring.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:46.880]   It's going to.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.920]   I'm going to fall asleep.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.840]   No, it could be anything you want it to be.
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.680]   I mean, there is nonfiction.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.160]   There's history.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:58.240]   I listen to a lot of great history, a lot of science and technology, but also great thrillers
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.600]   and novels of all kinds.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.160]   And boy, something like Dick Francis is a great way to listen.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.520]   And just these things come alive.
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.440]   You'll be sorry when your commute's over.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.760]   If you're not yet an Audible subscriber, I can get you one free.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.160]   Go to, in fact, I can get you two free.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:17.680]   Go to audible.com/twit2, T-W-I-T, and the number two, that's the Audible Platinum account.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.360]   It's two books a month.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.480]   It's a subscription.
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.800]   You can even like candy.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:30.400]   I love it when I go to my Audible page, and I see the two credits because that means two
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:31.880]   more books I can add to my library.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:35.800]   You know, by the way, when you buy an Audible book and you get to keep it for life, your
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.280]   library is always available to you.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.080]   It's like a real bookstore, a real bookshelf.
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.920]   These books download in just a matter of minutes.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.040]   They play on most devices, including all the iPods, iPhones, Zindal and Koon.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.640]   I mean, Zoon and Kindle.
[01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.720]   Go to audible.com/twit2 and sign up today.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.280]   And then when you've got your two free books, go to the Free for Members page and you'll
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.960]   see a lot more that you can download, absolutely free.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:07.240]   Audible, a world of great listening awaits you at audible.com/twit2.
[01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.680]   We thank them so much for their support and we invite you to give them a try.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680]   Audible.com.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:15.800]   I know you already did the Go to Webinar spot.
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.120]   And I run Media Survey on Go to Webinar.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.120]   Go to meeting.
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.400]   Go to meeting too.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.480]   Because those are sort of like the ad hoc things and you can have.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.480]   Oh, they have their own webinar.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.480]   It's the same.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   Citrix though.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.480]   Oh, I didn't know they had to go to webinar.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   Honestly.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.480]   How many people can you have in there?
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.120]   Up to a thousand for Go to Webinar.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.120]   Wow.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.680]   So anyway, that's all they paid for, but I'm a very happy customer there.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:48.080]   If people wanted to do, if they're interested in your media stuff, they go to samwittmore.com
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080]   is that the place?
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.760]   I do have that alias over to Media Survey.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.920]   Our business is called Sam Whitmore's Media Survey.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.320]   And it's who are your customers?
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   There it is.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.040]   About two thirds are tech PR agencies.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.680]   But we have CA, we have Teradata, novel, we have some tech vendors too.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.560]   And we analyze tech editorial.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:15.360]   And in fact, as we were saying off camera, I did the iPad coverage analysis last month.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.760]   And I just had--
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.960]   I liked your conclusion.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:24.680]   Yeah, I had to conclude that Twit TV just kicked everybody's ass and I said so.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   And--
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.680]   Thank you for the link.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   It's really awesome.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680]   It's a great job.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.680]   You guys did a great job.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.280]   Gadget did a really good job of live logging.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.760]   Well, they were smart because they didn't use cover at live.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.080]   No, I came this close to using cover at live.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.080]   You crashed.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:42.400]   And everybody else, including Engadget, used cover at live and it died.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.240]   Was it seen it using cover at live?
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.240]   No, we did.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240]   OK.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.440]   But GD and GDGT did not.
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.920]   And I know I saw Ryan in there.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.520]   Ryan Block was typing away like crazy.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.280]   And everybody else was just stymied.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.200]   I think it wasn't Dwight from--
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.280]   Dwight Silverman was using it from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   He can do it.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.280]   Yeah, I felt bad.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.280]   That's too bad.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.200]   By the way, I didn't talk too much enough about the Mac Show.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.440]   And I will mention that if you go to the Devorakun sensor YouTube videos, I just posted my
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.560]   random walk video walking through the show.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.560]   So you did show--
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.680]   What would be the URL for that?
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680]   YouTube.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680]   No, no.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680]   Devorak.org.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:20.360]   I didn't put it on the blog yet.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.360]   Oh, it's only on YouTube.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.360]   So it's YouTube.com.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.360]   That's what you're getting.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.360]   Yeah, but it's YouTube.com/devorakuncensored.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.360]   Oh, I didn't even know.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.840]   So you don't necessarily always put it on the blog.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840]   No.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840]   Well, I'll put it on YouTube.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.320]   There's more there on YouTube all the time.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:37.320]   There's a lot of stuff.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:38.560]   There's stuff constant.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.040]   I got the tech hippie there on there.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.840]   But here's a random walk through the last-- so what do you do?
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.840]   You just take pictures.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.280]   I just take this little camera and walk around with it.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.760]   On video.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.880]   You know, we spent thousands and thousands of dollars and brought many--
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.000]   Yeah, you're just a buck in a $50.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:03.800]   This is really the truth, though, is that all these tools really allow you to cover
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   stuff.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.120]   I mean, did we learn anything from this?
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120]   Is there audio on it?
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   Yeah, there's audio here.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.880]   Oh, you put this is-- oh, so this is-- it's not you narrating it.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   No, I'm just walking through there.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   There's no editorial.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.400]   I try to catch people when they're having a conversation.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.400]   I'll stop and eavesdrop.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:19.160]   So it's as if you were there.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.720]   Yeah, this keeps people from having to go to the show.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.920]   You see what a miserable experience it is.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.080]   And the truth is, how many minutes is it?
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   Seven minutes.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.080]   Seven minutes, yeah.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.080]   You really saw everything.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.080]   Pretty much.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.080]   You didn't miss a thing.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.440]   No, it took me half an hour.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:35.440]   I couldn't believe it.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.240]   I went upstairs to the Sam of Artie room and had a cup of tea.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   It was like a--
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.240]   And your iPhone?
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.720]   So that note's going to be with you wherever you go.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.720]   This is great.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.720]   It is.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.720]   It's exactly like going there.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.720]   It is Merlin.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.720]   It's Merlin doing his Omni group thing.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   He's hoping anything up to anything.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.720]   This is terrific.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:50.720]   This is riveting television.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.880]   Yeah, and it was like the show.
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880]   The show's not that riveting.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880]   You have to--
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.480]   You can only be as good as the show you're covering, right?
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.800]   The way it is, it's-- the only reason people think these things are interesting is because
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:08.360]   the show-- the crew goes in, they shoot it, and then the guy goes and edits it so it's
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.280]   exciting when, in fact, mine's more believable.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.680]   CES was very vital, though.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.160]   I thought CES was a happen.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.920]   Yeah, you really liked it going there.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.520]   Because you were a big shot.
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   I was.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.520]   I was feted.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.680]   You had a whole crew of people down there.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.680]   But I say feted.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.680]   I don't mean F-E-T-I-D.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.960]   That's what it sounded like to me.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.120]   You were feted.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.760]   That's a homonym if I ever heard one.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.080]   And I'm like, not a solicitous one either.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.000]   So Google made an interesting announcement.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.440]   And I think in a way, this is kind of-- they're throwing down the gauntlet.
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:44.600]   They said they are going to pick several municipalities in the US, towns ranging in
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.040]   size from 50 to 500,000.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:51.920]   And they are going to become an internet service provider in those towns offering-- get ready
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.360]   for this-- gigabit internet access using fiber.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.960]   The best you can get right now may be 50 megabits.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:05.680]   So we're talking 20 times better than what the best you can get at any price.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.840]   And Google's point is this can be done.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:08.840]   The fiber exists.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.520]   Yeah, well, no, there's a bunch of dead fiber out there.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.520]   My new rallying cry is light the dark fiber.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.720]   I like the fist in the air.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.600]   I think that's really makes it work.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.880]   Light the dark fiber, baby.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   A rallying cry.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   You think?
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880]   Maybe we could make it a--
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   More cry.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880]   Light the dark fiber.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   It could be a T-shirt.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880]   Yeah, we'd make a good T-shirt.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.000]   And in the dot com boom, a lot of fiber was laid even before.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.920]   It was laid under the ground and never used.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:38.800]   We overbuilt the infrastructure as often happens in these tech booms or booms of any
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.800]   kind.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.800]   Remember the tulip boom.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   You remember that?
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.800]   Back when I was a kid.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.800]   Laid the infrastructure for the bulb network.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.800]   Yeah, the bulb.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:50.640]   No, I think that that's-- I was read somewhere.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.320]   Maybe I shouldn't read.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.360]   But I read somewhere that-- Or listened.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:12:00.200]   Maybe you told me that economic boom bus cycles did have a value because the boom created
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:05.720]   over building, over optimistic over building that later after the bust, the railroads
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:11.240]   of the classic example, the railroads joined the country.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.800]   All the railroad companies after that went bust, but we had the railroad.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   We had the teller.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.280]   Well, that's what we're seeing today.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.760]   If it wasn't for the dot com bust, we wouldn't have all this great stuff that we use now.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.760]   That's--
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.760]   Exactly.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.640]   There are some companies out there now that make usable products.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   Right.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   And actually stunned.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.480]   And there's all this gigabit or faster fiber under the ground.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.800]   Yeah, sitting there waiting.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.080]   So Google says they're going to offer fiber to the home.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.080]   I love this.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.280]   I just love the phrase fiber to the home trials.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.080]   Yeah, but where?
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.400]   At the astounding data speed of a gigabit a second, they'll sell this service they say
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.680]   at a competitive price.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   Well, here's the deal.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.680]   And it's just going to be ethernet.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680]   They'll have to.
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680]   I think that's how--
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.680]   I think that's how Verizon does it.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.280]   They do fiber to the curb and then ethernet in.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280]   Yeah, some of that.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.280]   But you have gigabit ethernet.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.280]   I use gigabit.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.280]   We use gigabit ethernet here.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.280]   And I'll tell you what.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   Let me tell you about gigabit.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.800]   It's almost hard drive speed.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.520]   You feel like you can copy files very quickly.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.520]   Yes, that's nice.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.920]   It will empower things like high def video.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.840]   It'll be huge for what we do.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.840]   It'll be huge for anybody who's using internet to deliver rich media.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.840]   It's--
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:15.840]   You know--
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840]   To where?
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.200]   Where and how much?
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.200]   OK.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.920]   It's just all talk.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:21.920]   No, it's not talk.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.920]   It is talk.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.920]   Give me an example.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.920]   I went now.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:26.400]   I went into my house.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.400]   Let's talk.
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.200]   Sam, would you talk him down right now?
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.200]   I read a story from the show here.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.200]   This is the company--
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   I'll tell you.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.760]   The company is looking for communities to work with across the country and is taking
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.560]   online nominations from citizens and government officials until March 26.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.560]   It's a little bit like a journalist.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560]   I'm being in Petaluma.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.560]   I'm lobbying my friends.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.560]   I'm lobbying.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:48.560]   I'm lobbying.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.560]   I'm slobbering on my friends.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.560]   I was just practicing for the zoo.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.560]   That'd be good.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.560]   You need-- can I give you a cowbell and you'll be sad?
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.560]   Ding ding ding.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.560]   This is a little zoo-y.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.560]   It is a little zoo-y.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.880]   I've been there a while.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.320]   If you go to google.com/appserv/fiberfi--
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   Google or--
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.320]   You're fine.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320]   Oh, God.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.160]   --Google Fiber for the community.
[01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:12.160]   Here he is.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160]   Here's Mr. Google talking.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.720]   He says, "Think big with gig."
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.720]   Hi.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.720]   I'm James Kelley.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.800]   I'm a product manager on Google's infrastructure team.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   Hello.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:23.760]   We're announcing our plans to build and test ultra high-speed broadband networks in the
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.760]   United States.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.760]   He doesn't sound like he's from around here.
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.080]   We plan to provide fiber to the home service with speeds up to one gigabit per second,
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.240]   up with at least 50,000 and potentially up to 500,000.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.240]   Oh, my God.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.240]   We saw that, Lee.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.080]   The selected locations will offer internet connections in her 100 times faster than
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.080]   the Americans in the United States.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:41.080]   It's not up to bearish.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.080]   I was so excited.
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.080]   I was so excited.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.080]   We're doing it.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080]   I just couldn't get to the camera fast enough.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080]   It fell out better.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.560]   I'm just so excited about this.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.400]   The only applications that will be impossible.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400]   It's like watching us train wreck in slow motion.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   I just want to try out that way.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   It's not like you just didn't hit the glass.
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.400]   You were probably broken.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.000]   Finally, we're going to open access networks, meaning we'll share our network with other
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.520]   service providers, giving users more choice.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.680]   So I think I'm going to lobby our local.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.040]   The wall will be the death of Lee.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.520]   Yes, you're weak on the chat room.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.480]   Your state count.
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:18.520]   That's the first time I've actually rolled off the ball.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520]   It was quite funny.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   I really went down hard.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.520]   But it was really okay.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.520]   Because it was in slow motion.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.640]   You didn't hit it that hard.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.640]   No, no, no.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.880]   I was in control the whole time.
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.920]   So I personally would like to lobby our city council.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.000]   I know a couple of members of our city council and say, look, you guys got to apply for this.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.640]   What better way to get reelected, John, than to be the city councilman or the mayor who
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.720]   got Google to bring gigabit internet to your community.
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.720]   In Petaluma?
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.320]   Oh, they're all going to be going, what the heck is gigabit?
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.320]   Oh, come on.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.320]   Petaluma.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.320]   No, no, no.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   This is telecom valley.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.640]   So you go there, there's a button to push.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.200]   Easy for government officials.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.920]   It's a big button.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.120]   And then you get involved request for information for residents and community groups or for
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120]   government response.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   I'm going to nominate my community.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:12.040]   And I can imagine that Google's received a few million people saying, yeah, I like
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040]   gigabit.
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.400]   Why is Google doing this?
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.400]   Simplicity, just what I know.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   You want to own everything?
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.400]   No.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.400]   Wrong.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400]   Sam?
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   Wrong.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.800]   That's a huge asset in YouTube.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.280]   Who has a huge what?
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:31.120]   Asset in YouTube and they can't, they see Netflix succeeding.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:37.120]   They want to be in the video world what Google is to search results.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.560]   So you're saying they're doing it for YouTube?
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.800]   They paid 1.6 billion and they see what's going on in Korea.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.000]   They see what's going on in Europe.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.560]   And they can't wait for the United States telcos to provide the level of bandwidth that
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:59.440]   Google itself needs to monetize the YouTube asset plus whatever else they're cooking.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.440]   3D.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:04.600]   I mean, people go see Avatar, but eventually we're going to be seeing that sort of thing
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.600]   in our homes eventually.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.440]   But yeah, you'll see it on 2050.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440]   You'll see it on Blu-ray.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.440]   The point is let's see it on the internet.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.080]   What's the, what's the, is you are Google.com/what?
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.240]   Oh, it's a really lousy URL.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.840]   You know, somebody out of tells Google about this thing called SEO.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.680]   That's for crying out loud.
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.000]   It's Google.com/abservs/fibrf.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:32.400]   No, there's two R's in there.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.160]   F-I-D-R-R-F-I.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160]   Yes.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   What's dumb?
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.160]   I'm telling you.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.040]   You said Google.com/a.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.920]   How about just, how about just like Google.com/fibr or Gigabit or get involved, learn more
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.960]   about the fiber optic trial?
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.680]   Yeah, I think this is, I'll tell you, there's the, there's also the, the, the merely the
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.680]   interpretation that Google is altruistic and Google's already said, I think this is
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:17:59.680]   true.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.680]   We make money.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.680]   The more use the internet, the more we make money.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.240]   That's all simple.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.560]   So we want you to use the internet more.
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.280]   How do we get used to the internet more?
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.280]   More bandwidth.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280]   Make it more appealing.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.040]   And I think it's very simple.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:15.080]   They want to put the screws to internet service providers in the United States.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.800]   They're artificially maintaining scarcity.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.800]   I've said this before.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:21.000]   John and I have this argument for a long time.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.480]   They're overcharging.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:26.000]   They're underperforming and Google's saying basically, we got the fiber.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.840]   Light it up.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.080]   That's my rallying cry.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.600]   Light the dark, frickin' fiber.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.600]   Is this like, is this?
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.600]   Cost money, Leo.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.240]   What's related to the Google's efforts to like what put Wi-Fi in some cities is related
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.840]   at all to that effort?
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.600]   Google, I'll have to go back and look at the Google blog.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:47.120]   But one of, one Google executive said and it wrote a very good piece and said, really,
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.560]   our business model is simple.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.680]   The more users the internet, the more money we make.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.680]   It's really simple.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:58.360]   So every, and if you, if you look at Google through those eyes, everything they do makes
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   sense.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.480]   They just want you to use the internet more, right?
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.480]   Does that make, doesn't that make sense?
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.800]   Damn, yeah, it's YouTube, but it's everything else.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:07.480]   That's true.
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.120]   I think that they have a political issue against the telcos.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:15.200]   I mean, they decided to end run them with the phone and I don't think they, I think
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.520]   they're political enemies and I don't think they want to, they want to tether their business
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:26.000]   trajectory, their multi-year revenue plan and be beholden to telcos.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   That's true as well.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   It's also, it could also be a preemptive strike against the whole net neutrality debate situation.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   Very good points.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   Good point.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   I mean, nobody likes the telcos.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.440]   Nobody likes the cable companies.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.480]   Even Comcast in an effort.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.720]   Yeah, I feel it all just formed to get the, your city nominated.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:43.720]   It's ridiculous.
[01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.720]   Well, if it were easy.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.120]   We have to link to supporting material.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:51.000]   You know, it's bolt, but this is crap.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   John wants it.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   Of course it wants.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   He doesn't want to do anything for it.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.280]   I don't, I don't have any web link to supporting material.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280]   Forget that.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.280]   Just tweet.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.280]   And tweet.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   Hey, it worked for Kevin Smith.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.280]   Come on, tweet.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.280]   Give me Gigabit.
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.280]   Google.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.280]   I'm going to take a chance and they're not going to look at anything and I'm going to
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.280]   send them to the FBI site.
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.040]   That'll work.
[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:14.320]   You just screw it for open.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320]   Let me tell you right now.
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.320]   This is it.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.280]   If Oakland doesn't get Gigabit, you'll know why.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:23.200]   Actually, I think Petalom has a good shot at it because this is the, was the second area
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.240]   that Comcast did there at Homestuff.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.720]   Did you notice Comcast renamed themselves by the way?
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.720]   What?
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.720]   They did?
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.720]   What would you know?
[01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:32.720]   This is the joke.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:33.720]   He's looking like it's a joke.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.240]   Oh, it should be a joke.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.440]   Comcast is no longer Comcast.
[01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:37.440]   It's Xfinity.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.440]   What?
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.040]   That means you're no longer Comcastic.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.880]   They're Xfinity.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.440]   It's.
[01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.920]   Comcast admitted that they are so hated.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.320]   Oh, look at Sam's video.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.920]   Oh, there it is.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:54.000]   Sam's got it.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.680]   Speed security convenience.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.160]   It's a new era of entertainment is about to begin.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.640]   Get ready boys and girls for Xfinity.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.800]   Oh, please.
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.240]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.760]   They're rebranding.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.760]   Is that the worst?
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:12.320]   And then here's right in the web page.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.800]   What is Xfinity?
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800]   Comcast.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.440]   Yes, tell me.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   It's Comcast.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.940]   Remember Comcast?
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.120]   We're better than Comcast.
[01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.560]   We're the new Comcast.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.160]   No, why?
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.160]   Why did they change it?
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:29.240]   I don't know if they're banning Comcast completely or if Xfinity is some sort of bizarre brand.
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.960]   I don't know if there's a brand.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.800]   They got too many ads out there to just all of a sudden change.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.840]   It's very confusing.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.160]   But I think this is the new Xfinity is the new.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.560]   I don't know.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.560]   See, there's fan cast.
[01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.560]   That's the Comcast web.
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:44.560]   What's Xfinity?
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.560]   I'm confused.
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560]   What's Xfinity?
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.560]   Well, let me click the link.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.560]   What is Xfinity?
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.080]   When you click that link, Xfinity is a massive selection of TV and movies you can watch.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.080]   This is a Hulu.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.040]   On TV, online and on demand.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.800]   It's, wait a minute, there's more.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.640]   It's also lightning fast internet access.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.640]   But there's more.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   It's Hulu.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.640]   It's Hulu for Comcast.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.640]   It's Hulu is exactly.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:09.720]   In fact, I'm a member of this.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:14.960]   If you have a Comcast email address, you can watch some percent of the shows that come
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.160]   in over your co-acts over the over the web.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160]   I love this.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.160]   This is the portal for that.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.160]   But they're also selling it for $80 a month, even if you're not a customer.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.160]   So what's Comcast?
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160]   I'm confused now.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.160]   They're replacing fancast.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.160]   Xfinity.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.040]   But fancast was a limited on demand system.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.640]   This is basically, you know, you get, I love Lucy and everything else.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.120]   This is like your TV on the internet.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.920]   If you have a Comcast account, you get this from me.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.600]   It's free if you have a Comcast account.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   Ah, great.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.600]   I like it.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:44.000]   You're not going to hear that often, folks.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.120]   You just, you know, enjoy it while you got it.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.120]   All right.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.120]   This has been so much fun.
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.200]   This is the morning zoo.
[01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.200]   I'm really enjoying it.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.280]   Tom Whitmore is @SamWittmore on Twitter.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.440]   He's also samwittmore.com.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.660]   And the Whitmore Media Services is something that everybody who subscribes or consumes
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:03.200]   tech content for business should know about.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.200]   That's right.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.680]   And we give a 30-day free trial, too.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.960]   There you go.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.040]   John C. Devorak is a channel devorak.com.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.360]   He does a lot of stuff.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.480]   Ah, but you can see it all there.
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.440]   It's all consolidated.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:22.120]   Word, by the way, is an apology from Southwest Airlines.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.560]   Should I do a dramatic reading?
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.560]   Yes, please.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.840]   Can you do it in German?
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.400]   It starts not so silent, Bob.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.440]   Oh, this is a little weird.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.440]   What's weird about it?
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.080]   Oh, I thought it was a...
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.080]   Okay.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080]   It says "Christy Day."
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.200]   I thought maybe that was some religious holiday, but I guess that's her name.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.960]   Many of you reached out to us via Twitter last night, and today regarding a situation,
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.440]   a customer, capital C, customer, Twittered about that occurred on a Southwest flight.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.840]   It is not our customer relations, method of customer relations to be so public on how
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.080]   we work.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.960]   First and foremost, Mr. Smith, we'd like to echo our tweets.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.320]   Again, offer our heartfelt apologies.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.560]   We're sincerely sorry.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.160]   As soon as we saw the first tweet from Mr. Smith, we contacted him personally to apologize
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.080]   for his experience and address his concerns on both Twitter and with a personal phone
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.160]   call.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.880]   And so they explained what happened.
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.880]   He originally purchased two Southwest seats in a flight from Oakland at Burbank as he's
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.920]   been known to do when traveling on Southwest, but he wanted to get on an earlier flight.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:34.360]   He flew standby, and when he got on, there was only one seat.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.360]   Apparently Smith normally buys two seats.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.240]   Our pilots are responsible for the safety and comfort of all customers in the aircraft,
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:45.880]   therefore made the determination that Mr. Smith needed more than one seat to complete
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.160]   his flight.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:50.720]   Our employees explained why the decision was made accommodated Mr. Smith on a later flight
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.280]   and issued him a travel voucher for $100.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.280]   That sounds reasonable.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.280]   Well, I don't know.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.600]   Let's find out from Mr. Smith.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.120]   You've read about these situations before Southwest instituted our customer of size policy
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.520]   more than 25 years ago.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.360]   Requires customers that can't fit safely and comfortable in one seat to person.
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.360]   That's reasonable.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.280]   You don't want to be next to somebody who takes more than one seat if he's only got
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280]   one seat.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280]   Yeah, no, that's true.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.440]   I've seen it.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:19.720]   But what I've been convinced over the last few years that we should be charging people
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.320]   on any airline by the pound.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:27.360]   I think a person that is 100 pounds should not pay as much as a person as 250 pounds.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.360]   What if they're just tall?
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.360]   I think it's tall.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.600]   No, it's a weight because their plans are always, just Japanese airlines don't want to
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.280]   give you this idea because they said they're going to make people take a crap before the
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   flight.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.000]   It's a fact.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.120]   It would save us a million dollars a year and so it's a morning zoo.
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:47.120]   So as a matter of fact, I'm sorry, they can't do that.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.120]   What are they going to say?
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.120]   You go there.
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.120]   You have to.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   You can't do that.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120]   What are they going to monitor it?
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120]   You know crappy.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:57.240]   They could do that because isn't it true in Japan that they have toilets that say thank
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.240]   you when you.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.400]   Maybe they give you a ticket or receipt.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.400]   I don't know.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.400]   I think they weigh it.
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.440]   Sometimes they could make you just charge you by the pound.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.600]   They would have to make you take a crap because you just pay more.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.080]   John C. DeVorex available at channeldevorex.com.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.680]   Nicole Lee covers cell phones for CNET.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:26.680]   You can find her on CNET.com/diled-in-podcast.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:27.680]   Is that right?
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.680]   You can also go to just dialed in.cNET.com.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.160]   That's probably better.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.160]   dialed in.cNET.com.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.240]   It's so nice to see you.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.240]   Happy Valentine's Day.
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.240]   Thanks for being here.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.400]   And Gong Hei fat, Troy.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   Yes.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.200]   Thanks to everybody who joined us today.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.880]   You can watch live at live.twit.tv.
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.120]   We do this show at 6 p.m. Eastern, 3 p.m. Pacific time every Sunday.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.160]   You can watch the live.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:53.960]   We do really about eight hours and then we edit it down to a mere hour and a half.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.200]   You're really missing a lot of the best stuff.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.200]   There's a lot of jokes in between.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   A lot of jokes.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:58.200]   A lot of the jokes.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   People falling off balls.
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.200]   Just crap jokes.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.600]   It would have been a classic if you had the camera on yourself.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.600]   They would be great.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.600]   They would be great.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.000]   I was reaching for the switchers.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000]   I went back and I couldn't go.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   You've got to do it again if you're not careful.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   I'm going to go to quiet now.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   Careful.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   Careful.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.760]   You can also watch us now on the iPhone using Safari.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.040]   We've got live streaming on the iPhone.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.040]   Go to twit.tv.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.440]   Actually, live.twit.tv on the iPhone.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:22.440]   It just works.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:26.200]   I know Android folks and Blackberry and Palm people are saying, "Why not us?"
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.640]   It has to do with, they have the technical capability.
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.680]   But for some reason, the browsers don't know how to handle it.
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.400]   They just go, "What am I supposed to do with this link?"
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.240]   It's something that they're going to have to help us with.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:40.640]   Thanks to you, Stream, for making that possible.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.640]   Anything else I want to say?
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.400]   Yes, go to twit.tv for all our shows.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.200]   I've got a lot of good ones.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.960]   Is there anything else I need to say?
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.040]   I guess I'll just say, "Thanks for joining us."
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.840]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:28:14.240]   I'm going to do it.
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.820]   (upbeat music)
