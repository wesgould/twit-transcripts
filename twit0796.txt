[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:53.160]   It's time for TWIT. This week in Tech, the show we cover the Wakes Tech news with a
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.840]   fine bunch of tech journalists from the information. She's a reporter there. Paris
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.360]   Martin, oh we've known her for years. It's so great to see you Paris.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.600]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.560]   Love to have you on. Same with you, Devinda Hardawar. He is a senior editor at the fabulous
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.480]   Engadget. We're going to push the button. There he is. Oh, you're at work today. No.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400]   No, I mean home office. I'm slowly building out a home office in my basement. So it looks
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.080]   like work. It is happening. Is that good or bad? I don't know. But I'm very productive
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.760]   down here. So I like it.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.200]   Devinda was pressing enough to move to Georgia. Just to know. We need the votes. We need the
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:45.260]   votes. Two more votes. They're coming in. Also joining us from Massachusetts, Mr. Dan
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.280]   Morrin of six colors.com and the great clockwise podcast. Hello, Dan. Good to see you.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.040]   Hi, Leo. Let's see you too.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.760]   Welcome to the show. A couple of things to mention. I think the election is mostly over.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.840]   We've stolen all the votes we can and don't tell them.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.240]   You're going to make them so angry. Don't tell them. It's a secret. And so that's good
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.080]   news. We can, you know, take, we can breathe again. And then there's some sad news after
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.960]   80, 36 years as host of Jeopardy, Alex Trebek passed away today at the age of 80 years.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.160]   You know, he had cancer announced it on the show, continue to do the show. I understand
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.600]   there are new Jeopardyies going through Christmas. And then I don't know what they'll do. They'll
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.560]   have to do reruns, I guess. I think from now on, we're going to answer all questions.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.840]   All answers will come in the form of questions on this show in honor of Alex Trebek. So we
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.520]   miss them. I was talking to our photography guy who lives in Germany. Chris Markwart,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.720]   he said, Oh, yeah, I heard about Alex Trebek. I said, did you watch Jeopardyies? No, we
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.000]   don't get in Germany, but everybody knows Alex Trebek all over the world. He said,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.720]   he's an institution. Yeah, institution is it at the chaos computer club when they're
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.880]   arranging the chairs to make more room, getting everybody to, you know, defrag the room. Everybody
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.240]   does the Jeopardy theme. So I guess, yeah, it's kind of universal. That's in Berlin.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.760]   That's kind of universal. So Dan, you're going to be busy. We're all going to be a little
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.600]   bit busy on Tuesday. Apple is having its one more thing event. Oh boy. Just one.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   Just one third event in the fall. It's cannot leave a guy.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.280]   Got that many in. Apple's going on longer than the 2020 presidential election. This is an endless
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:46.920]   supply of Apple news. It's expected, especially because the AR invite had an Apple going up like
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.000]   a laptop lid that they will be announcing laptops almost certainly based on Apple silicon, right?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.960]   Yeah, I mean, that seems to be the big thing that's left for them to talk about this fall.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.160]   They've already revamped the iPhones, the iPads, the HomePod, pretty much everything. So the
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.120]   Mac is about the only thing left in their lineup. And the Apple Silicon rumors have been running
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.520]   pretty fast and furious for a while now. And, you know, it's, there's a certain logic to it.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.160]   Obviously they switched to Intel 15 years ago. And they, you know, have been increasingly moving
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.640]   more and more of their critical infrastructure under their own roof. So since they're building
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   all these great processors for iOS devices, it seems only logical that they'd want to bring
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.280]   them over to the Mac as well. I mean, it seems like the potential for huge gains is really significant.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.000]   So I'm excited to see this. I've been waiting for this for a long time. And I think we're going to be
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.160]   pretty blown away by what they have to offer. In a way, this seems like a new era, the end of an
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.160]   era with Apple Intel. But Intel itself has been struggling not just on the Apple platform, even
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:58.680]   Microsoft's looking at ARM and certainly data centers are looking to ARM and, you know,
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.080]   Nvidia for their processors. You have to wonder if this is the beginning of the end for Intel.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.320]   I think they could dig stuff out. I mean, I would never bet against them because they are so big
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:18.280]   and they have such a deep bench. But they definitely, their miss in terms of mobile was a really big
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.800]   deal, right? They never really competed in mobile platforms. And they were sort of bound to the
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.520]   desktops and laptops. And I think that has done a lot of damage to them. And they've tried to
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.280]   dig themselves out of that hole. And they have not had a lot of success with it. So as the sort of
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.000]   influence of the desktop and laptop computer starts to wane a bit and people are more and more using
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.520]   tablets and smartphones to do everything in their lives, Intel and to a lesser extent AMD have both,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.520]   you know, suffered, I think, as a result of that.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.720]   Intel must definitely. It certainly has. It's a big company and probably has a lot of patents
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:01.480]   and intellectual property. But they're also saddled with $10 billion chip fabs that are becoming less
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.640]   and less valuable by the minute. I have to wonder that's Ben Thompson's contention. He said this
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.280]   two years ago, Intel's big mistake was both designing the chips and making them. That's
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.280]   exactly what arm does not do. And that they got locked into their platform because they built
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.240]   so many fabs, so many giant fabs. And then it turned out their platform couldn't deliver.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:30.920]   First with a titanium, the new I a 64 platform, which they abandoned. And then finally, they
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.200]   couldn't get down to the 10 nanometer process. Meanwhile, Apple's chips are five nanometers.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.480]   Hard to argue there. And especially because Apple has really pushed the envelope in terms of what
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:52.200]   they're doing with their silicon on iOS side that I think that they were always frustrated
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.600]   in Cupertino for dealing with the fact that they had to be locked into Intel schedule, right? And
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.360]   like Intel would come out with new chips on their very specific roadmap. And Apple always felt a
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.960]   little bit like it was straining at the bit there and trying to push their computers faster or
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:14.440]   forward. And the problem was that they just couldn't, they had to wait for Intel and being bound to
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.560]   any other company for Apple, especially for something that's that important. It just, I think
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.160]   it drives them crazy inside. And like, I think that's a long standing philosophy coming from those
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.160]   days when they were really teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and being essentially dissolved as
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.480]   a company was the fact that they had to be beholden to some other company in order to produce their
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.840]   devices. So I think they've kind of, if you look at their trend line over the last 20 years,
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.920]   it's all about bringing more and more stuff in house and doing more and more stuff,
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.680]   designing, building everything from the ground up as much as possible under their own control,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.640]   because frankly, their control freaks. Right. None of you are old enough to remember,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:04.280]   but I remember very well the same exact problem, the same tensions between Intel and Microsoft.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:11.560]   Remember interviewing Andy Grove 20 some years ago, the CEO at the time of Intel, who was just
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.920]   bitching and moaning about Bill Gates and Microsoft saying, you know, here we are, we're making these
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:24.040]   32-bit chips and these stupid windows is still 16-bit. There is something to be, I mean, there's
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.880]   plus is a minus, but there is something to said for making both the hardware and the software.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.280]   That's what Steve Jobs always said. Actually, it goes back to Alan Kay, who said, you know, you really
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   want to make a great computer, you need to make both, you have to have, you have to own both sides
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:43.000]   of the equation. Unfortunately, or fortunately for Intel anyway, Microsoft couldn't break up with
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.120]   Intel. Microsoft wasn't in a position to say, okay, all you PC makers stop using Intel, they didn't
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.600]   make the hardware, they just met the operating system. So there was this natural tension that
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:58.280]   never did get resolved. And now, you know, it's maybe too late for Intel.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.280]   Well, well, good, you bring it up now, because almost seems like a Microsoft and Intel
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.040]   combo would be really interesting down the line. But to what you guys are saying, do you guys remember,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.080]   yeah, where were you when the Intel switch was announced for Apple? Because I was working in IT,
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.520]   and I just looked at that as like, oh my God, everything I just have built and supported is not
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.560]   working anymore. So I'm really worried for IT people right now, because this is, it's not even
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   just, you know, x86 x86, it is a completely different switch. It's to arm. Everything is
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:39.400]   that was literally the beginning of my tech journalism career was in 2006. So it was literally
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.040]   at the moment that transition happened. I was getting, I was just starting out writing for the
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:49.640]   Mac user blog at Mac world. And yeah, I know, I think it's a big deal. But I think what Apple has
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.080]   proved is that over the time, they have done more transitions than anybody in computing, right?
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.520]   They have not only gone from, you know, they used to run a motor roller chips in the classic days,
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:03.480]   they went to power PC, then we had the software transition going from the classic Mac OS to Mac
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.800]   OS 10. And now they're transitioning, you know, they would transition Intel. Now they're transitioning
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.160]   to their own silicon chips. Like, if anybody has got this down to sort of a science, it's definitely
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.960]   Apple. And so yeah, there's going to be impacts for sure. I think the biggest question that everybody's
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.040]   waiting to hear is whether or not Apple's going to decide to do something about virtualization.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.240]   So running Windows on your Mac, for example, right, that was a huge sell of switching to the Intel
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.640]   processors was like, you can boot into Windows, you can run virtualization and virtualize Windows.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.640]   How is that going to work on an Apple Silicon processor? I mean, like, what kind of emulation
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.760]   is going to have to happen there? If any, is it going to be feasible at all? Are they going to be
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.640]   able to run, you know, maybe the ARM variant of Windows? There's some licensing issues at play
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:48.040]   there as I understand it. So a lot of questions there for people who depend on that as like critical
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.960]   workflow. Yeah, also makes me worried about games because Mac has never been a great platform for
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:01.000]   games. And now it's good luck, good luck, but now I built this thing. Yeah, iOS apps run natively
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.520]   now and iOS is a great platform for games. So it's kind of a weird situation for them. Yeah, I know,
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:13.240]   I agree. It's constantly frustrating as a longtime Mac user, I wish that I could be able to play
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:20.920]   games on this device. But now I must stick to my switch or a PC if I want to use Steam.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:27.000]   Apple's so hostile to triple a gaming that they basically kicked the most profitable game
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.280]   of our generation off Fortnite. They, you know, who needs them? They really act like, yeah, whatever.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.440]   Yeah, but they have Apple Arcade, a five buck a month subscription. All you can eat 100 games.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.640]   They're all kind of casual games, but maybe Apple's. Some of them are pretty good. Like,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.680]   I'll say this about Apple Arcade and I wrote this up in gadget. Like it is,
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.800]   it is sort of an antidote to where mobile gaming is now, right? Because Apple Arcade.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.960]   They had to do it for that reason. Yeah. Yeah. There's no in app purchases. It's all like
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.720]   frame, jolly, you can eat, but some are really complex, deep narrative games. So it's not just
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.800]   like the casual stuff. There's a lot of cool stuff in there. Apple's history with gaming is so weird.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.760]   I think fundamentally, I would argue they've never gotten gaming in the way that they have
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.600]   a while they were going to make a gaming platform. They're going to make the pimping.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.440]   Remember the pimping? Yeah. They also, do you remember when Halo was a going to debut on the Mac?
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.400]   Oh, yeah. In 2000, Steve Jobs announced it at a keynote. That's because Bungie did marathon,
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:31.080]   which was the last great Mac only game. And that's 20 years ago. Paris, what did you,
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.640]   what games would you play if you could play on a Mac?
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:43.240]   God, if I could play on a Mac, I'm interested in a lot of, I guess, like, I end up just playing
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.840]   most games that I can play on my Switch because it's the only console that I currently have.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:55.800]   As of late, I've been playing, I guess, I've been playing Fire Emblem. I'm playing a Final Fantasy
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:02.920]   7 remake. I have been playing, I don't know, just trying to fill my brain with as much retro
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.280]   content as possible. It's soothing, isn't it? Given current events.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.360]   Yes, very soothing. Yeah. I have a shameful admission to make.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:17.960]   I was all excited about buying the Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5. Then I noticed the Switch
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.640]   was available again because you couldn't get it for a while during quarantine. So I bought a Switch
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.120]   and I thought, "Oh, because I wanted to play Hades." But they thought, "I should try Animal Crossing."
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.840]   Oh, are you deep in Animal Crossing now? I am so stuck on my island.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:41.640]   I said, "I don't need a Series X. I don't need a PlayStation 5. I have Animal Crossing." That is
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:48.520]   shameful. Animal Crossing will get you. It was the first three months of quarantine. That's all I did
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.400]   with my free time. It's wonderful. Enjoy it. You grew out of it. Eventually you do...
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   Because you do everything your island is perfect. Oh, thank God.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.160]   Because I don't see that in the light. But it doesn't take a while. You just have to fully
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:07.320]   give in the light. I'm still buying turnips and trying to maximize my stock portfolio.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:13.960]   And I'm saying, "When is the turnip lady coming? It's Sunday. Where is she?"
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.920]   You got to go to the sites that have all the ratios and the...
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.440]   Oh, God, it's not figured at all. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's crazy. It's really...
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.200]   From playing... You can exchange turning some like the black stock market.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.440]   Oh, yeah. Some random people online. It's crazy.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:34.520]   And there's scammers. There's turnips scammers. Oh, yeah. Of course.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:42.680]   What a world. It's a crazy thing. Having played Pokemon Go when it came out,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.720]   I saw how nuts people went. And there were all those sites, just like you said, Dan,
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.560]   where they figured everything out. And you know, "Oh, you need this to do this and this."
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.600]   And animal crossing is the same. I was starting to worry, "You'll just say,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.920]   'Oh, you need this app and this app and here's the site and then..."
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.280]   And you can track the stock prices and figure out when to send your sell your turnips.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.080]   I feel very fortunate. I sold them on Wednesday by Friday. The market had crashed.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.960]   So I got that. Get out of turnips. Sorry. Don't return.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.760]   You got to play return of the Oprah Den next, Leo.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.640]   Okay. That's a game that I played. It's on Switch.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.000]   So good. That probably would be my answer up until it came to Switch for a game that I'd
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.440]   wanted to play on Mac, but couldn't. It is technically an insurance adventure with minimal
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.840]   colors that were 18.02, but it's much more interesting than that sounds.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.800]   It looks and feels like a classic Mac game from the 80s, basically.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.640]   And I ended up playing on my Xbox for the same reason as Paris. I can't play it on my Mac.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.160]   Oh my God. It does. It looks like it's beautiful.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.960]   It is so clever, too. It looks like it's that hard.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.080]   Castlevania or something. Oh my God. Look at that. Return of the Oprah Den.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.080]   So this is a ship and you're supposed to like...
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:03.720]   You're an insurance adjuster. This ship came to shore with nobody on it.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.640]   You represent the insurance company for the ship who's supposed to figure out whether or not
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.000]   they can make a claim. And you're given this pocket watch. You'll see right there.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.960]   That lets you go back to the time of death. Oh my God.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:20.680]   For every body you see, then you go and you have to kind of jump from death to death and figure out
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.080]   what happened on this ship. Oh.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:29.480]   And it's a mystery game. And so essentially, you have to try and figure out who all these people
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:38.040]   are, how they died, and you have to get the names and causes of death right in groups of three
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.920]   to advance. And then you learn more about the story. It's fantastic.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.200]   The good thing about this game is it has an end, right? You get to the...
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:50.040]   Yes. Yes. And I guess Animal Crossing has an end unless you decide you want to continue the
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.960]   turnip thing. Animal Crossing, you can play forever. Oh God. It is infinite.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.880]   Oh God. I'm going to...
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.560]   Or you step away from Animal Crossing when you go back, there's just weeds everywhere.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.320]   So you have to do all the work again. And cockroaches.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.840]   To clean it up. And cockroaches. If you leave your wife's...
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.200]   The house fills with weeds and cockroaches. That's not a game.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.680]   It's just life.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:21.560]   A bunch of the game is involved with picking up weeds, shaking trees to find things.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.920]   It's like it's work.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:29.480]   Catching lice on your neighbor. I could do it. My wife played it for quite a long time and I
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.400]   played it for a few weeks. And then was like, this feels too much like work.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.080]   That's going to go back to doing something else.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.960]   But it is a good thing to watch when you're waiting for election returns to come in.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.840]   I want to do this.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.920]   I want to... So I'm excited about the Apple thing.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.520]   There really isn't much to say till we see on Tuesday. Although,
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:54.120]   although there were some leaped geek bench results.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.960]   Yeah. And this happens from time to time, right? Where...
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.920]   And I don't know. Maybe you guys have a better idea.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:08.680]   Where either it's somebody who has the new Apple MacBook accidentally.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.120]   Because when you do a geek bench benchmark, if you're not careful, it can upload it to the public
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.800]   site where everybody can see the numbers. It could be that somebody did that by accident.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.840]   It could be Apple leaked it on purpose. It could be completely faked.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.040]   But it's impressive as hell. It's for an A14X.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.040]   It would expect the A14, which is the current chip in the iPad Air and the
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:40.840]   new iPhones would have a special desktop variant. It clocks at 1.8 gigahertz,
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:48.040]   can turbo boost to 3.1 gigahertz, which means the first time ever any Apple Silicon gets over three.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:54.360]   Eight cores. That's about what you'd expect too. They've got six cores in the iPhone 12.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.920]   This one had eight gigs of RAM, although, I'm sorry, the GPU had eight gigs of RAM.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:10.840]   So this sounds like a pretty heavy-duty machine. And it outscored the i9 Intel Apple MacBook Pro,
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.000]   both in single core and multi-core performance.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.520]   I mean, Dan, maybe you have some experience with this. Could this be fake?
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.240]   It could be fake. It's impossible to know, but it could very well be real.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:30.200]   Like you said, it kind of pegs in where we would expect it to be. The A14X would be expected,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.080]   because that would probably be the same chip that would end up in any new iPad Pro as well.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.400]   Usually the X variant is what you see in the iPads after they debut the sort of standard
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.680]   variant in the iPhones. So a lot of people speculating that what we see in an iPad Pro might also show
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:51.160]   up in a laptop. And as you said, it kind of outpaces basically every Mac laptop on the market right now,
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.280]   which is not a bad place to be. And we don't even know what configuration, what variant is that,
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.120]   right? Like if they're talking about both a MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro, is this the Pro
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.440]   version? Is it the Air version? What is going to be the functional difference between these things?
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:10.760]   So yeah, there's a lot of possibility here, but certainly exciting to look at something and be like,
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.440]   well, if even the base level is going to be faster than everything on the market right now,
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.720]   what does the high end look like?
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:21.000]   Right. Well, definitely on your bingo cards, you should have the phrase all day battery
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.600]   life. Right? Because that's what you get with these kinds of chips is much better power,
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:33.800]   much better power curve. And and perhaps maybe 30% improvement and performance,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.640]   that's the kind of number Apple likes they don't like doing benchmarks. They don't like giving
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.400]   a benchmark numbers, but they like saying things like 30% better perform.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.640]   I think the last thing they had said, like when they were talking benches was like their chips are
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.880]   twice as fast as the most popular Windows laptop, right? I think that's what it was for when they
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.200]   were talking about the new iPad. So, you know, and then we don't know, like the thing about
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.840]   Apple's even once we get the actual spectrum, we won't have the actual number.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.520]   They never say we have to break it down.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.440]   Well, do we don't get them? Somebody, you know, the one thing I do remember,
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:09.480]   because I bought I have bought several now of the I9 MacBook Pros, was when it first came out,
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.200]   the the YouTuber who benchmarked it in the freezer, because the thermals are so terrible
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.240]   right thing that you could as soon as it got fast, it could it could only be very bursty,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.840]   you know, quick, because as soon as it got fast, it would heat up so much they had to say,
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.080]   oh, no, no, slow down, slow down. So I keep a mind that none of the existing, you know,
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   A series devices have active cooling in them, right? You know, phones, iPads, Apple TV,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.800]   there's no active cooling systems in those things. There's no fans. So, if you can put an active
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.640]   cooling system in on top of it, I mean, think about what additional performance that lets you
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   sort of eke out of it. If it's like, well, now that we can actually cool this chip down and it's
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.600]   not threatening to burn the entire laptop to the ground, we can eat so much more performance out of
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.480]   it. That's just going to be very person who constantly has probably a hundred or more Google
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:01.240]   Chrome tabs open at once. I truly wish that there was any period because my laptop constantly
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.720]   sounds like it's about to take off into outer space. Yeah, when your laptop spins up,
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:14.360]   the fans spin up because you're installing software, then you know it's time to get a better laptop.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.880]   And a lot of the modern, a lot of the modern Windows 10 laptops, the fans are on at high volume
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.600]   a lot of the time. And I think that's an Intel flaw. That's why I think this is going to be very
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:30.120]   interesting. And I can guarantee you everybody's looking on the PC side looking at this with interest,
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:36.360]   not that they'll be able to get Apple Silicon, but at least maybe this can stimulate arm chip
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:42.760]   development for Windows. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a fanless laptop out of this, by the way,
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:48.520]   just because of the history of these processors. So we've seen a couple, I think the last time I
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:57.000]   saw it was Dell's XPS 13, 2-1 from two years ago was at least very, very quiet and it had a weird
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   cooling system. So I guess we'll see, it was super underpowered because if it's fanless on Intel,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.280]   you're running Y series probably. And it's just slow as hell.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.560]   Yeah. I'm going to just guess, we'll see, it's not like we need to speculate, it's only two
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:17.960]   days away. But I'm going to guess they'll do a fanless MacBook, very thin, very light, all day
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.560]   battery life. It's going to be better performance than the current MacBook or MacBook Air because
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.600]   they don't have to use those crappy Y series Intel chips. But it won't be super good. And
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.680]   then I think we will maybe, and it might not even be for delivery this year,
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.000]   see a higher end. And I'm sure that that's where these Geekbench scores come from, a higher end
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.960]   MacBook Pro 16. That will be the one that Pro's will want, obviously.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.200]   The Bloomberg story that came out last week from Mark Gurman, I think suggested that
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:52.280]   we'd see a 13-inch Air, a 13-inch Pro, and a 16-inch Pro all announced on Tuesday,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.600]   all of which will probably be in sort of the same form factor as the existing laptop.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.200]   This is what I mean. I was hoping that- Yeah, it is. I agree. They'd be a color or something,
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.800]   just to distinguish. Well, you don't know. I mean, there's always details and you never know
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   what they get right and what they get wrong. But it is interesting to just see, like, is this
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.880]   a situation where we try to keep things looking as similar as possible so we don't scare off any
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.000]   of our customers worried that this is a whole new product. So we're going to take a break. As you
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.960]   know, there was an election. There will be, there's a new president and vice president elect.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:29.800]   January 20th, maybe they'll take office. I don't know what's going to happen between now and then.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.520]   Oh, yeah. But if they did. Yeah, of course. It's a mirror. What could go wrong?
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.320]   But when they do take office, when a Biden-Harris administration takes office,
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.360]   how will they approach big tech? That's the question everybody's asking. And what will come,
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.960]   become of the DOJ's lawsuit against Google and so forth? Jessica Lesson has a good article in
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.680]   the information, your publication Paris, but we will talk about that. What does the,
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:01.080]   what do the election results mean for big tech when we get back? Actually, we should probably
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.640]   include in that Prop 22 in California, which enfranchised Uber and Lyft and said,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:14.280]   "Nah, don't worry. Those guys don't have to be employees." So this will be very, very interesting.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.160]   Coming to you from the beautiful Four Seasons Landscamping Company in downtown Petaluma,
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.720]   it's this. I will be thinking of that for the rest of my life.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:33.080]   That is just a perfect coda to the whole last four years. Rudy Giuliani is standing at a parking lot,
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.840]   like feet away from a sex shop, giving announcement at the end of Donald Trump's.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:47.880]   Incredible. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:57.560]   Nowadays, I think that getting a job in IT is probably as good as it can get. It's job security
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.280]   for one thing. And there's so many different areas you can choose from that could fit your
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.000]   interest. Obviously, if you watch our shows, you're interested in technology. If you've been
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.680]   tasked to learn something new for IT, whether for work or just for yourself,
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:16.440]   I think a lot of people say, "Oh, I'll just go to YouTube," or maybe I'll sign up with a technical
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   college or go to the bookstore. No, nobody thinks that. Get some books. The problem is that is
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.400]   it's not the best way to learn. What are the best videos? What are the best books?
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:34.280]   How much do you have to waste on a technical school? You need to go to ITProTV. There will
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:41.160]   be no waste of time or money. It's the best online education platform, both engaging and
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:47.800]   informative and entertaining. So it's painless, but you will learn and man for every kind of IT job,

[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:05.720]   I think if it's a little bit fun, it's also a little easier to learn, but it's not too fun.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:11.080]   It's to the point too. It doesn't waste your time. You can get your IT search through ITProTV's

[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.480]   Technetto with Don Pazette. It's got industry guests. IT news. Recap's Don's a great guy.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:13.400]   He's one of the founders of ITProTV. They're also focusing now on next certifications for
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:22.120]   November. Learn more about getting certified as a cybersec first responder. Wow. Or a cyber secure
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:29.320]   coder. Or I love this. This is the cert I want. I'm a certified Internet of Things practitioner.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.360]   There is such a cert. And wouldn't that be a good thing to have? There should be no question.

[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:16.680]   ITProTV/twit. You liked being an IT guy, right? Devindra? It was fun.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:24.040]   I did. It's great. You're always learning simple things to solve compared to, in a way,
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:29.320]   journalism feels like being in college forever. Because I basically spent the last week just
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:35.800]   writing nonstop like a crazy person. So it was nice to have simple problems to solve back in the
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:41.960]   day. I came out of IT too. I enjoyed being like, "Oh, I fixed your problem. Goodbye."
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:48.680]   You're gone. You're gone. And you're done. Yeah. Nice. Nice work. On the other hand,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:59.240]   this is a job that never ends. I kind of love it too. I always got to be a ringside seat
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.120]   on the things that are changing the world. And that always for me was really the reason to be a
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.800]   tech journalist. You're watching stuff. It's fun. Nobody dies. Nobody bleeds. So it's a really,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.880]   well, not so much. That's so bad. We are watching the destructive democracy.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:25.160]   Yeah. Not as many people die. Democracy might crumble due to a couple of platforms.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:31.560]   The consolidation of the power is constantly, you know. Let's talk about that. Biden's already
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:40.680]   tweeting. I think that Twitter is now kind of the de facto communication platform for presidents,
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:46.600]   you think? Has Donald Trump changed that? I know that would- I'm not sure that that's going to
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.040]   go far beyond the Trump administration. I mean, I think that the Biden administration will
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:58.920]   probably use Twitter much in the same way that past non-Trump administrations have as a social
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:05.080]   media channel rather than a extension of the president's thoughts. Well, hopefully,
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:11.000]   some of the oil references. Well, I hope so too. But press conferences. Wow. But the @potus,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.760]   Twitter handle, which was created for Barack Obama, passed to President Trump, will pass on to
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.880]   President Biden. So he will have that as an option. But I don't think Obama used it that much.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.160]   But those were- It was his team. He had a great social media team. He did.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:29.720]   And who knows? Maybe Biden will be TikTok, you know.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.320]   The first TikTok president, there's always time. I think Kamala could be, honestly. Oh, yeah.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:41.000]   So in a more serious vein, there is a lot of
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.120]   investigation going into big tech. There's the Department of Justice's
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:53.800]   lawsuit against Google. There's the House's, the antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee's
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:03.080]   450 page document. There's a lot of interest in what we can do about big tech. How much of that
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.760]   transitions from the Trump administration to a Biden administration? What do you think, Paris?
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:15.960]   I think quite a lot of it. I mean, I think we're definitely- It seems like the Department of
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.400]   Justice's investigation into Google is probably going to continue into the Biden administration,
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.120]   if not be furthered. It seems like it's more likely that like Democrats,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:33.000]   Democratic state attorneys general would join that lawsuit, maybe even like add allegations
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.840]   about Google. Yes. Right. As of now, it was really a political- It looked like a political
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:45.000]   prosecution of Google. It was Republican governor or Republican AGs rather joining it,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:53.160]   not Democrat. And it really was- As formed, it was something William Barr pushed through. In fact,
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.520]   we're hearing reporting that a lot of the staff attorneys at the Department of Justice said,
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.760]   "It's too soon. It's too soon. We don't have a case built yet." And Barr said,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:08.440]   "No, no. We got to do it before election day." So it's somewhat political.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.400]   But you think- I mean, it's been very clear. Biden has in his many statements during the
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:19.240]   election said, "We need to pursue this, Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic candidate,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.800]   who perhaps will have a role to play. She's certainly going to have a role played in the Senate."
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.440]   Was actively campaigning for the breakup of Big Tech.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   So you think that- In fact, Biden even said, "I think we should look at
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:41.880]   Section 230 of the DMCA. We should get rid of that." I've been told Jeff Jarvis says he knows of
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:48.120]   advisors who have spoken to him about that and said, "Please, no. Please, maybe that's not what
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:53.960]   you want to pursue." So maybe his positional change. You don't think it'll be a big change,
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:36:01.400]   though, from now until in January 20th. I think that- I mean, we're certainly going to see
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:10.040]   a change in tone. It depends on honestly whether or not what happens with the Senate, because I know
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:19.000]   that Democrats were interested in possibly tackling antitrust laws and doing reforms so that maybe
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.440]   they could stop Facebook and Google and other companies from acquiring smaller startups and what
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:34.200]   not and perhaps pursuing antitrust charges or building a defense based on things like that.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:43.240]   But I think it- I mean, certainly, I hope that some of the inflammatory policymaking or executive
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:49.720]   orders we've seen kind of around 230 and the rhetoric around that might cool down a bit in a
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:55.080]   new administration. Hopefully, when somebody explains to whoever her president is, what,
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.360]   Section 230 actually is and what it means and what it does not.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:07.160]   Well, yeah, I would agree with that. I do- Jessica Lesson writing in the information
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:14.520]   says that it's expected the FTC will decide whether to sue Facebook soon, could even be as
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.880]   soon as this month under a Trump administration. And we've been waiting on what is an antitrust
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:25.240]   action in Europe on Amazon for a couple months now. And that certainly is not going to change.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.920]   That's not affected by the US presidential elections. I think it's a big unknown. I don't
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.800]   know if we know what Biden Harris administration will do about big tech. Do we-
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.200]   I don't think- They have the same- Sorry, go ahead, the major.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.480]   Well, just quickly, like, at the very least, we won't just have hearings where they invite all
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.600]   the leaders and just yell at them like children, which to me was the single most embarrassing,
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.920]   like a lot of embarrassing things happened over the past four years. But that was just-
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:58.600]   it was so pathetic. It was so childish where there are a lot of big problems to solve. I think
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.880]   Elizabeth Warren has some great ideas like deconstructing the monopolies is really what
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:08.760]   we should be talking about. So I hope she pursues that because we've seen time and again, like
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.720]   Facebook, even with this election has been slow to fix a lot of the problems from 2016. So,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.920]   yeah, there's a lot more they can do. Dan, go ahead.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.760]   Yeah, I was just thinking, I mean, along lines with the Avengers saying, I think that it's clear
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.160]   the concerns that Democrats have with big tech are very different from the concerns that Republicans
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:31.080]   have with big tech. So with a DOJ investigation going forward, it sure seems like it might be
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:37.000]   refocused, if anything. I kind of agree with Paris. I don't think it's going to go anywhere, but perhaps
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.240]   if it gets more time to sort of mature and then they're spinning up a different, you know,
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:46.520]   different DOJ apparatus, it's possible that we'll see stuff that's more focused on the issues that
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.840]   Democrats are concerned about and which I think are probably the issues you should be concerned
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.760]   about like the vendor was just saying, not why does why does Google not like me?
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   I imagine there was a little celebration in 10 cent had company headquarters, TikTok,
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:09.240]   and we chat might survive the Trump administration and judge actually it was, you know, TikTok was
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:14.200]   supposed to be shut down in four days. Judge Beadlestone said, no, you don't have any reason to do that.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:20.120]   So that's been stopped by the courts, at least temporarily. I can't imagine a Biden administration
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.400]   would continue to pursue that. That seems so politically motivated. On the other hand, our
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.880]   relationship with China, I mean, I mean, that's a big part of tech too. You know, Apple's
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:35.800]   phone sales in China dropped precipitously last quarter. And it's thought that that said
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:41.080]   something to do with the anti China sentiment, the tariffs that the Trump administration leveled
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:47.400]   against China, Chinese phone buyers suddenly got patriotic and bought a lot of Huawei phones,
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:53.160]   making them the number one phone manufacturer in the world. That might change. I don't know what
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:00.200]   I don't know in what way or how. Well, I mean, Apple is also, they've been in kind of a bind there
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.840]   for a while because not only is China a huge market for them, but China is the source of the
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:10.040]   vast majority of their manufacturing and labor. And so Apple has been slowly, you know, as we saw
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:15.080]   starting in the early this year when the coronavirus really started in China, you know, been trying
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.600]   to diversify and move their assets around so they can manufacture in other places, including
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.440]   India and Vietnam and elsewhere. Of course, for the pandemic, it ends up turns out that that's
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.960]   everywhere. So that didn't really help them. But I mean, certainly the relationship with China is
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.000]   part of that where trying to not have all their eggs in one basket and be in a situation where
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.360]   they're not solely dependent on if the Chinese US relationship goes south. It's not like we can't
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.320]   not only sell into that market, but we can't get our phones produced and sold to other markets either.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.520]   So I agree that it's a huge area of interest for Apple is how well the US-China relationship
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:55.560]   sort of stands up and whether the Biden presidency will improve that. Do you remember the Trump
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.760]   administration has seemed it was only four years, but it seems like it was very, very long. It was
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:06.760]   only like it was four days. Do you remember though, he had a tech and science council
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:12.280]   that featured CEOs from technology? Oh yeah. Remember that?
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:20.920]   And you know, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Apple. Tim Apple.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:26.280]   And they went to DC and they told me that's prudent if you're a CEO of a big tech firm or
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:34.120]   any firm to make nice with the president. But I was like years ago.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.920]   The photos from that meeting I think are hilarious too, because it was like Tim Cook and just like
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.720]   what the hell are we doing here guys? Look at this idiot. Why am I doing this? It's because of my
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:49.720]   stockholders. I have to sit here and take this. Yeah. I mean, Obama had a similar council. Eric
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   Schmidt was on that. Craig Mundy of Microsoft was on it. It wasn't a bunch of CEOs.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:06.520]   I wonder I'm actually very curious, A, what happened to that? And B, what what a Biden administration
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.880]   will what its relationship will be? You know, those CEOs are going to pay, you know,
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:18.680]   pay a Beecience to the new president. Of course, they'll make the trip to DC and have lunch in
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.960]   the residence if they can and that kind of thing. I just wonder what it's going to, what it's going
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.080]   to look like. I don't think it'll be a, you know, it's hard to say, but it doesn't feel like it'll be
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:34.440]   a tense relationship. This is the difficulty. You might, you might say if you're conservative,
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:40.280]   or they're censoring our speech, you might say if you're a Democrat, all they're too, they're too big.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.600]   But there's also this issue that they seem to be powering the American economy, especially now
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:53.080]   during quarantine. You want to be a little careful. You don't want to chop them up and destroy what
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.640]   may be the only big economic powerhouse during quarantine. There is.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:05.000]   That's, I mean, there's only, and we should point out there are bigger issues that Biden's going to
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   have to solve. I think that's the main thing. It won't be number one on his list. Yeah.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.640]   Tech will be perfectly fine because we literally have to rebuild the country, fill out the state
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:19.320]   department, like fix this entire mess. So yeah, tech will probably be good for a little while.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:25.080]   He will have to name a new FCC, or will likely name a new FCC commissioner.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:32.760]   The way it works, the White House, there's two Republicans and two Democrats on the FCC.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:38.360]   And then I guess the White House gets to choose the chairman of the FCC. I imagine
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:44.760]   Ajit Pai is sending out his resume at this point, probably get a nice, cush job lobbying for Verizon
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.360]   or one of the big telcos. He's been good to that. Who knows? What about net neutrality?
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:44:00.280]   What about net neutrality? We're done. We're done. We didn't solve that already. We didn't
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.560]   fix that one. Again, I don't see that being a high priority. And yet, you know,
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:10.520]   that these are the concerns we have as tech people. I want to be an interesting time for
[00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.920]   four years or so to not have tech related issues be the number one news.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.160]   I remember we didn't have to talk about politics at all on these shows.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.880]   But it is a little, but now it's kind of a big part of the overall.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.560]   Yeah, like tech wanted to rule the world and now tech is ruling the world in that bad
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.760]   is like, whoa, why is everyone so concerned with us?
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:33.240]   Don't worry. This is too long.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:39.640]   It's too long. It's too long. We are going to do. We got this. All right. So I guess,
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.960]   I guess we'll watch with interest to see, you know,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.320]   I hope Warren gets a, like a good role as in, you know, as somebody overseeing
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:54.040]   antitrust and everything because it's not just tech, but it is certainly a lot of time.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:01.880]   I thought that she might not be considered because isn't the governor of her state
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   a Republican? She was removed. It would cost them the majority in the Senate.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.240]   That's a good point. Charlie Baker is a Republican, even though he's a very liberal
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:14.280]   Republican. And yeah, that would be too much of a risk. Plus her position in the Senate, I think,
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.600]   is pretty, pretty vital to a lot of what it's going on.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.160]   It's also precarious. Yeah. Meg Whitman might join Biden's cabinet.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.680]   Yeah, we need more short-form video.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.160]   Quick fights. Quick fights, you know.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   It's actually a quick fight.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.200]   It's a funny.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:32.680]   Yes.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:41.480]   What about Quibi? It's over, right? Did they shut down yet?
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:46.120]   Or can you still watch Dish Mantle and the girl with the shoulder arm?
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.760]   Never forget.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.440]   We'll make fun of the Golden Arping because it was Sam Raimi being campy.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.080]   But when you take something like that out of context, it just really feeds the idea that
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.480]   Quibi is this complete disaster. So sure.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.520]   Did you enjoy it?
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:05.320]   That's fine. I mean, it's fine. I love Sam Raimi. I give Sam Raimi.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.440]   I love her too.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.080]   Yep.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:13.400]   And he played it for camp. If you saw it, it was obviously not serious.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.480]   She had one she had. We talked about a couple of weeks ago.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.600]   Pulmonary, gold pulmonary disease.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:25.160]   You have to take off the arm. Never!
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.280]   They're at me with my gold love.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:35.000]   I will say my favorite thing about Quibi is that it crashed and burned just in time to
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.560]   make my Halloween costume relevant, which I was a ghost of Quibi.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.440]   Oh, I love it.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.880]   It was originally supposed to be the ghost of the idea of Quibi, but then it was just the real
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.000]   ghost of Quibi.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.160]   How did you identify yourself as Quibi?
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.720]   Did you look the same sideways and upright?
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.480]   I almost have it here.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.200]   I had the ghost sheet costume and they had the Quibi logo.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:56.760]   Perfect.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.400]   Right in the front.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.680]   The ghost of I am the ghost of Quibi past.
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:07.560]   Politico says Meg Whitman would be a candidate for commerce.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:13.960]   And I would be surprised to see Joe Biden look at some Republicans.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.440]   After her string of successes, let's bring her in.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.960]   That's really just yeah, Meg Whitman.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.360]   I don't know who's putting her on the list.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.320]   Probably Meg Whitman.
[00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.280]   She's looking for the word.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:30.680]   I will never forget sitting across the table from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.840]   and be like guys, nobody wants this.
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.880]   Nobody wants to be.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.320]   No, you told me straight face.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:41.000]   Well, basically I'm like Netflix between Netflix and YouTube and everything people has.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.360]   Why would anybody want this?
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.200]   And what did they say?
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.520]   They're like we're convinced we're convinced we can create like a third option for
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.800]   new categories.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.280]   I have a clue that it goes on.
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:53.080]   That's insane.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.920]   That's any number of services before Quibi was a third option for services.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.000]   Quibi was like the 17th option.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.720]   I think there is an axiom in there.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.880]   We'll have to make it harder war is axiom.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:10.200]   But it's something like if you have to create a new category for your product,
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.840]   you have zero chance of success.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.880]   Probably.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.280]   Right.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:14.760]   Probably.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.560]   I mean, it's hard to protect when things will go viral and will be really successful.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.560]   But I mean, even you look at TikTok, right?
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.440]   TikTok, I feel, is the bones of vine.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.800]   And you knew that there was something there.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.200]   You just needed the investment to make it successful.
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.000]   So that wasn't super surprising down the line.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.840]   Maybe Snapchat was a little more surprising.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.360]   But it's hard to tell.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:40.760]   Maybe iPad was a new category that had really an Apple was trying to find something in between
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.120]   a phone and a computer.
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.200]   And it took it 10 years to kind of.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.720]   It took a while.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.520]   And it's not like tablets weren't a thing before that.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.080]   That's true.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:52.040]   But it was a combination of factors that made it so successful.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.720]   But "Divinures Right" like finding out that one like what's going to make something popular.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.000]   I mean, that's true in almost anything.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.240]   Movies, books, TV series, right?
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:05.000]   Tech like what makes this thing catch on in a viral way or become something more than just
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.960]   the sum of its parts?
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.800]   And the answer is you can't predict it.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.320]   You can do all the research in the world, but you can't ever know for sure that your
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.280]   thing is going to catch on.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.200]   But that's the hubris of Hollywood, isn't it?
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:14.520]   Yes.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.000]   Sure.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:15.560]   Absolutely.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.200]   He said, oh, no.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.320]   We know how to make things viral.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.280]   And venture capital.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:18.920]   And VC.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.320]   Yes.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.920]   Oh, put those two together.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.120]   That's a match in the heaven.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.360]   Hold my beer while I make this viral.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.520]   But nobody knows how to make anything viral.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.120]   Everybody claims this.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:30.600]   We did.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.040]   We just do it all the time, right?
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.000]   We would do it.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.400]   We would do it.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.840]   We would do it.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.640]   It's a mystery.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:41.800]   Why something catches-- why did the guy on the long board with a cranberry sing and
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.120]   Fleetwood Mac, how did that become a hit?
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.120]   Because he was the vibe of our times.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:46.440]   OK.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.400]   That's true.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.440]   He's an icon.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:49.000]   He's an icon.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.800]   He's an icon.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:49.960]   He's an icon.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.440]   He's an icon.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.640]   But he got a truck.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.640]   He said, we're all happy for him.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.520]   No.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   This guy was-- his truck broke down.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.960]   And he had a long board in the back.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:02.040]   And he said, I'll make a video of me vibing to Fleetwood Mac
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.560]   because I skate down.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.520]   And now-- and you know, it's now, by the way, I saw this on Monday night football.
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.600]   Or maybe on Sunday night.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:14.200]   It's a-- it's a tech nationwide TikTok ad.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.320]   And they have him doing it.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.560]   And then a bunch of other people doing it.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.000]   And Mick Fleetwood and a bunch of other people.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.240]   And then finally Stevie Nix shows up.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.320]   And it's like, who would it--
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.160]   You know, it's done, by the way.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:25.720]   If you pitched--
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.800]   If you pitched this.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.640]   If you went into Hollywood and said, look, I got this great idea.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.040]   Guy in a truck breaks down.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.680]   He gets on his long board, drinks some cranberry juice,
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.360]   and sings Fleetwood Mac.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.720]   It's going to be huge.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.560]   They would have laughed you out of the office.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.000]   That's the problem.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.080]   I knew how to make stuff viral.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.280]   I've written three books.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.480]   I know how to make stuff viral.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.920]   I've sold a lot more.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:49.720]   Let me tell you.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.200]   Three.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.560]   I've done more than a dozen.
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.800]   They were all flops.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.160]   That's a weird thing.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.240]   I was reading somebody did a retrospective
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.160]   of the Dancing Baby from Ally McBeal.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:50:59.720]   Perfect experience.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.360]   And I--
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.640]   Like late '90s viral, the thing that became a hit everywhere--
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.480]   I still don't understand it.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.160]   But it was a weird confluence of the bunch of things.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:07.640]   Ooga Chaka.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.600]   Ooga Chaka.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.000]   Ooga Chaka.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.200]   That was--
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.800]   I'm sure you know this.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.840]   But that was a 3D model that came with some big 3D program
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.640]   at the time, right?
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.000]   That wasn't a real baby.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.560]   They make an HD version of that.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.200]   There's an HD version of the baby now you can put on to things.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.160]   So enjoy.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:29.640]   No.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.280]   Thank God.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.320]   Thanks, Snapchat.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.280]   That was back in 1998, the Dancing Baby.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:38.840]   We've gone from Dancing Baby to--
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.880]   Simpler times.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.920]   Simpler times.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.520]   Although the creator, David E. Kelly, is still around.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.120]   If anybody knows how to create viral, I guess it's him.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.360]   He's got a good formula for rich people shows, basically.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.560]   Have you been watching The End Doing?
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.840]   No.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.320]   It's good.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:57.880]   I try.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:58.520]   It's really--
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.280]   I consider my life the end doing.
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.320]   Little too close to home.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.560]   You can't do that to us right now.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.680]   A rich family in Manhattan, living their rich life.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.440]   Whereas succession is right there, and is a perfect show.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.480]   I agree.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.160]   I only have one of those in my life right now.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.320]   Oh, here it is.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:17.880]   I found it.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.040]   This is on the AV Club, the Dancing Baby.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.560]   Look how low-res this was.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.400]   1998, we thought this was--
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.600]   like that was great.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.800]   So--
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.240]   AV Club represent.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.200]   I'm sure.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.360]   Somebody rediscovered the model,
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:36.040]   re-rendered it, and ported it to Gmod.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.840]   This is all much better.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.400]   Still horrifying.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:41.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.280]   I agree.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:42.840]   I agree.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:47.960]   There are kids alive-- adults alive today.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.800]   Who weren't born and don't know what the hell we're talking about.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.320]   You want to feel old?
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.000]   That baby is 35 now.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:56.840]   Yes.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.720]   That baby can vote.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.200]   That baby can vote.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.040]   Yeah, that baby can vote.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.720]   Oh, that baby can vote.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.880]   That baby can vote.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.360]   And please vote for the Senate run-offs.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.960]   Uga-chaka, baby.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.240]   Uh, let's take a little break.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.560]   I'm kind of punchy.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.600]   I don't know about you guys.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.560]   I'm a little punchy.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.280]   This was a long--
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.080]   Oh, sure.
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:23.720]   Difficult.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.000]   Shit.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.080]   This is our collective like exhale,
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.680]   as a country.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   So this is the tail end of my--
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.160]   I have--
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   I have not quite literally,
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.840]   but very close to--
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.720]   certainly figuratively--
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.440]   been all in my breath for four freaking years.
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.200]   I'm still--
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.680]   and by the way, 73 days, still to go.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.720]   Just got power through the re-ass.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.640]   It's not too late to start a nuclear war.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.320]   Just remember that.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:53.560]   Uh, good golly Miss Molly.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.560]   Great panel today.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.320]   It's great to see Paris Martino
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   now working at the information.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.160]   Working at the information?
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:01.240]   Working at the information?
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.760]   What are you thinking about nuclear war?
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.960]   I'm sorry I brought that up.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.600]   That was--
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.640]   that was bad.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.760]   Not too soon, Leo.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.880]   Too soon.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:08.360]   What--
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.000]   what do you cover?
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.040]   What's your beat over there?
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.880]   Um, I cover Amazon.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.080]   Oh, so you're still doing that?
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:14.600]   Still doing it.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.440]   There's a lot of Amazon out there, shock.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.800]   I want to talk Amazon.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.520]   We get back.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.240]   'Cause, you know, Black Friday is coming.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.000]   It's true.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.440]   Black Friday actually began in October for Amazon.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.240]   [laughter]
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.920]   It changed Black Friday in July to Black Friday in October.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.960]   It's Black Friday.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.000]   It's Black Quarter.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.800]   Black Quarter.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.720]   Also with us from Engadget to Vendra Hardawar.
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.920]   You've been on this show now.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:39.480]   This must be--
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   you must be in your second decade now on this show.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.280]   You've been here with us.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.320]   Oh man, I wish--
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:43.960]   I wish.
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.520]   I remember when I was in doing IT, Leo,
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.720]   listening to you with the original Twitch show.
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.960]   You know, back in the day, it was like 2005, 2006.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.440]   Dude, this piece.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.280]   So it does feel like I've been here for two decades.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.720]   Is the original Twitch show.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.280]   This is not--
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:56.680]   That's true.
[00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:57.720]   This is not a sequel.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.280]   Well, it's like the first batch of episodes.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.920]   'Cause I grew up also watching you on tech TV and everything.
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:03.640]   Nice.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.760]   To see it come back.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.640]   That was pretty cool.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.360]   Yes.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:06.680]   Yes.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.880]   I'm feel old now.
[00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:12.680]   And also with us Dan Morrin, of course,
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.760]   host at sixcolors.com, host of clockwise.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.200]   And I loved the Jason's charts.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:20.920]   They did it again.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.680]   The color charts for the Apple quarter.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.640]   Was--
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.680]   Very good with those charts.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.240]   It does so.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.720]   He really takes the six color stuff to heart.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:28.280]   That's for sure.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.720]   He lives it.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:30.040]   Yep.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.240]   Our show today brought to you by Worldwide.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.520]   Anyway, great to have all three of you.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.000]   It brought to you by Worldwide Technology.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.680]   This was the--
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.920]   I have a soft spot in my heart for them.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:44.200]   'Cause it was the last trip I ever took.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.400]   Well, it was eight months ago in March.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.200]   I went out to--
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.800]   Lisa and I flew out to St. Louis to visit WWT
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.120]   and their Advanced Technology Center.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.600]   Even when we were going out there in early March,
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.880]   I was holding my breath thinking,
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.760]   "I hope I can get--
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.120]   I hope I can make it."
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.040]   But fortunately, St. Louis was still pretty clear.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.240]   So we were able to go there.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.080]   We had a meetup.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.320]   We hung out with people.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:12.120]   I did a little bit of elbow bumping
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.000]   instead of hand shaking,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.880]   but that's about it.
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.760]   I did get to see the Advanced Technology Center,
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.280]   though, and I'm forever grateful.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.040]   They've been building that for 10 years.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:23.560]   There's now half a billion dollars of equipment there
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.320]   from hundreds of OEMs.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.920]   So what I should explain,
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.880]   WWT is a partner for enterprise technologies.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.240]   They help you buy it.
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.200]   They help you configure it.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.240]   They help you design it.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.280]   They help you implement it.
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.960]   They help you support it.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.640]   They have expertise in all the areas you need
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   to make enterprise technologies sing.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.640]   And this ATC is so important.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:46.360]   It's got everything in there.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.800]   Hundreds of OEMs and key partners range from the heavyweights
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.240]   like Dell Technologies, VMware, Intel,
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.360]   to emerging disruptors like Equinix.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.800]   And that's important because if you're looking at,
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:01.160]   you know, moving to the cloud,
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.920]   or you're looking at security,
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.200]   or looking at app development,
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.440]   you want to make sure that the tools you choose
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.440]   work with the tools you use,
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.280]   that you'll be able to make this transition.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.240]   And that's what the engineers at WWT do
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:13.880]   with these labs.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.640]   They spin up proofs of concept.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.520]   They do demos.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.480]   They do testing.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.000]   And you can too.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.320]   I'll explain how you could do that in just a second.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.800]   The ATC is an incubator for IT innovation.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.400]   It offers on-demand and schedulable labs
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.480]   like Dell's VxRail, PowerStore, Unity PowerMax,
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:34.040]   Data Protection Central, IDPA.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.240]   These labs represent the newest advances in primary storage.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.640]   And if you're looking at a Dell solution,
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.160]   you can go in there, you can test it,
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.200]   you can see how it works,
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.880]   you can integrate it with your existing stuff.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.160]   There's white papers,
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.120]   there's benchmarks,
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.400]   there's everything you need,
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:48.600]   and hundreds of labs
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.840]   that you can explore on every topic in enterprise.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.920]   From multi-cloud hyper-converged infrastructure
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.000]   to networking and secondary storage,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.800]   data analytics, AI, and more.
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.200]   That's what WWT's engineers do.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.400]   And that's what you can do too,
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.080]   because they offer labs as a service,
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.800]   a dedicated space within the ATC,
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.480]   where customers can perform their own programmatic testing.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.280]   It's amazing.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.720]   It's virtual too,
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.800]   so you can take full advantage of the ATC's benefits
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:17.320]   no matter where you are in the world
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.440]   at any time of the day or night.
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.880]   WWT's engineers work in these labs every day,
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.160]   beta testing new equipment,
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.080]   building reference architectures,
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.240]   and custom integrations to help their customers
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:31.000]   make decisions and see results faster
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   with much less investment.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:33.960]   No mystery.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   When you implement this stuff,
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.840]   you know it's going to work,
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:38.040]   because you've tested it.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.480]   WWT last summer launched this digital platform
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.720]   and includes the entire ATC ecosystem.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.760]   Creates a multiplier effect of knowledge,
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.360]   speed, and agility,
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.720]   anytime, anywhere around the world
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.480]   for all their customers and partners.

[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.680]   WWT is a real partner for your journey in technology.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.160]   They simplify the complex.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.320]   WWT.com/twit.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.160]   Worldwide technology.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.600]   Delivering business and technology
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.520]   outcomes around the world,
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.960]   and they're nice people too.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.160]   They're really a great company.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.720]   Beloved there in St. Louis.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:35.560]   Okay, got to put away the dancing baby.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.080]   Was dancing the whole time by the way.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:37.880]   I was doing that, Ed.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.400]   Good chuck up.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.720]   Some say it's still dancing even though.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.840]   I've heard that.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.320]   Wow, Apple and Sony,
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.760]   according to Bloomberg, Mark Gurman again,
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.160]   Apple and Sony both talked about buying
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:59.880]   Wondery, which is a podcast network
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.360]   producer, Dirty John and Dr. Death.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.840]   When I read this to Lisa, we both went,
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.000]   they asking price for Wondery.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.520]   I don't know how many podcasts they have.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.640]   Probably fewer than we do.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:15.160]   $300 to $400 million.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.640]   Oh my God.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.880]   I should get into podcasting.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.640]   Why does an Apple spend that money
[01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.320]   making its podcast app good?
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.200]   I say this is a person who uses Apple's podcast app
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.440]   religiously because it's what I've done.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.440]   But it needs to be so much better.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.760]   And it has had these same issues for years.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.680]   Yeah, got to love it.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.680]   Apple spent 10 years ignoring podcasting.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.400]   And now they're like, oh, I got a podcasting thing.
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.040]   I think it's hot.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:40.840]   We got a bunch.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.640]   We got a bunch.
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:44.520]   Just giving me the option to sort my podcast episodes
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:47.960]   by like either most recent or not most recent.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.800]   You get it in an annual podcast, Farris.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.240]   Pocketcast.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.200]   Pocketcast.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:52.840]   Pocketcast.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.320]   I spend three hours of, I know,
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.800]   but Apple shouldn't be this bad.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.760]   I guess I'll get podcasts.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.480]   But I spend three hours of every day scrolling back
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.000]   70 podcast episodes.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.160]   Oh, Parris, you remember a little thing called iTunes?
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.680]   I've heard of it.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.840]   You remember how bad that got?
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.200]   Truly it haunts my dream.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.640]   Haunt's my waking nightmare.
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.280]   And then instead of fixing it, rewriting it,
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.200]   do anything, these just chopped it up into chunks.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.680]   Now it's podcast music.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.560]   It's still just as bad TV.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.840]   Just as bad.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.160]   But now it's three times as many places.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.440]   No, it's so much more bad.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   Exactly.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.720]   This is so bad for you.
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.200]   Exactly.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.480]   So Spotify was also looking at buying Wonderie.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.200]   They bowed out.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.880]   Maybe the price was too high.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.080]   But Apple's got plenty of money.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.680]   There's putting too much money on Rogan.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.240]   Wow.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:41.240]   Wow.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:41.240]   Wow.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.440]   Wow.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.280]   Was that a good buy or not?
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.640]   For whom?
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.760]   100 million dollars it was rumored they're going to pay
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.440]   for Rogan over time.
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.720]   It seems like he's going to be okay.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.440]   I don't know if that was good investment of money for Spotify.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.000]   Well, there's certainly a good deal for Rogan.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.080]   Yeah, I can't.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.240]   I'm being happy for Joe, but they're facing some
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.960]   headwinds from their own employees who say,
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:13.160]   "This guy doesn't represent what we want to represent."
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.240]   He just interviewed Alex Jones,
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.680]   who's been banned.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.760]   Deep platform from YouTube, Twitter,
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.280]   faced by everywhere.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.280]   But Joe Rogan's given him a platform.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.440]   I just read an article in The Atlantic.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:31.720]   I think it was Zaneb Tuficke who said that Joe Rogan could well be a candidate for
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.160]   president in 2024.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:33.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.680]   I would not discount anything crazy like that.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.520]   If you all feel crazy about everything happening right now,
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.120]   Zaneb's work at The Atlantic,
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.040]   and I think she started a newsletter, it's fantastic.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.000]   She is.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:45.800]   Absolutely.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.840]   A vision of me.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.880]   She's so good.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.000]   I have to say, I'm not thrilled with her most recent article,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.160]   because if she's a visionary, then we're in trouble.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:59.240]   We're in deep trouble because she says, basically,
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.680]   let me see if I can find it.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.000]   Oh, America's next authoritarian will be much more competent.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.880]   Oh, boy.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.760]   But she was one of the first to write about masks.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.240]   No, she's just a sociologist, but she's just brilliant.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.240]   And she was the first to say,
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.400]   "You know, this mask thing is ridiculous.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.080]   We need to be wearing masks.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.040]   Why is this such a general in the United States saying,
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.480]   don't wear masks. They don't work.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.280]   They do work."
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:24.840]   So dumb.
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:30.040]   And because our early advice was like, save the masks only for health care,
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.840]   and that was literally the worst thing we can be telling people right now.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.080]   I mean, we needed it, and we needed it still.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.880]   We need the PPE, but you could have made a home,
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.640]   as I did, make homemade masks that would have been effective.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:49.560]   Yeah, she says, in 2024, look for Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton,
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.640]   or maybe Joe Rogan, she says, to run.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.080]   Oh, my God.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.840]   And actually, that's just given the things and everything that powered Trump.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.640]   Like, actually, Joe Rogan makes a ton of sense for a lot of people.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.200]   He'd be very popular.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.360]   Now, we've broken the seal on, like, celebrity president.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.560]   I guess we do a lot of that.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.600]   Oh, Ronald, that's what they brought.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.720]   Yeah, but still.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.560]   I need it, but like, even that, it felt different, right?
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.680]   Like, this feels like, you know, we could go on Capitolops.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.880]   Yeah, at least he'd been a governor.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.800]   He'd done some public service.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.840]   It wasn't bankrupt and evading his taxes.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.800]   Okay, that's a four years from now problem, but it is something to think about.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:36.280]   Most viewed all-time video on YouTube.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.160]   You got any guesses?
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.000]   Baby Shark.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:39.400]   You know.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.920]   Baby Shark.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.000]   I know, because I live it every day.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.840]   Oh, you have little kids.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.320]   Don't play it.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.200]   You have little kids.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.040]   Come on, everybody.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.080]   Come on.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.280]   It has seven billion views.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.360]   I thought, uh, uh-oh.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.080]   Uh-oh.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:57.720]   Uh-oh.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.280]   No.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.640]   Run for cover, Paris.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.720]   Run for cover.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.320]   Run for cover.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.360]   Here it comes.
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:11.000]   All right, I'll stop before the kids start.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.840]   I have multiple Baby Shark toys.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.520]   Like, it is, it's an epidemic.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.320]   It's pretty catchy.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.320]   Sure.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.280]   They got a good beat.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.600]   Opo, it was Opo Gangnam style
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.920]   that was the first to like cross a billion views, right?
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.840]   We just saw the-
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.040]   Oh, run for back in the days.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.560]   Those were the good old days.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.600]   Oh, innocence.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:38.200]   Um, let me see how many views that has these days.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.200]   That's that a-
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.880]   Wait a minute, this is a cartoon version.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.560]   Or is this it?
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.200]   Maybe this is-
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200]   There are a couple of different KNO style videos now.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:46.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.680]   This has 3.8 billion.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.520]   So it's-
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.400]   It's doing okay.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.280]   Yeah, I think this is it.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.320]   Oh, yeah, this is O.G.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.080]   We should mix this O.G.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.280]   That's funny.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.240]   It is.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.360]   It's eight years old.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.560]   Eight years old now.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.520]   Love it.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.600]   So, but in eight years,
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.480]   it only has been able to garner three billion views.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.560]   It's still pretty funny.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.400]   Literally the same exact time I bought my car.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:14.120]   My car is the oldest Gangnam style.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:14.520]   That's good.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.840]   That's my car is my Gangnam style car.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.960]   Baby Shark, 7.1 billion views.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.480]   And that's in only four years.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.560]   But this is-
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.200]   But this is why this is more successful.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.080]   Because how many times have your kids watched this?
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.600]   Devender.
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.480]   I mean, probably a thousand times each.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.440]   My daughter loves it.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.200]   But also it's like it's not just the YouTube.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.160]   It is it's an institution where there are ton of toys,
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.920]   ton of official toys are a lot of different-
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.680]   They're baby shark live shows.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.000]   Where they tour around and do-
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:47.960]   I don't even know what they do.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.320]   I'm pretty sure there are.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.040]   But yeah, it is-
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:50.840]   It's also two minutes long.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.400]   Did you get a little show out of it?
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:53.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.520]   The kids all just want to do the thing.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.240]   So as a battle,
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.960]   I didn't realize this between that and Despacito.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:08.600]   Which had billions and billions of views.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.280]   Devender, how many times have your kids watched that one?
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.400]   Actually quite a bit because my wife loves it.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.080]   But there's also a Sesame Street rendition of Despacito.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.040]   Which is like Spanish for Rubber Ducky, which is very good.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.080]   It's perfect.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.120]   I can see us entering Devindra's personal hell right now.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.200]   Despacito and baby shark warring.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.800]   And just throw pit bull in there and that's my hell.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.880]   There is.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.760]   I didn't realize this.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:40.920]   A Wikipedia article list of most viewed YouTube videos
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.440]   that you can use to keep up to date on this.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.160]   It has a section called the Billion View Club.
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.840]   It shows the top videos.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.120]   Despacito, $7 billion.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.000]   Oh, Johnny.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.840]   Johnny, yes, Papa is up there.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.880]   Oh, I'm in the-
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.120]   Johnny, I mean Johnny is a thing, yeah.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.800]   Johnny, I don't know that one.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.360]   Let's-
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.400]   Oh, it's first.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.120]   No, no, no, no.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:02.920]   That's from the-
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.400]   Actually, let me-
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:03.960]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.360]   Go back.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.640]   You need to click the link.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.080]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.200]   You know how to use-
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.480]   You know how to use this.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.600]   No, no, no, the 36.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:11.720]   36, there it is.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.360]   Click that.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:12.840]   Click this.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.040]   Oh, it's good, actually.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.320]   It's the best song for children.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:15.720]   How do you-
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.840]   Do you have kids, Paris?
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.480]   No.
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.280]   No.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.360]   I just remember when this-
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.200]   What do you get high and watch this?
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:22.920]   What do you do?
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.480]   I-
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.840]   It's like when we get high too.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.040]   This is like really boring-
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.160]   This is a bad trip.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:29.560]   This is a bad trip.
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.440]   It's really bad.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.880]   There was a version of this that was even more uncanny valley
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:36.200]   that took off online a couple of years ago
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.360]   and it was horrifying.
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.560]   It's like compared to the-
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.800]   Yeah, this is very slick.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.280]   The one that I'm thinking of is terrifying looking.
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.640]   Yeah, I think we're all just glad that the dancing baby still has it work.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.520]   Yeah, yeah, really it all comes back to the dancing baby.
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.280]   Wait a minute, that's not even an original.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.720]   This is like Barney.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.920]   They're using somebody else's tune.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:06.280]   I believe it's like an Indian company that just makes tons of webbitches and
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.000]   sees what hits.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.000]   And everything's a remix.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.600]   It's all algorithmic is what it is.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   So there are tons of these crazy baby videos.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.520]   They're just like pure algorithmic trash.
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.360]   So one of my things is just like keeping my daughter away from all this stuff.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.160]   So we're big into studio jibbly movies right now.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.200]   Like that's her thing.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.080]   Less stuff.
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:25.560]   Good.
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.600]   Except for everything.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.560]   So this is interesting then.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.080]   So have they somehow-
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.040]   These companies are they-
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.960]   They're not using any research or any even intuition.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.960]   They're just making so many things.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.240]   They have analytics that are just like those analytics videos.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.360]   It's a feed video.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.160]   What's hitting?
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:43.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.760]   There is a whole like subsection of kids' YouTube that is clearly just like
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:55.640]   shotly put together 3D animation and colors with computer generated sound and random sound effects.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:04.280]   That are just pumped out at high volume and then just in the hopes that it ends up in kids' YouTube feeds.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:10.440]   It's actually kind of a weird, large problem that when it comes to the top 10
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:17.560]   kids' YouTube channels, a lot of them it's hard to tell who is behind the company.
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.160]   Like behind the channel at all.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:26.280]   It'll be like a random LLC and no idea whatsoever what company or people are actually behind it.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.240]   The Wall Street Journal had a good piece a couple of years ago trying to find any of the people behind this.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.680]   And they could not.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.360]   Fascinating.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.400]   Let's go back in time.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.560]   It was a more innocent time.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.880]   YouTube had just emerged 2005-2006.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.120]   Here's a graph thanks to Wikipedia of the most viewed videos.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:51.640]   And by the way, we're starting in the low millions.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.640]   We never get higher than 19 million.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.000]   Oh, evolution of dance.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:55.640]   Remember that?
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.680]   Evolution of dance.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.120]   That's this one.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.080]   That's the pink one.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.120]   My Space the Movie.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.480]   Chronic of Narnia.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.120]   Narnia.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.680]   You're the only island that did such a great job of really getting these things.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.080]   And then Touch of Gold.
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.120]   I don't remember that one.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:17.800]   Actually, My Space the Movie looks like it was the big gainer in that time.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.720]   Do you remember that?
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.840]   Bigly.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.200]   And here's Charlie.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:22.920]   Charlie, a bit.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:31.000]   My finger came on strong in October 2008 and just owned the world by a year later.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.360]   Killing the evolution of the dance, which.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.000]   Remember to look at these graphs and think, what is wrong with us?
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.880]   This is somebody put a lot of effort into this.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.640]   Do a lot of research.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.440]   Probably one of the smartest things Google has ever done other than the
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.120]   inside of the original search engine, right?
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.520]   Like this, they own internet video.
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.560]   Like that's it.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.760]   They do own it, don't they?
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.480]   Yeah, but who cares?
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:54.120]   They do own it.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.080]   They totally own it.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.480]   Here's October 2009 through January 20th.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.960]   Now we're getting to billions, January 2013.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.840]   Charlie, a bit.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.280]   My finger keeping alive.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.800]   Baka, gang, a bad romance.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.800]   Baby.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.760]   I don't know what baby is.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.200]   Probably a Britney Spears, right?
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.840]   And then look at this green wedge.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.720]   That's a volcano style suddenly showing that a billion was within reach.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:22.680]   And then we have the most recent.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.760]   It's rock.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.240]   You're turning human evolution right now.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.120]   This is something.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:28.920]   This is telling.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.120]   I will argue about evolution or devolution.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:32.600]   Still, keep it up.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.160]   That's amazing.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:33.720]   Yeah, baby.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.520]   What is baby?
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.240]   Baby, baby, baby.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.920]   That doesn't be a song.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.480]   Bieber.
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.440]   It's Bieber, baby.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.120]   Bieber, baby.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.000]   And here's Gangnam Style.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.960]   Kind of, you know, still going up and leveled off a little bit.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.640]   See you again.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.160]   The orange is Despacito.
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.840]   But look at this.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.760]   Despacito and baby shark in a battle to the finish.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.360]   And baby shark now on top.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.160]   I can't believe I just spent five minutes on that.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.200]   Thank you, Leah.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.400]   We're all so much smarter for this.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.200]   Thank you.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:07.560]   Oh, what a world we live in.
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:09.320]   We need this, actually.
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:09.800]   We need this.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.400]   I'm looking for stuff like this, to be honest with you at this point.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.240]   Yeah, I just want to lean hard into smooth brain for a little bit.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:17.880]   Smooth brain.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.760]   Smooth brain.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.240]   Smooth brain.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.200]   Smooth brain.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.000]   No problems.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.440]   You lose.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.760]   Play Hades on your switches.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.760]   Everybody Hades is perfect.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:33.400]   So this week, last week, I had to get up early at five to order an iPhone Pro Max or maybe mini.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:42.360]   I got up at 8am here in the east coast to get my iPhone 12 Pro.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.400]   Oh, look, Purdy.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:43.800]   Hi.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:45.640]   Is that the Max or just the regular?
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.160]   It's just the Pro, just the regular.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:47.640]   Just the regular.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.520]   That's, I got my mom.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:52.120]   I got a fancy case on it though, that like quad lock case.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.160]   And I can attach it to my bike because I just got a really nice.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:55.880]   Oh, nice.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.360]   Are e-bikes the best thing in the world?
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.240]   I don't know how they are in Brooklyn.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:13:59.960]   E-bikes are.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:00.840]   And I love them.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.400]   I used to be, I was never a biker in New York because people here are crazy,
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.680]   but when I was a pandemic hit, it became the only mode of transportation.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.320]   Good point.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:15.400]   And especially because a lot of people have, I don't know, left in traffic isn't that much here.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.440]   It's a lot easier.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.280]   So I upgraded to an e-bike recently from Wing Bikes.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.400]   And it's been phenomenal.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.440]   I just got the Wing Freedom X, which is their newest edition came out last month.
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.160]   And it is a perfect machine.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.680]   It's pedal assist.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.960]   They've got so many different levels.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:38.200]   It is like a built-in screen to it that'll show you how fast you're going in your battery level.
[01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:38.280]   Okay.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.800]   Here's the most important thing.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.920]   Do you have a throttle?
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:48.040]   It has a throttle, but I can't legally say whether or not I have it attached because that would not be for New York.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.080]   In California, it could still be a bicycle.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.120]   It can only go 20 miles an hour and can have a throttle, but you have to have pedals.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.840]   The throttle is so important when you're at a stoplight because you don't have to go,
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.400]   to get going, you just throttle up, get moving, and then you can pedal the rest of the way.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.280]   I love throttle, so hook it up.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.120]   Just be a lawbreaker.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:08.840]   Go ahead.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.240]   Do it.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.360]   Yeah, mine's been hooked up.
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.240]   I got it.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:11.800]   No.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.760]   Throwing is awesome.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.320]   Right.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.000]   I love it that they put it in the box and they say, but in your state, don't hook it up.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.600]   Whatever you do.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:19.160]   Just be good.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:19.880]   Just be good.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.760]   Can I ask you how much?
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.320]   I think it was...
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.240]   They're expensive.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.600]   They're really expensive.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:33.800]   Honestly, wing of freedom, their freedom X was actually not that expensive.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.480]   Starting at 12.98.
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.840]   That's very good for an e-bike.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:47.400]   And I think I got the fancy insurance or whatever for it, so it ended up being like 1,500 or something
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:47.880]   like that.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.400]   Really not bad at all.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:57.240]   And it has built into the stem there, built in lights.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:57.880]   I love it.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.440]   It's really huge.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.400]   The battery power is both the rear and the front lights,
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.960]   because that's so much more safe in a city.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.360]   And they haven't updated their website yet,
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.920]   because you can see on there, it looks like it has the little
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.320]   thing that comes off the handlebars.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:17.080]   But the new version built into the stem is a screen that turns on whenever you turn on your bike.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.160]   And the new version, right there in the middle of the stem, it has the thing.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.200]   It's not there anymore.
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.320]   It's really cool.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:25.800]   Nice.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.200]   It's been my favorite purchase of the last car.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.400]   I love e-bikes.
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.000]   I love e-bikes.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.400]   I have a rad power, which is a little more expensive.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   I bought it, though, because also it was less than...
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:43.400]   Our son is a senior in high school, has a specialized e-bike.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.880]   And it was so expensive.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.320]   I like my rad power, but we're going to review...
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:57.560]   I think it's Ant just got the new Van Muf.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.480]   No, wait a minute.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:16:59.960]   That's what you...
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:00.440]   Beautiful.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.200]   Is it the Van Muf?
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.440]   Yeah, it's a Dutch one.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.680]   I was looking at this, but they're really backed up right now.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.200]   I mean, deliver, because everybody, I think, is buying bikes right now.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.240]   We're going to review it on a hands-on tech.
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.000]   You know what?
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.640]   I think we should just get rid of cars and all ride bikes.
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.680]   I agree.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.120]   Big fan of bikes.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.400]   I have this fantasy.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.600]   Some day that the freeways in California will be...
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.920]   Cars will be banned, and we can all just ride our bikes.
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:27.800]   It'll be so great.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.840]   I think I'm using the bike right now.
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.200]   Wife got out of the dump.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.880]   Yeah, no, you need a better bike, Dan.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.040]   Yeah, a better bike.
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:36.840]   No, I can't remember.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.680]   Are you in Western Massachusetts?
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:39.880]   No, I'm just outside Boston.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.240]   So it's...
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:41.800]   Can you bike?
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:42.040]   Is it...
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.760]   We ride a bike around sometimes.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.440]   There's some good bike paths in the area, too,
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.440]   including ones they do go out pretty far.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.240]   So my wife and I do occasionally take the bikes out and just hit the road.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.280]   There's some nice ones, Render.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.960]   How do we get into this?
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:56.680]   I don't remember.
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.400]   How do we get started talking about bikes?
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.160]   I guess I was going to ask you...
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.040]   Oh, that's right.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.480]   We're talking about ordering the iPhone.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:10.360]   And now I'm thinking I got to get up early on the 11th at midnight
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.160]   to try to get in line to order a PS5.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.840]   Xbox or PS5?
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:15.720]   So which...
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.840]   Devendra, you're a gamer.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.280]   Which one are you going for?
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.960]   Yeah, I mean, I reviewed both.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.920]   They're both sitting in my...
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.000]   You know, Dan right now over here.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:23.720]   What?
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.440]   They're very good.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:24.920]   They're refueling them both.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.680]   I've reviewed them both.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:26.920]   And I guess...
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.880]   Are you allowed to talk about them other than the box or...?
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:30.360]   The embargo.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.240]   The embargo got lifted on the Xbox a couple of days ago.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.240]   The embargoes on those things are the most insane and laughable things I've heard in a while.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.720]   I got the page 20 page PDF from SOTY with this.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.200]   It's amazing.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:40.600]   Oh my god.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.560]   But you're truly amazing.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.120]   But the embargoes up on the PS5 too now as well.
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.800]   Yep. Reviews are up for both.
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.040]   Go check out my videos because it's some of the longest videos
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.560]   and longest reviews I've ever done.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.520]   But I'm not going to pick a side because that's the thing.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:57.560]   And I actually scored them exactly the same because these are gaming computers
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.560]   that are running basically the same hardware.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.120]   They both have AMD Zen 2 processors.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.240]   They both have RDNA 2 graphics, you know.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   So they're very, very similar.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.680]   It's just like a couple of little design tweaks here and there where I think they're different.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.400]   I really lean to the Xbox Series X just because I'm more of an Xbox gamer.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.720]   I like Game Pass, which is their subscription.
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.480]   You pay 15 bucks a month for that in Xbox Live and you get a ton of games
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.680]   and all the first party games.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.880]   It seems like a no-brainer purchase for any Xbox gamer.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.840]   And it's great.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.640]   Like it's fast.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:30.120]   It does work.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.520]   Hey, well, it has all the ray tracing hardware we need.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.280]   There aren't many games right now that fully take advantage of this hardware.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.320]   I think that's the big downside for Xbox.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.640]   Whereas PS5 has like, it's Sony.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.000]   Sony's always good with the big first party games that people want to play.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.120]   So they've got Miles Morales, Spider-Man.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.800]   They have Demon's Souls coming up.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.760]   So those are things you'd want to buy a new system for.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.520]   They're both giant boxes.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.280]   These are PCs under your TV.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.920]   This is a hysterical humble brag.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.960]   Shops.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:00.520]   Oh man.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.160]   Because not only do the PS5 in the middle,
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.040]   but you've got this.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.800]   I could see the Series X in this corner and the Series S in this corner.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.600]   That's not my living room.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.240]   Oh, okay.
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:09.800]   It's a good shot.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:11.160]   That's a hell of a humble brag.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.680]   Oh yeah, I got them all.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.800]   That's our executive editor, Aaron Seporis.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.160]   And he is, he helped me with the photos because he's just much better at that.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.480]   But these things are huge.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.920]   You need so much room for them.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.480]   So I think that's something people just have to get over.
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.200]   I prefer the Xbox's design because it's just a box.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.560]   But the PlayStation 5, it is ridiculous.
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.600]   It's a massive.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:33.640]   It's huge.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.160]   In fact, that's like massive.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.880]   That's exactly what the tower case of the gaming,
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.000]   the Razer gaming PC I got for our son, is looked just like that.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:45.080]   My Razer gaming PC is not covered by cheap plastics.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:45.400]   Right.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.920]   So I feel like that's the thing.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:51.000]   It's, they're both, they have very cheap plastic side panels.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.640]   You could pull it off, stick it in a new NVMe SSD down the line to like give it faster storage.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.880]   The best thing about these consoles, they're both running NVMe SSDs.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.440]   No more.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.000]   Right.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.360]   Old, ugly, slow laptop hard drives.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.160]   No more of those.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160]   So they're fast.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.680]   They load games super quickly.
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.960]   They're both doing interesting things when it comes to speeding up load time.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.600]   So Microsoft has quick resume, which lets you jump between games pretty easily.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.280]   Sony's load speeds in general just seem super fast.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:26.680]   So Spiderman loads like from title to gameplay 15 seconds or so.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.160]   And there's no loading in the game itself.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.320]   Like there is, you'll be in Manhattan.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.200]   You'll go into a building.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.000]   You'll zip right out back into Manhattan.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:35.480]   Nothing.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.080]   So it's almost magic.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:37.880]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.560]   Oh man.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:44.680]   You know, it's interesting how it comes down to like everything else in gaming.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.280]   It's very narrow slices.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:54.120]   So if you're playing, if you want Spiderman, you're going to get, you got to get a PS5.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.200]   I mean, there's just, if you, the exclusives are going to drive a lot of sales.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:04.440]   I'm driven as you were by the, in fact, I was going to do the $35 series X deal because...
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.320]   It's a good deal.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:05.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.080]   You pay less for the hardware.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.680]   You actually get a break on the hardware.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:10.920]   And then you have to, you're subscribing to there.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:16.760]   But for me, different gamers are different, but I am not going to buy a title.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.080]   Paul Theratby's Call of Duty, he'll buy Call of Duty Cold War.
[01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.360]   And just play that nonstop for four years or something.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:25.480]   That's it.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.960]   For me, I'm not as, that's serious about a game.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.120]   I want to try a bunch of different games.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.320]   You want Game Pass, Leo.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.920]   So the Game Pass makes sense, right?
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.040]   Yep.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:34.520]   For sure.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.040]   One flat rate.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:36.840]   I have to say that...
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:40.200]   Is it worry you at all to not own any of your games, though?
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.480]   Because I mean, that's my...
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.440]   I don't own anything.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.720]   I always, I don't own your...
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.240]   I guess you don't own your TV shows.
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.840]   You own your music.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.920]   I feel like I'm usually happy after I play a game for a while to sort of sit back and like,
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.760]   not have to worry about it anymore.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.160]   I mean, I've had an Xbox One for years and like,
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.200]   I've played a bunch of games on it and it's nice to be able to finally be like,
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.240]   "Yeah, I'm done with that."
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.480]   And like, I never know what to do with them afterwards.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:02.600]   Do I say, like, you can't...
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.800]   Preselling most of them these days, it's not worth that much.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.040]   So I don't mind you having the option.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.560]   When I look in my cupboard and there's the Assassin's Creed,
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:17.480]   15 different Assassin Creed, it's like, I only buy the Halo...
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.080]   Also, the Game Pass game is great forever.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.000]   You're the Master Chief Collection.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.680]   I got 18 DVDs.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.400]   With Game Pass, by the way, you could still buy...
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.480]   If you really love a game, because it's like, it's a cycle of titles.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.240]   If you love a game, you can buy it.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.360]   You have to buy it if you want to keep playing it.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.000]   Discount.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.280]   But they don't leave that quickly.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.320]   So if you want to play a game for a month or two,
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:42.760]   you can just play it on Game Pass and all the first party games are just there.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:46.520]   They're not going anywhere because that's the Microsoft's big draw.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.880]   So I think that's good.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.320]   They're getting Bethesda games soon.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.720]   That's what actually sold me.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.480]   Because I'm a Skyrim fan.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.480]   And when they bought Bethesda...
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:56.680]   We're going to be waiting what?
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.520]   Another decade or two for the Skyrim game?
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.000]   I know.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.600]   I know.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.960]   But they own it, right?
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.920]   So I don't know.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.480]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.680]   I feel like this argument,
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:11.160]   so Sony has always really led with the killer games that people want to play
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.320]   like Uncharted and Last of Us and everything.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.760]   But with Bethesda...
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:15.240]   That's great.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.400]   Things are getting interesting.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.760]   Now tell me about Miles Morales,
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.240]   because the ray tracing in that, the videos I've seen,
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.520]   looks pretty spectacular.
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.920]   I presume you reviewed it on a 4K HDR screen.
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.640]   Oh yeah.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.640]   Actually, so it worked out really well,
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:34.280]   because I had LG's latest CX OLEDs in my basement to test.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.520]   So I was like, okay, perfect for these systems.
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:40.200]   That has HDMI 2.1, so it can do 4K up to 120 Hertz.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.160]   And that's the big draw.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.120]   Just look at the charmed life.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.000]   Oh my god.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:43.960]   It's just so jealous.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.600]   Super good.
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.320]   It's pretty good.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:50.440]   But I also have spent the last week just writing like a crazy person.
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.440]   So I reviewed the heck out of these things.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.680]   Miles Morales ray tracing.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:55.960]   I feel like ray tracing is this thing.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.840]   We're all going to have to learn to live with.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.600]   Because it looks great, but it's running the game at 30 FPS.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:06.120]   You don't like Spider-Man did on the PS4.
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:08.760]   There is a 60 FPS mode, but there is no ray tracing.
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:11.480]   Because ray tracing is so hard, we're intensive.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.600]   And honestly, I'd rather play the 60 FPS mode,
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.800]   because it's Spider-Man.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.720]   You're zipping through this city.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.360]   So that's the big thing gamers will have to learn this year,
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.080]   is that 30 FPS gaming, you'll get some great,
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.720]   you'll get 4K rendering, you'll get ray tracing in there.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.400]   But if you want the pastor frame rate,
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.560]   which I think just looks better to most people,
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.880]   you'll probably have to sacrifice a lot.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.840]   I had no idea.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.080]   So you're going to really stop down the frame rate
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.600]   in order to do the ray tracing.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.400]   So you either get to enjoy the game or enjoy the lighting.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.400]   Pretty much.
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.360]   Pretty much.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:46.120]   And honestly, I feel like we're going to see some games kind of balance how they do this.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:51.160]   So I feel like Spider-Man, if they give us a 1080p mode with ray tracing,
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.280]   that was 60 FPS.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.800]   I think the hardware could handle that.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.880]   And I don't mind it being 1080p.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.440]   Just look at the reflections there.
[01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:58.920]   Look at this.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.800]   It's beautiful.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:25:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.840]   Oh my god.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.800]   But you see that, well, the tearing's probably me, but that's...
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.080]   It wouldn't.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.800]   And when you're climbing up skyscrapers with ray tracing on,
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.360]   you could see Spider-Man's reflection of the whole city.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.000]   It's beautiful.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   But I want it to succeed.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:13.480]   Yes.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.040]   It's more about scenery than it is about gameplay.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.000]   So yeah, that's interesting.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.880]   My one strange contribution to this is I learned the other day
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:22.600]   from my friend Matthew Olson, who's a writer at US gamer,
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.880]   that apparently Tetris,
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:27.480]   the new Tetris will also have ray tracing enabled in one level.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.800]   So that you're a blocks and shine with all the colors of life.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.880]   That was the strangest thing about the Microsoft reveal of this summer.
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:39.240]   You know, we're watching these all these, you know, AAA games,
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.520]   and then they show Tetris.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.880]   They show Tetris.
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:42.920]   And hey, I was playing...
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.640]   Tetris.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.600]   I was playing Geometry Wars on the Xbox Series X,
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:52.680]   which is Xbox One launch title because they have this AI-driven auto HDR feature,
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:55.000]   which brings HDR into all your older games.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.440]   So playing Geometry Wars on an OLED with that HDR pop of color and light,
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.480]   it's beautiful.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.440]   It is an amazing thing.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.280]   So that's another big benefit of the Xbox side.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:07.000]   Well, you have not helped me decide.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.040]   Yeah, I would say it's a great-
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.840]   It's a great owner, but like the Miles Morales thing is like,
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.440]   in the Spider-Man games, we're enough to feel like-
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.000]   It's a great demo.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.200]   That's tempts me so much.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.960]   And I love the little Spider-Man.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.400]   Sony's controller, Sony's controller, which I have right here,
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.800]   this thing is beautiful.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.320]   And it feels really good.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.160]   And they did a great job of basically giving us next gen haptics.
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.920]   So the triggers can like,
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.080]   they can really manipulate the tension on this.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.240]   So if you're pulling back a bow in a game, you can really feel it.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.080]   There's a game, Astro's Playroom, which comes with the system.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.360]   You can really feel the haptics where if you're walking in sand
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.320]   versus walking on metal or wood or something,
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.080]   you could feel it in the controller.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.160]   So I think Sony's done a smart job here.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.480]   And it's their first controller that doesn't look like.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.000]   The original PlayStation controller too.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.160]   So yeah, shout out to them for that, finally.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.280]   Paris, can I get the code to visit your island?
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.680]   I haven't played Animal Crossing in forever.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.880]   I'll clean up the cockroaches.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:09.960]   Absolutely covered in three months worth of weaves and cockroaches.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.920]   And whatever else you have.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:13.160]   There's no ray tracing on the Nintendo Switch.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.040]   I can assure you.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:20.200]   I did recently just get the Switch, the ring fit.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:21.800]   For the Switch.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.160]   And I feel sensitive.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.200]   It's wonderful.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:28.680]   I love the fact that for the ring, you can push it in and out.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.040]   Yeah, it's a good exercise.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.120]   Shockingly good exercise.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.360]   I thought it was going to be more of a gimmick.
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.080]   Oh, it's fun.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:35.800]   No, it works.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:38.920]   Actually, I'm looking forward to Apple's going to release Fitness Plus.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.920]   And probably in next four weeks.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.760]   And that's going to be really interesting with the Apple Watch.
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:43.640]   It's another one more thing.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.600]   One more thing.
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.840]   One more more thing.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.520]   They could actually do a December event.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.640]   Let's go for it, Apple.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.360]   Why not?
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.400]   We got new ones to leave.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.120]   Not off the table.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:52.600]   Not off the table.
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.480]   Don't give them any ideas.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.000]   Not off the table.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.840]   It's great to have Paris Martina with us from the information,
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:01.960]   from Engadget,
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.720]   to vendor Hardowar,
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.160]   Dan Morin,
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:06.200]   six colors.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:06.600]   What is it?
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.880]   This is a nice way to decompress after a very stressful week.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.600]   I'm glad you're here.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.640]   You're all here.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.160]   Our show today brought to you by Wasabi Hot Cloud.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:20.600]   Storage.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:22.600]   If you are one of those companies we are,
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.760]   where you're generating a lot of data
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.440]   in a fairly consistent way,
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.360]   you know, we know there's going to be another terabyte every week of Twitch shows.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.120]   You're probably thinking,
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:32.680]   "Why am I?
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:34.360]   I'm just buying more hard drives every week.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.240]   What am I doing here?"
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.080]   Look at Wasabi.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.680]   Look at Hot Cloud Storage.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:40.280]   Wasabi is so economical,
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.080]   it actually costs less than just the maintenance fees on that on-prem storage.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.760]   And I would argue it's more secure,
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:50.200]   more reliable than any on-prem solution.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:52.280]   This is cloud done right.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:55.080]   80% cheaper than Amazon S3,
[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.760]   about as much as five or six times faster.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.320]   It uses Amazon's API,
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.840]   but it doesn't charge for that.
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:05.160]   It doesn't charge for egress.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.960]   It's always the thing that bugs me in a lot of cloud storage is,
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.320]   "Oh, look, it's cheap to store it there,
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.200]   but if you want it back,
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.200]   you're going to pay not with Wasabi."
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.960]   No charge for egress.
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.960]   And I think it's significantly more
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.400]   secure.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.200]   11 nines of durability.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.320]   11 nines.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.920]   I don't know if you can get better than that.
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:23.800]   That means on average,
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.920]   you'd lose one file maybe every 649,000 years.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.800]   I don't know what's going to be,
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.840]   what the planet Earth's going to look like at 649,000 years.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.440]   But all your files will still be there.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.920]   All your data is hosted in Premiere,
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.000]   Tier 4 data center facilities,
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   not only highly secure, but they're fully redundant.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:43.640]   That's a good thing,
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.520]   because Wasabi has active integrity checking,
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:51.160]   every object stored on Wasabi's check for integrity every 90 days.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.920]   And because they're in redundant data centers,
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.560]   if one bit goes missing, you can get it back.
[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.200]   You can get it back.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.080]   Try that with your on-prem storage.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.960]   Wasabi follows industry's best security models
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.400]   and design practices.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.080]   They have access control mechanisms
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.400]   like bucket policies and ACLs.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.360]   You're the best thing.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:08.840]   I love this.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.040]   Your data is immutable.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:15.400]   So ransomware hackers, fumbled-fingered employees,
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.520]   your drunk self at three in the morning,
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.440]   cannot change your data.
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:22.360]   So it's safe.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.960]   In fact, they encrypt automatically
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.360]   whether you request it or not at rest.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.280]   Wasabi's HIPAA compliant,
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.520]   FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.640]   It is the best way to store data.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.440]   A flat fee?
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.160]   So you always know exactly how much it's going to cost.
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.000]   Or you could save even more
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.880]   with something they call reserved capacity storage.
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:42.760]   If you know,
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.840]   I'm going to be using this much data every month
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.680]   for the next forever,
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.680]   you can buy storage ahead of time
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.240]   in increments of one, three, or five years.
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.280]   The discounts go up for the more capacity
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.640]   and the longer the term.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.200]   So it's another way to save even more with wasabi.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.640]   And if you're a managed service provider
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.160]   and you sell storage,
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:01.960]   you'll love it too,
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.920]   because you'll be making more and charging less.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:07.720]   Wasabi's not just highly secure,
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.920]   disruptive technology
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.280]   that's turning the industry nuts here.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.080]   It's storage that's 80% less expensive
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:16.680]   and up to six times the speed of the industry leader.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.200]   You calculate the savings for yourself.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.560]   You can start a free trial of storage for a month at wasabi.com.
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.080]   I love these guys.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.960]   They're founder David Friend's a long time friend.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.960]   He's so impressive, so smart.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.280]   And his CTO, Jeff Flowers,
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:33.000]   they really invented something transformational.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:33.720]   Join the movement.
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.360]   Migrate your data to the cloud and do it with confidence.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.280]   W-A-S-A-B-I wasabi.com.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:40.840]   Do me a favor.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.200]   Use the offer code TWIT
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:43.640]   when you do that free trial.
[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.440]   That way they'll know you saw it on this week in tech.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:47.480]   wasabi.com
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.640]   offer code TWIT.
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.920]   Thank you wasabi.
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.240]   We had a good week, a great week,
[01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:55.800]   nay, a fantastic week on TWIT.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.960]   We even made a little video for you to watch,
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:00.040]   so you'll feel bad that you missed any of it.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:00.360]   Watch.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.040]   How thankful are we to be together on this Tuesday night
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.560]   with nothing going on in the world?
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:07.480]   And all we can do is talk about all of that,
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.040]   Android.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:09.320]   Like it's a great life.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.120]   The most important news today is definitely Android news.
[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.440]   And that's why all of that Android doesn't stop,
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:18.360]   not for November 3rd, 2020 previously on TWIT.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.080]   This week in Enterprise Tech,
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:23.000]   are you ready for disaster recovery?
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.440]   Well, the pandemic period has put us on high alert
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.040]   and we'll take you through nine
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.840]   cyber disaster recovery planning tips to help you out.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:33.000]   Hands on iOS.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.600]   I am going to show you Apple's new subscription bundle service.
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.040]   It's Apple One.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.000]   Here's how you get it.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.040]   What?
[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:43.720]   Hands on Android.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.680]   Coming up, I'm going to show you how to take an old device
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.360]   that's gathering dust and turn it into a home automation control center.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.360]   This week in Google.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.200]   The Ring Video Storebells.
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.320]   They're going to pilot a program in Jackson, Mississippi
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:02.680]   with a local police to live stream Amazon's Ring cameras.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.160]   Not all about the people that actually own Ring, though.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:05.800]   You know?
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.360]   What if I get murdered in my house and you don't discover the body?
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:13.720]   You would still like to see who came and went, right?
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.680]   I just want you to know it'll almost certainly be my wife.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:19.480]   TWIT.
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:23.080]   And she's got a very credible excuse.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:26.040]   He just wouldn't stop talking.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:37.080]   Join us every week for all of our shows on TWIT.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.680]   And thanks to our great editors,
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:41.080]   because they put that together every week.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.680]   In fact, the holidays are coming.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.400]   You know what that means?
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.480]   Our best ofs are just around the corner.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.160]   We've got some fun stuff on all of our shows.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.200]   Let's see.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:54.360]   Anything more to say?
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.000]   I don't think about the PS5 or the Xbox Series X.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.360]   You probably already know which one you would get if you could get one,
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.080]   which you can't.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.480]   So forget about it.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:08.680]   I think the main thing, by the way, is that there is no big rush for this stuff.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.040]   But especially, I've talked a lot of PC gamers who are like,
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.480]   "I really want to pick up a new console."
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:18.040]   But you guys, if you have a decent, you know, a recent Nvidia video card
[01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:22.360]   or something with an RTX, then you have most of these features already.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.800]   So yeah, don't worry.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.200]   Don't sweat it until the really great dreams come out.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:30.360]   Gaming must be huge right now because video cards are sold out.
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.440]   There's just a land rush for these consoles for the new RTX.
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.040]   I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.000]   Even the AMD Ryzen chips, boom, sold out like that.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.600]   Obviously, it's good news, I guess, for the tech industry.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.960]   People are spending money on tech.
[01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:46.440]   Actually, makes it a lot to do.
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.600]   There's nothing I find myself to the same thing.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.120]   I'm not eating out.
[01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:53.560]   So money that I'm not spending on things like travel and eating out,
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.160]   I'm spending on upgrading my environment at home.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:57.800]   Why not?
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.840]   I was trying to buy a flight stick to play Star Wars Squadrons with,
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:01.800]   and they are now.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.280]   They're gone.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:02.760]   Nope.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.560]   They're all gone.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.200]   They're all gone.
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.640]   But I don't think that's because of squadrons.
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.440]   I think that's because of those.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.240]   No, like flight simulator.
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.000]   Yeah, Microsoft's flight simulator.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.240]   I just got hit by the follow on effect there.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.120]   Oh, you want to play Star Wars?
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:14.680]   No problem.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:15.480]   We'll get you one.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.120]   No problem.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:25.320]   In California, we passed Prop 22, and there's been a lot of hand ringing from labor advocates.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.640]   But I think there's also, I mean, this is a tough one.
[01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:29.880]   I voted yes on Prop 22.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.680]   This is the one that said Uber and Lyft drivers
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:36.120]   can be employed as independent contractors.
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.480]   They don't have to be, as California Employment Law has said,
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.680]   and AB 5 in particular, they don't have to be employees.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.240]   And I'll tell you why I voted yes, because I know so many people in our business,
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:54.680]   freelance tech journalists who, if they lived in California, lost gigs, lost work,
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:57.640]   because they were covered by these crazy laws.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.480]   They can only write so many articles before the company would have to hire them.
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:04.760]   And as you guys all know, you work in the business.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.840]   Most of the people who write for tech publications are freelancers.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.440]   You guys are staffers.
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.880]   Well, Dan, I don't know what you're--
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:12.840]   No, I'm a freelancer.
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:13.720]   You're a freelancer, yeah.
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:19.240]   Nevertheless, I saw Robert Reich, former Clinton Labor Secretary, and others
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.400]   bemoaning this.
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.440]   Like, this is going to be the end of the labor movement in the United States.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.560]   Did I do the wrong thing?
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.320]   I think it's tricky to sort of distinguish,
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.400]   because there's certainly circumstances where these people feel like it feels like they should
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.240]   have the option for things like benefits.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.480]   And I know Prop 22 did allow some benefits to sort of trickle down.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:44.040]   And there is a freedom aspect of being able to have either the choice of being an employee.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:49.480]   But it still does feel to a certain extent that when it comes to the ride-sharing companies
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:52.440]   and those kinds of gig economies, the sort of new gig economy stuff,
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.720]   that there is a lot of advantage being taken of labor markets.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.040]   But it's not cut and dry.
[01:37:58.040 --> 01:37:59.080]   I think it's the big problem.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.520]   It's like they wanted to kind of apply a one-solution-fits-all approach to it.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.120]   And it turns out it's more complicated than that, unsurprisingly.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:11.720]   I'll tell you that Lyft and Uber spent a lot of money on ads.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:19.240]   They even got the chairman of the Mothers Against Drunk Driving
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:24.360]   to come out in support of it, because she said, "People can't take Ubers and Lyft.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.360]   They're going to get on the road and kill our children."
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.160]   And it's like, "Well, I can't vote for that. I got a better vote for that."
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:34.840]   I have mixed feelings, because I do believe in the labor movement.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.080]   I don't want people to be taken advantage of.
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.680]   Is it foolish of me to say, "But Lyft and Uber drivers are choosing that?"
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:46.040]   And obviously, if they choose it, they like it.
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:50.200]   Or am I just--
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:56.120]   Yeah, I think it's challenging, because I can imagine a lot of people who do want the security
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.200]   of a full-time job from these things.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.760]   But certainly, the flexibility is proving to be one of the things that a lot of the people who are
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.760]   doing these kinds of work want.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:06.440]   They want the ability to set their own hours.
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:11.400]   They want their ability to work when they feel like it and not have to go in for a 9-5 job,
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.680]   which is totally understandable.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:20.120]   Honestly, I feel like so much of this potentially could be solved if you had something like
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.600]   socialized healthcare, for example, where you wasn't tied to your employment status.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.360]   So maybe this isn't a symptom, not the root cause.
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:34.520]   Uber and Lyft would not exist if they had to pay a fair wage, if they were responsible for benefits.
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:40.520]   The way it works, you own the car, you pay the insurance, you pay the cash, they give you a
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:41.320]   pittance.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.400]   It's not like they're making a profit even at this point.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.400]   But they still lose a huge amount of money.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.840]   They said, and I think it's fairly credible, if this does not pass, we're leaving California.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:53.880]   So I don't know.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:00.280]   California had just passed a law saying, or a judge rather, had just ruled that they do have to pay.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.520]   They can't be contract employees.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.560]   They do have to pay for wages.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.640]   But I think this law overturns that.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:08.680]   Furthermore, and this is something that's kind of nasty about it,
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.120]   it is a lock-in.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:17.800]   It says this can only be overturned by the state legislature with 7/8 of the legislature.
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:18.600]   Wow.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.040]   That's crazy.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.160]   Talk about a super majority.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.400]   That's, you might as well say, it's got to be unanimous.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.720]   Paris, you live in Brooklyn.
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.320]   I'm sure you take Ubers or used to anyway, take Ubers and lifts, right?
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.840]   I mean, it's, I think, a really complicated issue because,
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:44.600]   I mean, as you said, these companies wouldn't exist if they did not from the get-go kind of
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:53.800]   source their labor from this strange gray area in current labor laws where they have employees
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:59.800]   that are working essentially full-time hours, but for not the same sort of minimum wage or just
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:02.520]   wages generally that you'd expect with full-time work.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:06.280]   And that traps a lot of people in a precarious situation.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:14.920]   And I know that a lot of labor groups that support these workers are made up of contract drivers
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:22.360]   fought against Prop 22 solely because they wanted a kind of different option.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:27.320]   Some of them contended that if these companies were forced to, they could figure out a way to
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:30.040]   make the job is flexible and still pay benefits.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:35.480]   I mean, you, I'd certainly hope that for all of the innovation, for all the things we
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.080]   law these companies with, oh, wow, they're able to make this kind of new app.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:46.040]   Like, they should also maybe be able to make it create a business that works
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:51.720]   in current labor laws. But I guess there's always the option of changing the labor laws to fit the
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.080]   business, which is what happened in this case.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:02.200]   You know, I feel I don't know what that you know, I like to take Uber and Lyft.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:07.240]   I don't want him to go out of business. Well, I don't these days, but my daughter does.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:12.600]   I would prefer to have her take Lyft and drive a car. It's very expensive. She can't afford it.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.640]   You know, she takes mass transit whenever possible, but she has a late shift. She's going to have to
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:27.400]   take Lyft home. You know, taxis are not widespread in California. And I don't think being a taxi
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.320]   driver is a walk in the park either, for that matter.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:36.840]   No, it's been really tougher taxi drivers in New York. Like, that's one of the, it's an ongoing
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:44.280]   thing because of, was it the actual value of the medallions, just dramatically plummeted or
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:49.640]   something? So yeah, that's been a major problem all around. Hey, these are big, tough problems.
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:55.000]   AB5, I just know from having a lot of freelancer friends in California and people who write for
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.480]   California-based sites, you know, that really made their lives incredibly difficult. That thing
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:04.440]   was just kind of a disaster. It was not designed at all for that. Like, it did not have any
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:09.480]   understanding of how that job market works at all. That was really what swayed me. And people like
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:16.840]   Mike Elgin, who, you know, our own Aunt Pruitt, who used to live in North Carolina, was able to
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:22.200]   write for Tech Republic. As soon as he moved to California, Tech Republic said, because of AB5,
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:29.720]   the bill that put this in effect, they said, "We can't, you're out of work. We can't use you." Because
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:34.040]   of these restrictions on how we can use you. I understand, I'd be really great if Tech
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.680]   Republic could hire Anne as a full-time employee. It'd be really great if Mike Elgin could get
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:42.760]   benefits in a job and all that. But that's just not how, at least in my business, in our business,
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:48.280]   the Tech business, that's just not how it works. Almost everybody who's on our shows is a contract
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:56.200]   employee. And they want to be. They're happy. Yeah, I worked full-time at Macworld for seven
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:01.240]   years. And I enjoyed that. But I really love the flexibility of having my own schedule and doing
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:06.680]   my own work when I want to do it. And yeah, it's a plus for sure. But it does come with its challenges.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:10.840]   Yeah. Yeah. This would all sound so much bill. You guys brought up health care. But that's really,
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.400]   like this would all be 100% if we didn't have to worry about this. If we were like,
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:20.920]   so many other first-world countries. So that's the big thing. I think of like,
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:24.840]   I have friends in Germany. Right. Oh, sorry. Did you? No, I got there.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.960]   I was saying health care wasn't supposed to be tied to employment forever. This was a band-aid
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.000]   put on after I believe it was World War II. And yet somehow we've stuck with it this entire time
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.080]   as our dominant system. And it certainly has a lot of compounding impacts. I mean,
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:46.600]   especially as somebody who working in media staff jobs, I've prepared being on staff. But I've
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.240]   also been laid off twice in the last couple of years. And it is awful just in the sense that
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:58.840]   it's hard to suddenly have to be like, oh, I could if I get injured, be in debt for the rest of my life,
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:05.720]   or I have to pay a thousand dollars a month for Cobra, which I can't afford because now I am unemployed.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:11.320]   Right. Yeah. It isn't right. We've got to fix that. I think we all agree. But
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:19.000]   this is a larger challenge. And I think you could also, and I'm sure there'll be advertisements
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.560]   that make this case, why should taxpayers subsidize Uber and Lyft by paying their employees benefits,
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:32.440]   their health care benefits? And that's a good point too. We got to solve this. I agree.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:41.800]   We also just passed a privacy law, Prop 24 in California. This was an add-on to our already
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:48.280]   very strict California Privacy Act. This made it even stricter, although there are interesting
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:56.120]   loopholes. A number of people pointed out, notice Facebook did not lobby against Prop 24. And maybe
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:04.760]   one of the reasons is Facebook is big enough to adhere to this requirements of Prop 24. But it
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:11.480]   pulls up the ladder against smaller companies who can't. That might be one reason. This was another
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:18.120]   tough one, poor California voters. We have to do the work of the legislature. I voted for this one
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:21.400]   as well because I feel like more privacy protections are probably a good thing.
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:29.720]   It's still not nearly as strict as GDPR, but it did bring in some of the GDPR rules.
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:36.760]   And now, I understand none of you or California voters are technically affected by this.
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:42.760]   But if there is a privacy law in one of the states, it's very likely that every other state
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:46.360]   will benefit from that because companies are going to have different policies for every state.
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:53.240]   I feel like companies often do. As somebody who spends in an ordinate amount of my time reading
[01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.360]   terms of service or privacy policies, that person who actually does try and read it
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:04.920]   now before I agreed anything because legally, they have to be clear and easy to read. That often
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:12.360]   does impact us thanks to GDPR. But generally, the protections only apply to California.
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:18.280]   And for the rest of the country, I can't request to see any of the data that companies are collecting
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:26.440]   on me. Meanwhile, colleagues that are in California can. And I assume a similar dichotomy applies to
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:33.400]   data collection. I assume that these companies that have made so much money, finding every loophole
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:40.200]   in my privacy that they can are not going to give it up just because one state out of 50 has passed
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:40.840]   some laws.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:45.960]   It's like the digital equivalent of how every time I open up a product and it's like,
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.720]   this is known to contain things that cause cancer in the state of California.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:52.920]   Does it only cause cancer in California?
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:48:01.320]   That Prop 65 warning is another great example of California voters being, and it's apparently
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.720]   very easy to get a proposition on the ballot. I think 100,000 signatures and you're good.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:12.680]   And that's a great example. You can't go anywhere without seeing a Prop 65 warning in California,
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:16.680]   which effectively eliminates the warning because it's everywhere.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:21.960]   I'm sure there are cancers. I mean, the chemicals known to cause cancer here in this building.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:28.280]   And there's a Prop 65 warning out front. So what is it immediately deludes at all?
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:34.040]   Same thing with a cookie warning that we now see on every GD website. Thanks to GDPR.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.200]   So knowing you just click through it a lot of times.
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:36.760]   Click through it.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.320]   Except all. I just make the banner go away, please.
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:42.680]   Go away. Go away. I just was on a site that keeps popping it up.
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.120]   Thank you. That's nice. That's user.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.880]   It's really great on top of all the pop-up ads and everything else we're getting out to.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:52.520]   And please, the notifications. Yes, please.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.120]   Let me know your location and send me to.
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.080]   No, stop.
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:55.640]   All that.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:56.280]   Go away.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.680]   Click this button if you're receiving too many notifications.
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:04.600]   One of the most controversial parts of the California privacy law.
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:10.280]   It allowed companies to charge consumers who opt out of having their data sold.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.200]   Now, on the face of it, that sounds like a good idea.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.800]   You have a choice. You want to keep using Facebook?
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.280]   OK. Five bucks a year, five bucks a month, whatever.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:19.880]   Seems like a fair trade.
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.960]   But there were those who say, oh, now privacy is a luxury item.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.360]   And only people with money can afford to have privacy.
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:29.000]   I mean, it's already a luxury item.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:29.880]   That's true.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:30.680]   That's true.
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:33.560]   Now, the transaction, I guess, is becoming more apparent in some cases,
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:38.680]   although I doubt that, I don't know, it seems not beneficial to a company to kind of
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:44.120]   make it that apparent, especially when California is the only state where the supplies.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:50.360]   But already, people who are at an economic disadvantage are the ones
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.160]   who are being exploited the most when it comes to data and privacy.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.040]   That's just a fact.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.240]   Well, we'll see.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.800]   This election, this had a lot of follow on effects,
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:03.400]   and we won't know what they are for a while.
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.480]   We'll see how the world is going to change.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:08.440]   Massachusetts, Massachusetts.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.320]   Massachusetts.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:09.800]   Massachusetts.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.200]   Massachusetts.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.240]   That's Massachusetts.
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:13.480]   That's what we call ourselves here, Massachusetts.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:17.720]   It may double SACHU, S-E-W-T-S.
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:25.000]   Massachusetts voters passed a right to repair expansion, covering vehicle data.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.320]   And I think really quite rightly.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:27.880]   Great.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.280]   Preventing companies from locking out.
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:33.000]   It's common.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.920]   It was such an interesting campaign here, because Leo, you just mentioned the
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:40.120]   getting the mothers against drug driving involved.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:47.640]   And here, the big sort of scare tactic that the opposition was using was the ability for,
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:50.200]   just anybody could get your data about where your cars were.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:54.200]   So they were using domestic abuse kind of as an example of like,
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:57.880]   "Oh, now your abusive ex can find you anywhere."
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:01.880]   And it's like, "Well, that's not exactly what this is about."
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:04.520]   I mean, there are certainly data security concerns.
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:08.520]   You want to make sure that if this system does exist, it is well-secured.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.960]   But that's true of any system that uses any personal data, right?
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:15.880]   Like any location-based system, which is a ton of stuff that we use right now.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.080]   But overall, I think it passed by a wide margin,
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.200]   because we passed the first right to repair law back in 2012.
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:27.240]   And this basically was like, "Well, more and more stuff has been moving to online resources,
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:30.360]   which the manufacturers can control by essentially saying,
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:34.040]   "You can only log in if we decide that we want you to log in if you're it."
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:37.720]   So opening that up to third parties, I think is potentially a big win,
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.840]   both for independent mechanics who were the big
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:45.800]   constituents you were talking about here, but also just anybody who wants to make devices that
[01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:51.080]   work with some of these cars that are so technological that you can't get access to these systems anymore.
[01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:56.600]   I wonder, though, if it's still a lockout for individual consumers,
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.960]   how expensive will these devices be?
[01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:02.360]   How much skill will you need to use to operate them?
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:04.200]   It's great for independent mechanics.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:05.960]   It's not so much for the shade treatment.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.800]   Yeah. And I think that there's a big question still outstanding as to what exactly this looks
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:13.000]   like, right? Because if you have to have all automakers complying with this,
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]   and it has to be sort of broadly accessible,
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.920]   how are you going to implement that?
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:20.680]   Are you going to have them all use one set, one sort of system or protocol?
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:23.640]   Are there going to be everybody have their own little siloed systems?
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:27.400]   How are you going to roll this out and make it secure and who gets access, etc.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:31.080]   So yeah, there's a lot of implementation details to figure out, but I think it's a good first step.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:34.920]   Is it, would it be through the OBD to port the onboard diagnostics?
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.480]   Well, I think this is actually for online specifically like stuff where your car might
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:45.400]   tell them, yeah, telematics stuff where it's like, you know, Tesla talks to its servers or whatever,
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:50.520]   and gets diagnostic information that's only reported via their closed web portal or something
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:53.720]   like that. It always bugged me when I had a Tesla, I don't have one anymore, but
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:57.400]   we had a problem with it going forward, we weren't supposed to go backward and we called,
[01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:00.360]   and they said, well, wait a minute, let me look. Oh, you know, it's a very big problem.
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:07.960]   Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of. Just kind of. Yeah. Like a major. Yeah. Yeah. And they said, well,
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:11.720]   let me look at the logs and they said, okay, what time did this happen? And they said, oh, no,
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:17.560]   no, you were you were in reverse when that happened. Or you weren't in reverse when it was right,
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.800]   right? What do you mean, you know? Oh, yeah, we know everything. Yeah. We know, we know
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:26.600]   it all, but they don't share that with you, of course. Sure. Right. That was a little eye
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:31.400]   opener. Oh, yeah. No, we're looking at the logs. It worked as expected. It says so right here.
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:37.240]   That's not a bug. It's a feature. Okay. Okay. I guess I was dreaming.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:42.600]   Kyle Wienz, the founder of I Fix It, one of our sponsors, a great guy, says this will be the
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:48.360]   most advanced right to repair law in the world, opening wireless automatives, diagnostics, and
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:53.480]   unleashing unleashing a world of possible apps. That's interesting. So you could have an app on
[01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:56.840]   your phone, maybe that would say, you know, you went backwards when you're supposed to go
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:03.000]   forwards. I could see it right here. Okay. That's what all of my apps tell me. That's life.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.760]   Yeah, I'm going backward. I opened Twitter and I'm like, I'm clearly going backwards.
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.320]   Okay. There's your mistake right there. Never open Twitter.
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:19.720]   True. Life model. Actually, let's take a break. And then I wouldn't mind asking that question.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:23.960]   Wither Twitter. Now that the election is over with her Twitter.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:29.400]   Are showing a Twitter or Twitter? I know where it's happening with Twitter. I know exactly,
[01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:35.240]   but Twitter, I'm not so sure. This week, a tech brought to you by NetSuite. NetSuite gives you
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:39.960]   visibility and control over everything you need to know if you're running a business.
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:46.280]   Financials, HR, inventory, e-commerce, and more, everything you need all in one place at the same time.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:52.760]   That's an awesome thing. I know I watched Lisa trying to run our business. She's got a 49 inch
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.800]   wide screen so she can get QuickBooks open and the spreadsheets open and all the different files
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:02.680]   open that she needs to look at. And then she has to scan it back and forth to figure out what's
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:09.000]   going on. You know, using QuickBooks spreadsheets, that's slowing you down. If you are tired of
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.200]   working on multiple platforms and you want to take your business to the next level,
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:17.240]   now is the time to upgrade in NetSuite. Running a fast-growing, smaller, medium-sized business is not
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:24.360]   easy. I know I hear the screams. You need a solution that's constantly evolving to meet your needs.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:29.960]   And NetSuite is the world's number one cloud business system. NetSuite gives you cloud-based
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:35.800]   solutions, streamlines mission-critical business processes, reduces IT costs and allows you to
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:40.040]   easily scale and future-proof your business. With an agile business platform that evolves,
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:47.400]   as your needs change, you can close with confidence. You can report with accuracy after all. Financial
[01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:53.560]   accuracy is everything. You can even drill down into the underlying details, understand exactly
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:58.600]   what's impacting your business because you're getting real-time information, real-time metrics.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:02.440]   You got role-based dashboards. You'll never be in the dark about what's going on in your
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:07.080]   business, where your money's going, how business processes are working. Look at the Commvault
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:12.040]   example they turned to NetSuite's cloud solution as the platform that could dramatically reduce
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:16.760]   complexity and provide much-needed agility. They use the Sweet Cloud Development platform
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:21.480]   to support unique processes and to integrate with third-party cloud applications. And of course,
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.240]   the apps from NetSuite partners ran out of the company's updated environment. It's really,
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.960]   really cool what you can do. SolarWinds says we needed more than just a good accounting solution.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.760]   We had to responsibly manage growth. NetSuite provided the business application infrastructure
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:40.280]   to do exactly that. Stop paying for multiple systems. NetSuite delivers what others can't.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:46.440]   No wonder 22,000 companies are upgrading to NetSuite. Let NetSuite show you how they'll benefit

[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:15.400]   let them know you saw it here. NetSuite.com/twit. Do not confuse Twitter with Twit. That's for sure.
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:23.720]   Two different things. Twitter has been... Let's face it.
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:30.840]   The dirty little secret of big media and Twitter and Facebook is the Trump administration has been
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:36.520]   a great thing for them. It's been great for ratings. It's been great to drive traffic.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:41.240]   Twitter is in the news practically every single day thanks to the president's tweets.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:47.560]   That's all going to go away or not. Maybe he'll still tweet.
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:51.240]   Probably still going to tweet. We couldn't be that lucky.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:57.240]   I don't know. I wonder if one of the things people are speculating when he no longer is the
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:01.400]   president of the United States, he will no longer be protected by as a world leader.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:07.880]   Oh, I mean, I think they're still going to consider his tweets the same way they were.
[01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:14.920]   Any presidential... The one thing that is for certain is Twitter is never going to ban Donald
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:18.600]   Trump from Twitter.com. That's not going to happen.
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:24.600]   Really? Okay. They did. It was remarkable. They have been very quick to cover his tweets with,
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:29.080]   "That's not true. That's not true. That's not true. They're still doing it."
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:31.720]   They only took them four years. Yeah, right. Yeah, right.
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:38.200]   It's clear they're very aware of the value that he represents and the value that his
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:45.640]   supporters represent to the platform. It's really interesting. We'll watch.
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:54.440]   Singles Day is coming. Alibaba is trying to make Singles Day, which is November 11th.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:59:01.560]   What is that? 11. 11. 11. Just four times bigger than Prime Day.
[01:59:01.560 --> 01:59:09.960]   Four times the number of ones, too. Oh, one, one, one, one. Last year, 11. 11. So what is
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:13.400]   Singles Day? It's a Japanese to celebrate being single?
[01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:18.760]   It took another commercial holiday from what I know. Yeah. It's like Prime Day.
[01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:25.960]   Basically. Yeah. Chinese use... It was originally the 1990s as a day in which Chinese youth would
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:33.960]   go on blind dates, which is because 11. 11 is singles, right? One, one, one, one.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:41.720]   But also couples. One, one, one. It morphed into a day in which Alibaba's retail market offered
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:50.920]   deep discounts, became their Prime Day. Last year, 11. 11 was worth $38 billion of transactions on Alibaba
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:58.680]   alone. It's amazing. A lot of money. 38 billion, and they expect it to be even bigger.
[01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:06.280]   I've seen pictures of robot delivery vans that are being lined up to get ready to deliver all these
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:14.920]   goods to Singles in China. Yeah. I'm sure I don't know exactly what's going on in the ground in China
[02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:19.880]   right now, but I know at least in the US, there has been this huge push. I mean, part of the reason
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:24.360]   why Prime Day was in October is they're trying to stretch out the holiday season so that the
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:29.160]   supply chain doesn't completely collapse as the shipping infrastructure happens all at once.
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:35.320]   I mean, just because we're already at max capacity when it comes to the amount of mail
[02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:41.240]   and packages that can be sent around the US and delivered, then you throw in mail and ballots,
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:45.800]   then you throw in all of the holidays shopping and it all being just online because people are
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:51.400]   too afraid to go in stores because we still haven't gotten the pandemic under handle and it's going
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:57.320]   to be a mess. So Prime Day was 10 billion Prime Days because it was two days, it was 10 billion
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:04.200]   dollars this year in the US. As Amazon says, only Amazon could turn Prime Day to 48 hours
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:12.360]   from now on. It's a Prime Day miracle. It's a miracle. So the stats from Amazon Web Services
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:24.520]   on Prime Days, 16.4 trillion calls to their database API, peaking at 80 million requests a second,
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:32.840]   241 petabytes of pre-provision storage, 280 million HTTP requests per minute,
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.960]   450 billion requests across the 66 hours of Prime Day.
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:44.280]   Yeah, and that's just thinking about Prime Day because when Amazon announced the day, of course,
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:50.600]   within a few hours, Target announced deal days which were around the same time and Walmart announced
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:57.560]   Big Save, which was the name of an event for some reason. Just Big Save. Not Big Save Day,
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:04.120]   not Big Save. But just Big Save. Big Save. Too many words. Big Save. You step pitch for the cardinals?
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:09.080]   Big Save. He had an arm in me. Long adult save son.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:16.600]   It's so funny because only Amazon could turn Prime Day into a pitch for AWS.
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:23.000]   Like, see how we handled Prime Day? Now you two, go ahead. Come on, try it, Target. You two can do
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:30.280]   Prime Day. That's amazing. I wonder how many, I'd like to see some delivery numbers from Prime Day.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:36.200]   I know I get an Amazon. Yesterday, I had three Amazon deliveries within an hour.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:41.960]   Yeah. It seems like they could consolidate. That was a little bit. I don't know.
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:47.880]   There is an option whenever you're buying to combine it into one order or just do your Prime Day
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:53.240]   delivery or Amazon Day deliveries where it all gets delivered in one day. I don't like that. I
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.680]   want it tomorrow. I'm not going to wait till Monday. Okay, then you and your three prime boxes.
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:04.600]   Okay. Oh, Monday is tomorrow. Well, then maybe I will. You know what? You can't buy it now.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:10.840]   It's already sold out, but I was very impressed with the Raspberry Pi 400, a Raspberry Pi and
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:16.120]   a keyboard, a complete computer in effect, just to add monitor mouse and keyboard for $70.
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:22.760]   Oh, no, I was just going to remind you of the... At a monitor and mouse, it has a keyboard.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:32.200]   That's cool. It feels like a Commodore 64. It's cool. Yes. It's got that vibe to it. I was
[02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:36.040]   very tempted by this, but I ultimately didn't because I knew I would get it. And then I would
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:40.280]   play around with it for like a week and then going to the bin with all the other stuff that I never
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:45.080]   used. All the other Raspberry Pi's. I have three or four in a box. Yeah. They're cool. You can open
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:53.400]   up a bakery, a pie bakery. Just in time for Thanksgiving. Oh, it's true. Oh, I think we could
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:59.960]   wrap this thing up now that you mentioned pie. I'm getting hungry. So, Paris Martin,
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:04.200]   no, you're the greatest. She's a reporter at the information at Paris Martin, no,
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:11.320]   plug something. Follow me on Twitter. Yeah, I'm at Paris Martin, no. This week,
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:16.760]   I'm having a big story on Amazon come out. So, can you give us a hint? Anything?
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:23.880]   It has to do with a part of Amazon's logistics operations. Also, that question I was asking,
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:32.040]   maybe you have the answer. Maybe. Does it involve drones? They're actually going to do that,
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:36.600]   aren't they? Drone delivery. They, I mean, so they're working on it, but it's still
[02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:42.360]   a ways away. It's going to be probably for rural areas because it's so costly, otherwise,
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:51.320]   to ship. But yeah, drones eventually. Remember when Charlie Rose, how many years ago is that on 60
[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:56.760]   minutes, Jeff Bezos, 2013 or something that he was like, within five years, we're going to have
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:01.800]   drones. Yeah. Yeah. Everything's always five years away. Charlie Rose is like, oh, that's so cool.
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:08.600]   That's so cool. And everybody else is going, Charlie, get a grip on yourself. That's way off.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:12.520]   My cat did just come in here. So, I'm going to do this little cat.
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:15.640]   Oh, I guess Mo. I guess Mo.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.480]   Black and white are great. Yeah, that's right. What a great name. Boy or girl?
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:23.800]   Good time. Gizmo could be either. She's a girl. She's a gizmo. Yeah. And then
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:31.880]   she's got gizmo and gadgets. Oh, that's hysterical. Thank you, Paris. Have fun on your bike.
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:36.920]   Be careful. Wear a helmet. I shall. I wear a helmet. Got lights. Good. Yeah. You got lights
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:43.720]   front and back. I saw them. Very cool. Milton. Devendra Hardewar. He also has his own podcast,
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:49.480]   the Slash Film Show. Yes. Slash Film Cast.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:55.480]   What's going on over there? I mean, a bunch of stuff. We actually just launched a Patreon. So,
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:06:01.640]   we are pumping out a whole lot more stuff. We're doing our after dark segment now, which is just us
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:06.200]   kind of hanging out and having fun chats that are not necessarily film related. And our listeners
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:11.160]   really dig that. So, go check all that out. I'm doing the Engadget podcast too. And that's been
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:16.120]   a lot of fun because we get to talk with everybody in gadget to dive deeper into the stuff too.
[02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:22.200]   So, hey, yeah, that's our Patreon. There's three levels of membership for five bucks. You
[02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:27.800]   could be a watcher. For 10 bucks, you could be a good sitter. 25 bucks a month, you get to be a
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:32.520]   money horse. These are all in jokes. These are all in jokes, but our listeners know what's up.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:40.680]   Yeah. It's a bunch of. One of my co-hosts couldn't figure out the phrase cash cow.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:41.960]   And he came up with money.
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:43.400]   Or is this better?
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:44.200]   Much better.
[02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:45.080]   That is better.
[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:51.480]   And of course, catch to Vindra at Engadget. His reviews of both. That is overachieving.
[02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:52.280]   The Xbox.
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:53.320]   It's a lot.
[02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:57.880]   And the PlayStation 5. Geez, Louise. Your thumbs must be killing you.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:01.960]   My thumbs, my everything, because I basically, I've had to ignore my child.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:06.040]   Daddy's playing games. Leave me alone.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:10.920]   Well, it's not even a get like a, I want to play more of the games I can actually review,
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:13.720]   but it's the writing part that takes forever. I hate it.
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:15.480]   Writing.
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:15.880]   Oh, work.
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:16.360]   Writing.
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:19.240]   Oh, whoever thought that was a good idea.
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:21.240]   That's why I talk for a living to Vindra.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:26.280]   I learned talking is so much easier than writing.
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:31.320]   And of course, it's great to see you, Dan. You're going to be a little busy on Tuesday,
[02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.040]   I imagine.
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:34.200]   Yeah, it's going to be a big week.
[02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:34.920]   Yeah.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:38.440]   There isn't a week there so far that isn't a big week in the last seven months.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:38.680]   I know.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:39.480]   No, no, no.
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.480]   Did you, which iPhone did you end up going with?
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:44.840]   I've got a 12 Pro in Pacific Blue.
[02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.680]   Yeah, I thought I'd get the blue.
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:47.240]   I thought I'd go.
[02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:48.200]   It's a really pretty color.
[02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:48.360]   I like it.
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:48.680]   Yeah.
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:49.800]   You have the blue too.
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:50.200]   Pretty.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.160]   Oh, I can't wait.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:51.800]   Yeah.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:52.040]   Yeah.
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:54.360]   I'm going with the max just because I want to try those cameras.
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:55.800]   I'm very intrigued by the low light.
[02:07:55.800 --> 02:07:56.920]   I can't do the big screen.
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:57.880]   It's too big for me.
[02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:59.080]   So I was tempted by the mini.
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:01.480]   It's got to be able to fit in my pockets, you know.
[02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.880]   I got big pockets, big pockets.
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:06.760]   Big pockets for days.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:07.640]   Big pockets.
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:11.880]   In the pocket, a big pocket.
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:14.920]   I got money horse sized pockets.
[02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:16.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:16.920]   Thank you, Dan.
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:17.640]   It's great to see you.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:17.960]   Thank you.
[02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:18.520]   Devindra.
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:19.960]   Thank you, Paris.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:21.560]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:24.200]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.640]   230 Pacific time.
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:28.120]   That's 530 Eastern time.
[02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:29.720]   That's 2,130 UTC.
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:32.200]   You can watch us do the work live.
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.160]   If you like the behind the scenes conversation, that kind of thing.
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:40.120]   We stream live audio and video all the time at twit.tv/live.
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.840]   Whenever you're there, there'll be something going on.
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.840]   And if you're watching it, you should join the chatroom,
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:46.200]   because there's always somebody there too.
[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:50.840]   All over the world, irc.twit.tv.
[02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:54.200]   But if you just don't know when you'll have some time,
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:56.280]   why don't you get the on demand versions of the show?
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:00.280]   You could download audio and video from our website at twit.tv.
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.560]   Of course, there's a YouTube channel with this week in tech.
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:09.480]   And we encourage you to get a better podcast app than Apple's podcast.
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:12.840]   Maybe pocketcast, maybe or whatever.
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:13.320]   Maybe.
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:13.800]   Whatever.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:14.920]   We're on all of them.
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:19.960]   Even Stitcher and Slacker and Spotify and Google's podcast.
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:21.880]   Just subscribe that way you'll get it automatically.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:26.200]   You'll have it Monday morning, just in time for your non-existent commute.
[02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:29.480]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:31.480]   Have a great week.
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:35.080]   Well, oh, I told my son I was going to plug his Instagram.
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:35.640]   Do you mind?
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:45.960]   Hey, you know, I got a little nepotism here because the reason is he's learning how to be a drone pilot.
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:49.880]   And he started to post his drone videos on his Instagram.
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:51.480]   And they're actually pretty darn cool.
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:54.280]   Yeah, that's a good career for a young guy.
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:55.880]   He's got a good skill right now.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.800]   He studied at CU Boulder.
[02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:02.920]   He studied broadcast journalism, which I thought, oh, geez.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:05.080]   Please.
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:07.240]   But he ended up--
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:09.480]   Leo, I feel like he would have given him some advice there.
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:10.440]   I tried.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:13.160]   I said, there's no future in it, kid.
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:18.120]   But he did learn how to do videography and editing.
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.840]   And now the drone thing is a nice little addition to it.
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:21.400]   This is--
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:23.560]   You can broadcast journalism from drones.
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:24.120]   That's the future.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:24.760]   Exactly.
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:25.560]   Exactly.
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:26.440]   Exactly.
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:29.880]   He did-- he's been doing stuff for wineries.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:35.160]   This is the night harvest at Hudson Ranch in Napa.
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:37.880]   They do it at night because it's cool.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.600]   So the grapes, the sugar and the grapes are--
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:42.120]   There's a skill to have right now.
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:42.680]   Yeah.
[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.480]   Yeah, isn't that neat?
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:46.520]   So Hank will report on Instagram.
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.560]   I said I would plug it.
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.680]   And also when the robot wars start, he is first in line to pilot some drums again.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:53.480]   Yes.
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:54.120]   That's right.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:59.480]   Did you watch and raised by wolves?
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:00.280]   What did you think of that?
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.320]   It was just a point.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:05.000]   It was like the first episode.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.720]   I've only seen a couple episodes, but I'm not going to keep going.
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:08.920]   There's so much other better.
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:09.960]   It is poorly.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:13.160]   So what do you like these?
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.600]   I'm always asked to vendor it because he's--
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.880]   I'm into the Queen's Gambit.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:16.840]   Oh, I love that.
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:17.800]   Talked about Queen's Gambit.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.440]   It's really good.
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:20.440]   Everybody's watching that show.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:20.920]   You know what?
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:22.040]   You've got a great show.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:22.840]   It's chess.
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:26.600]   But I've heard that it's like a bad dialogue or something like that.
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:27.320]   It's not great.
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:27.880]   It's not great.
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:28.360]   It's not great.
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.120]   Why is it good then if it's not great?
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:31.080]   Well, it's a really--
[02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:33.160]   Because it's an adaptation of a novel.
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:37.480]   And I think it feels very fresh and different compared to like most streaming
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:38.440]   dress we get now.
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:39.480]   You know what, Paris?
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.280]   It's really compelling.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:46.840]   It's a beautiful and very stylish, but also troubled young woman who becomes the top
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:51.400]   at chess, which is a man sport, especially in the 50s and 60s.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:53.320]   It's got great period look.
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.920]   It's got great period fashion.
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:57.160]   It's a good shape right now.
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:57.720]   Yeah.
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:00.200]   And you Taylor-- I can't remember her name, but she--
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:01.080]   And you tell her, Joy.
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:03.240]   She's been a ton of horror movies lately.
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:07.160]   Yeah, but she was also Emma in that comedy adaptation of Emma.
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:08.040]   She's very good in that.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:09.160]   She's brilliant.
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:12.280]   So I think the reason people love it is because of her.
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:12.920]   And I was--
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:13.080]   She's--
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.280]   I mean, I played tournament chess.
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:17.160]   I played in the US Open that year that they--
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:20.200]   You know, '19, whatever, 's 1968 or whatever.
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:24.760]   So it's-- and I can tell you, it rings 100% true.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:28.040]   So it really is-- the only difference is they're moving a lot faster.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:33.480]   It's not quite as exciting a game when you're actually watching "Real Chess."
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:34.840]   You got to make chess exciting somehow.
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:35.240]   Come on.
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.040]   Yeah.
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:36.520]   It's-- you know what?
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:39.000]   I think it's also-- because it's kind of relaxing.
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:40.040]   Yes.
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:40.840]   Nobody dies.
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:42.920]   Now a lot of people die.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:43.400]   Oh, wait.
[02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:45.480]   It's actually filled with a lot of death apparently.
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:45.960]   What?
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:46.520]   Yeah.
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:47.000]   Yeah.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:47.960]   I mean, she's an orphan.
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:48.600]   Her parents die.
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:48.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:50.440]   Her mom dies at the beginning.
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:51.320]   That's-- there's only one.
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:51.720]   Yeah.
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:52.920]   And there's a funeral at the end.
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:53.160]   OK.
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:54.440]   So people do die.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:54.840]   But only--
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:56.040]   It's a nice, nice, happy death.
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:57.560]   A little light death.
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:12:59.640]   Like-- there's no blood.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:00.200]   Great.
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:01.000]   It's--
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.040]   Somebody in the shower says it's--
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:02.600]   Just a general--
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:03.480]   It's relaxing.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:04.280]   It's a relaxing.
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.080]   It's very relaxing.
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:08.760]   You get a little nervous for her, but then she settles down.
[02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:09.640]   For some--
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:10.840]   And also--
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:11.400]   Go ahead.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.000]   I hope you've seen Ted Lasso, Leo.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.200]   Because Ted Lasso is a little bit--
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:15.240]   I saw your show on that.
[02:13:15.240 --> 02:13:16.280]   I saw your show on that.
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:17.160]   That's so fantastic.
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:17.960]   It's so good.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.760]   It's so good.
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:19.720]   It's a little tricky.
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:20.280]   Highly recommended.
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.000]   It's a little tricky.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:21.880]   It's not--
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:22.840]   It's not tricky.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:23.560]   Wait, come on.
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:24.520]   It's hopeful.
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:25.720]   It's uplifting.
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:27.880]   What else on TV is hopeful and uplifting?
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:28.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:29.160]   Yeah.
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:30.040]   It's trickily.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.720]   Did you finish it?
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:32.360]   Or are you like happy?
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:33.080]   Yeah, I finished it.
[02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:33.640]   I liked it.
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:34.280]   Yeah.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:35.320]   It's the only--
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.640]   Apple TV has been a little bit of a disappointment,
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:38.200]   I have to say.
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:38.680]   Mm-hmm.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:39.960]   But that's a decent one.
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:41.560]   Uh, I think they're--
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.480]   I have hopes for Apple TV.
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:44.200]   I think they might--
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:46.600]   They're starting to kind of get in a gear a little bit.
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:47.800]   It was unexpected.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:49.240]   Let's put it that way.
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.680]   Nobody expected to be that good.
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:51.160]   Yeah.
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:51.240]   Yeah.
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.680]   Nobody expected Ted Lasso to be good at all.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:55.640]   That's so--
[02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:56.280]   Because he's--
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:58.680]   Because he's-- he's-- he was creative for a commercial.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:13:59.800]   Like, that character is a marketing thing.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:13:59.800]   Yeah.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:02.280]   Jason Sudeik has created it for--
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:04.600]   was it ESPN or some football thing?
[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:05.080]   Mm-hmm.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:05.880]   And yeah.
[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:07.240]   It's pretty funny.
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:08.600]   It's pretty funny.
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:09.240]   It's OK.
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:10.200]   Here's a little trickily.
[02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:11.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:12.360]   Uh, trick--
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:13.080]   Yeah, no.
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:14.040]   Because they have--
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:14.360]   Fine.
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:14.760]   They have some hard--
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:16.200]   I'll be over here just talking about it.
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:16.700]   Yeah.
[02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:17.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:18.680]   It's just good.
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:19.320]   It's just good.
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:20.760]   Like, he is-- the character--
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:21.880]   I would not want to be friends with him,
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:23.080]   because he seems super annoying.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:24.280]   But watching him--
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:25.240]   He's very annoying.
[02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:25.720]   --fry to be annoying.
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:26.440]   People's really--
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:27.000]   That's--
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.760]   He's extremely annoying.
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:31.000]   Because he's so upbeat and happy.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.360]   But he's not just upbeat.
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:33.400]   Because he's got--
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:33.400]   Sure.
[02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:34.600]   He's got problems.
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:35.400]   He's got problems.
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:35.800]   And I think that--
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:37.160]   Oh, he's got to be problems.
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:39.640]   Why can't we just have a character with no problems?
[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:40.040]   I know.
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:40.520]   I know.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:41.480]   Smooth brain.
[02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:42.040]   Can't quit.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:42.680]   I know.
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:44.760]   We've got so much problems in drama.
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:47.320]   For that, we have Jeopardy.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:48.520]   No, we don't.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:49.960]   Not anymore.
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:54.840]   Actually, the rumor is that the--
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:56.760]   Who was the guy who won all those Jeopardy's?
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:57.240]   Jeopardy.
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:57.720]   Jeh-ninks.
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:00.040]   Might be taken over for--
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:01.800]   They'd already hired him as a consultant,
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:03.480]   I think, earlier in the year.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:03.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:06.200]   That would be nice.
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:08.440]   Would you say Alex Trebek was one of the nicest people
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:09.480]   on the planet?
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:10.360]   He had a little edge.
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:12.360]   I feel like he was probably a little bit of--
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:13.640]   He had those really funny bits.
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:14.840]   A little do-gler.
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:15.400]   Yeah.
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:16.200]   He wasn't--
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:17.880]   But I think he had a reputation for being somewhat
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:20.760]   curmudgeonly, but he also seemed like he was a gentleman.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:21.240]   Yes.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:23.160]   He was at old school.
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:26.120]   And of course, it's kind of ironic
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.760]   that he and Sean Connery passed the same time.
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:31.800]   What was Jeopardy in Heaven?
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.360]   Because of celebrity Jeopardy in Heaven.
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:35.160]   I'm going to--
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:35.880]   Will Ferrell--
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:40.120]   I'll tell you guys, I saw Trebek do a short demo
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:42.920]   of the IBM Watson thing, because that was like 2012,
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:45.960]   '23, when they were taught like Watson beating Jeopardy.
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.400]   So we traveled up to--
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.880]   I forget the town, but where the IBM headquarters is
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:51.880]   and got to see him at least host that.
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:52.760]   That was pretty cool.
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:54.440]   I bet that was really fun.
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:55.400]   Yeah.
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:57.320]   It's fun to watch shows like that.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:59.480]   I reached my card.
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:02.440]   OK.
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:06.200]   This would be-- this would be Wonderwatch.
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:10.840]   If you haven't seen the celebrity Jeopardy with Sean Connery.
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:11.800]   For the new generation.
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:13.000]   You got to make a viral for the new generation.
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:13.560]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:14.040]   Those are classic.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:14.840]   Yeah, wait.
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:16.840]   Kyle, you cut it down into five seconds,
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:18.120]   make it a TikTok.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:18.520]   Yeah.
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:19.880]   Then they'll watch it.
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:20.840]   Or a Quibi.
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:21.080]   Yeah.
[02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:22.280]   You know, come to think of it.
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:22.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:23.880]   They're always going to take this a quick bite of content.
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:26.440]   It'll never-- yeah.
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:29.000]   It's never going to survive because it's too long.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.160]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:16:31.160 --> 02:16:32.280]   We'll see you next time.

[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:33.720]   It's amazing.
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:34.440]   Is it the game?
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:36.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
