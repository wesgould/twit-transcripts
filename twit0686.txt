[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.320]   tweet, probably the most expensive tweet in history. And a big fine for a robo-caller.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.440]   It's all coming up next.

[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.880]   of the best tech journalists in the world. I want to welcome Larry Magget. He's here
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   from CBS News Radio.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.360]   He got it right.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.360]   Yay.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   Our new name.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.840]   We used to be CBS Radio News.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   Big change.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   It's a subtle difference.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.880]   Yeah, that's important, I think.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   Probably.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.840]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.560]   We also welcome from CNET. Lindsey Turrentine, she's editor in chief@cNET.com. Always a pleasure
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.000]   to have you in Lindsey. Thank you.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.360]   So fun.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.200]   She made the trick up here.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   I did.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   Larry Magget.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   I know.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   I know.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   But I told you I couldn't do it.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.640]   Yes, because you have your book club.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640]   Right.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   A chef choose.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   A chef choose?
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.640]   Oh, you didn't call it?
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.840]   No, okay. That's different.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   Right.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.040]   If there's Chinese food involved, I'm there.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   Absolutely.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.960]   You're doing the crazy rich agents.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.080]   So is that you choose a restaurant that goes with the media that you use?
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.240]   Yes, because the chef choose son with a director.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.240]   Oh.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.640]   So there's a connection there.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   Even though the movie took place in Singapore and they served Chinese food, but they're
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.920]   ethnic Chinese people in the movie and the book.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920]   Perfect.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.920]   I think it works.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.440]   And by the way, the book I have to admit, I kind of skimmed the movie I loved.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.360]   It was a counter-stereotype.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.360]   I mean, it was great.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   I'm not seeing it.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.360]   I enjoyed it.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   I will probably see it.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   I haven't seen it either.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.600]   But my 15 year old son saw it because the horror film that he and his best friend went
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.440]   to go see sold out sold out.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   Yeah, when they think.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   He was like crazy.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.640]   And he came home and he was like, Mom, you got to see it.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   What?
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640]   It's really wonderful.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640]   Oh, that's great.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   That's great.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.320]   He's like, it was romantic, but it was funny.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.160]   It was like, alien versus predator.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.960]   He really was charming.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   Meets.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   Wow, that's great.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.120]   I haven't seen it yet, but I'm Asian.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.320]   So that's father Robert Balasair.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.880]   He's not a crazy rich Asian.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   He's the digital Jesuit.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.200]   Actually, we changed our name now.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   We're Jesuit digital.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Totally different.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   Org.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   Org.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.400]   We're the BAP with CDF to change our name.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.280]   Father Robertson, town for what?
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   So I was here for Dreamforce.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   Oh, nice.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.800]   Which is the big conference for Salesforce that shuts down half of San Francisco.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.280]   175,000 people come in.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   Was it fun?
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   You actually did a panel or?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   Yeah, I did.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.800]   And yeah, it's interesting because everyone was talking about AI last year, but it was really
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.960]   sort of this, "Oh, AI will be good."
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.440]   Could change CRM forever.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   Exactly.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   And it's like, okay, buzzwords.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.760]   This year you actually had companies coming in saying, "This is how we're using it."
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.040]   And I always love it when it gets to that level.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.160]   And then we had Oculus Connect down in San Jose.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.640]   So I had to come and get my VR on.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.120]   It was not fun for people whose offices are two blocks from San Francisco.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.040]   I can imagine how awful that must have been.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.440]   Also, it's so nice that I needed to raise my mic.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.440]   Is it better?
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440]   I hope so.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.440]   So I'm sorry to say if you were tuning in to watch Chang Chi Wong delete Mark Zuckerberg's
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.160]   Facebook page, he has decided to cancel that.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.520]   I have reported the bug to Facebook.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.320]   I will show proof when I get it bounty from Facebook.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320]   Oh.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320]   Hmm.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.800]   He's a so-called or self-designated white hat hacker from Taiwan who said he was going
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.640]   to broadcast himself hacking Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook page today.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.760]   But he's called it off.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.440]   It's kind of like the digital equivalent of Al Capone's vault.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.240]   Well, it's actually that.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   I'm going to do something super illegal that everyone will immediately know as me.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   That's probably not the best way to-
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   Don't do it.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   On Facebook Live.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   Don't do that.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   Don't do that.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.320]   Don't do that.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.640]   However, it isn't apparently related to the massive security breach which Facebook revealed
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.120]   on Friday.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.120]   Right.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.480]   This is a little hard to believe.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.680]   But according to Wired, and this is Louise Metzakis and Icy Lapowski writing in Wired,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.360]   they found out about it September 16th because they saw an unusual spike in users' actually
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   seeing Facebook.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   Now, when you have two billion monthly active users, what does an unusual spike look like?
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   Right.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.640]   But it must be pretty big, but they probably because they have so many users have really
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.400]   predictable patterns.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.640]   That's a good point statistically.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.240]   They can probably predict it just down to the-
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   Right.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   Right.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   To the hundreds of thousands.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.320]   I mean, 50 million is a lot of people, a lot of accounts.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.280]   But when you consider Facebook as well, 2.3 billion accounts, it's still a pretty small
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.000]   percentage of the- I wasn't affected as far as I can tell.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I seem everybody would know.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Here's how you would know.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Here's how you would know.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So, let me give you the full story.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.160]   September 16th, they saw an unusual spike.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.720]   They had started investigating on September 25th, which is what?
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   How many days ago?
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.720]   Four days ago.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.960]   The company's engineering team discovered hackers appear to have exploited a series of
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.680]   bugs related to that Facebook feature that you could- you know, you've probably all
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.280]   used this where you say, "What do I look like to others?
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   What's the view as feature?"
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.680]   Which is actually a private feature, ironically.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   What do people see?
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.280]   Do they see my phone number?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.040]   The bug is an interesting mix of three different bugs.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.040]   The first one-
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   Bug sandwich.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   It's a bug sandwich.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   I like that.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.000]   The first one, when you do view as in the Facebook page, it should get rid of the video
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.120]   uploader because you're viewing it as somebody else sees it, but the video uploader remains
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.360]   bug one.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.680]   The second one caused the uploader to generate an access token that had the same sign in
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.600]   permissions as the Facebook mobile app.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.040]   So I'm, as a hacker, able to go to your site, somehow get the view as, get the uploader,
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   get your token.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.040]   Right.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.840]   So it's the persistent authentication that they're taking advantage of.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.280]   And when the video uploader did appear in the view as mode, it triggered an access code
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.040]   for, and this is the bad thing, whoever the hacker was searching for.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   Oops.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.280]   Basically giving the hacker the access code for anybody on Facebook.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.400]   Facebook told everybody on Friday, and what they did is to protect people, they think
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.480]   there was about 50 million accounts access, but they were worried about another 40 million
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.120]   that could have been hacked.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.360]   So they, they essentially reset that token for those 90 million people.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   So they logged everybody out.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   They logged them out.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.440]   So the way you would know is if you had to log in to Facebook again on your mobile,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   or your desktop, did you?
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440]   I did too.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   I did too.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.920]   I got to ask you, when you log back in, did you get a survey?
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   No.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   Okay.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.200]   Cause I got a survey on mine saying, I think Facebook is, and they had choices from wonderful.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   I use it all the time.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.280]   And the, the worst one was a detriment to humanity.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's like, that was on there.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It was on there.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I did not get that survey.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.920]   You don't give me that kind of loaded gun click.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.960]   I have no, this is just my theory, but I know, know people had already been bounced.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.120]   I hadn't been bounced yet.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.400]   And then later that day I got bounced.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.200]   So which made me think that I was part of the 40,000, not the 40 million, not the 50
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.400]   million, but I don't know.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   Yes.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.560]   Uh, so as you said, Robert, that, that, that token can be used to basically log in without
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.560]   long.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.560]   It's you.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.560]   So it's you as Facebook.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   And we saw this has been stolen once before.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.640]   You remember about, I don't know, five or six years ago, the fire sheep exploit that would
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.920]   allow somebody on the same Wi-Fi network as you to access your Facebook token and then
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   post as you.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   Right.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.360]   So this isn't the first time that's happened.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.560]   Uh, it is not good for Facebook.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.200]   It's probably the worst hack we've seen, not the first, but the worst that we've seen of
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   Facebook.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   It's very sophisticated.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.840]   This is a revenue hack though.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.000]   This is, this hurts Facebook because this is data that they wanted to sell for users,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   though.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.880]   They, Facebook was already selling that data.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.680]   Are you talking about the phone number issue?
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   No, no, no.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   I'm talking about what they, what the price would have encompassed.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.720]   I mean, the worst part of it is the fact that they could have gotten the token so they
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.440]   could have access other sites that you're using Facebook as an authentication.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.360]   No, but if I get your token, I can change your password.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   Maybe I can't.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   Can I change your password?
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.360]   No, no, no, I can post on your behalf.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   I think it's about the other site.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.840]   Well, that's the other thing.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.320]   Many people use Facebook night.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.320]   What did it affect this?
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.320]   Yes.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.960]   So Facebook has a single sign on that you can use to log on other apps and sites.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   And it did affect that.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.680]   It did affect that, which is a huge concern.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.600]   So if somebody's stealing the ability to log into another site and then can use that
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.280]   as a way to get in and mess with that site or that service, that's the thing.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.040]   It was the last draw for our mutual friend Ed Bot who wrote on Facebook that he's going
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.640]   to be deleting his account at the end of October.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   I don't know how many people, I suspect there'll be relatively few people doing that,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.400]   but here's a guy who I think knows a lot about tech and apparently it's just enough
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   for him.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   I'm mostly delete.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.240]   I mean, I basically, there's nothing I post on Facebook.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.840]   All of the information, my personal information is wrong.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   I put Tony's information.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.000]   You're actually a rabbi in Facebook, right?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.800]   So why do you use Facebook if you don't put your stuff there?
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   The only reason why I use Facebook is because I need to administer certain pages.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.200]   So it's tied to that and also because I use it as a third party authentication, which
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   I will no longer be doing.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.840]   I'm going to be moving all of that over the next half.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   I never do that.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.440]   I'm the opposite, which is that I use it to quietly watch what other people are doing.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   Lurking?
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.440]   I like this.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.440]   Yes, I use it as a lurking platform.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.920]   Really, I mean in the sweetest way.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.160]   Just see pictures of other people's kids or whatever, but I never use it as a third party
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.680]   authenticator for that reason.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   It just for example.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.360]   I only do and I'm really lazy.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.240]   If I'm really in a hurry and too lazy to type in a username, I might.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.080]   But in general, I avoid it.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.840]   But I use Facebook a lot to post comments, personal thoughts.
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.120]   I try not to be overtly political, but kind of subvertly political and I ask a lot of
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.440]   questions.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   And I also use it to post links to articles I read, write and broadcast I do, which get
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.960]   almost no engagement.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.480]   People engage heavily when I say something personal.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.520]   To some extent, why it hasn't been political, but hardly at all when I try to get them to
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   read whatever.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.920]   It's actually the Facebook algorithm.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.680]   I mean Facebook changed this not long ago and they're just nobody's seeing that post
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.680]   that you're doing.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.920]   The problem is that you're not paying Facebook.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.880]   If you're paying them for the engagement, then you would get all the engagement you
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.880]   want.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   That's probably true.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.040]   So this is funny that Ed bought this bother to about so much to delete his account because
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.360]   I don't think this I mean this is their security breaches.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.040]   Lots of companies have secure breaches.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.680]   This is the one that bothers me a little bit more.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.520]   This is a cashmere hill article that appeared on Wednesday, two days before this Facebook
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.880]   is giving advertisers, advertisers access to your shadow contact information.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.560]   Not information you're giving Facebook, but information Facebook has about you from other
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   things.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.560]   For instance, if you use a phone number for two factor authentication to.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.600]   Yeah, that's oh that I hate that idea.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.120]   So they're like taking that phone number and adding it to your profile.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.360]   You can't see it.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.080]   You don't know if you look at your profile.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.800]   My phone number is not there, but they know and they're using it to sell ads against you.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.440]   But what's particularly bad about that is they push that heavily on people as a security
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.240]   precaution and it's a good idea.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.640]   I mean it's a good security precaution, but when they mix a security precaution with a
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   marketing advertising gimmick, it kind of destroys something that's very important.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   But they have an opt out.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.840]   Facebook does have an opt out.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.040]   They will take you off that shadow sharing list.
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.960]   If you give them your social security number and your mother's name.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   Right.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   So pictures.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   Right.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.520]   And if you send them nude pictures, they'll make sure that no new pictures of you ever
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.880]   mentioned on Facebook.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.400]   So this comes from research done by Northeastern University, Princeton University.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.200]   Cashmere Hill says, I asked last year whether the Facebook was using shadow contact information
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   for ads and they said no.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.520]   However, these researchers did a series of tests that involved handing contact information
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.880]   over to Facebook for a group of test accounts in different ways and then seeing how much
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.280]   of that information can then later be used by an advertiser.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   And the way they did this is complicated because they have to see what information becomes
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.480]   available to advertisers by looking at the stats provided by Facebook about the size
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.240]   of an audience after the contact information is uploaded.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.680]   It's complicated.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.640]   But they figured out that when a user gives Facebook a phone number for two factor or in
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   order to receive alerts about new logins to your account, in other words for secure, good
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.800]   sensible security reasons, that phone number now is targetable by an advertiser within a
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.160]   couple of weeks.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.720]   So if you want to be more secure, you're going to have to give up some privacy.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.640]   You know, we didn't know how not to.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   That's true.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.400]   That by the way, for me is why I had budget equipped Facebook, not the other one.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.600]   That Google ultra secure privacy measure is better.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.040]   I mean, that's annoying.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   It's so annoying.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.120]   But I mean, it's secure.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.880]   It's very secure and you don't give any personal information to make it work.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   What's interesting.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.040]   Yeah, you have to use a dongle or what are the unique in the future.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.480]   And Farron if that didn't say why he was deleting Facebook, he just said that they
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.640]   responded to the last centilla of trust.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.520]   I was willing to give them so lots of strong.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   It is this.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.560]   Maybe I can do it yet, but I have removed the app from my phone.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.240]   Oh, I know it doesn't do much for my security situation.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.240]   That's what I do.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.520]   How much more battery life did you get on your phone once you've removed it?
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.920]   You know, not a noticeable amount, but I just brought me a lot of sanity.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.680]   You know, one reason you get more battery life.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.440]   You don't look at your phone as much as you don't have stuff to look at.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.640]   Yeah, so I find myself looking at Twitter way more.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.960]   Yeah, it's sort of the like it's like vaping when you click smoking.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   You're going to do the next thing.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.360]   You're going to delete Twitter next and then you're going to delete Instagram.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   No, but you know what?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.240]   Pretty soon you're going to delete those accounts because that's what I did.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.640]   And then I just will leave my phone at home.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:24.480]   I have a bot that runs in a container and it has made my Twitter feed so sane.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.920]   Your bot runs in a container.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.440]   So it runs in a container and I mute, but it does all the blocks automatically.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.000]   And I just gave it a couple of parameters to look for and my feed has become so much
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.560]   more useful for Twitter.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.360]   For Twitter, for Twitter.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   You know the best thing to do just to leave Twitter.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   And one of the reasons I say that is because not merely because it's a, you know, a dumpster
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:52.400]   fire that draws your attention constantly and I always feel worse when I look at it.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.560]   By the way, that was my, that was what put me over the top.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.280]   Did I feel better or worse?
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.280]   Always worse.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   And I always feel worse.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.320]   So that was enough for me to say, okay, well, I better not do this anymore.
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:08.880]   But, but the, but the other thing that happens, especially with Twitter is for some reason
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   it makes people crazy and they tweet things they shouldn't.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   This is true.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   Okay.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   Elon Musk.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.880]   40 million dollars.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880]   20 million.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.720]   Fun word secured are going to cost him chairman of the board at Tresla.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.760]   It's going to cost him 20 million dollars.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.480]   It's going to cost Tesla 20 million dollars.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   That's 40 million.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   That's, that's a lot.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.880]   40 million dollars for two word tweet.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.600]   That's going to hire a nanny to watch, watch over him apparently to make sure he doesn't
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.080]   miscommunicate in the future.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080]   Think about the things.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.320]   So let me explain what happened here for those who don't remember that two word tweet.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.520]   This was a couple of months ago.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.280]   Elon tweeted, I'm, I mean, as soon as I saw this and Elon, it's not the first time he's
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.560]   gotten in trouble on Twitter.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.200]   And by the way, it's not just Elon.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.000]   It's a lot of people getting trouble on Twitter, right?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   The president.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.560]   Everybody gets in trouble on Twitter.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.960]   Eventually you'll say something in opportune.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.720]   And part of the problem with Twitter is it feels like it's transient, quick, you know,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.080]   it's going to go into the ether and it's preserved forever.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.200]   So it's this mismatch between expectation and what really happens.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.920]   You think it's water cooler talk.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   It's a quick bullmo.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.000]   Instead, it's your permanent record with no context because it's very little context.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.200]   So I'll give you a little context.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.080]   Elon Musk's tweets.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.520]   I'm thinking obviously it'd been on Joe Rogan or something.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520]   A little smoke.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   I'm thinking.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   This is before Joe Rogan.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   Yeah, but wait a minute.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520]   I here's, but okay.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:36.280]   But he's saying I'm thinking about taking Tesla private, buying all the shares at $420
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.280]   each.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   Now I know you have a 15 year old.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.280]   So you know what?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.280]   That would have been okay.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   If you had tweeted that, that would have been okay.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280]   Oh, I didn't say.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   Oh, the 420.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   No, bull.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.680]   And the devil's triangle's a drinking game.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.720]   You know what 420 was.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.320]   It's a pot reference.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.080]   So he says that and immediately the stock goes whoa, because that's more than it's currently
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   trading for.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:07.560]   So a lot of people, short sellers probably go crap and long sellers go buy, buy, buy
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.280]   and then he tweets funding secured.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.680]   Now that's actually what got him in trouble, not the pump and dump, which I think should
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.680]   get you in trouble.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   Sure.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.680]   But 50 cents.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   We talked yesterday of Fitties.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.680]   I have to say it like the 50.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   Fitties sent tweeted.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.720]   He really liked this H&H stock some years ago, made millions of dollars on a penny stock,
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   no trouble at all.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.520]   SEC says that's fine.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.000]   But the reason he got in trouble with the SEC is because those two words funding secured
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   weren't true.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.080]   He said, well, I had talked to the Saudi royal family and they showed some interest, but
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.440]   he had not secured funding.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.280]   And that's the lie that got him in trouble.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.320]   Well, he's also CEO of a public company and he's supposed to know better.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.600]   A publicly traded company.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.600]   You have to offer it.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.640]   But it's ironic that saying 420 didn't get him in trouble, but funding secured.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.840]   I have a tip for anybody who uses Twitter that you don't lie.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   Yeah, you can't.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.920]   I mean, it's pretty simple, right?
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.520]   If you use Twitter, it'll make you sad.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.760]   But if you use it, if you don't want to get in trouble, just don't make stuff up.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760]   I have a positive lie.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.200]   It's what's getting people in trouble on Twitter.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.360]   I mean, among other things.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   I don't tweet right back.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   Sometimes it's telling the truth.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.720]   It gets you in trouble on Twitter.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.920]   Can you imagine if Steve Jobs was on Twitter?
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.400]   Those late night emails that he would send a journalist, can you imagine if that was
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400]   on Twitter?
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   You know what?
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.880]   You don't have to use your imagination because there's one guy we talked about this last
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.120]   week who doesn't do this.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.400]   I mean, he tweets, but it's very bland.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.800]   Jeff Bezos is very careful not to give interviews, not to be in public, not to tweet what he
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   does tweet.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.800]   He has a Twitter account.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.320]   And if you look at it, it's not him.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   It's not him.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.840]   It's promotional for Amazon.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.240]   That kind of discipline is what you need in this day and age in the problem with Twitter
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.520]   is he not mind that.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.520]   Obama did that.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.560]   He had a Twitter account and with you very carefully, probably by his staff and very
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   thoughtfully.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.760]   And then we have another president right now who doesn't have a take to just go on Twitter
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.160]   and say whatever is floating through his mind.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   I'm just kidding.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:07.160]   So don't you think people who are Trump fans like that about him?
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.880]   Isn't that what people liked about Trump in the beginning?
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.080]   He spoke his mind.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.240]   He said truth to power.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.960]   He didn't, he wasn't mealy mouth.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.280]   He wasn't cautious.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.840]   He said what they were thinking.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.840]   And he bypassed the media.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.680]   He had the direct conduit to his base.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.720]   Actually, in fact, some of the things he says.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   By the way, I just want to point out, he absolutely did not bypass media.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.560]   He used it as an amplifier for his tweets because if nobody reported on the things he
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.400]   said, but the fact that he would get media coverage every night during the campaign,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.640]   he didn't bypass media.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.480]   He completely, he was media savvy.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.280]   In fact, if there's anything you could say about Trump is that he, more than anybody
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.960]   else in the history of the world, used social media, particularly Facebook and the mainstream
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.680]   media to his advantage, that was huge.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.080]   It was a masterful use of an echo fan.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.480]   He absolutely knows how to keep all eyes on him all the time and Twitter for him.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   Twitter is a very good way to do it.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.280]   It's a great way to stop whatever news cycle is happening because all he has to do is
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.280]   plot his phone.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   I think the fact that he's a reality TV star probably helped him.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.640]   Well, I mean, that's how he understood how media works.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.480]   That's how reality TV works.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.680]   You have to be outrageous.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.280]   Otherwise, you end up on the cutting room floor.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.160]   You see, and I don't know, and I have two minds about how calculating he is about this,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.200]   but he's certainly able to distract people from other stories.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   By the way, I mean, nobody mentioned that Congress passed a huge tax bill this week.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.920]   No attention paid to it, giving trillions of dollars back to the wealthiest Americans.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   No attention paid to it.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:48.200]   I don't want to be a conspiracy guy, but honestly, you could make the case that media is still
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.600]   being manipulated very effectively.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.520]   So tell that wax a dog.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.720]   That's the tale that waxed.
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.360]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.120]   In any event, Facebook has, it's funny.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.760]   I don't even, it's like, well, yeah, of course, Facebook got hacked.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.720]   Yeah, of course, Facebook uses your phone number.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   Right.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.720]   This is like the conversation that happened about whether Facebook listens to you.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.520]   Yes, they've been saying it.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.800]   Like a real story, true story.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.840]   The other day, a boyfriend and I are in the car and I make a joke about old-timey outhouses.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.840]   Right.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.040]   Like, that's not even a thing I think exists, but we drive by and have it.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   Because you're a 15-year-old even know what an outhouse is.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.560]   Well, we drove past, we drove past like, you know, a construction outhouse.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   And I was like, wouldn't it be funny?
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   And there were sort of like retro houses.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.080]   Like with a moon in the door?
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   And the Sears-Cantelline.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.720]   The next day in his Facebook feed, he gets an ad for a retro outhouse.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   Like, that is not something.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   No.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.800]   I've heard that people heard that accusation before.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.120]   That seems hard to believe.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.920]   Are you suggesting that Facebook was listening to your conversation?
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:53.960]   Why on earth would this person who actually is not a property owner get an ad for a specifically
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.440]   a retro outhouse?
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   And it was verbal.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.440]   You didn't, you didn't message to me.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   It was totally verbal.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.440]   We were driving.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   Yeah, that's, yeah, it's amazing.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   I've heard that before.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   Oh, we've all heard them.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   There have been lots of them and not just out-
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   And you're actually saying the other people are hurt.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.080]   Amazon's Echo, there was.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.080]   Well, in Echo, I would understand.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.080]   Because they have a device.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.480]   But I mean, the only way Facebook would be able to do it is if you had the A app on it
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.920]   and it was sending data back.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.360]   It was recording your audio.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.320]   I don't know what was going on, but I'm telling you it was the weirdest.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   We would have seen that.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.320]   It can't be.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   Because that's a massive amount of data.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:29.240]   I'm just going to stand up right now and say, yes, of course, it's an amazing coincidence.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.720]   But remember, life is filled with amazing coincidences.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:37.040]   We're so bad at assessing the probability of coincidences.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.600]   Oh, we've got it.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.640]   I know, but it happens all the time.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.640]   And there's absolutely just-
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.960]   But I think that ad targeting is more sophisticated-
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.680]   For that to happen, Facebook would have to-
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.680]   I mean, what would that involve?
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.160]   Facebook would have to have the microphone on your phone on at the time.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160]   Right.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.160]   And a really good AI.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.960]   For not just you, by the way, for two and a half billion people.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   Sure.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.360]   It couldn't send back a constant stream because that would be noticeable.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   You would know it.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.800]   It would have to be smart enough to pick out certain parts of your conversation.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.040]   Well, the app has to be doing it.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.200]   The app has to do it, which means it would be killing your battery.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.000]   Is it possible your son Googled outhouses later?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Nope.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Maybe went online and nothing about outhouses.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Nope.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Do you have an echo at home?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   This is in the car.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Do you have an echo at the car?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.280]   Denise Haus in our chat room this week and launched.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.280]   She points out, "Cajmir Hill's been reporting on these kinds of weird coincidences."
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.560]   I have not had that.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.760]   People, Facebook, this happens all the time.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.040]   And actually, I think we have an explanation for it.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:39.920]   But Facebook, "Cajmir's reported," will say, "People you know, you ought to befriend."
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:45.480]   And it's like, "That's the guy who's my biological father that nobody knows is my biological
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.480]   father."
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.720]   Yeah, that could happen.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   Stuff like that.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   It could happen.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   That could happen.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.120]   I don't want to be an idiot.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.960]   I don't want to be the kind of person who says, "Oh, that couldn't happen."
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   And it is happening.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.960]   But at the same time, it stretches credulity.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   I think Facebook's doing it.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.960]   Really great.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.480]   And over and over again, CNET, other outlets have looked into it and reported that this
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.240]   is definitively not happening.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   Right.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.800]   But yeah, that is a huge, huge question.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   It was straight.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   I mean, seriously, a retro house.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   It's a little creepy.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.520]   I mean, even this whole conservative conspiracy theory that Facebook is banning conservatives,
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.760]   they can come up with data to make that case.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.120]   It's not the case.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:28.200]   But you can always find data to make a case if you're looking after the fact for some kind
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   of conspiracy.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.600]   So I actually trust you.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.800]   I know you're saying.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.520]   I know that you don't have an axe to grind.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.360]   So I don't know where to put this particular coincidence.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.880]   But some of them are manufactured because it's convenient.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880]   Sure.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   Right.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.920]   My ads are never well targeted because I have a, I told you about this, Leo.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.400]   I have a bunch of devices that fuzz all my data, my location data, my search data, which
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.200]   means the ads are curiosity.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   Why?
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.680]   Like I'm getting a bowling ad right now.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.080]   I don't bowl.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.680]   But honestly, wouldn't you prefer to get ads for things you want to buy?
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   No.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   Because then I might buy them.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   Oh, that's true.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   I don't need it.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   You know, I will say.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   That's on Gizmodo.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   Let me see.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.280]   I have an ad blocker on.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   So let me turn off my, and I apologize, Lindsay, in advance.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.560]   No, that's fine.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.680]   I was just going to say that I, I, when, and I know this a few weeks ago, but when Instagram
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.720]   launched, it's, they're talking about its plans to launch a shopping app.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   That was the first time I thought, you know what?
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   Good.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.680]   Because I love the ads I get on Instagram.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   I have bought so much stuff.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   This is underwear.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   This is underwear.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.280]   The underwear I'm wearing right now.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   Too much information.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.480]   I'm wearing Instagram underwear.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.680]   For a week and a half, I was getting nothing but dancing lesson classes.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.880]   And I'm like, which one of my devices is triggering this?
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.680]   It's like a ballroom dancing.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.280]   No, no, that's not me.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.560]   I, this is something that doesn't bother me is having ads targeted because I think you
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.400]   get better ads ads for stuff you want.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.800]   Now, if you, you're right, if you have no willpower, but see, have we gotten that far
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.080]   in the conversation where we now think, yeah, ads, ads are good.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.560]   I mean, I, I'm okay.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.800]   Adger net, ads are not good.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   Adger net, ads are not, ads are not good.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   I'm done with that.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   Yes.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   Yes.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   And you're right.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   I would write, you know, in theoretical, if you look at the history of advertising, it's
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.100]   always been targeted, for example, you'll get an ad based on the demographics that the
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.480]   publication was trying to read.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.480]   You're my friend, New Yorker.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.560]   You know, you're going to get ads for New York, you know, Bermuda trips and back in the golden
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.880]   age of television, that's why certain ads showed up in the middle of the day when they
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.320]   knew housewives would be watching.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.040]   So you watch, you always get different ads and you're going to see an MSNBC, not all
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.240]   of them, but some of them are as many as I thought.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.240]   Not as many, but some.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.080]   Mostly there for drugs for older people.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   Yes.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.560]   Number one, number one ad category on television is ED, ED medication.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.400]   Well, there's a reason for that.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   Watch it's TV.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.560]   Actually, we have an ED advertiser.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.360]   So I don't want to say anything bad against the ad advertiser.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.760]   I mean, I was talking about it.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   Awesome.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   It's a drinking game.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   You've heard of four years.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.080]   But with technology, we can just do a better job.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:07.200]   And you know, the only irony is that for all of this tracking, this still crappy ad.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.440]   Oh, there are lots of terrible ads.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.440]   Okay.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.880]   So I see that ads are inevitable as are necessary.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.680]   So we might as well get good ads.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680]   That's basically what people like.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.240]   I'll tell you why I like that idea.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.400]   One, I want to see ads that are relevant.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.560]   A bowling ad is just an annoyance.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.480]   It's the three of us on the show maker are living from advertising.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   Exactly.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.800]   Do you know I do two?
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   Two.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   Two in a way.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   I mean, because I'm going to see ads.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   So I want to see ads that are relevant.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.480]   Two, I don't really see that as an invasion of privacy.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:38.440]   The issue to me is not so much the way Facebook does this.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.080]   Although you can go too far.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.200]   So for instance, and I know that Facebook does this, they sell ads against state of mind.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.320]   So if you're depressed, you're showing depression in your posts on Facebook and Facebook can
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   tell this by the way.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.440]   Don't they deny that?
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   They didn't deny that.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440]   They didn't deny that.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.440]   Oh, my friend.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.920]   Well, they didn't deny all targeted ads, but I thought they denied that for a particular
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   ad.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.520]   You have to look carefully.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.160]   I don't buy Facebook ads, but if you buy Facebook ads, look carefully at the categories
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.400]   available to you.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.800]   It doesn't say, would you like to have depressed people?
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:17.960]   But there are ways to use people's state of mind and buy ads against that on Facebook.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.160]   I've been told this by people buy ads on Facebook.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.880]   That's what advanced CRM is all about.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.400]   It's not just about targeting the ads.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   It's not about targeting the ads.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.400]   It's not about targeting the ads.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.400]   It's not about targeting the ads.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.400]   It's not about targeting the ads.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   It's about targeting the ads on Facebook.

[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   I guess you're right.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   Everybody's selling something.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.400]   Our show today, let's talk about Betterment.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   I know one of the things you want to do is say, sure everybody tells you you've got to
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   say for the future, whether it's kids going to college, your retirement, maybe you want
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   to buy a house.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   But how do you save?
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   You don't put in a savings account, right?
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   Return on that is so low, you'll actually lose money just by inflation alone.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   So you've got to invest.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.400]   But how do you invest?
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   I know a lot of us geeks do it ourselves.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   We think we're smarter than anybody else.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.400]   Have you tried that?
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.400]   Investing money in the stock market and all that?
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.400]   Has that worked out for you?
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.400]   Maybe not the best way to do it.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   I've got an investing tool for you who knows they have to save, knows they have to invest,
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   but wants to do it better.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   It's called Betterment, the smart way to manage your money.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   It's the largest independent online financial advisor designed to help you build wealth,
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   whether it's planning for retirement or achieving financial goals.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   They're helping you make more from your investments with tax efficient investing strategies.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   It'll give you an edge, by the way, with the volatility of the market right now,
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   these things like tax loss harvesting really make a big difference in your overall return.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.400]   Betterment provides unlimited expert advice designed to help you make smart financial decisions.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.400]   Most importantly, and I really want to say this, they're fiduciary.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   That means they work in your interest.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   They are not incentivized to recommend certain investments.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   They don't have their own investment products to sell.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.400]   They work solely for you.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   And they don't work on commission.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.400]   There's a flat fee.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   In fact, there aren't even any transaction fees.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   And I love that because of the kind of things that they do like tax loss harvesting.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   Sometimes they'll be trading on your behalf many times a day.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   But you never pay more for that.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   You never pay a transaction fee.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   You get constant information, the Betterment app.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   Just take a look at it.

[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   So you can feel like a smart savvy investor.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   And the cost is low and fixed.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   Find out, investing involves risk.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   I'm not going to lie to you.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   That's true.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   But you want to do it and you've got to do it.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   You've got to save.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   You've got to put money aside and you want to do it right.

[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   This is apparently blocked at double click ad.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.400]   Oh, I'm getting bold.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.400]   There you go.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   See?
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.400]   See?
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   We're both in the bowling.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   I think they must have just bought all of Gizmo.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   I think they have a Gizmo.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   That's just a big buy.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   They figured everybody bowls.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   Who doesn't?
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   You should bowl.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   I'm going to bowl more.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   It's a young man's game Leo.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   I can't be bowling anymore.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   I'll hurt myself.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   Bowling.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.040]   I have a family joke in my family about how when I was a kid my mom would always be like,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.400]   "Why don't you kids go bowling?"
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   Oh, why not?
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   It was always the sort of wholesome.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.400]   Can you guys just go bowling?
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.760]   Well, no, they bowl today.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.400]   They just call it Devil's Triangle.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   Instead of saying go out, get some fresh air, your mom said go down to the lane.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   Why don't you kids go bowling?
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.040]   All the bowling alley they're on here are clothing though.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   There aren't that many bowling alley.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.040]   We have one in Petaluma that's awesome.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.400]   One in Petaluma that's one in Fremont.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.840]   The rockin' bowls used to be the way to say bowling.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.760]   I don't know if that's still a thing, is it?
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:26.480]   Let's talk about, as long as we're talking about Facebook, Instagram, Kevin's System
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.160]   and Mike Krieger, founders of Instagram, walking out the door at Facebook.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   Apparently, because...
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   I'm just walking.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   They slammed the door behind me.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.240]   ...slam the door because they didn't like Mark Zuckerberg's interference with their business.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.000]   Now, there's a lot of takes on this.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.680]   A lot of hot takes.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.440]   Ben Thompson and Stratecria thought I had a very good take on what she said.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.440]   You know what, Kevin?
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.680]   You were never CEO of Instagram.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.960]   You were a product creator.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.480]   But to be a CEO, you have to have a business.
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.080]   You have to make a business out of it.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.160]   And that's what Mark Zuckerberg does.
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.160]   That's what he did.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.400]   And maybe Kevin didn't like that too much, but that's what you do.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:07.040]   I suppose, but back to our prior conversation, Instagram already seems to be doing pretty
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.720]   well from an ad targeting standpoint.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:15.160]   And I think the problem is that Zuckerberg wanted to take more of Facebook and apply
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.000]   it to Instagram, which those guys do not want.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Interesting.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   That's what got...
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.960]   ...recode with implying that in a piece where...
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.680]   Actually, it was Cara Swisher in an op-ed piece.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   This was weird.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.480]   In the New York Times, it was an op-ed piece.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.360]   And I thought it was a very good piece, but I just think it's kind of interesting to call
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.800]   that opinion.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.840]   But yeah, she's basically...
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.640]   Well, let me see if I can find it, because she's talking from her experience with both
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:45.760]   Mark Zuckerberg and Kevin's system.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.040]   And I'll read you some quotes, because I thought it was a very good piece.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   You know, I work with both companies, you know, through my nonprofit Connect Safely.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.440]   In fact, we just recently published a revised version of the Parents Guide to Instagram,
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.160]   which you can find at connectsafely.org.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.400]   I think it's still on the front cover.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.440]   And the companies, at least in the groups that I work with, which is the Trust and Safety
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.040]   teams are different.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.440]   They have different sensitivities about privacy and trust and safety.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.200]   They're trying to merge them.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:17.360]   But I think for Facebook, it's like herding cats trying to get the Instagram people to
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.880]   get lockstep with the Facebook people.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.480]   And I don't know, maybe that will change over time.
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.560]   But it's been my experience, at least, that there are differences in terms of how they
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.280]   manage that aspect, those aspects of their companies.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.280]   Here's what Cara says.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.360]   And by the way, the title of her piece should tell you something.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.880]   A wise man leaves Facebook.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.880]   Ow.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.880]   Ow.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.680]   Kevin's system, a founder of Instagram, wasn't a team player.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.800]   But Cara says that's exactly what Mark and Facebook needed.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.520]   They need somebody to speak truth to them.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.920]   While it's good to be king, she writes, and Mr. Zuckerberg is that controlling every
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.560]   aspect of the company from its many units to its board as controlling shareholder, it's
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.080]   not easy.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:06.680]   Without the Instagram founders, it will be so much harder.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.600]   So it sounds more like the issue was that, and she says she got this from insiders at
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.160]   Facebook telling her this, "System was an irritant."
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:21.560]   She said, "When she had problems with Instagram, she texted Kevin's system and he responded
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   to her.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   He listened.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.960]   He didn't get angry.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.600]   She said, "That's the kind of thing you need a product guy like system to be doing."
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.880]   On the other hand, she said, "Zarkerberg, it would be nice if system was still in the
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.320]   room to articulate that to powerful people like Mr. Zuckerberg.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.720]   But now, just like that, he's not."
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:45.880]   I don't buy the hot takes that they're out because they weren't businessmen.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.880]   Instagram was making money.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.000]   It had a revenue stream.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   It was growing.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Sure.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.720]   The difference is, and this is why it didn't mesh perfectly with Facebook, is for Instagram,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   for him, his users were his customers.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.080]   He was selling ads for them.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.080]   That's the problem.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.080]   That's the problem.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.160]   Facebook, if you're a user, you're not the customer, you're the product.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   Correct.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.000]   Those two cultures do not match well.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.160]   Can it also be the possibility that his stock vested in, and he said, "Man, I'm going
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.160]   to go get it."
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.360]   He had just gotten off of maternity leave.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.760]   That first day he comes back, he says, "By the way, bye."
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.520]   Well, I'm sure that's the best word.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.520]   He's a normal person.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.520]   That guy's money.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.240]   He's going to go to have some fun.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.880]   What he said is probably true.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.280]   He wants to go do new creative things.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.280]   That's probably true.
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.360]   At the point that that business is right now, it's no longer really a natively creative
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.560]   pursuit.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.000]   It's now part of the business, and it's now about growing that business.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.360]   We all know people who are startup people.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.640]   They love starting a company, maintaining it, running it.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   Not so big into it.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.600]   Cara says he should be the chief executive of Facebook.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   I disagree.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.600]   I don't think so.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   I don't think systems the right.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.280]   Frankly, think if you're going to be Facebook, the right guy to run it is Mark.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   He probably wouldn't go on to do that.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   He wouldn't go on to do that.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.160]   Being a CEO is probably the president.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.200]   It's probably awful.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.800]   The best quote from this New York Times piece though is this.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:08.040]   Swisher says she had a talk with Kevin Sistrom at a hopelessly hip coffee place in San
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.520]   Francisco where I was left with one thought.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.600]   One thing he said seemed particularly wise, so I asked him if I could put it on the record,
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.320]   quote, "Social media."
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   Now think about this.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.200]   It's a little hard to grok, but see if we can get this.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:23.000]   It's in a pre-Newtonian moment.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.920]   So before Newton, we knew gravity existed, but we didn't understand why it worked or how
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   it worked.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.800]   We all understand that social media works, says Sistrom, but not how it works.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.040]   There are certain rules that govern it and we have to make it our priority to understand
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.560]   the rules or we cannot control it.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.560]   Do you think that's fair?
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.120]   I think that that's really broad.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.240]   I just guess I don't really know what it means, how it works technically, how it works socially,
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.240]   how it works with human brains.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.760]   I'll tell you maybe what he's thinking is, of course, Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.280]   to connect and everything like that.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.240]   It was used against us during the election by the Russians, particularly to convince people
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:06.880]   either not to vote or to stay at home mostly or to vote for somebody in particular.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.920]   To me, that was the kind of come to Jesus moment where somebody figured out how to use
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:16.560]   social media, pardon me for saying come to Jesus, in a very powerful way.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.400]   And they understood it, but Zuckerberg did not.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.520]   And it took Facebook off guard.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.400]   It's like, what?
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.880]   And in fact, at first they denied it even happened.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.120]   Finally, they've, you know, basically admitted.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.240]   Yeah, that's what happened.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.840]   I think part of the problem for consumer is that most of us don't know how it works.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   We know that there are algorithms.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.840]   Do you think Suck does?
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.600]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.840]   I would assume Suck does, but maybe he doesn't fully understand it.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.160]   That would be an interesting question because that's basically what Suck was saying.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.400]   We're in a pre-Newtonian moment.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.920]   We understand how to pull the levers maybe, right?
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.360]   But we don't understand why it works.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.160]   It's, look, that's a, it's a great thought and it's actually really good insight into
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.040]   the mind of a startup person.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.800]   However, that last part of otherwise we can't control it.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.160]   You're not going to control it.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.360]   That's the thing about social media.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:08.320]   It is such a huge zeitgeist now with so many different systems of algorithms that compete
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   with one another.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.440]   That's a huge problem because it's like saying, yeah, we've been a nuclear bomb.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.320]   We don't know how to control it, but we got it.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   Well, that's scary.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   It's scary.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.560]   Maybe this is oversimplifying it, but the thing that really kind of strikes me about
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:25.840]   this whole conversation is that what social media is is just humans acting like humans.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.880]   And maybe we just need to step back and be like, okay, humans have problems.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.880]   They sometimes are good and sometimes they're bad and we have to be thinking about the bad
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:38.640]   impulses along with the good ones because we know that people will use it for bad things.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.840]   To that extent, neither Zuckerberg or sister or anybody else at a social media company
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:48.040]   can truly control what goes on because it's sort of like asking you to control what's
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.040]   going on in your chat room.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:54.200]   I mean, to some point, I gave you that up a long time ago.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.840]   The mayor of Palo Alto doesn't get to control what everybody in Palo Alto does.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.840]   And so there is a lack of-
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.160]   It's probably a very important insight that all politicians need to have and don't necessarily,
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.240]   which is you can't control everything.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   That's not right.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.240]   That's what you're there for.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.480]   It's not other basics like you can't predict the future and humans will always do something
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.480]   you don't expect.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.720]   That's not just a political or a technological thing, by the way.
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.680]   In my new job, that is the number one question I get, which is, well, how do we control this?
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.200]   And the answer is always, you can't.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.920]   And if you try to, it's going to be horrible.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:26.920]   It's going to be the bad ones.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.640]   You can put some guardrails in and you can try to anticipate the worst things that could
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.120]   happen and protect, but you still can't guarantee that you can, which is, it's kind
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.400]   of like the same conversation we always have about hacking.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.080]   Assume that everything will always get hacked.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.520]   You can try your best to stop it.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.960]   You can stop most of it, but it will just keep happening.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.480]   Well, and that's, of course, going to be relevant in six weeks when we have another
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   election.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   And already, a Defcon report showed that a great number of other machines that will
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.960]   be used to be hacked remotely.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.960]   So easy.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.960]   Oh my God.
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.880]   This is a book, I just read this article in The New Yorker.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:01.720]   I thought it was really, really good by a professor of communications, University of
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:07.000]   Pennsylvania named Kathleen Hall Jamison, she is, according to this New Yorker article,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.720]   absolutely nonpartisan.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.840]   In fact, almost humor, humorless.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.360]   At least that's as she comes off in the article.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.240]   She wrote a book called Cyber War, how Russian hackers and trolls help elect the president.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.000]   What we can't don't and do know.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.160]   And she at first poo pooed the idea as many of us did that you could throw an election
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.840]   by remote control using Facebook.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:34.160]   But she did some research and what it started for her was she does a lot of media research.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.480]   She was watching the dials during the presidential debates.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.560]   In fact, this book was originally going to be about the debates.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:46.040]   And she noticed something somewhat surprising.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:52.400]   You know, most people, most of the media watchers who watched the debates thought Clinton won
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.480]   them all pretty resoundingly.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:04.520]   However, her research showed that during the debates, there was a small but significant
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:09.800]   drop in the number of people who had the intention to vote for.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:17.360]   And at furthermore, the debates afterwards, more people thought Clinton was less trustworthy
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.800]   than more.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.320]   And she was puzzled by these results.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:27.160]   She said that didn't seem to fit the research, I would not have expected this.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.520]   So she put a lot of work into this.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:34.400]   And where her eyes really were opened was when Facebook finally started releasing the ads
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.920]   from the troll factory, the internet research agency that Russian ads.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.400]   And she said it was very clear that Russia in actually a surprisingly sophisticated way
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:51.320]   was going for that result, that you don't trust Clinton, you don't trust Clinton.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:55.720]   And she said the other thing that was very clear is it was synchronous, it was in lockstep
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:49:04.400]   with the Trump campaign's message that the two of them combined in very clear ways to
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:10.120]   create an impression, however subtle, but sufficient to change people's mind in the election.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.120]   I thought that was very interesting.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.080]   The truth is the scary part about that campaign was not that people can be swayed by media
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.320]   because we've known that since the start of media.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:20.280]   It's how cheap it was.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.040]   It cost nothing.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:27.000]   And what was interesting was that people didn't, one could argue that that wasn't media or
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.120]   that people didn't see it as media.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:35.440]   It was media, but people saw it as, oh, this is just real people saying things.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.480]   It was people still thinking that Facebook was just your aunt and your cousin and your
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.680]   old classmate when it's like, no, it's grown up into a full-fledged media.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.600]   And this honest ad-zact, which I think is a good thing that Klobuchar and others are
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.360]   backing isn't going to even come close to dealing with that problem because it's only
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.320]   dealing with paid advertising and what you're talking about is the organic content that's
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.680]   being posted on these services.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.920]   So again, it gets back to how do you control the people and how do you control the people
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.440]   who are controlling the people, which in this case could be bots controlled by foreign
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.440]   agents.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:10.080]   So that is a challenge that I think Zuckerberg doesn't yet understand how to control.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.160]   I don't think he knows what to do about it.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.360]   Well, and the real fear, of course, the worry is we've got an election coming up.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.280]   And we haven't put any controls in.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.920]   Nobody seems to understand how it worked.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.080]   And now we're going to do it again.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.840]   I am trying to predict in red waves, which is why I'm voting.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.680]   That's all I can control right now.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   Vote and don't.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.480]   I have to tell everybody on install Facebook.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.480]   I don't know.
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.280]   I mean, don't look at it.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   Have you?
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.880]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:40.280]   The problem isn't you and me and Father, Larry or Ed Bott or any of the people who are
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.960]   going to delete Facebook, that's not.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.400]   But if you don't see it, if you don't, I meant everybody.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   Everybody.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.320]   But the people whom we use Facebook the most are the ones who are going to be most impacted
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   by it.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   And the people least like to delete it.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:58.920]   Did anybody take the New York Times quiz asking you to see if you could identify the
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.960]   actual pieces of content created by Russian?
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.960]   I had not seen that.
[00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.880]   Influencers, it was very difficult.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.640]   You can take this quiz and you can see whether you can tell the difference.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.160]   And after answering each question, it will sort of walk you through how you could in
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.320]   the future tell.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.040]   You really have to work on educating yourself about what is real and what isn't in order
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   to not be fooled.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.560]   One of these posts is from a genuine Facebook page that supports feminism.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:24.880]   The other was part of an influence campaign from Russia.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:30.400]   And you guess which of these is fake and which is real.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.800]   The first one, girls make rules and you follow them.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:37.360]   If you don't like them, you live end of story, rules for dating my daughter.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.360]   I don't make the rules.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.360]   You don't make the rules.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.360]   She makes the rules.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.360]   Her body, her rules.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   Feminist father.
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.160]   Here's another one.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.840]   My boyfriend thinks I should quote my boyfriend thinks it likes it when I quote my boyfriend
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.400]   doesn't want me to dump him.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.200]   Okay.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.400]   They seem to have the same message.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.400]   Which one's real?
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.800]   I don't know.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:03.640]   And I mean, is the point being that the fake ad was somehow effective in manipulating.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:10.600]   Well, the fake ads were often used to build up follower accounts for an account and then
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.240]   in the tenth time they would do something that was political.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.240]   Because you and I.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   And reach more people.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:20.040]   Because you and I agree with this sentiment, we aren't necessarily the target for this.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.040]   It might be somebody who so virinally disagrees with it.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.600]   Typically, if you continue to read in this, the target audience is actually usually people
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.000]   who do agree with it.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.280]   And so what they would do is build the following over time, get them going and then start to
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.960]   insert things that really would influence your opinion.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.920]   But they actually seem like they're very similar.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:45.520]   This is a really this is from puppy and kitten pictures and then the political ad.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.560]   You know what's interesting about this is I don't actually share stuff like this, but
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.360]   a lot of people close to me do.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   And you can't help seeing it in your news.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.360]   Right.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.720]   When I'm wondering whether the people who whether people are sharing it who are unwittingly
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:02.520]   being duped into helping to spread propaganda.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.360]   In fact, I'm quite sure of that.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:06.480]   And which is one of the reasons why I rarely share anything.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.800]   But that's social media.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.240]   I mean, that's that's what we do.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.640]   You look for people who amplify your message.
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:15.160]   It just happens that some people have because I don't have.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.360]   You know, if I'm amplifying a message that I know, you know, if, you know, Padra, you
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:22.560]   post something and I agree with it, I know it's from you and I amplify it.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.600]   Well, that's fine because that means that I'm amplifying something that I know where
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   it came from.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.560]   If it's just some kind of mammer or poster like the ones you were showing, you might
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.320]   look at that, say, yeah, I agree with that, amplify it.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   And it could turn out that you're actually promoting something that's the exact opposite
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.720]   of what you think you're promoting.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   Right.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:40.720]   Okay.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   Yeah, I could see that.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.720]   All right.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.320]   It's really a problem with this conversation is we can't fix it.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:48.960]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.960]   That's scary.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.040]   Let's take a break and then we're going to celebrate a birthday special special birthday.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.040]   Not somebody here.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:56.040]   Wow.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.120]   Somebody you're all know.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:08.520]   This week in tech this week brought to you by wasabi wasabi.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.520]   It's that green hot stuff.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.520]   Oh, I love it.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.600]   But that's not what I'm talking about with Sabi.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.920]   It's hot, but it's hot cloud storage.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.400]   Okay.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:23.480]   From the guys, my friends who did carbonite, they knew more about, they learned more about
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.400]   how they got the patents on how hard drives worked in anybody.
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:31.800]   And when David friend, you know, kind of semi retired, this problem with David friend
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.720]   is he can't retire.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.360]   He is a serial entrepreneur and he started a new company.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:44.120]   He and his buddy, Jeff Flowers, who was the technologist behind carbonite went out and
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:49.400]   started with Sabi because he realized there was a huge opportunity here.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:53.800]   This storage is big to put it lightly.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:59.800]   They'll be an estimated 163 zettabytes of storage by 2025.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.000]   That's that's I think 21 zeros.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.560]   Tons of data.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:07.600]   There is a huge market for people who want to efficiently and affordably underscore affordable
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600]   store data.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.760]   It's critical for business to critical to get the job done.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.200]   You're going to store that data in the cloud.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   You know you are, but there are lots of issues with Sabi is disruptive technology that's
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.360]   turning the industry on its ear.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.600]   Now I know if you're about to acquire cloud storage, I know the names and you know the
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.960]   names, the big three you're going to look at.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:31.000]   I just want you to add one more name to your thinking.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:39.720]   That's all I'm asking was Sabi uses technologies that result in storage is 80% cheaper and
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:47.360]   six times faster, 80% cheaper, six times the speed and they don't charge you for egress
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.080]   free unlimited egress.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.080]   It's simple.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.640]   There's one tier of service.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   No charge for egress.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.080]   You pay for storage.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.080]   That's it.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   It is just as secure.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.760]   In some cases even more secure than your local storage.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.160]   I can think always more secure than your local storage.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:04.160]   It's HIPAA compliant.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.160]   It's FINRA compliant.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:11.160]   CJIS compliant wasabi has this thing they call the wasabi ball, which means it's a physical
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:16.320]   device that allows you to migrate petabytes of data quickly, easily securely.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   You got to check out wasabi.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:23.120]   You can experience it yourself with free unlimited storage for a month.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.320]   See it says terabyte there, but if you go to wasabi.com and click the free trial link
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.640]   use the offer code TWIT.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.480]   You're going to get unlimited for a month.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.040]   See what you think wasabi.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:43.280]   W-A-S-A-B-I dot com enter the code TWIT one low price, no tiers, no egress fees.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:44.920]   You will save it's faster.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:45.920]   It's better.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.560]   And I 11 nines of durability redundancy immutable.
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.240]   Oh, I love the immutable storage.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.400]   You'll get this.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.680]   You can say this file may never change.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:04.080]   So if you're worried about ransomware or anything, any data get corrupted.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.240]   You say this file, that's immutable.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.760]   That's that's storage.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.760]   That's permanent.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.480]   That's untouchable.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.480]   This is S3 compliance.
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.440]   It's got an S3 compliant interface, but it's not as three.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:22.600]   It's wasabi six times faster than S3, 80% less than S3 and 11 nines data durability.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.920]   And I love the idea of immutable storage.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.200]   No charge for API calls either.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.360]   W-A-S-A-B-I dot com is the offer code TWIT.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.280]   What's that?
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.480]   Now I want cloud storage on my sushi.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.400]   It's hot.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.040]   It's hot.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.160]   Google is 20.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.160]   Yep.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:53.080]   Leave that 20 years ago, the official Google anniversary, I think was the 26th.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:55.360]   I can't remember.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.560]   There was a special Google Doodle.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:04.480]   I mean, Google didn't happen all on one day, but basically it's 20 years old.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.120]   I was teaching high school.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   Were you really?
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   I was.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   Do you remember when you first used Google?
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:12.160]   I did because before that I was defaulting to Altavista.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.960]   That was your search engine before Google, you remember?
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   I do.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   Yahoo.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   It might have been--
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   Yeah, it might have been--
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   That was the one to the third engine.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   Yeah, Altavista was probably the one that was--
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.960]   It was--
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.960]   It had to be Altavista.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   It had to be Altavista.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   That was it.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:29.960]   Altavista, well, there's Jeeves.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:30.960]   There's Ask Jeeves.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.960]   There was a dog pound.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   That was sort of--
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   Dogpile.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Dogpile.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   Dogpile.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   I think it was Altavista.
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   I think Altavista.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   I was aggregating.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   Right, right.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   There were other ones.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   You don't-- oh, you know, the names are all gone.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   And they're all gone.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.960]   I started--
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   I remember excited--
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:46.960]   I remember excited--
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   Go for.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.960]   That was my first real internet thing.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.960]   Yes.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.960]   Oh, Go for predates any of this.
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.960]   Exactly.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   Oh, Go for it.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   There was excite--
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   Lycos.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   Remember Lycos?
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.960]   Yes.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   Yes.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   You remember this?
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:00.960]   Yes.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.960]   They didn't use it as much.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.960]   Is it funny how these names have just gone?
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   They're just gone.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   They're just gone.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   Completely disappeared.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.960]   Right.
[00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.960]   Well, number Sun was the dot in dot com because it was literally running like 90% of the Internet.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   I was a VISTA, but I cheated with Ask Jeeves.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   Well, Ask Jeeves was such a great idea.
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   It was.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   And that's essentially what Google has cornered.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.960]   Right.
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   Altavista was really just a big index with no smarts.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   Right.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   No, Altavista had a search with Yahoo that was the index.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   Yahoo was the index.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   I was just a head of crawler.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   Like, Go's head of crawler.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:33.960]   Right.
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.960]   I don't ask Jeeves--
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   That was all about naturalized search.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   Right.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:40.960]   That's what we--
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   What made Google so special was this concept of authority.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.960]   Right.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.960]   Givin' pages that had a lot of inbound links.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   Right.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.960]   Authority.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   And that's really what made them successful.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:56.200]   So I feel like Altavista was just-- we have an engine that crawls and if it has certain
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   words, we return it.
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.320]   But they couldn't tell whether that was an important page or a high quality page or a
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.960]   lot of people paid attention to it.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.960]   That's what Google did.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:07.840]   Which is ironically, because one of the things that's gotten Google criticized by conservatives
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:15.760]   is that it will surface very popular, highly regarded websites, which by the way often
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.440]   tend to be liberal or mainstream.
[01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.880]   But that's exactly what-- you know, when you look at the chart that was created by, I
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.920]   think, Cheryl Atkinson about the left and the right websites and how Google would skew
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920]   towards the left.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:33.480]   Well, the left was Washington Post, New York Times, CBS, ABC, all of these highly credible
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.760]   sources, which would naturally rise to the surface of a Google algorithm because Google,
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.800]   as you pointed out, was all based on authority.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.560]   That's the currency in the search economy.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.560]   How many people are linking to you?
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.560]   It still is.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560]   How many people are using you as a source?
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.560]   It still is.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.560]   It still is.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560]   It hasn't changed in really 20 years.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   And the algorithms aren't political.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.000]   And the algorithms aren't political.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.320]   The algorithms aren't political, but it happens to coincide with what people perceive to be
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.320]   liberal, which is an innocent--
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.320]   Spoken is a good liberal, Larry.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   No, it's not.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320]   Look.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.400]   Just look at them right in front of you.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.880]   I mean, no offense, but Breitbart News does not have the amount of inbound links as--
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.880]   Well, maybe it should.
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:11.880]   --here times.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.880]   Maybe it should, but it doesn't.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.880]   Yeah, this is the same argument.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.480]   In fact, Yelp, it's very interesting.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   I don't know.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.080]   Tech meme, Yelp started buying ads.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:24.920]   Whenever Google's mentioned Yelp buys an ad saying how horrible Google is.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.800]   But anybody who doesn't get high in those results for whatever reason is going to say,
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.680]   well, there's bias involved.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.680]   Right.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:36.440]   And that's really the challenge, isn't it, for Google is to prove to demonstrate that
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   their algorithms are unbiased.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.440]   It is a type of--
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   But there's always bias.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   There's always bias.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.440]   It's not random.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.440]   It's just a--
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440]   But it is.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440]   --it's the world.
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:51.800]   If 60% of the world thought that the sky was gray, it wouldn't necessarily-- or let's
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:52.800]   say green.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.640]   It wouldn't necessarily make the sky green.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.640]   Right.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.120]   It's just the majority says it.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:03.440]   And that's part of the problem with this authority is you can have authority be wrong.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.040]   But now you have to categorize certain objective truths.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.320]   And that's the hardest thing to do.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   Right.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.920]   That's where Google's having real trouble with these snippets and factoids and so on.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.560]   Well, Google is constantly questioning and struggling with these things all on its own.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:27.120]   And Google seems to be moving toward recency, the recency and frequency of update as a
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.120]   symbol of authority, which is very interesting, because you can update something all the time.
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   Right.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.480]   That doesn't mean you know more about it.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.320]   It just means you're putting more energy into it.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.320]   Right.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.720]   Google is a Thanos of the internet.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.120]   It wants to snap, be impartial, completely fair, completely random.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.560]   But we know that there's motivation behind that.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.080]   There's the people who write the algorithm.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.080]   There's the people who implement the algorithm.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.600]   There are the people who actually look at what are the data sets and an algorithm can actually
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.160]   ingest.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.680]   And you will never get rid of that ever, ever, ever, ever.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.000]   The human part of it.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.200]   And if we ever got rid of the human part, we'd have a bigger problem because it means we're
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.560]   all gone.
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.000]   Does anybody go to Google.com anymore?
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.760]   Because that's where the Google Friday, Friday, then you would have seen the Google Doodle.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.120]   I don't as often because that's actually not my primary search engine.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   What do you use?
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120]   I know what you use.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120]   It's Bing.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120]   Bing.
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120]   It's Bing.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120]   It's Bing.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   It's terrible.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   Do you like it?
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120]   You prefer it.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120]   I prefer it.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120]   It's my default.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120]   Why do you prefer it?
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   What do you like about it?
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.640]   For the searches that I do, it actually comes up with much higher quality searches.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   Interesting.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.640]   And it's not all the time.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:39.120]   So I started using on my Android device and started using Edge for the browser.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.120]   I want to like Edge so much.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.120]   That is my default.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.200]   When you search for something in Edge, you get Bing.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.360]   There are so many things they did right with Edge, but it's just missing that last five
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360]   percent.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.880]   What would be a good test of this?
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   For Edge?
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.880]   Well, just Bing.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.880]   Bing versus Google.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.640]   Yeah, what should I search for?
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.840]   Something obscure could be one test.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.640]   Have it like music or the Dave Matthews band?
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640]   Okay.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.640]   No.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640]   Boy, that is pain.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.640]   That is pain.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.080]   Did you do something you want to share with us about this?
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.960]   So what you should look for is a topic and then see what sites it brings up.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960]   That's a better one.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.960]   You know, I look a lot at internet safety because I always want to see whether to connect safely
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.960]   or safekids.com or coming up.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.720]   But those kinds of searches give you a chance.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.160]   Well, because you were just talking about the liberal versus conservative media or bias
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.480]   and media, let's choose something that we have a lot.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.480]   Well, I'm going to do Devil's Triangle.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.480]   Oh boy.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   You do whatever you want.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.480]   I'm doing doesn't.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.040]   Because those results will not be shown on the screen.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.880]   You might get excommunicated if you are.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.280]   Very first result on Bing.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.160]   I guess I should do this on the big computer.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160]   How do I use Bing?
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.720]   Oh yeah, I can use that.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720]   Bing.com.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   Yeah, right.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.720]   How does this work?
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.800]   I'll do this on, I think that Edge is using Bing.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.800]   Let's see.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.520]   No, it's using Google.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.120]   Very first result on here.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.440]   Fox News.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:13.000]   On my on my on edge on the Android phone on Google talking points memo in the New York
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:22.040]   or independent of liberal on my on my Bing the Hill, Fox News, ABC News, New York Times,
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   Reuters.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.240]   So there is a difference now partly that because I'm logged in.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.400]   That's because I'm logged in, right?
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.280]   One of the things I like about the Bing engine is that the filters are really good.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.440]   So I can drill down like only show me news sources or non news sources.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.640]   When I do these tests, I like to use a VPN so it doesn't know where I am.
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.640]   I like to use it.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.480]   Cognito mode so it doesn't know who I am.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:48.800]   I don't know if that's the perfect way to get the quote objective report.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:52.480]   So go to Indiana through a VPN or something and see what happens.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.960]   Let me do, well, I won't do, I won't, I'll do the location, but let me do it in Cognito
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960]   window and go to Bing.
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   That'll help, yeah.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.280]   At least it won't, I won't be logged in.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.520]   By the way, Google and Microsoft, if you could, I would love it if you would put a persistent
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.400]   setting so that when I'm in Italy, it doesn't keep, oh, I know.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.400]   I hate that.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400]   It's not awful.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.400]   I hate that you get everything to tell you.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.320]   How many times would tell you that I want English?
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.320]   Right.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.160]   Doesn't it know that you happen to speak English, even though you might be an Italy?
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.400]   I know it drives me nuts.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:23.200]   Well, Google actually just announced that in part of their, their new set of algorithm
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.080]   changes, they are going to have in their news feed, which I think you get if you go to
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.880]   like the Chrome, Google homepage on your mobile device.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   Right.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.400]   For instance, if you were a Spanish speaker in the United States, you're going to start
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.360]   to get results in Spanish and English.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.800]   They've never done that before.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:39.600]   They say that's coming soon, which is really interesting.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.160]   I would like that.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.480]   So here's Bing.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.000]   It's got a, actually, you know, I do kind of like this.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.120]   It's got a timeline.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.120]   It's got a little news carousel with Fox, but ABC and others.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.840]   It's got, I'm not crazy about, oh, I guess these aren't tweets.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840]   These are.
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:06:59.840]   These are.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.840]   This is perspective.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:01.840]   That's commentary.
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.840]   Actually, returning it.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.840]   Okay.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840]   So this is actually, I think that's, you know what?
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.320]   Maybe I'm going to have to re-assist because Google, I don't think does is good a job.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.920]   Here's the news carousel, top stories, the little bit of Wikipedia stuff here, then Twitter,
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:21.200]   which honestly, yeah, I don't think Twitter belongs in that list.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.200]   Videos.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.560]   Guess where those videos, most of them are probably on YouTube.
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.560]   Oh, no.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.560]   Mashable CNN YouTube.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.400]   You know what?
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.960]   I think Father Robert, at least on this search, Bing does win.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:36.760]   I'm telling you, it's, I know it's an inside joke, but I have over the last couple of
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.560]   years, I have found it quite good at what I needed to do.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560]   I'm going to have to.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.560]   And I love to be home page.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.880]   I like to spread around my internet footprint.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.800]   I don't want it all to live in Google's house.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.800]   Right.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.800]   Right.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800]   Smart.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:49.800]   That's good idea.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.800]   It's part of your fuzzing strategy.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.080]   It's part of my fuzzing.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.480]   This is the Google doodle you missed because you use Bing on the, on the Google homepage.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.920]   Oh, 20 years old.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   20 years old.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920]   And they start.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:04.800]   It can buy your sounds and the old Google page, which I love.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.360]   Oh, I did you hear that?
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.240]   Happened on why to negotiate it to 14 for did it?
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   You could tell.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240]   I hear that.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.360]   You're the kind of geek that would notice it didn't go the buying buying.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.600]   I miss that sound.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   I, you know what?
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.280]   I'm going to do that as a startup sound on my computer.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.400]   So it's going through the years.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.360]   And different languages.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.400]   Do you remember when they did their IPO and the Royal Yap analysts were saying, we just
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.120]   don't know how Google's making money.
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   Oh, Lord.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120]   Right.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120]   Right.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.360]   That's, that just shows you why you don't listen to analysts.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.360]   My mother in law never forgave me because she asked me if she should invest.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.120]   And I said, I really don't know.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.120]   That's what I said.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.120]   I gave her all the reasons why she should be cautious.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.920]   And of course, she never, you know, never forgave me.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.080]   She really don't know Larry.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.000]   Larry, you're really done.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Really did.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.040]   I had some insight information, but it didn't help.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040]   I didn't have any.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.600]   Oh, you're the buying calendar.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   You're a fuffle.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   Giff or Jeff.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.400]   It's still not been resolved.
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.400]   Selfie worse.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:27.200]   How do you make a
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   $10,000 in your house?
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   I don't know.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.200]   I don't know.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.200]   I mean, I know how much they bought.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.200]   I know how much they bought.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   I don't know how much they bought a $10,000 in your house.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.200]   I don't know how much they bought a $10,000 in your house.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.200]   I don't know how much they bought a $10,000 in your house.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.200]   I don't know.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   I don't know how much they bought a $10,000 in your house.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200]   I don't know.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.200]   I don't know how much they bought a $10,000 in your house.
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.200]   I don't know how much they bought a $10,000 in your house.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:58.200]   Why is Avocado?
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.200]   Maybe.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.840]   Google will have an event a week from Tuesday at which they will announce something, probably
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.200]   a Pixel 3 phone or two.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.560]   Almost certainly.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:13.200]   According to a number of people, including Kevin Tofel from about Chromebooks.com, the
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:22.960]   knock turn, which is the Google Pixel Slate, it'll be a tablet version of a Chromebook.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.920]   You see the keyboard, but that's made by Bridge.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.040]   That's how they found out.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.160]   Was BridgeBRY-DGE, which makes aftermarket keyboards, apparently had buried somewhere
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.480]   in its code, this render of a Bridge keyboard attached to, what?
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:41.440]   A Google Pixel tablet, perhaps.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.720]   I'm sure it'll be very expensive because it's from Google, but...
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.360]   It's a Surface Pro competitor, right?
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.360]   Exactly.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.400]   There was even a rumor, I don't know how credible, that it might even run Windows as well as
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.400]   Chrome OS.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.400]   That would be strange.
[01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.400]   Why would you want to do that?
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.400]   Well, here's my theory about that because if you...
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:03.760]   So what is weird to me about the idea of anything tablet related that's also a Chromebook
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:10.760]   is that usually creators want that so that you can create things on that Surface and without
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.280]   Windows, it's very hard to do anything with those files.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.720]   That's my only theory.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:21.000]   My theory is that this is probably going to be the last one plus phone I have for a while.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.440]   I love it, but the 6T won't have a headphone jack.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.440]   This annoys me.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.440]   You have to have one?
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.160]   I've not had headphones.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.400]   Well, good luck on that.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.640]   The Pixel 2 doesn't have one.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   No, it's going away.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   I mean, it might be the last phone I have for it.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.520]   It adds insult to injury on the new iPhone.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.360]   They don't even bundle the adapter.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   No.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360]   Because they want you to buy it.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.200]   It is my long-standing theory that Apple has become a dongle company.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.520]   I'm not joking.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.520]   It means Apple and the dongle company.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520]   Remember that?
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.080]   When people show up to Defcon or Black Hat with a phone that they need to use wireless
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.760]   headphones on, that's fun.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.760]   Snarfing.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.760]   Snarfing.
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.760]   Yeah, I don't have any.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.760]   All the data points.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.880]   I don't have any phones anymore, except for my note.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   The note has it.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   That's right.
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.880]   Samsung still does headphone jack.
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   I hope they keep doing that.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.320]   And I know it's an old port, but it is such a useful port.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.320]   It might be bad.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.320]   Look at me.
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.880]   Old can be useful.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.320]   I'm actually older than the headphone jack.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   Aren't I?
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   Is that right?
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   You are?
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   Oh, come on.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   Headphone jack.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.720]   I mean, they've had headphone jacks on televisions for a long time.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.640]   Yeah, but I'm maybe older than the 3.5 millimeter.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   Yeah, you're certainly.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   The quarter inch jack.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   I think are we all?
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   You are, Leo.
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.640]   I'm sure.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.200]   The quarter inch is definitely older than you.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   Okay.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200]   Quarter inch has got to be old.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.640]   The quarter inch jack was invented in 18-7.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.200]   There's a little older than you.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.200]   Okay.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.000]   What about this 3.5?
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.400]   But the little tiny, yeah, wow.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.240]   It was used in telephone switchboards in 1878.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.080]   I remember that too.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.480]   You have to be the grandite 5.5.7.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.400]   Those are the good old days.
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.400]   Let's see.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   The miniature.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.400]   The miniature.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400]   1950s.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400]   Really?
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   Transistor radio.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   That's right.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.400]   Transistor radio.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.400]   But that was a mono.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   That's a true conductor.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.200]   They didn't have the stereo.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   All right.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.000]   They didn't have the older than the mini jack that you find on most telephones, right?
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.440]   Or some used to find on most telephones.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.360]   We're all older than the Sony media.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.000]   I think that my Twitter bio is not going to be younger than the mini jack.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.800]   I am younger than the mini jack.
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.240]   Mine is going to be younger than the quarter inch silence.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.240]   Or the other quarter of the journey.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.280]   I get annoyed by effect.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:43.080]   I always forget to charge my headphones and the old headphones get require power, but
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.080]   wireless ones do.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   It's ridiculous.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.920]   So I want to be listening to my phone through the speakers, which is horrible.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.000]   You're absolutely forced to buy wireless headphones and I just...
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   And charge them.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   And they're not that good.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   No.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.360]   I switch to AirPods and I have...
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   I am going to suddenly admit...
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.360]   Okay.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.960]   Don't go drop out sometimes on you.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   Very rarely.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   Oh, and they drop out a lot.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   And how do you really...
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.960]   Losing them.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.040]   I lose things like that.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.600]   I don't lose them somehow.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.600]   I don't know.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.600]   I have a lot of money on it.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.600]   I am really losey.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.840]   I put my...
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:18.000]   I used a brother label printer, put my name Leo in big letters on my case.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   On my case.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.480]   Because I do lose them also.
[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.480]   The only thing that bothers me about them the most is just aesthetic, which is that
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.480]   that case looks like a floss case.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.480]   It kind of does.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.480]   I don't know.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.400]   I just feel like I shouldn't be forced to use any particular technology.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.400]   Right?
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.400]   Headphone technology works.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400]   It's inexpensive.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.400]   So you're forced to use headphones.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400]   It's more reliable.
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   Yeah, but it's more reliable.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   They're generic.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.760]   It's a far more flexible technology.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   Sure.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   It's more...
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760]   It is more reliable.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   Absolutely.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.360]   Amazon has donated...
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.240]   I'm thrilled because I donate to Wikipedia every month.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   Not quite as much.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.240]   Oh, good.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:58.200]   Amazon has donated $1 million to Wikipedia, the home corporation for Wikipedia.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.080]   And I honestly, Wikipedia is so incredibly valuable.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:08.160]   I think you could make a strong case where it being the single best invention of the
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.160]   Internet.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:14.360]   I was on our campus because I'm back in San Francisco and I just realized that the freshmen
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.560]   coming onto campus never knew a world without Wikipedia.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560]   That's kind of weird.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560]   I use it every day.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.560]   That's the research tool.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.440]   I sent them $100 a month just because I feel like that's paying for a research tool.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.240]   How skeptical are they about Wikipedia?
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.240]   Not.
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.240]   Or educated, I guess.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:36.080]   Well, I mean, they know way more than their parents do and way more than the teachers
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.840]   on campus do.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:40.480]   But they know how to use it.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.200]   They don't care how it works.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   But do they care whether it's factual?
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.200]   Do they...
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.680]   For instance, we were talking before the show about this devil's triangle.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.320]   And during Brent Kavanaugh's testimony, when she said that notation is your book, Devil's
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:58.360]   Triangle, was a drinking game, the Wikipedia article was changed to say that it was a drinking
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.360]   game.
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.440]   Now, what I love about Wikipedia is its self-healing and it was immediately or almost immediately
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.320]   changed back.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.800]   But I guess some of that depends on when you hit it.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.560]   It also depends on how prominent.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.960]   It also depends on how prominent the story is.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:18.360]   So for example, when somebody changed my Wikipedia entry to say that I was born in Egypt, it took
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.680]   about two months before somebody fixed that.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:21.680]   Why?
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   Even who did it?
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.680]   Why did you do that?
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   I don't know why I wasn't born in Egypt.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.680]   My name was Maggie.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.680]   It could be an Arabic name.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.680]   It's a thing.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   It's a thing.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:31.120]   He's a famous Egyptian radio journalist Larry Mann.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.120]   Apparently.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.120]   I don't know.
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:36.560]   I thought, but you know, the point is that because millions of people don't go to my page,
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.520]   I'm not that controversial, it actually remained that way for quite a while.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.000]   And you're not allowed to change it?
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   Yeah, I didn't.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.240]   I was actually clean about that.
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.240]   Good.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:47.000]   I stayed in Egypt for a while.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.040]   That's actually the changing phases of education.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.920]   It used to be that we had to teach kids how to find information.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.240]   I know a lot of schools that say you may not use Wikipedia, which I think is a mistake.
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   Well, which I think is a mistake.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:01.680]   Our school, our school says that you can use it as a reference, but it cannot be your
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:02.680]   own description.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.880]   And it also can be your primary source.
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.880]   Right.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.360]   So my son is in high school and what he does is uses Wikipedia to find sources.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   You start.
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360]   Sorry, Brian.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.560]   And then he knows to go to the sources and click through.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.200]   And he also has a very, I mean, he may be a special case because his mother is a journalist,
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.440]   but he has a very sophisticated set of his own standards for the kinds of sources he
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440]   is.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.480]   See, that's the advancement of education technology though, because it used to be we just needed
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.720]   to get them the information.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:34.520]   Now we actually have to teach them, okay, you have access to unheard of amounts of
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.520]   information.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.080]   We're going to show you how to actually choose what is usable and what's not.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.600]   Well, the worst, the most difficult, by worst, I mean, the most difficult to navigate is
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:44.600]   a YouTube.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600]   Okay.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:51.640]   And most teenagers and much are going to get all of their information from YouTube.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.640]   And it is difficult to navigate.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   Really?
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.120]   I don't even need difficult to navigate.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.400]   Like how difficult to know what makes somebody an authority, whether somebody on YouTube
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   is an authority.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   There are a lot of people who speak with great conviction and very...
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:10.320]   You do with that all the time, the guy who put the MacBook Pro and the refrigerator.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:17.400]   Pretty much changed Apple's business unilaterally on YouTube and was he an expert in benchmarking?
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400]   Probably not.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   See, I find...
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.040]   I find Wikipedia really useful.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.920]   I had to repair it by toilet a few months ago.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.360]   And I was about to call a plumber and I said, "Yeah, let me just go to YouTube and figure
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.360]   out how to do this."
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.600]   And it was actually very easy because somebody stepped me through the process.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.120]   And I find it very useful for that.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.760]   And if I were looking to buy a toilet, I'm not sure I would rely on some anonymous person's
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   recommendations.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   I'd go to...
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.760]   No, you would go to YouTube for a toilet.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.760]   YouTube is great for...
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760]   It's great for how to.
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.760]   It's fantastic.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.600]   No, and with all degree...
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.880]   And I'm going to give a plug to present company.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:54.000]   I mean, that's what I love about CNET and PCMag and PCWorld and all of the other places
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   where you actually get a buy line and get a review.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   Can't reach church.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   Let's not leave them.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   You know, you know...
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   In your product recommendation.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.320]   You know, you may not agree with it, but at least you know who they are and you can rely
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.960]   on hopefully that they're being honest as well.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:08.960]   Sure.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.960]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.160]   I mean, it's important to know that you can get group opinion, but you also can go to
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.040]   people who know how to evaluate something and have them for that.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:19.440]   I think that as long as you're accountable, you're fine.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:26.120]   The mistake probably on YouTube is going to the front page or using trend.
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.120]   Or using the algorithm.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:32.440]   And the reality is that you just go spill right into the next video and assume that it is
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.440]   appropriate for you.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:38.800]   But if I wanted to know how to cook baked chicken, probably if I typed baked chicken
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.320]   recipe in YouTube, I would find some pretty...
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.320]   Let's see.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   Look at this.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:50.040]   But without using Google, which is YouTube also, but without going to sort of a brand
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.040]   that you know, right?
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:52.400]   Yeah, I don't know any of these brands.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:59.400]   Something with a rating.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.200]   Chris Cook for you too.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:05.000]   Original Naked Chef, BlackWasi TV, Patrick Erskine.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   They all have recipes.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   It's hard to know if any of those recipes are good.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   Has anybody tested my recipes?
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   I would not eat chicken.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   Cooked by Naked Chef.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   Here's the funny thing that you think I could buy an Naked Chef.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   About my YouTube page.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.400]   And I think it's because I'm fuzzing all of my data.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.400]   The only videos that ever show up on my front page are videos I've already seen.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.160]   I've got a bunch of stuff from everything great about.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.800]   There's a series from CinemaWinds.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.000]   There's a bunch of a bridge series of anime.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   There's F1.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   That's about it.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.040]   I get 911 days of beard growth time lapse video.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.200]   I don't know why.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.720]   See, I would like to get odd recommendations like that.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.600]   Why am I getting 911 days of beard growth?
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.080]   Because it's in a round the world road trip and you've been traveling.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.800]   Oh, it's travel.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.400]   It's by that, by the way, after day 410, that beard's getting all over.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.400]   No, see, no.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.400]   I could run really.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.400]   No, no, no, no.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   That's a great video.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.400]   That video, where else are you going to see that by YouTube, right?
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.400]   That's conviction.
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.400]   900 days of beard growth.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400]   Wow.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.400]   You're not going to...
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.400]   You think it's amazing that his wife is still traveling with him.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   No.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.400]   It's like he could have things in there that we don't even...
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   He's hiding rodents in there probably.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.400]   I don't...
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.400]   Okay, so that's why I got that.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.400]   You're saying I got that because of travel.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400]   We are on a tangent.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:20.920]   So does it know about your Google searches as well or does it just know about your YouTube
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.920]   head?
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920]   Everything Google...
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.160]   Well, okay, so that's an interesting thing that actually comes to one of the stories
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:29.400]   that was a big story this week is that Chrome 69, all of a sudden...
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.400]   Start signing that in.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.400]   Start signing that in.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   If you sign into any YouTube...
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   Sorry, Google property.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   It signs you into Chrome.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   That's right.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.960]   It doesn't synchronize.
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.840]   You have to turn that on, but it does sign you into Chrome.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.760]   People got very upset about that.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:52.880]   Matthew Green, who's a highly respected cryptographer at John Hopkins, said, "I'm using Firefox.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.440]   That's unacceptable."
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.920]   Google's response, by the way, was quick and they said, "All right, next version.
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.920]   We're going to give you a chance to opt out."
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:03.280]   But why were people so upset about that?
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.760]   Because they see Chrome and their Google services as two different things.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760]   But they're not.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   They're not.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   But people see it.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:11.760]   And I think this is my browser.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.760]   Those are my services.
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:13.760]   I think normal users don't.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:19.920]   In fact, Google remember a big deal a couple of years ago unified all their services.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:23.120]   The logins used to have a separate YouTube login and a separate Gmail login.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.120]   They unified it all.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.240]   They unified the user and privacy agreements.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.600]   People weren't up in arms around that.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:32.080]   But I think honestly, that reflected how people think of Google.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.080]   They log in once.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   They expect it to be logged in.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:35.080]   That's how my iPhone works.
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:40.880]   Yeah, I have to say, it bothers me from a privacy standpoint, but I also am so glad
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.520]   they did it.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   My life is so much better.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   I'm the same way.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.680]   It really bothers me and I will always disconnect that.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.160]   However, it is one less technical support thing I get from my parents.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:53.160]   Because they're always logged in.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.160]   Oh my gosh.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.600]   I mean, I spend so much less time dealing with this now.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.880]   Isn't that how your phone works?
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:22:58.880]   Your iPhone works that way.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:22:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   You know what's interesting?
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:03.800]   Once in a while, my wife will come to my computer and want to get into her Gmail account.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.360]   And we have to go into Econ needle mode.
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:10.560]   If we go to Gmail for my account, I'd otherwise have to log out and log her back in, which
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:13.640]   is great, since I'm usually the only one who uses my computer.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.520]   But the other thing, the only thing you have to remember is if you want to do something
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.880]   that's absolutely private, you make sure you log out and go into Econ needle mode.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.560]   Just don't assume that anything you type into Google is private if you might be logged
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.040]   in or if you might be synced.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:31.080]   I think that's a great recommendation, but I am also skeptical about Econ needle mode.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.080]   Econ needle mode.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.080]   We know it doesn't affect.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.080]   It doesn't really.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.080]   It doesn't really.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.080]   Cookies, it doesn't.
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.080]   No.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.080]   Hide you from Google at all.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080]   Really.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.080]   That someone goes in in Econ needle mode and there's someone at the FBI going, "Where did
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.080]   he go?"
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.080]   That's not how it works.
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:53.120]   No, it doesn't have any impact on anybody who's able to tap into you, absolutely.
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.240]   A VPN might or might not.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.760]   I never, that's where I'm skeptical.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:01.640]   I wonder if VPNs are really secure if the VPN companies claim they are.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:06.800]   See, I run a VPN through Tor and then I encrypt it on my side.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.520]   No, you don't take any chances.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.920]   It also means that I do have 14 or four speeds.
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:14.000]   It's so amazing because Robert is a priest.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.040]   There's probably not a whole lot of secret stuff.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.040]   Go on.
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:19.040]   Well, maybe I take it back.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.040]   Actually, be careful here.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.560]   I'm just, you of all the people I know have more privacy protections in place and I think
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.040]   is more academic for you.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.360]   You've got some great cryptography that I've only started to figure out.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360]   Really?
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360]   Some of it's incredible.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   Just like secret messages and stuff.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.560]   What stuff you wouldn't think of.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   When I meet somebody-
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.960]   Yes, because of a long history, I don't think of this.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.440]   When I meet somebody who takes such pains, I'm usually like, "You don't have children
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.760]   because you have time to do that."
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.400]   It takes so much time to be private.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.400]   It does.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:53.920]   People used to do these PGP keys and I mean, would you strike me nuts?
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.920]   I still do that.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:55.920]   I still do that.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.360]   I have two PGP keys that I think have been used three times.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360]   Yeah, probably.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:04.440]   You know, because I publicly use remote PGP and recommend it, I get a lot of, not a lot,
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.160]   but I get email every day from people using PGP.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160]   Right.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:12.640]   Actually, it's a bit of an upset lately because the new PGP for Macintosh, they're charging
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.640]   you.
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.040]   They said, "You can still compile it for free.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.200]   It's still open source free software, but we're going to charge you 23 bucks a year for
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:23.840]   support and you have to log into it."
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.840]   Which I was fine.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.840]   I understand.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.200]   You got a- there's no reason an open source project people have to work for free.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.720]   That's fine if they want to charge.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.200]   But I paid for it and I never got any long-inner anything.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.920]   So now I'm just out 23 bucks and I still can't use it.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.160]   But you feel better, right?
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.640]   But I feel so good about privacy.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.880]   I'm so secure that I don't even- I can't even use it anymore.
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:48.240]   You're like that one guy who paid for WSFTP.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:49.240]   Oh yeah.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.920]   Oh, when I am that's right.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.920]   Wins it.
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:53.920]   I am both.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:54.920]   One guy who paid for Wins it.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:55.920]   Both.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:56.920]   I paid for both.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.920]   I'm still sending $10 a month to AOL.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.920]   Don't joke.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.920]   Don't joke.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.920]   I know people like that.
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:01.920]   People did for years.
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:04.720]   I just kept paying, right?
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.160]   One of my best friends in the Jesuits still pays for his AOL account because he's convinced
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:13.000]   that if he doesn't pay they're going to cancel his email.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.120]   They actually take your money still?
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   Throw what?
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.680]   It's not even a credit card.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.080]   It auto debits from his checking account.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.080]   Wow.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.840]   What exactly does he think that he's buying?
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:27.360]   He thinks that he has to pay for the email account.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.360]   Oh wow.
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.240]   What does AOL think that they're selling him?
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.240]   No.
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   That's my bigger question.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:35.280]   Oh, well for a while there, didn't they have ad free accounts if you paid or with it?
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.280]   Yahoo did that.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.280]   You could buy it.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.280]   You could pay it and not get ads.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.280]   I think on Yahoo.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.280]   Yahoo.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:41.280]   I used to do that.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.800]   I think I just recently stopped paying for Yahoo mail professional or whatever.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.960]   I might need to stop paying for Juno Pro.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   Juno.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.240]   I have a dial up account with Juno.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:51.240]   I'm just in case.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.240]   I'm ready.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.240]   I don't have a modem.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.480]   But if I had to get one, I could.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   You know what?
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.040]   I lost this in this move.
[01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:00.480]   I used to have an acoustic coupler.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.480]   Oh nice.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.520]   I didn't take that with me to Rome and I couldn't find it.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.800]   I think it got tossed out.
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.440]   Oh Larry's got one.
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.360]   It's like oh yeah, one of those.
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.600]   You should, you know, it would be hysterical if you created a dummy office that was completely
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.600]   outfitted in technology.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.600]   Oh, retro tech.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.600]   Retro tech.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:17.600]   Welcome to the Vatican.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.600]   Larry, let us see it.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.040]   No, no, I say if I, this is, you remember what these were.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.040]   Oh my god.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.040]   A Western electric phone.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.040]   Dial, that actual dial.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.040]   I love the dials.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.480]   You know, you're not allowed to own that.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:27.480]   You have to rent that.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:28.480]   Don't laugh.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.440]   I was, when I was a kid, my parents were in fear of being a fan of the internet.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.440]   The AT&T truck.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.560]   Actually a specific bell at the time because I used to buy phones on the black market
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.960]   and wire them into my house.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.960]   It was actually a felony at the time.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:42.360]   Yeah, no, I could have been.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.800]   That went all the way to Supreme Court.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.800]   Now here's the card challenge.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.320]   The key challenge with the rotary phones.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.320]   Can you dial a number without using the dial?
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320]   Yes.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320]   Yes.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320]   I had a phone when I was a kid.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.320]   Can you tell me that?
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.520]   When I was a kid, I had a phone that didn't, I can do it.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:58.520]   Yep.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.520]   That's all it is.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   I used to tell you what it is.
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.480]   I had a phone that didn't have a dial and I learned how to do that.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.320]   And it stood me well one day, oh, I'm admitting another felony.
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.480]   Years and years ago, I was in SFO, an airport.
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.280]   And remember they used to have the phones that you could pick up and call a rent a car.
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.280]   Right, right.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.480]   And they didn't have dials, but they had switches.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.520]   I could actually make free phone calls.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.360]   Oh, well, how can you?
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.360]   Well, how can you?
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:23.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.160]   So that's all that that dial did was just send pulses down the line.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:28.160]   Disconnect, reconnect, disconnect.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.480]   You're one of the very few people that know that.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.080]   I'm impressed and a young guy.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.760]   I'm a lot older than you think.
[01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.800]   I was actually bored before the quarter inch phone, oh, Jack.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.720]   Oh, I actually once used cranks.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.720]   I was in a gas station outside of Palm Springs when I was about 15 years old and they actually
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.280]   had a phone with a crank on it.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.280]   Wow.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.680]   Oh, and now I'm an old crank.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.600]   Oh, no, what?
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.200]   We actually, we have one of those in the Korea.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.920]   They took, I, there's a secret floor.
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:58.720]   It's not, it's not like telling you you need to get an office.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.000]   You need to get all this old stuff in there and accoust a coupler, a crank phone.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.920]   It has a printing press that looks like it's from the 1700s.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920]   Go to burn.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.560]   It's got a crank phone with complete with the like the, the little comically weird.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.480]   Oh, head, your piece you have to hold up.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.160]   No, but this is an original.
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.160]   This is not a remake.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.880]   It's an original, right?
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.280]   John, John, jammer B brought me one.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:23.280]   It's an original.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.280]   All right.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.280]   Okay.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.280]   I have a lot of antiques.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.120]   If you want to borrow anything for the Vatican.
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.120]   So you did take the steampunk computer.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.120]   I did.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.120]   I have your steampunk.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.000]   Is that sitting in honor in the, in the holy city?
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   It is actually, it did make it over to Rome.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.320]   And I, it's probably going to go into the studio.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.960]   I think you should put that somewhere.
[01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.560]   I'm telling you, you could be a stairwell of punk people.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:51.360]   They come in and, and you've got like, yeah, Francis is using it, skyping on the steampunk.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:57.000]   They have one of those really old typewriters like rusted that has the long throw keys.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.360]   And I want to turn that into a keyboard.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.840]   That would be awesome.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.840]   Oh.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.400]   Let's take a break.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:05.800]   When we come back, Estonia is suing.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:09.560]   FCC is hanging.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.600]   And one small step for the web, Tim Berners-Lee is up to something.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:15.320]   I hope you can explain it to me because I don't get it at all.
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.200]   It's all coming up as we continue.
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:20.000]   We had a great week this week on, on the network.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.200]   In fact, we prepared a little video for your enjoyment watch.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.920]   Previously, on to it.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:31.000]   We are live from the Microsoft Ignite OCCC podcast theater.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.320]   What's going down in the OCCC?
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.320]   See.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   Windows Weekly.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.360]   We get to touch the Surface Hub too.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:41.240]   Did they show you the things that it did in the video?
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.240]   Remember that?
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:46.560]   So we, we saw and got to perform the rotation.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.560]   It's neat, right?
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560]   It was.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.000]   I could almost picture people just rotating the screen arbitrarily just to watch it.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   Know how.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.200]   And we got the Nintendo Switch.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.840]   I think this is really cool.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.040]   You don't have to just play on your own region.
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:05.800]   On your Nintendo Switch, you need to have set up a Nintendo account that has like Japan
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.280]   as one example as the default region.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:12.520]   And boom, I am in the Japanese version of the NES.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:18.160]   The Japanese eShop gives you options for other games, three demos of games that aren't necessarily
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.160]   out here.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:26.160]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:27.160]   You really do.
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.560]   I mean, I don't know how much bigger the screen is, but it's enough.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.560]   It's a little bit bigger.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.360]   But the important thing is they're banned compatible Leo.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.840]   I don't have to fall into a fetal position and just cry.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:39.120]   We were all at least 20% expecting to hear the words watch band dongle.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.120]   Oh, God.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.120]   Introduce.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.120]   Ah.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.320]   To it, technology isn't always pretty, but we are.
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.320]   Apple missed a bet there.
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.320]   They could have had a watch band dongle.
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:52.480]   That was an awesome opportunity loss.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.680]   Dongle opportunity loss.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:59.680]   I showed they brought to you by Rocket Mortgage, quick and loans, the best lender, biggest lender
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.040]   in the country.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:06.000]   Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row focuses on the customer experience.
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.280]   When you get a home loan and they know it's a challenge, right?
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.280]   It's a big deal.
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.400]   You're buying the most expensive thing you'll ever buy.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.120]   You're writing the biggest check you'll ever buy.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.840]   And there's a lot of anxiety associated with it and they want to make it easy.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:21.360]   You know, they created Rocket Mortgage just so you don't have to go to the bank, you know,
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.680]   get all dressed up, pretend you have the money to see the bank only lends money to people
[01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.600]   who don't need money.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.480]   And so that's not going to work.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.600]   So no, instead you go to Rocket Mortgage to answer a few simple questions.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:32.800]   You can do it on your phone.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:33.800]   It's quick.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.800]   It's easy.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.840]   And you can get a loan in minutes.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.840]   So that's a great start.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:41.040]   But because of rising interest rates, it's not all.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.840]   There's still some anxiety because even after you get that loan, there's some pressure.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.600]   There's some uncertainty.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.920]   Are the interest rates going to go up?
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:52.560]   Do I have to buy a house quickly so that I don't have to pay tens of thousands of dollars
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.840]   more because of the interest rates going up?
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:58.840]   So that's why Rocket Mortgage and Quick and Loads created the power buying process.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:32:59.840]   Step one's still there.
[01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.520]   The pre-qualified approval, a few simple questions.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.040]   No need to get paperwork.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.360]   No need to call the bank and get your old check statements or previous employers for
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.360]   stubs.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.360]   They'll do it all for you.
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.000]   And within a few minutes, you get pre-qualified approval.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.280]   Then step two, within 24 hours, they'll verify your income, your assets, and your credit.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.160]   Again, no effort on your part.
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.800]   They've got trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:26.000]   Once you give them permission, they can get all that information.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.040]   And then they give you this thing they call verified approval.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.680]   Basically, you're now a cash buyer.
[01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:35.600]   When you go to a house and you say to the seller, "I want to buy this house," you show
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.960]   them the letter or even the screen on Rocket Mortgage.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.280]   And it says, "They're verified.
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.280]   They're good for it.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:42.280]   They're good for the money."
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.920]   Right at the front of the line.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.680]   But here's where step three makes such a difference.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.400]   Once you're verified, you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.
[01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.880]   They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.520]   You have three months where no risk of the rates going up.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.680]   If they go down, they go down and that's great.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.080]   But they can't go up.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.240]   So you win either way.
[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:06.640]   This is exactly what you'd expect from a customer-focused company.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:09.720]   They're thinking about your experience and they're making it better.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:14.520]   It's quick and loans and rocket mortgage and you can get started very easily right now.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.000]   In fact, set up the account.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.240]   If you're going to go home hunting soon, maybe you're going to need a loan soon.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.240]   Maybe you want to refi.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:21.240]   Set up the account.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.240]   Do that right now.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.560]   Rocket Mortgage.com/twit2.
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.640]   And when you use that URL, they know they heard it on Twit.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   That's good for us.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:31.200]   Rocket Mortgage.com/twit2.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:36.200]   Rate shield approvals only valid in certain 30-year purchase transactions.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.040]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.240]   Set up the accounts on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:45.280]   Equal housing, lender licensed in all 50 states.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.760]   NMLS consumer access.org 3030.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:53.200]   All you have to remember, rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.960]   Rate shield approval.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:56.120]   The verified approval.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.520]   I mean, this thing is great.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:04.360]   Rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.840]   You'll remember this, Father Robert.
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:14.520]   Estonia had those digital ID cards, and they had a chip in them that had the fingerprint.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:19.040]   And it was provided by a digital security firm called Giamalto.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.640]   You also remember probably there was a security flaw in them.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:29.000]   And Estonia had to recall every one of those digital cards, 1.3 million of them.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.240]   They're used all over Estonia for services, for identity.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.920]   It's a huge deal.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.840]   And Estonia is so pissed off, they're suing for 152 million euros.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   They should.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840]   They should?
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:44.840]   I'm sure that's really expensive to deal with.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.160]   Yes, that's not going to cover what they paid for that system.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:53.320]   They said Estonia police and border guard board said Giamalto had created private key
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:59.120]   codes for individual cards, leaving government IDs vulnerable to external cyber attack instead
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.360]   of embedding it on the chip's card as promised.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:07.240]   It turned out our partner had violated this principle for years, and we see this is a
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.520]   very serious breach of contract.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.780]   They were in use from 14 to 17.
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:12.780]   2017.
[01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.580]   The newest versions.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.020]   They were used for everything.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:18.560]   That's how you lived in that country.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.000]   And I was going to get one, because you don't have to be -- Seriously.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.260]   That's right, a Tony and Citizen.
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:25.640]   You can apply for this digital ID card.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.900]   It can be used as your PGP key.
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:31.360]   It can be used as an identity card.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.360]   That's very cool.
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.680]   I thought it was really neat.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:37.840]   But you remember when we found out about this flaw, we talked about this in security
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.160]   now.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.160]   It made them invalid.
[01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:42.040]   Made them insecure.
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:47.360]   The FCC is hanging a $37 million fine on Blockbuster.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360]   Oh, Blockbuster.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360]   I was in the house.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:51.360]   I was in the house.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.360]   I was in the house.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:53.360]   I was in the house.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.360]   Oh, I'm so in there.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.360]   We're so mature.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.860]   I'm misreading this thing.
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:37:01.120]   There was that one Blockbuster store in New York that had one video and video.
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.120]   This is what happens.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:06.560]   FCC hangs a Blockbuster fine over a robocaller.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.160]   Accused of spoofing real numbers.
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.160]   There's only one.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.800]   Well, you see it all the time.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.760]   It's called neighbor spoofing.
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:15.760]   I see it all the time.
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:16.760]   I get calls -- Yeah, I get all the time.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.760]   Right.
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.120]   From not just your area code, but from the exchange you're on.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.200]   Oh, it's the worst.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.800]   I get those at work all the time.
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:25.560]   And you have to answer, because what if it's your kid's school or a neighbor?
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560]   You have to answer.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:27.560]   Right.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:30.640]   Or in the case of my job, what if it's somebody I work with?
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:31.640]   It looks like it is.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:35.440]   Yeah, I just got to the point where if it doesn't identify who it is and it's not someone I know,
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.440]   I just don't answer.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.440]   I know.
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:39.440]   I know that's not an option.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.440]   I don't answer.
[01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:42.240]   I'm getting a double call in Chinese.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:47.760]   I have no idea why anybody thinks that I'm extremely calm.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.760]   Use Microsoft Translate.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.760]   It's a very good thing.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.880]   It's their advertising for bowling.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.640]   So the company was called Affordable Enterprises.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:02.680]   They made, according to the FCC, more than 2.3 million maliciously spoofed telemarketing
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:08.520]   calls just to Arizonans alone during a 14 month span selling home improvement and remodeling
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.920]   services.
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:16.000]   So I'm thrilled this is a big, this will mean nothing, but we need more people to be
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000]   fined and caught.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.640]   Well, isn't it recently predicted that 50% of phone calls in the very near future will
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:22.640]   be?
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.960]   Look, the problem with that is you can hang a blockbuster fine on this company, but all
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.600]   of these companies are shells.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:30.480]   The limited liabilities and they move from one to the next.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.440]   So this company will go under.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.800]   The principles will still be operating 10 other companies.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.760]   We figured out how to do it.
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:42.000]   First Orion, which provides a call blocking services, published a study that found telemarketing
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.600]   spam has increased from 2017.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:54.200]   In 2017, two years ago, 3.7% of calls this year, 29%.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:58.160]   And they're the ones who said, we think it'll be more than half.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:02.360]   Next year, it'll be 45%, more than half within a couple of years.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.360]   That's just the one I get rid of.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.360]   The phone online.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.200]   My landline with 100% junk calls.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.400]   I just finally said it enough.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.000]   My parents kept happening in the far field.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.720]   They're a landline from our family home.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.360]   And I don't know why because no one calls that except for telemarketers.
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:18.360]   Yes.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.360]   Nobody.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.160]   There is the idea that a landline might work better in an emergency.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.760]   Which is not true anymore.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.200]   Which is not true because where they live, all of the landlines, even though it looks
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.200]   like a landline, it's void.
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.200]   They're all void.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:32.440]   It's all void the power is gone.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:39.400]   The FCC does have a Trusen-Collar ID Act they can use for this, which finds up to $10,000
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:40.640]   for each violation.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:43.720]   That's where the $37 million fine came from.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.640]   If you can find the person who did it.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   Good luck.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.520]   Well, as soon as this is effective, what they're going to do is they're going to turn over
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:49.520]   oversight to the SEC.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.080]   That's where it should not get nice and go there.
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.920]   I mean, that kind of thing.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:54.920]   It's hopeless.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920]   It's terrible.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920]   I don't know what you do.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:00.400]   There is a brisk business in companies that block this kind of stuff, right?
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.400]   Right.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.400]   Anyone who needs to send me something important knows that they should text me.
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:05.120]   I think that's what the upshot of this is.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.480]   And frankly, if I were the phone companies, I'd get a little anxious because it really
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.960]   means nobody's going to answer calling.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.520]   Well, here's what you do.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.160]   You get all your calls on your cell phone.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:17.280]   You let your visual voicemail kick in.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.040]   And that's when if it can't transcribe, usually I just delete it.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.040]   So use this transcription.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.080]   Basically, if you don't leave me a message, I mean, this the only way you can reach me
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.840]   by phone is leave me a message.
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:33.560]   Or if you get calls a lot from TV stations will call me to, you know, my story.
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.920]   It's very hard for people who need to answer the phone.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.920]   Right.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.800]   And I don't, they're often just the individual calling from their cell phone.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.000]   So, I mean, I know what CBS has exchanged is, but I don't know what a particular reporter's
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.160]   cell phone number is going to look like.
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.400]   So I do answer because there is actually the possibility it might be somebody I want
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.400]   to talk to.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.720]   You mean my doctor, Kaiser Permanente, all of the call numbers are blocked.
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.720]   I understand why.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.720]   Right.
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:56.720]   Right.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.720]   But I don't answer blocked calls.
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:58.720]   That's a good example.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:40:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.320]   So I don't hear from my doctor.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.320]   Right.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:05.120]   Maybe my watch told my doctor I'm dying.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.800]   The doctor is calling and I'm not answering.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.280]   Maybe I did do that feature on though.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.360]   Oh, so Larry, you do answer your phone.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.280]   How many of those calls end up being spam?
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.920]   Maybe 20%.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.200]   That's actually what I'm thinking.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.480]   What I'm thinking of doing is I have Google Voice and I can have Google Voice screen my
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.480]   calls.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.560]   And if it gets to be worse, I'll do that.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:28.680]   So they'll have to go through a kind of a pre screen before they reach me.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:30.680]   They have to say their name.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:33.680]   They have to say their name, which I think will get rid of most of them at that point.
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:35.160]   There's got to be a solution.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160]   It's crazy.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.160]   But my landline it was 100%.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160]   I mean, literally 100.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:43.040]   It was like almost never with their legitimate call coming in the landline.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.920]   And that was a number that we had for 20 years.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:49.000]   At this point, the only time I've ever answered phone calls is if I'm using my phone when
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.240]   someone calls because this thing is always on silent.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:52.240]   Right.
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:53.240]   I'm always listening to you.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.240]   I tell you, I wanted to get you a $20 million.
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.960]   I have an African prince on the line.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.920]   You didn't pick up the phone if I called the rabbi.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.920]   You didn't pick up the phone.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920]   It's dead.
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.320]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.800]   Snapchat is offering to register voters through their app.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.160]   Oh, I feel so mixed about this.
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:14.200]   Well, it's over anyway because the deadline passed, right?
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:15.200]   This was earlier this week.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.200]   It was voter registration.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.040]   The last day you could register to vote.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.040]   So if you have the glasses, can you vote twice?
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.040]   Is that how that?
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.320]   Yeah, I know you put a digital disguise on them.
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.320]   They'll never know it's you.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.520]   It's problematic, but on the other hand, like...
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   That's how you reach people.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.520]   That's how you reach people.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:29.520]   Under 25.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.520]   And Instagram too.
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.520]   But really on Snapchat?
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.520]   Is that how you reach them?
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:35.520]   Yes.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.520]   And Instagram.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:41.160]   They launched a filter to promote National Voter Registration Day.
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:47.080]   I don't yet have numbers, but the problem is less than 20% of 18 to 25 year olds voted
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.080]   in the last midterms.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.080]   That's the problem.
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.320]   We need to get that number up.
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:53.320]   We need to make it cool.
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.320]   We need to make it hip.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.880]   Bernie would be pregnant if they all voted.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:02.120]   This time maybe we don't want to make it that cool.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:08.840]   I mean, look, when most of our political discourse looks horrible, it looks like the worst case
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.120]   of humanity, of course that demographic is not going to want to have any...
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:13.320]   Yeah, they don't want to go near us.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.320]   Oh, but they never have.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.520]   I mean, I don't think that demographic has ever been a particularly big finish block.
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:20.720]   That's actually the thing that makes me sad is it gives people a reason to just give up.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:22.720]   Like I don't want to get involved with politics.
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.720]   That really discourages me.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.800]   When I hear people who I respect, say it doesn't matter who I vote for anyway, it's like,
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.440]   that's the one little bit of power you have, man.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:35.600]   The most powerful political trying to enlist young people, a campaign I've heard recently,
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.680]   was sort of like, look, voters over the age of, I don't remember what it was, 50 cast,
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.680]   a huge percentage of the vote.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:42.680]   Yes.
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:43.680]   You don't want those whole farts to choose.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.920]   It was like, do you let your grandparents choose what you wear or what you eat?
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.920]   Why don't you listen to them?
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:49.920]   I think she's a great parent.
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.520]   She's a great parent to run in the Senate, obviously.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.520]   85, your great-grandparents.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.840]   I mean, both Feinstein and Grassley are like 85 years old.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.120]   And she's running for another six-year term?
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:06.080]   Feinstein looks like Galadriel, what she would look like if she had accepted the ring.
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.800]   I'm just saying.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.640]   It's a Hobbit reference, kids.
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.640]   Ow.
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.080]   I'm sorry, Lord of the Rings Hobbit, that's all the same, isn't it?
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:16.720]   Yeah, it's the same.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:17.720]   It's the same.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   It's the same.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.560]   It's Middle Earth reference.
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.960]   Steve Ballmer, remember him?
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:23.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:24.960]   Yeah, he's a basketball owner.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.600]   You know, but he has something else he's doing.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:33.720]   He has a nonprofit called USA Facts, and they've launched a new voter center for the
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.240]   midterms.
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:41.000]   So I presume it's nonpartisan, but unfortunately, it only works on Windows phones.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.240]   It does look very windowsy.
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.240]   It does.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.240]   It does.
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.240]   It does.
[01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:47.240]   Look at it.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.240]   It looks like tiles.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.240]   Look at that.
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:50.720]   Let me enter my zip code and see who my candidates are.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:55.200]   And then you could see, so these are the people running, and you could see how they stand on
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.800]   the issues from their public statements.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.800]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:01.240]   It's not a great UI, though.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.040]   It's a terrible UI.
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.040]   But maybe the kids-
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.040]   Only the guy had some sort of background in this.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.040]   Windows mobile coming back.
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:10.840]   You know, it's kind of funny because this is exactly what 18 to 25 years.
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:15.280]   You do not want to see.
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.880]   It actually does look like Windows can almost be on Windows.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.880]   They don't know.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:19.880]   It does.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.880]   I mean, yeah.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.600]   Is there like the politician store somewhere there?
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:26.600]   Download your favorite take action.
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.440]   You donate money to them or you take action.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.440]   Can you do what can actually?
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.240]   First of all, you have to scroll down and take action.
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:32.240]   Okay.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.240]   Scroll down, take action.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.240]   Okay.
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.240]   Let me start by.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.240]   I applaud the fact that he's put some resources into this.
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.240]   That's great.
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:39.360]   But that is a horrible interface.
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:42.040]   I'm a voter with countable and turbo vote.
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.520]   This doesn't sound right either.
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.120]   This looks like a scam site.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:47.120]   Countable.
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.120]   It's like, I don't want to give my information to you.
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.120]   It started.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.240]   The name, so you just enter your name.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.000]   By the way, it's an iframe.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.600]   Oh, I could.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:57.600]   What?
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.600]   Register you to vote, automatic.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.760]   You can't register online, can you with this?
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.600]   Well, I mean, it's awesome that he got a bunch of high schoolers to put together his
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.600]   website.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.600]   Oh, look.
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.600]   Some guy named Steve registered to vote.
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:07.600]   It would be a better website.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:08.600]   You could be a better website.
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:09.600]   Here's his video.
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.280]   Hi, I'm Steve Ballmer, founder of USA Facts.
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.280]   As voters, it is--
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.280]   Voters.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.280]   Voters.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.280]   Voters.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.280]   Voters.
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.280]   That's why we're both.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.280]   That's why we're both together with our partners.
[01:46:21.280 --> 01:46:22.280]   It's countable.
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.920]   It reminds me of all those conferences I went to where he would yell at people.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.920]   You can see.
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:26.920]   He even wants you to vote.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:27.920]   He even wants you to tell you.
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.920]   Well, I see him talking into the pause symbol.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.920]   I got to do it.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:31.920]   I got to do it.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.920]   I can't.
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:33.920]   Come on, Steve.
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:34.920]   I'm excited.
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:35.920]   See what you think.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.920]   It's an horrible.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:37.920]   You can't get rid of it.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:39.920]   You can't get rid of it.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920]   Vote.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.920]   Vote three times.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.920]   Vote.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.920]   Vote.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.920]   Vote.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920]   All right.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.920]   So no, I--
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:47.920]   You say both three times?
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:48.920]   I did.
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.920]   I did.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:50.920]   I did.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:51.920]   I did.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920]   I did it to commend him.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]   No, good for him.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920]   Good job.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.920]   Good job.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:56.920]   Well, thank you.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:57.920]   Thank you.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:58.920]   But work on it.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:46:59.920]   Get someone to work on it.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.920]   He's just going to yell at you until you do it.
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:01.920]   I do.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.920]   That's what it is.
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:03.920]   Just call him at us.
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:04.920]   He's going to break my iPhone.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:06.920]   Eric Schmitz--
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.160]   Eric Schmitz says there's going to be two
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:11.520]   internets by the next 10 to 15 years as the Chinese
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:12.800]   winner net and the other one.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:13.800]   We've actually been predicting this on
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.800]   "Twiet" for years.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:16.280]   The fragmentation of the internet.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.920]   It's not theoretical.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.920]   It's real.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:19.920]   It's actually happening.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:22.960]   You're seeing it every time a country says, you know what?
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:24.840]   We don't want our citizens to be able to access that
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:28.440]   information and not necessarily because we think, oh, we
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:31.120]   don't want them to know the real world.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.120]   This does not fit with our culture.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.160]   And the more you start to see that, the more it makes sense
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.840]   that China's going to say, look, we've got enough internet
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.840]   companies.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:39.840]   We don't need yours.
[01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:40.840]   We've got our internet.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.840]   We've got our internet.
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:42.840]   We've got our own--
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.840]   Carson White.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.840]   --better on Amazon.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.840]   Carson White.
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:46.840]   Why did you put this story in here from the
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.400]   Columbia Journalism Review?
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.920]   Is the podcast bubble bursting?
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.920]   Eric, I forget it.
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:51.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:56.480]   Carson, why isn't it right next to your resume?
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.640]   What's going on, man?
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.440]   Panoply, the broadcasting unit set up by Slate recently
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.960]   laid off what?
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.160]   Most of its staff.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:06.840]   So now it's just going to be a distributor of podcasts
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.080]   instead of a creator of them.
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:09.080]   Some big company.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.800]   On Wednesday, Buzzfeed announced it was laying off staff
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:12.800]   at its podcasting.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.800]   Geez, Louise.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.440]   And you've got companies that are just becoming
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.800]   aggregators and they're going to make an
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.800]   original podcast, man.
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:20.120]   Laid off some staff from its podcasting unit.
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.680]   Well, the thing is that not this podcast, but some
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:24.160]   podcasts are very easy to make.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:27.160]   So I think that the podcasting universe has a glut of just
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.760]   people who like to sit around and hear themselves talk,
[01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.680]   which if it's not--
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:31.240]   As you know--
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.080]   This show.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:32.600]   No.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.520]   But if it doesn't have wonderful producers like Carson, and if
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:39.960]   it's not structured and reliable and it doesn't have a
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.960]   narrative quality, nobody's going to listen to it.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:46.240]   Yeah, there's different levels of podcasts.
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:49.320]   There is the person who is just talking to a mic and maybe
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.400]   you like the sound of his or her voice.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.880]   And then there's actually podcasts that will try to show
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.440]   you how to do something or want to inform you.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.000]   And they'll get lumped into the same basket.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.440]   And that seems really unfair.
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.400]   Sure.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.680]   But I remember when I've been actually podcasting since,
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:05.480]   believe it or not, the late '90s before the term existed.
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.480]   And for the longest time, we got no respect with it.
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.160]   We're on your danger field of media, right?
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.560]   Everybody wanted a video.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:14.200]   And then serial came along and suddenly podcasting.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:16.760]   And Leo, you actually made a pretty big contribution to it
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:17.560]   as well.
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:19.400]   Podcasting suddenly became cool.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:21.600]   And all these television and radio networks
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:22.880]   are wanting to jump in.
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.440]   But I think it's cyclical.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.960]   And I think it's been overhyped over the last several
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.320]   couple of years.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.000]   And maybe it's a flight to quality.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.840]   Maybe at the end of the day, we will have fewer podcasts,
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:33.920]   but better podcasts.
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:34.360]   You know what?
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.800]   That's what this article-- and by the way,
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:39.040]   the article's by Matthew Ingram, who's a regular on our podcast.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:42.160]   But that's what this article says.
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.080]   It's exactly right.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:44.240]   And I think that's true.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:45.160]   And that's always been true.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.920]   In fact, frankly, I welcome this because the glut isn't
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:50.000]   helping us at all.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:50.480]   Right.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:52.960]   There was also some very unrealistic expectations
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.040]   that were set up by companies that were giving
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.040]   these incredible numbers of-- this
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:58.360]   is how many people download.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.360]   That A, most of them were crazy inflated.
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:05.440]   And B, wasn't really a marker of how effective it was
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:06.400]   in actually getting your messaging.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:08.400]   Absolutely not, because those download, as we know,
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.360]   does not rule a listen.
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.000]   Precisely.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.960]   And there's just no way to show that.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.920]   It's sort of like blogs.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:16.680]   I mean, remember when blogs with the huge big buzzword
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.800]   everybody was blogging?
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:19.800]   Remember John Markoff somebody said, do you have a blog?
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:20.560]   He said, yeah, I have a blog.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.040]   It's called NewYorkTimes.com.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:23.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.560]   And at some blogs did very well.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.040]   They actually rose to popularity,
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.560]   often because they deserve to be.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:33.120]   And now everybody and their brother has one,
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.120]   but most get essentially no traffic.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:37.160]   Dead blogs.
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:38.640]   There's so many of those.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.200]   That's why I replaced my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.400]   feed with a blog.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.280]   I went back to GeoCities.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.160]   My blog is actually--
[01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:52.480]   god, it was, I think, 1995 I registered larrythworld.com.
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:52.960]   Oh my god.
[01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:54.160]   Still not super popular.
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:57.520]   So my blog is where I put all my travel pictures,
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:00.280]   because I didn't have anywhere else to put them.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.560]   So I don't know.
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.920]   Nobody's reading them, but at least they're somewhere.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.040]   You can read them later.
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.560]   I can read them.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:08.560]   It's beautiful.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:10.200]   It looks very New York Timesy.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:11.000]   I read my own blog.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.720]   But that's why I had Google Photos.
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:14.960]   Google Photos just gives me all my travels.
[01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:15.560]   WordPress.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:16.160]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:17.760]   Which theme is it?
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.360]   2017.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:20.840]   Oh yeah, I use that on one of my blogs.
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:22.360]   Smarter and no dot dot.
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.320]   It has a nice big--
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:24.880]   I wanted a big hero image, right?
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:25.240]   So--
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:25.760]   Definitely.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.160]   Yeah, and every time you refresh it,
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:27.760]   it's a different one.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.320]   It's not always the same one.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:29.800]   Because--
[01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:30.560]   That's nice.
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.360]   That would take notes on how to do that.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:35.160]   Apparently, I don't remember either.
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:36.600]   There, nope.
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:37.600]   Refresh.
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.400]   It doesn't-- now it's like, no, you're stuck on this.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:41.720]   It's stuck on me and Lisa and Athens.
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:44.120]   As professional podcasters, do you guys
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:48.080]   think that there will be some improvement to the way
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:50.440]   podcast data gets tracked that will help the industry?
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.160]   I hope not.
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:51.800]   Yes.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:52.320]   OK.
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:54.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:58.560]   Well, not necessarily metrics, but autor.ai,
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:02.600]   which is this web page, allows you to transcribe your podcast.
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:06.000]   And so you can actually have a searchable transcription of it.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:06.920]   And it's not perfect.
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.040]   Oh, this is a great app.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:08.680]   We use this app.
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.640]   I've been using it a lot.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:10.480]   And it--
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:14.440]   It takes some work to make sure you fix all the typos.
[01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.400]   But if everybody did that with their podcast,
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:17.200]   it would be searchable.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:20.760]   So at least it'd be more discoverable.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.800]   Also, I'm seeing a split.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:24.520]   There's going to be those that are like the twits
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:27.200]   and the other podcast companies that can actually survive,
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.080]   because they're putting out quality content on a regular basis.
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:32.160]   But then you've also got the increase
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.440]   in the rise of the 1,000 loyal listeners, podcasters,
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.840]   who realize, I'm going to have a small audience.
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:40.040]   It's probably not going to grow.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:40.560]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:42.240]   But I got 1,000, and that's enough for me.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.240]   There's nothing wrong with it.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.480]   Essentially, that's what we are.
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:45.840]   I mean, it's a large number than 1,000.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:49.440]   But really, the only reason Twit continues after 15 years
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:52.320]   is because we have a very loyal core audience
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:54.600]   that just is stuck with us all this time.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.200]   And they're not swayed.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.640]   They're not seduced by these other podcasts.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:59.880]   Or maybe they are, but they end up
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:02.840]   continuing to listen to Twit.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.320]   And I hope they do.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:08.000]   The issue that we face right now is
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.760]   that advertisers are starting to feel their oats.
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:15.040]   The IAB, the Interactive Advertising Board,
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.720]   which is a big digital app--
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.120]   I'm sure they're very familiar with it.
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:19.440]   You are.
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:22.040]   Unfortunately, they seem to represent advertisers
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:24.560]   a little bit better than podcasters, especially podcasters
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:26.040]   don't have much of a voice with them.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.520]   And they're really pushing for podcast metrics for--
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:29.880]   I don't want to do this to my audience,
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.280]   requiring your audience, for instance,
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:35.040]   to use an app that measures whether you listened.
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.200]   When you buy a newspaper ad, nobody says,
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:40.640]   yeah, everybody read that newspaper from cover to cover,
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.800]   and they saw your ad.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:43.160]   That's not how it works.
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.320]   But for some reason, digital advertisers
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.640]   feel like they should know.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.280]   And it's because they're given this false sense of confidence
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:51.880]   from banner ads where, well, I know who saw my banner ad.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.000]   Oh, yeah, right.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.040]   And honestly, the only thing that should, in my opinion,
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.280]   affect advertisers is whether your ads work,
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:01.000]   whether you get results.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.040]   And if you made more money than you spent on the advertising,
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.480]   then that was a success, right?
[01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:08.760]   Is that the reason why you and a lot of people
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.400]   give out a special code or a special URL?
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.920]   Yeah, in media in general, that's always
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.520]   kind of how media evolves.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.640]   When you first, for instance, when Tech TV first started,
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:22.560]   it was, they call that direct response advertising.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.000]   We don't make, we don't, we've never done
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000]   what's called cost, CPA, cost per acquisition ads,
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.680]   where you get 50 bucks for everybody who signs up.
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.440]   We've never, we've always refused to do that
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.760]   because I consider that devaluing.
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.320]   So we do traditional impression based
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:41.680]   cost per thousand impressions advertising.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:46.480]   But, I'm sorry, what was your question?
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:48.800]   Well, giving out code like you look.
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.640]   Oh, the code's thing.
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:51.320]   So the code doesn't count.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:53.000]   I'm sorry, I completely gave space.
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.600]   The code doesn't, like if you use the code,
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:56.960]   we don't make more money.
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:00.560]   But advertisers use that to figure out,
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.560]   are my ads working?
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:03.720]   And it's kind of a problem for us because,
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:05.800]   you know, advertisers will use a variety of codes,
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.360]   but almost all our users just use Twitch.
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.680]   So, advertisers, everyone's on an advertiser say,
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.760]   well, I didn't get any response from that show,
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:15.960]   only got response from Twitch.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.320]   You weren't on that show.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:20.280]   Or, you know, things like that happen all the time.
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.640]   So I'm not a big fan of advertisers,
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:23.560]   and I know they want this,
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:25.520]   but I'm not a big fan of them getting real granular
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.360]   about the metrics.
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:30.360]   And I really don't like the idea of them demanding,
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.000]   and Apple started to do this, by the way.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.080]   Apple, if you listen in Apple's apps,
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.520]   they're counting you.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:36.880]   And I don't like that.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.480]   I don't want to see that be requirement.
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.800]   And I would hate for advertisers to say,
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:43.720]   yeah, we're only gonna account iPod iTunes listeners.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.440]   We're not gonna count anybody else.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:48.400]   That wouldn't be good for us for obvious reasons.
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.720]   Less than half of our audience uses an Apple product
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:51.840]   to listen to us.
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.920]   So, this demand from advertisers, I think,
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.720]   is I understand why, but I think it's misguided.
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:58.880]   It's gonna hurt advertisers.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:01.600]   And really the only thing that I tell advertisers is,
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:02.960]   does this ad work for you?
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.800]   Did you get results?
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.520]   And we produce phenomenal results for all of our advertisers.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:10.480]   And, you know, that should be good enough for them.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:11.880]   Right, if you ask me.
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.200]   So I hate to see this push towards metrics.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.240]   'Cause I mean, we give you metrics.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.600]   We know how many people downloaded this.
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:18.440]   Sure.
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:22.360]   That's better probably than how many people bought a newspaper.
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:23.440]   But that's not a sexy saying,
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.120]   "Oh, I got 100 million views on this YouTube video."
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.960]   I get that, so when I have an issue.
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.960]   That's right, YouTube kills this.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:29.800]   I want a nonprofit.
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:31.840]   And when I'm doing fundraising, once in a while,
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:33.240]   I'll get a potential sponsor,
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:35.720]   a potential funder that will start asking for metrics,
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:38.360]   how many hits do their website get, and this kind of stuff.
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.280]   And we can produce that if they want to.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:41.520]   We have to go in and look for it.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:44.880]   But it never occurred to me that you value a nonprofit
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:47.200]   based on how many hits their website gets.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.200]   You know, it's worse than that.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.600]   I hope this is changing.
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:52.400]   Used to be, until recently in Hollywood,
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.200]   the amount of money you'd get to make a movie
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.280]   would depend on your Twitter following.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.600]   So if you're Casey Affleck, and you have 500,000 people
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.400]   on Twitter, and you're Ben Affleck, and you've got 5 million,
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.720]   he's gonna get 10 times more.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.840]   And then you had to be Batman, and that's not gonna--
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.600]   (laughing)
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.360]   Not to send kills people, so whatever.
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:13.600]   That half of those followers are Russian bots.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:14.600]   They're not real people.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:15.440]   They're just bots.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.280]   So this is the problem with this obsession,
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.120]   and I understand it because you wanna get efficiency.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:23.240]   But this obsession with metrics,
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:25.840]   it's, you know, you probably, when you were a teacher,
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:28.680]   you would tell kids, when you use a slide rule
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.480]   to do mathematics, you know that you don't have,
[01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:32.120]   you only have a certain amount of accuracy, right?
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:33.880]   You can't say, you know, three--
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.120]   I saw one of those ones.
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:36.280]   Yeah, I have one in my office.
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:37.120]   You wanna talk to it.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:37.960]   I'm gonna do it.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:42.360]   I can't say one divided by three is, you know,
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.360]   .33333333.
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.160]   A calculator will say that, but you can't be that accurate
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.320]   in the real world.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:52.600]   Unfortunately, everything now is calculators.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:53.600]   It's all computers.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:56.920]   It's all high metrics digital, and it gives people
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:00.080]   this false sense of information, and they want this information.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:00.920]   But--
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.600]   And I'm afraid they're getting the information,
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.440]   but it's not useful.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.200]   Isn't that one of the promises that we're making though?
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:07.200]   We're saying, look, the reason why you should go with us
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:09.560]   over traditional advertising is because with them,
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:10.400]   it's shotgun.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:11.880]   You're paying for time.
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:14.360]   With us, you're actually paying for engagement.
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:15.360]   So that's what I think.
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:18.240]   But then we, you know, they wanna see
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:19.360]   if there's actually engagement.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:22.000]   That's fine, and that's why, so to get back to this history
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.280]   of direct marketing ads, when you're in new medium,
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:25.920]   for instance, when tech TV started,
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:27.480]   almost all of your ads are direct.
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:30.080]   There are 800 numbers, or they're using offer code there,
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:30.920]   'cause they want metrics.
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.520]   Not necessarily 'cause it's cost per acquisition,
[01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:34.080]   but just they want metrics.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:37.560]   As a medium matures and becomes network television,
[01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.120]   you start to see very few of those.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.520]   You don't see direct response ads on network television.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:44.280]   Because advertisers at some point say,
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:46.760]   well, hey, I'm gonna buy the NFL.
[01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:48.360]   It's gonna work, right?
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:49.640]   Super Bowl's gonna work.
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:52.040]   - Well, it's often about advertising agencies
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:53.560]   and pressing their clients.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.520]   So they wanna be in front of the biggest events.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:56.880]   - Well, that's a funny thing.
[01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.200]   Remember the DraftKings ads,
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:58:59.640]   where they'd have a different offer code
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:00.760]   every time they ran that out?
[01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:01.600]   That's if--
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:03.280]   - What always cracked me up is when you're watching
[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:05.240]   like a Super Bowl and they'll be an ad for,
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:07.400]   in the year they go, an IBM mainframe.
[01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.360]   How many people watching the Super Bowl
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.360]   are actually gonna go out and buy a mainframe?
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:11.800]   - Totally, but prestige.
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:13.200]   - And no, it's all, it had nothing to do with selling.
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:16.200]   - We had an advertiser, I don't wanna name any names
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:18.600]   that spent a lot of money with us for many years,
[01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:20.280]   and then said, no, no, we're gonna spend that money
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:21.440]   on the Super Bowl.
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:24.400]   And it's, I mean, literally over a million dollars on one ad.
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:29.400]   And all I could say was jaw dropping,
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:32.120]   and that was it, that was that advertiser left.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.880]   - It wasn't GoDaddy by the chance.
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:36.360]   - No, but my favorite was pets.com.
[01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.000]   That basically bankrupted them.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:38.840]   - That was it.
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:42.440]   - I know the amount of money it's cost is incredible.
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:45.520]   - Yeah, so everybody knows in business,
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:48.360]   you gotta advertise, the challenge is how do you know
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:50.000]   that my money is working?
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:50.840]   - What's your ROI?
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.480]   - Yeah, and it would be bad for podcasting.
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.960]   I think ultimately if it got very metrics focused,
[01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:57.440]   because that's not what podcasting's doing.
[01:59:57.440 --> 01:59:58.480]   - Well, you know, I remember the day
[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:01.440]   when I used to write a print column for the LA Times,
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.400]   when nobody, including me and my editor,
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:06.440]   they had any clue as to how many people were reading my column.
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.600]   I mean, they ran that thing for 20 years
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:10.920]   and never knew what my readership was,
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.680]   'cause they had no way of measuring it.
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:14.440]   And I don't know whether they cared even.
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:16.600]   You know, I was actually kind of happy about that.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:20.040]   - Devorak used to tell stories about Ziff Davis
[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.320]   that they would do all sorts of tests and metrics.
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:23.760]   - Yeah, but they would.
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.080]   - You know, and I think that you can get over excited
[02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:28.320]   by that kind of thing.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.280]   - By the way, and a sad note, John is,
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.920]   after many years at PC Magazine is no longer writing his--
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:34.760]   - Really?
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.320]   - Yeah, well, it's a big change.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.160]   - Yeah.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:38.000]   - That's a big deal.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.120]   - He says it's 'cause he's a Trump fan
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:40.720]   and the lady who hired him isn't.
[02:00:40.720 --> 02:00:42.360]   - I don't feel that's accurate.
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.160]   - I think that's just the industry's changing.
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.440]   I mean, there's been a lot for my writers, for instance.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:49.360]   - Well, there was a time when he was a household word,
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.920]   among tech people.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:51.760]   - Yeah.
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.400]   - Are you?
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.480]   It's kind of sad.
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:59.160]   - I don't thought you young and it's a C-net.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:03.320]   - Isn't it sad when you get over the hill?
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:04.520]   It's just, I mean, I'm not talking about John,
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:05.440]   I'm talking about me.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.280]   - Yeah, really good.
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:07.120]   - You're crying about yourself.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:10.480]   - After a while, you don't, you no longer have the name,
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:12.080]   you no one, people no longer recognize you.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:13.760]   You know, it's all Marcus Brownlee.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:14.600]   - But this is--
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:15.440]   - Get off my lawn.
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.360]   - Yeah, you kids.
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:18.480]   - This is the way it is, and that's fine, that's life.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.320]   You know?
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:20.560]   - I have my retirement planned up.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:21.760]   What's your retirement gonna be?
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:24.160]   - I'm gonna sit in a cell until I die.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:25.120]   They already know that.
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.200]   I mean, that's literally what happens.
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:28.960]   It's not sell, it's literally what happens.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.520]   - That's a good deal.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:32.640]   - Because you've got to guarantee that after you die,
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:33.720]   you know, you're gonna have some fun.
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.880]   So you gotta, you gotta, you gotta good deal, really.
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:40.440]   - And then I'm gonna have my remains turned into glass,
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:41.320]   'cause they do that now.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:43.240]   I gotta keep the art glass from that.
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.560]   They will take some of your cremains,
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.800]   they mix it with silica, and they will make a glass bust
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.560]   of you so that you can sit on the mantle
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:50.880]   of your loved ones for eternity.
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:51.720]   I'm like, that sounds--
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.720]   - That's creepy.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:53.840]   - Ridiculously creepy.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.160]   - It's better than turning you into a bullet.
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.000]   - I'm like, I'm turning you into a shot.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.720]   - I wanna be turned into bullets.
[02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:01.480]   - I wanna say what I thought.
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:03.160]   - Our show today brought to you by Molecule.
[02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:06.480]   You notice, by the way, how delicious, fresh,
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.000]   and clean the air smells in here.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000]   Even though Alex Gumpel's eating hot dogs
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.560]   just around the corner,
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:14.240]   that's 'cause of our Molecule air freshener.
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.160]   It just, it takes all of the pollutants.
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.440]   And it, by the way, most air pure frieze,
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:23.520]   like the HEPA filters, all they do is they collect
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:26.840]   the pollutants in the filter.
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.200]   In fact, a lot of times, they don't collect all of them.
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.200]   They can only collect, you know, larger molecules.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.320]   The smaller things like bacteria, mold,
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:37.120]   volatile organic, how much VOCs from pain,
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:38.240]   you know, formaldehyde from carbon.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:40.440]   They just goes right through those HEPA filters.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.520]   The molecule doesn't trap 'em.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.000]   - It destroys them.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.240]   I love-- - Oh my God.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:48.280]   - I love, it's the apple of air purifiers.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:51.840]   It uses something called photoelectrochemical oxidation,
[02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:56.840]   Pico, to, it has this kind of catalytic converter,
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:00.880]   kind of, for these molecules.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:04.000]   It has a metal, you have to go to the website
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.160]   and look at that, it has a metal plate in there
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:07.520]   that attracts the molecules.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:10.560]   And then it has a UV light in there that burns them up,
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:13.360]   destroys them, they're gone.
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:16.680]   It makes it, it gets pollutants 1,000 times smaller
[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.480]   than those HEPA filters can catch.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.600]   And it makes it easier to cope with asthma and allergies.
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:24.200]   I know Lisa used to wake up with a headache every morning.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.880]   That's why we got the molecule in the bedroom.
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:28.640]   And now, and I know it works because as soon as we leave,
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:30.760]   you know, going vacations to get in the headache again
[02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:33.920]   from allergies, the molecule captures them.
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:35.760]   Lisa hasn't had a headache since we got the molecule.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.440]   We liked it so much, we got one for our son,
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:38.920]   we got one for the studio.
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:42.360]   Molecules technology was funded by the EPA.
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.520]   It's been tested not only by people like me,
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:47.240]   but verified by third parties.
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:49.280]   University Labs like the University of South Florida
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:51.760]   Center for Biological Defense, the University of Minnesota's
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:54.840]   Particle Calibration Laboratory.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.240]   It looks beautiful.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.000]   It's so cool because it automatically will send off
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000]   for new filters and that new, whatever that metal thing is.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.960]   It'll send off for those automatically,
[02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:08.360]   it's got a filter subscription service.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.320]   So the filters arrive when you need them.
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.120]   You can connect the molecule to your Wi-Fi
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.720]   or your Bluetooth controller from your phone,
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:16.720]   you don't need to, it has a button on the top of it.
[02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:18.760]   But if you want to, I love it.
[02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.560]   We love our molecule.
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:24.800]   That's why we bought two more.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:27.400]   They sell out fast, so right now go to molecule,
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:31.200]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E.com, moleculewithak.com.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:32.960]   They reinvented the air purifier.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.760]   You'll get 75 bucks off your first order
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:38.120]   if you use our promo code, Twitch 75.
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.000]   Twitch 75 will get you 75 bucks off.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.080]   Easy to remember, right?
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:46.080]   M-O-L-E-K-U-L-E. Molecule.com.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.960]   I like to think that it destroys those pollutants
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.400]   with lasers.
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:53.120]   It's kind of like that.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:54.920]   I have, so it has a light.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:58.240]   And at night we turn it off 'cause we don't want to see it.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:00.920]   And it comes on at six in the morning when the sun comes up.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:03.680]   And you can, you almost, I feel like it's like a bug zapper.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:05.440]   I know I'm not hearing it.
[02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:07.760]   - If it have a Pac-Man game that's associated with it.
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:08.600]   - It should.
[02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:09.680]   I feel like it's easy.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:10.920]   Like the light comes on,
[02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:12.440]   and I just can't, can't you see this?
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:13.920]   (groaning)
[02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:14.760]   The molecule.
[02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:16.120]   - You smell ozone?
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:17.160]   You smell a low zone.
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:18.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:18.840]   - That's what it is.
[02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:20.160]   - You smell a little something coming off of it.
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:22.680]   It's all that stuff being burned up.
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:23.520]   It's amazing.
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:26.760]   - Can you control it by Alexa and by Google Home?
[02:05:26.760 --> 02:05:27.600]   - No.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:28.440]   (laughing)
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:29.280]   It's either on.
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:30.480]   I mean, there's on, there's silent.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.680]   We run it in silent in the studio.
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:33.920]   There's auto and there's boost,
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.520]   which if like you've got a big room
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.480]   or you have, you know, some of these just smoked a cigar,
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:38.840]   you can turn the boost on.
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:40.400]   And then, whoof, it really cleans it out.
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:41.240]   It's amazing.
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:42.640]   So you're gonna have to explain this to me
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:43.720]   'cause I don't understand at all.
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:44.560]   I read this today.
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:47.720]   Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:49.160]   He's a particle physicist.
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.240]   He was working at CERN.
[02:05:51.240 --> 02:05:54.280]   He currently is director of the World Wide Web Consortium
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:58.640]   is taking a leave of absence to create something.
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:02.040]   - Something.
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:02.880]   - Something.
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.920]   I don't get it.
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:08.620]   It's, so there's this open source project called Solid.
[02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:12.560]   He says to restore the power and agencies
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:13.840]   of individuals on the web.
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:18.320]   I mean, basically his opening salvo is right on.
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:20.040]   I've always believed the web is for everyone.
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:23.480]   That's why I and others fight fiercely to protect it.
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:25.120]   The changes we've managed to bring
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:26.880]   have created a better and more connected world.
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:29.240]   But for all the good we've achieved,
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:32.280]   the web has evolved into an engine of inequity
[02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:35.240]   and division swayed by powerful forces
[02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:36.800]   who use it for their own agendas.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.640]   Boy, in a nutshell, that's what we've been talking about all day.
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:41.760]   - This is the decentralization of data that's being used.
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:42.600]   - That's what he wants to do.
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:44.800]   - So Solid's an open source project
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:48.400]   and he's creating a company that uses Solid
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:54.440]   but to do called in Ropt, I-N-R-U-P-T.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:59.520]   - I don't know, but I wonder if this is the long-talked-about idea
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:02.560]   that you are actually the owner of your data
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:04.680]   and stuff that you personally profit from it.
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:06.920]   So you can sell your data where you want to.
[02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:09.040]   - So the current model is you give your data
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:10.720]   to a company like Facebook, like Google.
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:11.560]   - And they're a broker.
[02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:12.400]   - And they're a broker, right.
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:17.400]   This is turning you back into a client
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:20.040]   because Google and Facebook want your data
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:22.040]   but you get to choose who it gets shared with
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.520]   and what it gets used for.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.400]   The only way that you can keep that agency
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:28.400]   is if you have some sort of control over where it's stored.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.920]   - And it's effectively a currency for you.
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:31.800]   You choose to spend your currency for a product.
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.760]   - Precisely, precisely.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:34.600]   - But how do you-
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:35.440]   - I mean-
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:38.280]   - Once you transfer that data to another agency,
[02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:40.440]   do they then own a copy of it
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:45.160]   or will your server somehow pull it back in
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:48.400]   if you decide to cut off your relationship with that company?
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.960]   - Well, I mean, see, that's the point of owning it.
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:52.560]   Since you actually own the storage,
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:55.840]   you are the proprietor of all your data.
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:58.160]   It can only be accessed by those agencies
[02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:00.560]   that you give permission to access that data.
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:02.240]   So if someone stops doing business with you,
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:04.720]   they no longer get access to your data.
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:07.040]   - But is that enforced by technology or by contract,
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:07.880]   by agreement?
[02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:08.760]   - Both.
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:13.320]   - So the idea is you, it's kind of the de-cloudifying
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:15.160]   what we know of as web services.
[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:16.640]   - So had you heard about Solid before?
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.800]   - I've heard a little bit about it,
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:19.080]   but it was always just pie in the sky.
[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:20.440]   It's like, yeah, that would be a great idea,
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:23.520]   but are you really gonna ask millions of people
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:24.360]   to set up their own web services?
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:27.080]   - I created and interrupt what they call a pod,
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:31.280]   a solid pod, which is my data store, I guess.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:32.600]   And it has a website.
[02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:36.680]   It has a profile, which I'll obviously have to add to
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:38.400]   an inbox, a public folder.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:40.000]   And then they say, get the apps.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.480]   The problem is, are there apps?
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:43.320]   - Not really.
[02:08:43.320 --> 02:08:45.320]   - And so that's what needs to happen now.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:48.880]   In fact, frankly, this is why I wonder
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:50.880]   how possibly this could succeed.
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:52.960]   You've gotta replace everything we use.
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:54.480]   - The apps are coming, it says.
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:56.880]   You gotta replace everything we use on our phones
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:59.920]   right now, for instance, with apps based on Solid.
[02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:01.040]   Is that gonna happen? - Not only that,
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:03.720]   you would need the big players.
[02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:07.280]   - So Facebook, Google, Apple, you would have to get them
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:09.000]   to buy into this, because if they're already
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.880]   getting the information for free,
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:12.640]   why would they suddenly change their model
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:14.160]   so that they have to contract with you?
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:17.120]   - So the way that I see this working, if it works,
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:20.120]   is that there has to be some upcoming, big product
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:24.600]   that does not exist yet, that this partners with first.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:25.600]   - Right. - And that's really
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:26.760]   the only proof of concept.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:28.320]   - And this is what Corey Doctor has said,
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.200]   is that if you wanna beat Facebook,
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.040]   you gotta provide an alternative.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:33.040]   - Precisely.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.240]   - So, you know, maybe that's what this is the beginning of,
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:39.560]   the first steps, it certainly has a big name
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:42.240]   behind it, Tim Bernice Lee. - Right.
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:44.560]   - The other thing is if it provides data portability,
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:47.200]   so that if you can decide, I mean, the problem is,
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:49.080]   if you wanna beat Facebook, the other thing you have to do
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:51.240]   is you have to have a critical mass of users,
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:52.600]   and you have to gather their data.
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:54.840]   So if you could somehow get people to switch,
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:56.920]   kind of like number portability with cell phones,
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.160]   which enabled people to shop around different services,
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:02.600]   so you could actually switch from one social network
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:05.720]   to another, and have your data instantly come with you,
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:07.640]   which Facebook says it wants.
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:10.320]   I'm not sure it'll ever actually work towards that,
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:12.760]   but if some third party did that,
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:14.960]   then we would have true data portability.
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.920]   - In effect, I mean, this is what Google does
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:17.800]   for most people, right?
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:19.720]   This is what Google is for most people,
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:22.200]   is this repository of all information.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:23.520]   - Yeah, but Google. - It's Google.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:25.200]   - But Google owns it.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.000]   - Right, exactly. - Google does not hesitate
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.320]   to use it to make revenue.
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:30.160]   - And Google. - And Google.
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:31.000]   - And Google. - And Google.
[02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.160]   - But without hiding that fact either.
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:33.000]   - No. - No.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:33.840]   - No, they're wide up.
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:35.440]   I mean, they're saying, look, we're gonna give you a deal.
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:37.240]   We give you these services and exchange,
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:38.520]   you let us sell your data.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:40.160]   So-- - You remember Leo paying money
[02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:42.320]   for MCI mail, you'd pay like 40 cents
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:43.360]   every time you'd send an email.
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.200]   - Yeah.
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:46.040]   - So think of what Gmail is actually worth.
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:50.000]   What would it cost to actually pay for Gmail?
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.040]   It would be many dollars a year.
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:53.080]   - Right. - Oh, sure.
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:53.920]   - At least $100 a year. - At least $100 a year.
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.720]   - I would pay a lot, yeah.
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:11:00.040]   - Well, I mentioned this only 'cause I wasn't completely clear
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.880]   about what it was, thank you for explaining it.
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.640]   And 'cause I think people should know about it
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.960]   so that they could, I don't know, set up a solid pod.
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.880]   - It's better than Tide pods.
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:14.880]   - And maybe if there's some, you know,
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:16.600]   what you need of course, and this is the really hardest.
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:18.200]   - Maybe we can get the Twitter army to do
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:19.840]   the solid pod challenge.
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:24.160]   - Only on YouTube.
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:25.000]   Only on YouTube.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.680]   So there's a log into it.
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:30.000]   - The structure is interesting.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.160]   I love the idea.
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.520]   I just don't see a buy-in at any point in the near future.
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.320]   - It has to be necessary or people won't do it at scale.
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:39.280]   There will be some people who will try it
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.320]   because it's interesting.
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.160]   That's not how-- - Well, Robert,
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:42.600]   you worked for a top-down organization.
[02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:43.640]   Why don't you just command it?
[02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.560]   (laughing)
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:49.440]   - I'm still trying to get people to wear regular clothes.
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:50.280]   So--
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:52.000]   (laughing)
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:52.840]   - As opposed to what I think.
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:54.240]   - I got that covered, I'll come back to this.
[02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:56.320]   - Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:57.720]   of this fabulous program.
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:58.560]   You guys are great.
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:00.920]   Larry Maggot, thank you so much for being here.
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:01.760]   - Pleasure.
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:04.080]   - CBS News Radio, connect safely.org.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:06.960]   - @LarryMaggot on Twitter, anything you want to plug?
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.480]   - No, just, you know, I've got my review of the iPhone SX Max.
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:11.360]   We never talked about that.
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.120]   I thought that was on the agenda.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:13.960]   - It was.
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:14.800]   - Do you like it?
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.640]   - Yeah, yeah, I do.
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:16.840]   I think the camera's really good.
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:19.160]   I mean, I actually have a pixel two
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.680]   and a lot of people say the pixel two has a better camera.
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.080]   I actually thought that the iPhone S,
[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:27.440]   I give it 10S, Max had a great camera.
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:28.280]   So I do like it.
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:29.360]   I'm still in love with Andrew.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:30.920]   - That was a name not designed for you.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:31.760]   I just got to tell you.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:32.600]   (laughing)
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:33.440]   - 10S, I get a--
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:35.960]   - 10S, I get a iPhone XS Max.
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:40.480]   - I have my cryptographer for you if you're 10S Max.
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:42.120]   Yeah, I like it a lot.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:42.960]   I don't know.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.400]   I think the cameras are so good these days.
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:46.080]   It's hard to say one or better than the other.
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:46.920]   They're all good.
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:48.560]   I can't wait to see what the Pixel 3 does in a week.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:49.720]   - Right, exactly.
[02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:51.120]   - I use both and I'll probably keep you.
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:52.760]   - You know, my review is on LarryTheWorld.com
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.600]   if you want to look.
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:55.200]   - There you go.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.880]   - Lindsey Turatine, are you going to get the new iPhone?
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:12:59.480]   I see you still have a home button.
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:00.320]   - I still have a home button.
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:01.600]   I have an eight plus, no.
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:03.280]   The answer is no, I am not.
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:05.720]   Although we have a great article on why you should
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:07.600]   wait around for the XR.
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:11.480]   - Yeah, to me the 10R might be the real phone to get.
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:14.800]   - That's something that Scott Stein, who reviews the iPhone
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:16.760]   for us, has written a lot about.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:18.560]   - I've been saying the same thing.
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:20.480]   - It stands to be a very interesting phone,
[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:21.760]   partially because it is actually,
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:25.760]   the screen is larger than the 10S,
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:27.680]   which he pronounces like 10S.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.920]   - 10S or XS.
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:30.760]   - Yeah.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:32.240]   - So that's sort of interesting.
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:33.920]   And we've been doing,
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:36.200]   we've been, I could talk about this for a while,
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:38.560]   but the other interesting thing about the new phones
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:41.840]   and the only thing at this moment that would drive me
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:44.360]   to get the 10S is that we did the drop test on it
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:45.200]   that we do all the time.
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:46.040]   - Yes.
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:48.960]   - And we, we, it would not break.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:49.800]   - You can't break it.
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:50.640]   - No, we couldn't break it.
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:52.240]   We seriously, and we tried hard.
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:54.200]   We've broken it every time in the past.
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:55.160]   We could not break it.
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:58.600]   And I looked at that exact phone after she did that test.
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.560]   I would held it in my hand.
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:00.800]   It was barely scratched.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:01.640]   - That's pretty impressive.
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:05.100]   - And that, if I could have any phone without a case,
[02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:07.320]   it would cause me to buy that phone.
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:09.240]   - I tried doing the drop test on iPhones,
[02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:10.880]   but then they kicked me out of the Apple store.
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:13.040]   (laughing)
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:15.680]   - You'll find Lindsay and her fine work at cnet.com.
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:16.720]   She's editor in chief.
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:18.160]   She's a big shot there.
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:19.000]   Thank you, Lindsay.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:19.840]   It's great to have you.
[02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.680]   - It's great to be here.
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:21.520]   - Always fun.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:22.360]   And Father Robert Ballis here,
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:24.840]   who was in town for a couple of conferences.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:27.720]   We didn't even get to talk about the Oculus conference.
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.960]   There was lots to talk about this week,
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.440]   but we did it on the new screensavers.
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:31.280]   You can watch that.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.120]   He was my co-host.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:34.320]   - Save your money for the project Santa Cruz,
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.760]   which is called the Oculus Quest.
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:38.040]   That actually was gonna be huge.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:39.120]   But that's not till next year.
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.840]   - That's probably April would be, I guess.
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.320]   - Okay.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:43.640]   We thank you all for being here.
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:46.720]   We do this week in tech every Sunday evening,
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:49.040]   around 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern,
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.200]   2200 UTC.
[02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:51.040]   If you wanna watch live,
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:52.280]   you can't at twit.tv live.
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.240]   If you're gonna be in Northern California,
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.600]   come by and say hi.
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:56.840]   We had a great studio audience.
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:58.080]   Thank you.
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:14:59.760]   At least one long suffering spouse,
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:02.800]   but that almost always is the case.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:05.480]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.640]   There's no charge, we'll put a chair out for you.
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:09.720]   If you can't watch or visit us live,
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:11.640]   you can always get on demand versions
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:12.560]   of all the shows we do.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:16.440]   Our website is twit.tv.
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.520]   And the other way to do it is subscribe.
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:20.800]   And I don't care if you use Apple's podcast,
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:23.200]   or Stitcher, or Slacker, overcast, or undercast,
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:25.560]   or Pocket Gats, or in my pants cast,
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.880]   just get it, subscribe it.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:29.240]   And that way you'll get it every week,
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:30.200]   the minute it's available,
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:31.480]   and you'll never miss an episode.
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:33.400]   You'll have it in time for your Monday morning commute.
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:34.960]   Thanks for listening, thanks for watching,
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.080]   and we'll see you next time.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:38.160]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:39.000]   Bye-bye.
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000]   - This is amazing.
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.580]   (upbeat music)
